<p><span id="s39">A: From Auschwitz we went to Gross-Rosen, to Ravenbreek, and to the end in Neustadt -- Neustadt-Mechlenborg, we lived a couple months til the war finished, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: And when the war was ending, right at that period --</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: When the war was ending, when we were liberated, we tried to head back to Poland.</span> <span id="s42">There was a lot, how you call it?</span> <span id="s43">Mins, explosive, underground.</span> <span id="s44">One of my friend died from that.</span> <span id="s45">She pulled a pia to make a piece of bread, and she right away with a shrapnel.</span> <span id="s46">So, we decided to leave Germany, we went back to Poland.</span> <span id="s47">That was a mistake, because in Poland were very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Let me ask you first --</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: -- at the end of the war, which camp were you in?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: Which camp I was?</span> <span id="s52">Beside the ghetto, in the camp, I was in Birkenau, in Auschwitz since 1942, til 1945.</span> <span id="s53">But in the Dead March, when the Russian was behind, we have to run together with the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: And when the Russians were coming, which camp were you in at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: No, that was the Russians and the American came in the same day.</span> <span id="s56">That’s in Neustadt-Mechlenborg, the same day.</span> <span id="s57">They both came in the same day, yes.</span> <span id="s58">And then we tried to head back to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: What -- What had the conditions been like in that camp?</span> <span id="s60">What was going on in the weeks that was leading up to liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: You mean in Birkenau?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Mm.</span> <span id="s64">When we came, we have to start to build the camp, because was just the electric wiring all around half.</span> <span id="s65">We haven’t got no water, no nothing.</span> <span id="s66">It was like a lot of malaria, a lot of camp -- a lot of sickness, because was -- they make the camp from a farm, so we hardly could work, it was still [indecipherable], the ground.</span> <span id="s67">And I was there til 1945, in the same camp, very close to the crematorium, just a couple steps away.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Did you -- did you have much of a sense of how the war was going, that things had turned against the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: No, we didn’t know nothing about it.</span> <span id="s70">If they find a pencil, or a piece of paper on somebody, right away they hang the person.</span> <span id="s71">So, we didn’t know nothing wi -- but we saw the planes running above, but we didn’t know nothing of what’s going on.</span> <span id="s72">That -- that’s the way it was, until we came to Germany, we realized that the war was coming to an end.</span> <span id="s73">It’s going to take -- but every day, people were dying anyway, from hunger.</span> <span id="s74">Every minute, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: What was it that -- that made you realize the war was ending soon?</span> <span id="s76">What did you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: What did we see?</span> <span id="s78">Because the German starts to go away from Poland, from the camps, and come closer to Germany, over there, in the other camp.</span> <span id="s79">There was no place anyway, to run anyway, because all the camp was fu -- filled.</span> <span id="s80">So we was tha -- we didn’t even know when the war finished, because I tell you how we find out.</span> <span id="s81">Near us was [indecipherable] from pilots, where the Germans shot down.</span> <span id="s82">French pilot, English pilot.</span> <span id="s83">We didn’t speak English, but they cut the wires, and they told us we are free, because the German ran away from the camp, they locked up, and we didn’t know the war was over, either, but we understood what’s happened.</span> <span id="s84">They went out, and we went out, and we started to run to the houses to get some food.</span> <span id="s85">But all the houses was empty, not with food, with people, because they were sure when we came out in the camp, they going to kill them.</span> <span id="s86">So they just -- they left all the -- in the whole city was empty houses, th-the Germans run away.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: What -- when -- when they cut the wires --</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: -- and they said, you know, you’re free --</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s91">Over there was not electric wires.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Not in this -- in Auschwitz was electric wires, not over there.</span> <span id="s94">They told us that we start to run for food, that’s the first thing, whatever we saw, sugar on a wagon, any -- anything what we could eat, we started to eat, because for six years we were starving to death, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: But at the -- at the moment that that happened, and you realized --</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s97">We --</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: -- the war’s over, we’re free, do you remember -- did -- anything people said to each other, or how did -- do you remember your own emotions at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Yes, we -- we was -- we was happy the war -- the war was an end, but we wasn’t happy, we lost everybody.</span> <span id="s100">But we didn’t know what to do, actually.</span> <span id="s101">It -- it wasn’t organized, nothing was organized, we just was running from one city to the other, and we wouldn’t know what we going to do, where we going to end up.</span> <span id="s102">It wasn’t yet order -- we made a mistake, we went back to Poland, that was all.</span> <span id="s103">We couldn’t go back to Germany later.</span> <span id="s104">So a lot of people who stayed in Germany, they organized them, and they got help.</span> <span id="s105">We didn’t have any help in Poland.</span> <span id="s106">I came back to my city, and I went up to the government to ask for help, we were 10 girls.</span> <span id="s107">So he gave us the key from the school, where we was finishing school, that building belonged to a Jewish family, but they -- they got killed.</span> <span id="s108">So I told them, “How about food?”</span> <span id="s109">He said, “Nothing else.</span> <span id="s110">Just stay.”</span> <span id="s111">So we were sleeping on the floor, and we were starving, actually.</span> <span id="s112">We didn’t have what to eat.</span> <span id="s113">It was horrible.</span> <span id="s114">So, after a couple weeks, some people from my town came back to the city, and he told us that we shouldn’t stay there, because they already killed four girls that went in -- in a hiding place there.</span> <span id="s115">The Armia kryova went in, they killed them, and one was hiding under the bedsheet in Israel, they tried to kill them.</span> <span id="s116">So the -- the life was very danger in Poland.</span> <span id="s117">So he says, “Don’t stay in that city, you’re going to be caught -- killed.</span> <span id="s118">You better come to Lódz, to a big city there are kibbutzim there, they’ll take you in.”</span> <span id="s119">So we were happy to have [indecipherable] had, and a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s120">You could only stay six months.</span> <span id="s121">We have to smuggle ourselves to Israel.</span> <span id="s122">So I -- I knew I had a brother in Russia, I was already in contact with him, so I didn’t want to go, I want to wait.</span> <span id="s123">So they send me to another kibbutz, in Bialystok, to stay another six month.</span> <span id="s124">We stood there a couple months, in this -- and these, the Polish people was very angry, they didn’t want the Jews back.</span> <span id="s125">So one night they came in, the police, and they give us ammunition, they going to attack us, going to be a pogrom, you have to defend yourself, we can do nothing about it.</span> <span id="s126">So five people went to [indecipherable] on the train.</span> <span id="s127">We tried to pull out from Bialystok.</span> <span id="s128">Four of them got killed, they took them down from the train, 18 - 19 year old.</span> <span id="s129">What -- Hitler let them live, but the Polish wouldn’t let them live.</span> <span id="s130">One was hiding under a pleated skirt by a lady in the train, so he survived.</span> <span id="s131">So he crawled back, and he told us to pick up the bodies.</span> <span id="s132">So, when I saw that, in time my brother came in, so I pick up my brother, and I says, “I’m not staying here.</span> <span id="s133">I’m going to [indecipherable] right here the Bricha taking out the people,” because they says it’s a graveyard in Poland.</span> <span id="s134">.</span> <span id="s135">When we went out on the street, and we saw dead people, dead Jews, they wasn’t missed by nobody, their families was killed a couple years ago in the camps, and they came back from Russia.</span> <span id="s136">So they got killed in Poland.</span> <span id="s137">So I took my brother, and I went on the train.</span> <span id="s138">We sitting on the train, and a Polish woman says to me, “You know, they took down yesterday, Jews, and they killed them.”</span> <span id="s139">Like she gave me the idea that I’m going to be killed too, in a couple hours.</span> <span id="s140">So I almost fainted.</span> <span id="s141">Finally, we reach Vulsa -- we came into Vulsa, I fainted.</span> <span id="s142">I couldn’t take it any longer.</span> <span id="s143">So I find out that the Bricha organized people -- actually, they organized people who came back from Russia.</span> <span id="s144">Russia let in a half a million Jews.</span> <span id="s145">So the older people -- so I got together with them, and we start to go -- the Jewish agency made up with American government that Czechoslovaki should let us in, out from Poland.</span> <span id="s146">It was like a couple thousand people.</span> <span id="s147">I was the only one with a number, actually.</span> <span id="s148">So, we went to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s149">In Czechoslovakia we stood overnight, and we have to go to Austria, and they prepare camps for us.</span> <span id="s150">We came to Austria, a few thousand people.</span> <span id="s151">The people who should provide us with bread, sold the flour, and we didn’t have nothing to eat, we have to run in the field to dig out a potato -- a pickle, to eat.</span> <span id="s152">That was after the war, in 1946.</span> <span id="s153">In time, I met my husband, because he had a couple brothers in Russia, in the army.</span> <span id="s154">So he told the Russian people coming back from Russia, maybe one of his brothers will survive.</span> <span id="s155">None of them survived, they all got killed.</span> <span id="s156">So I met my husband, so he says to me, “How comes a number?</span> <span id="s157">It’s mostly people with the Russian.”</span> <span id="s158">So I told him I was waiting for my brother, he’ll -- til he came back from Russia, and together I decided to leave Poland.</span> <span id="s159">We have our chance, the Bricha -- thanks to the Bricha.</span> <span id="s160">So my husband told me that he got papers to go to the United States in a month, a cousin sent him papers.</span> <span id="s161">But if I marry, two people can go on the same certificate.</span> <span id="s162">I didn’t even know my husband, to be honest with you.</span> <span id="s163">I decided, what do I got to leave?</span> <span id="s164">Israel is closed the doors, you couldn’t go to Israel anyway, we have to smuggle ourselves.</span> <span id="s165">The people who went there, went to Cyprus, you know.</span> <span id="s166">I didn’t have where to go, I was hungry.</span> <span id="s167">My husband, when he was liberated, he didn’t live this town.</span> <span id="s168">So the UNRRA gave him -- put him in a hotel, and they gave him three meals a day.</span> <span id="s169">So when I came in, I see this [indecipherable] table, with white tablecloth, and eating.</span> <span id="s170">I couldn’t believe it, that’s a dream.</span> <span id="s171">So I decided I got married, only the condition my brother should stay with us.</span> <span id="s172">So that’s what’s happened.</span> <span id="s173">From that month, turn into two years.</span> <span id="s174">They didn’t let into the United State, they’re going to elect a president, it took two year.</span> <span id="s175">So, a very hard time in Austria.</span> <span id="s176">We couldn’t work, we have to live on a ration, [indecipherable] gave us.</span> <span id="s177">A herring, a piece of bread, and that’s how we lived for two year.</span> <span id="s178">Finally, we find out, in order to go to America, we have to go to Vienna.</span> <span id="s179">Vienna was occupied by the Russian.</span> <span id="s180">So we got ourselves on that train, and we start to go.</span> <span id="s181">The Russian soldier came out, and he says, “No, you can’t go there.”</span> <span id="s182">So he took us down from the train.</span> <span id="s183">So we was waiting for another train, and we came to Vienna, on the boat, on Vienna.</span> <span id="s184">Now, we have to go out from Vienna to Germany, with our paper.</span> <span id="s185">Rush -- Vienna was occupied by the Russian, so we couldn’t go.</span> <span id="s186">So we were standing, they tore us down from the other train, and they told us, “You got to live here, you got to vote here, and die here.</span> <span id="s187">You can never go out from here.”</span> <span id="s188">We were like 10 people.</span> <span id="s189">So, we standing at night, and thinking what we going to do, til a -- a German guy, a young guy came over to us, and he says to us, like that, “You know, my father takes people over the border.</span> <span id="s190">If you want to go, you give me a few dollars, til -- I’ll take you, show how to go over the mountain.”</span> <span id="s191">If I see the mountain during the day, I wouldn’t climb up.</span> <span id="s192">So we took -- I said, “What’s going to be if he catch you?”</span> <span id="s193">The Russian is out -- downstairs, you could see they working with the car.</span> <span id="s194">He says, “Well, I tell him my cow got lost, and I went to look for the cow.”</span> <span id="s195">He got us over the mountain, we stay overnight, but how we got down from the mountain, the very high mountain, I figured maybe I lay down [indecipherable] they had a hard time to get down.</span> <span id="s196">We came down, finally, from the mountain, we didn’t carry anything.</span> <span id="s197">We came down from the mountain, we already on the other side, in Germany.</span> <span id="s198">In Germany, you can’t go in a hotel at night, everything is closed.</span> <span id="s199">And it’s raining, we don’t have a place where to go.</span> <span id="s200">While we was walking, I walk over -- a man was walking with a lady, and I says to him, “What -- we just came from the other side, and it’s raining.</span> <span id="s201">Where can we go?”</span> <span id="s202">So he says to us, “Come on, I’ll take you to a hotel, maybe they’ll let you in.”</span> <span id="s203">So we thank him, we came in the hotel, and the guy said, “I’m sorry, no room.”</span> <span id="s204">I says to him, “Listen, I don’t care what you see, I’m going to sit here in the lobby, I’m not going out in the rain.</span> <span id="s205">No way I’m going out.</span> <span id="s206">We don’t -- we just came in, and we have no place else to go.”</span> <span id="s207">So he gave us a room, and we stood there.</span> <span id="s208">Once we got there, we went to Bremen, in Germany, and we have to wait like five weeks til we can go to America.</span> <span id="s209">The problem is, people who came to the Joint, got it good.</span> <span id="s210">They greet them by the plane.</span> <span id="s211">They gave them -- they pay six months rent, they gave them a job.</span> <span id="s212">We didn’t came through the Joint.</span> <span id="s213">My husband’s cousin was a religious man, he wants to show in the shul he do something, so he borrowed the paper for somebody else, so they was not responsible for us.</span> <span id="s214">So, we came he -- we came to Boston.</span> <span id="s215">From Boston we have to take a train to Chicago.</span> <span id="s216">Nobody waits for us, we didn’t know any langu -- English, nothing.</span> <span id="s217">So we sitting in the Union Station, and in the morning -- a whole night -- in the morning, I hear Polish women, speaks Polish to each other.</span> <span id="s218">They come to clean -- and I finished school in Poland.</span> <span id="s219">So I walked up and tell them the story there.</span> <span id="s220">Nobody waits for us, where should we go, what should we do?</span> <span id="s221">So they pick up a telephone book, I gave them the address and the telephone, and they called the people, and they picked us up.</span> <span id="s222">They picked us up, then we came to Chicago.</span> <span id="s223">I came to the HIAS, and told them the story, they said, “We’re not responsible for you, you can’t -- we don’t want to do nothing, not even a job.”</span> <span id="s224">Luckily, I find here a friend, he took me into the factory to work.</span> <span id="s225">I was two days in this country, I went to work.</span> <span id="s226">And I didn’t even have money for the car fare, a dime, so he paid the car fare.</span> <span id="s227">And I went there, I got a job.</span> <span id="s228">My husband didn’t get a job right away.</span> <span id="s229">We went through a very hard time in Chicago, we couldn’t get a -- a place there to live.</span> <span id="s230">We stayed with them three, four weeks, so finally they rented a room for us.</span> <span id="s231">The lady put in, in a closet, she put in a bed, in a walk-in closet.</span> <span id="s232">There was no heat, where to put a chair.</span> <span id="s233">That’s wasn’t a -- that wasn’t the worst thing.</span> <span id="s234">She got three teenage girls, we couldn’t use a washroom in the morning, and I have to run downtown to punch a card.</span> <span id="s235">So I washed my face in the kitchen, and I ran for work.</span> <span id="s236">I worked a couple of years downtown, til -- til finally we got another apartment, you know, just rented.</span> <span id="s237">If you was lucky, just rented an apartment, by somebody, not on our own.</span> <span id="s238">So finally, my husband couldn’t get a job, so somebody recommended the [indecipherable] work he does, a lot of Jewish and Polish people open up a cleaning store.</span> <span id="s239">For that you don’t need money.</span> <span id="s240">You take an empty store, you buy an old sewing machine.</span> <span id="s241">I still didn’t give up my job.</span> <span id="s242">So I worked there, we open up the cleaning store, my husband was in the cleaning store, and that’s the work, I came to work in the store, and I worked til 12 at night to keep up the thing.</span> <span id="s243">Next couple years, and I already have a little money in the bank saved up, and I have the children.</span> <span id="s244">You know, it was very hard, the beginning, we don’t have help from nobody.</span> <span id="s245">Mostly refugees come, they have a lot of help.</span> <span id="s246">The Joint pay the rent, they -- they get them a job, they watch over them.</span> <span id="s247">I didn’t have that luck, so the same thing after the war, people stay in Germany, the -- right away there was organized camp, they got what to eat.</span> <span id="s248">We was on the bad side, we was in Poland, we couldn’t go back, the Russian didn’t let us go to the border.</span> <span id="s249">So, we live hard times.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Let me ask you a couple things.</span> <span id="s251">I just need to --</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Move this slightly.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Let me ask you this -- let’s -- let’s leave your story right there --</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: -- where you’re -- you’re now in this country, but I’d like to go back actually --</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: -- to where you started, and pick up on a -- a couple things --</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: -- that you said.</span> <span id="s262">I’m -- I’m still a little curious about that first day, when you realized you were free.</span> <span id="s263">I mean, how long do you -- was it after you heard you were free that everybody started to run into the town and look for food?</span> <span id="s264">Was it just a couple minutes, was it a couple hours?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: The first minute, we thum to run for food, nothing else existed, just food.</span> <span id="s266">I ran up and I -- I went up on a wagon, started to eat a lot of sugar.</span> <span id="s267">Anything what we saw, we started to eat, we were so hungry.</span> <span id="s268">Most people got sick from it, because the stomach was so shrink, we couldn’t even eat, but -- but people were so hungry, they though they’ll eat the whole world, would be enough food.</span> <span id="s269">That’s how they started to eat.</span> <span id="s270">And the German got plenty of food in the house, mind you.</span> <span id="s271">For 10 years, they storing food for 10 years.</span> <span id="s272">So each time we went in a different house, and -- and we ate there, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: And you said that the houses were empty?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s275">They all left, they run away.</span> <span id="s276">Near our camp, you couldn’t find a house that Germans should be occupied there.</span> <span id="s277">They were sure that we going to kill them when we go out.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: What if when you had gone to --</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: -- any of these houses, what if you had found some of the Germans in there?</span> <span id="s281">Did you want to kill them?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: No, there wasn’t, they wasn’t there.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: But I’m saying, what if they were?</span> <span id="s284">Did you -- did you want to kill them?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: Well, I would like to, but I -- I couldn’t do it, no.</span> <span id="s286">I tell you what’s happened.</span> <span id="s287">There was, near [indecipherable] time, was a lot of soldiers, and there was -- and when -- and a lot of raping going on, too.</span> <span id="s288">So when we went into the house, came in a Russian officer, I’ll never forget, a very intelligent man.</span> <span id="s289">And he says, “They let out from the jails, the worst thing, and they rape the woman.</span> <span id="s290">I’m going to sit the whole night and watch you.</span> <span id="s291">[indecipherable] I can do nothing about it,” he told us.</span> <span id="s292">So that’s what -- he was sitting a whole night, and they start to knock in the door, and then, when they saw him, they run away.</span> <span id="s293">Then we went a little further, and the same thing happened.</span> <span id="s294">So we made up -- the girls, we were 10 girls, we made up, if they knock on the door, we run out in the back door, and there was a lot of broken trains, so every girl was laying under a train the whole night, cause train didn’t move, they was broken.</span> <span id="s295">And we was laying a whole night, and there was [indecipherable] got in the house.</span> <span id="s296">A whole night that we were laying there til it’s got light, then we -- we came out from the -- under the trains, and we start to look to go any further.</span> <span id="s297">There was a big struggle after the war, a big struggle.</span> <span id="s298">Was no government, was no nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: Did you -- right after the liberation, where were you for the next few days or weeks after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: All by ourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: Did you go back into the camp, or once you left the camp did you never go back in there?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: No, we didn’t go back, we didn’t -- we didn’t go back.</span> <span id="s303">You know, in a room like that, half the size, was maybe a hundred girls.</span> <span id="s304">We was laying down, there was no room to turn over, that’s how it was.</span> <span id="s305">We didn’t go back.</span> <span id="s306">We went in the houses, we took some clothes.</span> <span id="s307">So then, we went on a train, the train was standing [indecipherable] going.</span> <span id="s308">We took some clothes for ourself, we went on the train.</span> <span id="s309">The train was standing all night.</span> <span id="s310">So a Russian fella came in, and he says, “Oh, girls are here, okay, we going to bring my friend.”</span> <span id="s311">So we ran out from the train, and we wait there, the train left with all our stuff, we have to go look for other stuff.</span> <span id="s312">We didn’t want to go back to that train.</span> <span id="s313">Was a big struggle after the war, with no government, no [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: So from the -- from the moment of liberation --</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: -- you were -- you were totally on your own?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: On our own.</span> <span id="s318">Nobody could help us.</span> <span id="s319">As a matter of fact, we saw our -- our German guard with a wagon, with horses.</span> <span id="s320">So we walked over, he should give us the wagon.</span> <span id="s321">He says no.</span> <span id="s322">So we went to a Russian fellow, and officer, we told him we want the wagon to go away from the camp.</span> <span id="s323">So he took the German by the head, and threw him in the -- in the ground, he says, “You take whatever you want, you’re entitled, and go ahead.”</span> <span id="s324">One of my girls knew how to operate a wagon with [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s325">See, we tried to go any forwarder and forwarder, til we got to Poland, and then we have to leave everything behind, because they -- they -- they checked us up.</span> <span id="s326">We didn’t have any money anyway, but was free -- traveling was free, people didn’t have anything.</span> <span id="s327">I mean, Poland was our graveyard, it was impossible to be there, they killed 50 people in Kelts.</span> <span id="s328">That’s the people who lived through the war, they came from Russia with children, they killed them all.</span> <span id="s329">Whatever they find a Jew, they killed him.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: Did you know that this was happening in Poland before you went back there, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: We didn’t know -- we didn’t -- that we should go.</span> <span id="s332">We just didn’t want to be in Germany, so we tried to go back in Poland.</span> <span id="s333">It was a mistake.</span> <span id="s334">We didn’t know they going to organize.</span> <span id="s335">We didn’t know what to do actually, where to go.</span> <span id="s336">Finally I went to -- back to Poland, and some people took back property, you know -- that we went back.</span> <span id="s337">There was no way to go back without an organization to take care of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: You mentioned -- you mentioned earlier, and I think you mentioned in one of your video interviews, that Jews were being killed by the -- how do you say it, the armia --</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: Armia kryova, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: And what -- what kind of group was that?</span> <span id="s341">Who were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: That was -- that were like a underground Polish army.</span> <span id="s343">They was for one thing, just to kill the Jews, that was their idea.</span> <span id="s344">They killed four girls right near our town, in a little town.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s346">Had they been fighting the Germans, as -- were they like the underground, or what -- what were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: No, I don’t know if they was fighting, but that was the -- after the war, that was after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Maybe they was, but I don’t think so -- that they did.</span> <span id="s350">Only the Poles would fight after the -- the German -- [indecipherable] the Russian, they organized themself, but not the other, not the others.</span> <span id="s351">But Jewish people was fighting in the ghettos all over, a lot of people don’t even know about that.</span> <span id="s352">In Bialystok, 70 people -- I went -- went there -- came there to find a grave, 70 people were fighting, girls and boys was fighting against the German.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: And I think while you were in one of the camps, there was an uprising in one of the camps, wasn’t there?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: That was in Birkenau, yes.</span> <span id="s355">One of my girlfriends, she -- they hanged the four girl.</span> <span id="s356">See, the woman [indecipherable] ammunition, and when the men came into work in the camp, they gave him the ammunition, you know, little.</span> <span id="s357">Well, when the uprising was there, I thought when they -- they killed a couple Germans, they put them in the oven, they did whatever they could.</span> <span id="s358">But, in a few minutes later, you couldn’t see the sky, that’s how many airplanes [indecipherable] German.</span> <span id="s359">And the German wants to find out how did the people organize themselve, and to kill so many Germans, and all this thing.</span> <span id="s360">Well, they ran across one girl, but she broke down -- not mine girlfriend, from my town, she broke down and told them on three others.</span> <span id="s361">They arrested the girls, they kept them in a bunker.</span> <span id="s362">One of my friend, she was typing whatever they say.</span> <span id="s363">They took her -- I don’t know how you call it, the strip?</span> <span id="s364">What inside with steel, you know, strip, like it’s -- how you call it?</span> <span id="s365">A strip.</span> <span id="s366">When you going to beat up something, you have a --</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: When you’re going to --</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: The thing, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: Oh, you mean, like a whip?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: A whip, yes, and they put in steel, and they beat them on the body, on the naked body, and a doctor was there to revive them, so they can get out of them.</span> <span id="s371">Mine girlfriend never told anyone, and the four girls was hanged, right in the -- we have to stay and watch.</span> <span id="s372">This was only four weeks before they evacuated from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s373">Like in January, that’s [indecipherable] they killed four girls, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Do you have any idea, during that uprising, how many Germans were killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: No, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s376">They couldn’t kill that many, because some of them started to run, you know, away, and they shot them down anyway.</span> <span id="s377">They kill mostly the Germans, but the -- but the Sondercommando were working, you know.</span> <span id="s378">They -- they -- they killed them, they put them in the oven, they did a lot of things, you know.</span> <span id="s379">But they didn’t survive, these people, either.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Did you see any of that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: No, I couldn’t see, there was -- no, that you couldn’t see.</span> <span id="s382">But I saw the sky was right away with airplanes, and -- and they start to shoot down whoever starts to run.</span> <span id="s383">So I don’t think everybody make it, you know, out.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Let’s go back to after the war, when the -- this Polish group --</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: -- was killing Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: The -- the English translation is -- I think it’s called the Polish Home Army, in English.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Were you sure that it was members of that group that were doing these killings?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s392">That was their name, that was their main thing, to kill all the Jews.</span> <span id="s393">Jews lived there 400 years, they have some property, and for them, the war was a plus, because they got in in a minute -- lot of people was poor Polish, too.</span> <span id="s394">And they got in, they got everything.</span> <span id="s395">They didn’t want a Jew -- if a Jew got in in a house, he didn’t get out alive any more.</span> <span id="s396">So we don’t even know how many was killed.</span> <span id="s397">They didn’t want the Jews there any more, so they could have everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: When you were, you know, leaving Germany, and you decided at first to go to Poland --</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: Yeah, we did --</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: -- and you said well that --</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: -- we didn’t realize the reaction, we didn’t realize the --</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: -- we ca --</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Well that’s -- that’s what I wan -- I wanted to ask you about.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: Because, you had lived in Poland, I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: Did -- wi --</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: -- did you -- from your past life, you hadn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: -- you didn’t feel that the Poles were hostile to Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Or that they were?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: -- they were very hostile, but we thought after the war, maybe it’s changing.</span> <span id="s416">We couldn’t believe they’re going to -- ready to kill the Jews.</span> <span id="s417">We didn’t -- we didn’t think of it.</span> <span id="s418">In po -- was very bad in Poland lately, after the war, you know what’s happened in Poland.</span> <span id="s419">First of all, when we went [indecipherable] they told us the Polish, in the same age where we were, “Go to Palestine, you don’t belong in here.</span> <span id="s420">That’s not your place.”</span> <span id="s421">That was one thing.</span> <span id="s422">We got up in the morning, we saw all kind of signs on th -- on the -- on the building, the J -- the Jews are Communists, the Jews are that and that.</span> <span id="s423">Then, after that, they put down the -- they organized them in the churches.</span> <span id="s424">Every Pole who came in for the village, have to wear a green band, and stay by the Jewish store, so when the other people come in, they wouldn’t let them in.</span> <span id="s425">You know, that’s a Jewish store, you’re not supposed to go to the Jewish store.</span> <span id="s426">That was a open boycott in Poland.</span> <span id="s427">Even in the [indecipherable] asking what you going to do with the Jews, with three and a half million Jews, which to build up Poland, 400 years, they say, beating up make no sense, but boycott them with the business, that’s yes.</span> <span id="s428">That was written all over, in the papers.</span> <span id="s429">So the government was hostile, and the people was 10 times more hostile.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: So when you went back to Poland and found all this going on --</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: We knew about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Did it make you angry?</span> <span id="s433">How did you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: We was angry, see, we had -- we have a house, I want to take back the house from the government.</span> <span id="s435">Mine girlfriends the same thing, they have houses.</span> <span id="s436">Then they figure, maybe we’ll find somebody from family.</span> <span id="s437">Maybe they was in different camp, and they survive.</span> <span id="s438">That was the reason we went back.</span> <span id="s439">I wouldn’t want to stay in Poland, but bec -- be -- there was no way out.</span> <span id="s440">If not the Bricha, everybody will be killed there, they wouldn’t leave anybody else.</span> <span id="s441">They took care on them.</span> <span id="s442">They knew -- they knew, because the Bricha, some of them was born in Poland, and they knew.</span> <span id="s443">That’s the only way to get out the Jewish people from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Lonia Mosak.</span> <span id="s446">This is tape number one, side B.</span> <span id="s447">You went back to Poland, and found all this going on --</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: We knew, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Did it make you angry?</span> <span id="s450">How did you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: We was angry, see, we had -- we have a house, I want to take back the house from the government.</span> <span id="s452">Mine girlfriends the same thing, they have houses.</span> <span id="s453">Then they figure, maybe we’ll find somebody from family.</span> <span id="s454">Maybe they was in different camp, and they survive.</span> <span id="s455">That was the reason we went back.</span> <span id="s456">I wouldn’t want to stay in Poland, but bec -- we -- there was no way out.</span> <span id="s457">If not the Bricha, everybody will be killed there, they wouldn’t leave anybody else.</span> <span id="s458">They took care on them.</span> <span id="s459">They knew -- they knew, because the Bricha, some of them was born in Poland, and they knew.</span> <span id="s460">That’s the only way to get out the Jewish people from there.</span> <span id="s461">So they took [indecipherable] a half a million, when they came back from Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: The -- you mentioned I think that nine or -- nine or 10 girls that y-you --</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: -- you were together.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: We were together all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Who were they?</span> <span id="s467">How did you -- how did you get together, and how did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: -- form your group, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: -- I tell you something.</span> <span id="s471">In Auschwitz, we’re like that, when you stay in a group, some speak French, some speak Yugoslavian, some speak Greece, so everybody stick to their own town, to their own friends, what we went to school together.</span> <span id="s472">So, I was with mine group.</span> <span id="s473">Everybody got their own clique, like they say, because we couldn’t -- we couldn’t communicate.</span> <span id="s474">The others speak Greek, they speak French, they speak Italian.</span> <span id="s475">We couldn’t -- we couldn’t understand.</span> <span id="s476">So they did the same thing, they grouped themself with their own people, with the same language.</span> <span id="s477">That’s the way it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: So was your group -- were they from your town, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: From mine town, mine -- we went to school together, town.</span> <span id="s480">The thing is, but I didn’t mention it, they always made selections in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s481">The selections were like that.</span> <span id="s482">Because they couldn’t bring a townsbut on the outside, like they got a note, 3,000 people got to be killed.</span> <span id="s483">So, they took from the place that we were standing -- people only survive in the wa -- the last in the line.</span> <span id="s484">I came back to the barrack one Hanukah, 1943, yeah, I came back, we were thousand in the -- in the barrack, only three came back.</span> <span id="s485">They count up, if they have enough, they they’ll let the last go.</span> <span id="s486">Only three came back from thousand.</span> <span id="s487">And that -- each time there are selection, somebody ask you how you survive, I always said the same thing, I was the last in the line.</span> <span id="s488">That’s the only way, not because we were smart, or we was healthy, didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s489">They have to burn so many people.</span> <span id="s490">And that was even worse, because the people when they came from a transport, they didn’t know what’s going on, it was the night.</span> <span id="s491">But when they took the people from the camp, and we know where they’re going, that wasn’t -- that was very sad.</span> <span id="s492">There -- there was crying, there was hollering, they were singing the Haptikvah.</span> <span id="s493">But they knew where they going, they saw every -- and you know how when they put the people on the truck, they didn’t took him down gentle, they open up, and just like potatoes, they roll down on the -- on the ground.</span> <span id="s494">That’s the way they treated people.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: I’ve talked to, in some of the other interviews --</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: -- I’ve done with people who were in the camps --</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: They --</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: Were in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: Various camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Yeah, it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Various ones, several.</span> <span id="s504">But th -- one thing that some of the people, not all of them, but some have said to me that by sort of the day of liberation, or the time of liberation, the end of the war --</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: -- they -- they had almost given up, or were almost ready to die, that they didn’t care any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: Yeah, it’s happens to me, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: I’m wondering how you felt?</span> <span id="s509">That happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: I really wanted to commit suicide, to be honest with you.</span> <span id="s511">We were starving in Poland, there was nobody to -- I started to sew a little bit to make a few cents.</span> <span id="s512">We -- we bought a few potatoes, that’s where -- we didn’t have an-any nothing, the Polish government wouldn’t help you.</span> <span id="s513">So, I really wanted to commit suicide, there was no way out.</span> <span id="s514">So, in time, came a guy from mine town, what he was going to the Yeshiva, by a -- by a [indecipherable] next to the Yeshiva.</span> <span id="s515">So he knews me.</span> <span id="s516">So he said, “Listen, don’t stay here, the life’s danger.</span> <span id="s517">I’ll take you to Lódz.”</span> <span id="s518">There was kibbutzim there.</span> <span id="s519">We didn’t know where to go.</span> <span id="s520">How can you go when you don’t know where to go, to whom to go?</span> <span id="s521">Was very sad.</span> <span id="s522">So, he took a few of us, we went in there, he took us in a kibbutz.</span> <span id="s523">So, to me it was a haven, you got a roof over the head, and you got a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s524">And then I have to go to Bialystok, and was very sad of a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: So, did I understand this right?</span> <span id="s526">You were saying that you wanted -- you felt like committing suicide, even wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: -- when the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: Yeah, that’s was in 1945.</span> <span id="s530">There was no way out, we couldn’t go back to Germany, we didn’t have anybody.</span> <span id="s531">Even you’re starving, you -- you kind of don’t feel like to live any more.</span> <span id="s532">Luckily, that guy came in, to one -- he was born in our town, too.</span> <span id="s533">And he looked around, and he said, “Listen, let’s go from [indecipherable] they already killed four girls in that little village.</span> <span id="s534">Let’s go out, stay in a big city, in a kibbutz, ther -- at least they’re organized.”</span> <span id="s535">So we were happy.</span> <span id="s536">He was like an angel coming from the sky.</span> <span id="s537">You know, we were happy that somebody show us the way where to go.</span> <span id="s538">The big ci -- the big -- in our city, they wasn’t organized, you couldn’t talk to nobody.</span> <span id="s539">Like I told you, the government gave me the key from this school, where I finished school, laid down on the floor, no clothes, no beds, no food, no nothing.</span> <span id="s540">It was -- it was horrible.</span> <span id="s541">It was very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: The -- just go back for a second, the gr -- the group of --</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: -- girls from your town.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Do you remember any of their names?</span> <span id="s547">Do you know if any of them are still alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Oh yeah, tell you all the names, yeah.</span> <span id="s549">One just died last year, she was in -- in New York.</span> <span id="s550">One just died.</span> <span id="s551">Some of them are in Israel.</span> <span id="s552">I hear a few already died too, over there.</span> <span id="s553">Some of them end up in a institution, they lost their mind, you know?</span> <span id="s554">A lot of them went up in an institution there.</span> <span id="s555">And one of my ne -- closest friend, [indecipherable] in the underground, she lived in Canada, and she got killed.</span> <span id="s556">A car went up -- she went out from a wedding, and going to go home, and a car went on the sidewalk, and he killed her.</span> <span id="s557">That was my closest friend, from mine town, we went to school together.</span> <span id="s558">So here, we have to make new friends.</span> <span id="s559">The others, I don’t have any.</span> <span id="s560">I only have one friend in Detroit which -- she came here in 1939 -- 1937, with a grap -- a group of youngsters.</span> <span id="s561">That’s the only friend from mine childhood I have.</span> <span id="s562">All the other -- yes, I meet them in Florida.</span> <span id="s563">They went in Russia, where they survive, in Russia.</span> <span id="s564">Some -- a few was in the camps, so we get together all the time, and we go out for dinner, and we keep together, the group.</span> <span id="s565">Some lives in Detroit, some lives in Philadelphia, some lives in New Jersey.</span> <span id="s566">A few of them, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: So that -- that -- that group of you all --</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: -- can you say for the record what some of their names were?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: Yes, I’ll tell you the name.</span> <span id="s571">Which I meet in Florida, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: These people?</span> <span id="s574">Becau --</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: Yeah, but also the -- the original group that you --</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: -- the others went -- the original went to Israel, and some of them died over there [indecipherable] institution.</span> <span id="s577">One died in New York.</span> <span id="s578">I really don’t have any -- the original, they’re not here any more.</span> <span id="s579">The one there, what I meet in Florida, they went to Russia, that’s how they got saved, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: So we meet then.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: But again, I was just wondering, just for the record --</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: -- if you could just say their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: Yeah, I can tell you.</span> <span id="s588">One -- only one is there, Dinka Blanke -- well now, she got married, she got a different name.</span> <span id="s589">One is named Dinka, and one is named Kirsch.</span> <span id="s590">Those two was in Auschwitz, but they got married, you know, so they change their name.</span> <span id="s591">All the others didn’t survive, no.</span> <span id="s592">I hear they wa -- they die in Israel, one was [indecipherable] institution, yes.</span> <span id="s593">No, I had -- my friends now, it’s not the original friend.</span> <span id="s594">None of them.</span> <span id="s595">I’ll show you the picture here when I finish school, and I graduate.</span> <span id="s596">Only one was what -- she was in the underground, in -- in -- in Auschwitz, she’s on that picture, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s598">Let’s -- let’s pick up the story where you went to the kibbutz.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: And then how long were you there?</span> <span id="s601">What happened after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: I wa -- we could only stay the six months in one kibbutz, we have to smuggle ourself to Israel.</span> <span id="s603">Because I was waiting for my brother, so they sent me to Bialystok.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: How did you know that your brother was still alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: Oh, some people smuggled themself out from Russia, on the boat there.</span> <span id="s606">My brother was waiting til they give him a legal -- legal to go out.</span> <span id="s607">So, when I talk to them, so I told them, oh, I was with him in Siberia together, so I already got a name.</span> <span id="s608">And I start to write letters there, and it took a couple months til he came back, in a legal way.</span> <span id="s609">So that’s when we was together nows, we have live together.</span> <span id="s610">He couldn’t come to the United State, I was on the papers for my husband.</span> <span id="s611">He was -- not 1945.</span> <span id="s612">They got two categories, 1945 - 1946.</span> <span id="s613">1946 couldn’t go to America.</span> <span id="s614">They came from Russia, no, not these people, only the 1945.</span> <span id="s615">So he was there in -- living in Vienna, and I got some papers for him in here -- to bring him over here, but he got -- unfortunately he got killed a couple of years later in a car accident.</span> <span id="s616">He got run over, yeah.</span> <span id="s617">That’s was -- I -- I’m the only one from my family, from my father’s side.</span> <span id="s618">From my mother’s side, nobody ever survived, none of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: Did you -- and, right after the war --</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: -- did you know that, that no one was left but your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: I-I-I knew, I knew, but anybody who survived, there was offices where you put on your name, if somebody else come.</span> <span id="s623">Now, I knew that nobody survive, and I didn’t see any name.</span> <span id="s624">Sometime when my brother was still in Russia, and I announced on the radio, and I wrote postcard -- Kirshenbaum is my maiden name, so a lot of people came from other town, but it wasn’t my brother, they just got the same name, but wasn’t that.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: And then, after the kibbutz, where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: No, like I told you, the Bricha took us out from Poland, we went to Austria -- to Czechoslovakia first, then to Austria.</span> <span id="s627">In Austria, I remained there, because I got married.</span> <span id="s628">So, I took my brother and t-took us two years to come to the United State.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: How did you meet your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: He came to look for his brothers.</span> <span id="s631">He got four brothers in the Russian army, so he thought maybe somebody, because those really -- a transport with the people came, but none of them survived.</span> <span id="s632">And he was surprised to see [indecipherable] because I was the only one, but mostly people from Russia, when they came back.</span> <span id="s633">So that’s how I met him.</span> <span id="s634">So, took me out, and show me the hotel, and got papers, and that was like a miracle.</span> <span id="s635">So I decided to get married.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: Did you -- this is a little bit of a funny question --</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: -- but, I mean, did you get married because he had papers, and he could get you to America, or did you get married because you were in love?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: N-No, n-no, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s640">I tell you something.</span> <span id="s641">He was very nice, was a nice person, he was the -- he was not far from out of town, you know, junhanfrum.</span> <span id="s642">He’s from Ben-Gurions -- he treat me nice, he was a very nice man.</span> <span id="s643">So I figure, what do I got to lose?</span> <span id="s644">I have -- everybody got married like that after the war.</span> <span id="s645">You met somebody, you get married, that’s the only way to do, not to be alone.</span> <span id="s646">That’s was the only way.</span> <span id="s647">No, if I wouldn’t like him a little bit, no I wouldn’t marry, no.</span> <span id="s648">That’s for sure not.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: Were you madly in love with him, or kind of in love with him, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: We tried to be in love, you know, but we really didn’t know each other, to be honest true.</span> <span id="s651">We have to do it in a couple days, because that transport was in Austria, have to go foraday.</span> <span id="s652">I kind of sneak out from the barracks, and came to the little city.</span> <span id="s653">And you couldn’t stay in the little city until you got papers.</span> <span id="s654">We have to pay up in the government to paper, that I should stay here.</span> <span id="s655">I couldn’t go back there, those people go forward already.</span> <span id="s656">So I kind of sneak out from that camp, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: So you said you -- you tried to be in love.</span> <span id="s658">Do you think that he felt the same way?</span> <span id="s659">That --</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: Yeah, yeah, yes.</span> <span id="s661">We -- we got along nice.</span> <span id="s662">He got a brother, too, we all lived together, mine brother, his brother, we all lived together, and I kind of took care on everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Sounds like you were almost like creating -- like kind of creating instant families?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: Yeah, we did, we did, yeah.</span> <span id="s665">We did.</span> <span id="s666">He got a brother came over from Germany to Austria.</span> <span id="s667">I got the brother from Russia.</span> <span id="s668">And I said, whatever I do, I don’t go away from my brother, and got to be with us together.</span> <span id="s669">So we all lived together, yeah, that’s true.</span> <span id="s670">His brother couldn’t come because to America, he come later.</span> <span id="s671">My brother come later, maybe two years later.</span> <span id="s672">But when he came already, I had an apartment, because I make money, I prepare everything [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s673">Now, when my brother came, I already had a child, yeah.</span> <span id="s674">Was two years later, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s676">So then -- then you went over the mountains, right?</span> <span id="s677">That was -- that’s when we came out to Austria, to go out to the German border, in -- and Russia occupied Vienna, you couldn’t go out from Vienna, you have to sneak out, was very hard.</span> <span id="s678">Was a very hard thing go -- it’s really hard to believe it, how people manage like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: Yes, yeah, I’m --</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: To climb on mountain, then to go down it [indecipherable] yeah.</span> <span id="s681">But we did it on the night, that -- that’s what we have to do, a lot of things which sometime we think it’s impossible, but we have to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: When you think about these things now --</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: -- I mean, so many years have gone by, and you re -- you remember some of these things --</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: -- does it seem kind of unbelievable to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: Yeah, it’s unbelievable to other people, not for me.</span> <span id="s688">Luckily, I had a profession, I went on the second day to a nice job to make money.</span> <span id="s689">I was fast, I was working piecework.</span> <span id="s690">And we were on our own, with no help of anybody.</span> <span id="s691">I was lucky I found this man, you know, from my town, and he took me in on the job, in the factory, was a big factory.</span> <span id="s692">I worked there a couple of years, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: When you did come over to the United States --</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: -- did you come on a boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: We come out on a boat, you know.</span> <span id="s697">Not on a regular boat, a boat where they bring animals, everybody was sick, like little sack, you was laying a little sack.</span> <span id="s698">And voo -- a lot of people said, “Throw me in the ocean, I don’t want to live any more.”</span> <span id="s699">They were throwing up, was horrible.</span> <span id="s700">And it was a big storm, it was even in the papers, written down, they didn’t thought that that boat will make it.</span> <span id="s701">It was on a little boat [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: Where did you leave from?</span> <span id="s703">Do you remember the name of the boat, or any of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: No.</span> <span id="s705">The boat I don’t remember, but the -- that -- but I remember we came with an airplane, we came -- no, I don’t remember the name of the boat, no.</span> <span id="s706">It was a -- a miserable boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: What -- where did it leave from?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: Oh, they -- they brought us to Boston.</span> <span id="s709">In Boston we stay overnight, and we took a train to come back to Chicago.</span> <span id="s710">And the HIAS paid, but I paid them back, because they told me that I -- you come to a sponsor.</span> <span id="s711">So the first check I got, I paid them back 70 dollars, in that time was a lot of money, but I paid them right away back, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: So the first place you landed in the United States was Boston --</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: Boston, yeah, overnight --</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: -- but you were just there for the night, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: -- overnight, that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: Do you remember when you pulled into the harbor what it looked like, what it was like to finally be in the United States, do you remember any of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: No, we didn’t know nothing.</span> <span id="s718">I think a Jewish organization was waiting for the people to come down from the boat.</span> <span id="s719">There was Gentile people there on the boat, too.</span> <span id="s720">They were -- took us out, I don’t know what, a certain place, and we stay overnight.</span> <span id="s721">They gave us a [indecipherable] he said we got to go on a train next day.</span> <span id="s722">So, we didn’t even see Boston, we didn’t see those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: And then you had a train ride, that -- was that a couple days?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: No, next morning we have to go, we have to go next morning, they was back in Chicago, and I come to Chicago, nobody waits for us.</span> <span id="s725">We didn’t know the English language.</span> <span id="s726">So, luckily, when Polish women came to work in the -- whole night we were sitting on a bench, and I see they’re speaking Polish, I said, “You help me out?</span> <span id="s727">Because I don’t know who to call, and what -- what to do.”</span> <span id="s728">So they said, “Just give us the telephone number, we’ll take the telephone book,” and to call him [indecipherable] come pick us up.</span> <span id="s729">They was very Orthodox people, very religious people.</span> <span id="s730">So we stood there for a week, til we got a bedroom someplace, then we moved out.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Do you know which group the -- the people who came and met you at the train station, do you know what group they were connected with?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: No, with nobody, that was a second cousin of my husband’s, they carried the same name Mosak, the same name.</span> <span id="s733">So they came, and they want to show in the shul they do something, but that wasn’t good for us.</span> <span id="s734">It didn’t work out good for us, because we was on our own, we have to look for work and all this thing, we don’t know the language.</span> <span id="s735">You come to a country, if you have a profession, it’s half the battle, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s736">You work, you learn the language.</span> <span id="s737">I went to night school here.</span> <span id="s738">But at least I make a few dollars, you know?</span> <span id="s739">Because in the beginning, I was really was starving here, too.</span> <span id="s740">I asked the woman where we were, and to borrow me a dime for a roll, til I get a check.</span> <span id="s741">We didn’t have anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: When you were taking that train ride, and when you got here, and all, I’m wondering, how did things look to you?</span> <span id="s743">Here you were in this totally different country, very different from where you’d been.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: Yeah, yes, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Did it seem like a very strange place?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: It was very strange.</span> <span id="s747">When I looked out, when I was on the station, and I saw the cars are running all night, I says, “How I’m going to mingle into this place?”</span> <span id="s748">Looks to me like impossible.</span> <span id="s749">How we going to live here?</span> <span id="s750">How we -- especially you don't know the language.</span> <span id="s751">I only knew a few word.</span> <span id="s752">It was hard, it was very hard, very hard.</span> <span id="s753">But if you have a profession, whatever you go, you can make a dollar for -- it was half the battle right away.</span> <span id="s754">I started to make nice money that time, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: Were you happy to be in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: I was very happy.</span> <span id="s757">I was very happy.</span> <span id="s758">I took every advantage.</span> <span id="s759">We were 40 on the table, I was the only work overtime, I didn’t go home.</span> <span id="s760">Saturday you got a double check, double.</span> <span id="s761">In the summer, I didn’t took the vacation, I got another check.</span> <span id="s762">I was the only one for 40 woman, to come into work.</span> <span id="s763">I figure I’ll do anything not to be poor any more.</span> <span id="s764">I’ll make as much money as I can.</span> <span id="s765">And that’s what I did.</span> <span id="s766">Soon, I got the money, I start to run out, buy a television, buy a radio, everything.</span> <span id="s767">And the people said, “It’s not Europe, you get it next day.”</span> <span id="s768">I thought if I don’t grab it right away, I wouldn’t have it.</span> <span id="s769">Every chance I got, I buy -- I bought for the house, yeah.</span> <span id="s770">There we got an apartment, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: And you -- you started to have children, when was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: A couple of years later.</span> <span id="s773">We came end of ’48, my daughter was born 1950, in Thanksgiving.</span> <span id="s774">Until I had money, the bank, until I have an apartment, then I had the children, yeah.</span> <span id="s775">Because we didn’t have help from nobody, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: And how many children all together?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: Two, two daughters I have, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: And tell us again the years, and what their names are -- that they were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: Yeah, Esther is the older one, Dorothy the younger one, and I consider myself very lucky to have tho -- those two daughters.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s781">I’m wondering, this is a -- this is again a little bit of a strange question --</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: -- but, you know, you talked about the way you and your husband --</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: -- got together, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: -- the unusual circumstance.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: I can -- I can imagine some people doing that, who would --</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: Ever.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: -- do that, get over here --</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: -- and say, okay, now we’re here, now we’re safe, you know, we should -- we should break up now, and then go find other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: Well, I want to tell you something.</span> <span id="s795">My husband was a sick man.</span> <span id="s796">Later on I find out he was sick.</span> <span id="s797">Wasn’t sick when I was married, six months later I find out that he had bleeding ulcer.</span> <span id="s798">I would never do it to nobody.</span> <span id="s799">Even I could make myself better, and I had a chance, and I didn’t took the chance.</span> <span id="s800">But for me, I [indecipherable] the world, I would not do it to nobody.</span> <span id="s801">I’d rather suffer than to make myself better.</span> <span id="s802">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: I’m -- I’m not following exactly what you’re saying.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: Yeah, I could have have a better life if I want to change, in that time when I come here.</span> <span id="s805">It was a lot of men, and only a few girls came to the United State, but I didn’t -- I wouldn’t do that to nobody, not to my husband, not to nobody.</span> <span id="s806">But me, I work as a [indecipherable] and what I make up is for good and for bad, you know.</span> <span id="s807">I wouldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s808">Some people do it, a lot of them break up right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: You saw that?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s811">They live in New York.</span> <span id="s812">They want to come to this country, and they want to have the paper, and they broke up right away, they came a couple weeks later, and they marry somebody else.</span> <span id="s813">A lot of them, yeah.</span> <span id="s814">But not everybody had the heart to do it, no.</span> <span id="s815">Even you can make some -- so -- better, no, I wouldn’t do it, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: When you came here, and started establishing your life --</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: -- were you in contact with lots of other survivors who had come to the area, or not --</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: No, was I -- it was only the only one in 1948, and I didn’t see -- then, when we open up a cleaning store, they come in, most of them Hungarians Jews, Czechoslovakia, not from mine town.</span> <span id="s820">And so we got acquainted with them, you know, we tried to keep to -- to our own.</span> <span id="s821">And then they start up an organization, you know, that we got together all the time.</span> <span id="s822">But none of my past friends I have, none of them, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s824">Where was the cleaning store?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: On Division.</span> <span id="s826">On Division Street.</span> <span id="s827">You familiar with Chicago?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: Well, I lived here, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: Yeah, on Division, on -- first we have on Spaulding and Potomac, and then we moved up to the main street, on Division Street.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: Where at on Division, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: On Potomac -- yes, within -- corner Potomac and Spaulding.</span> <span id="s832">Was a -- was a hardware store, a butcher store, and that was our store, a cleaning store, we were there a couple of years.</span> <span id="s833">Then we moved up there, then we moved again, because the neighborhood changed.</span> <span id="s834">We moved on Jarveese, wasn’t good over there, either.</span> <span id="s835">So, we still -- you have our lease, you have to stay.</span> <span id="s836">And then I start to take in work in my own house, and I still do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: So Jarvis -- so you lived in Roger’s Park for a while?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s841">Yeah, that time we live already in -- in West Roger’s Park.</span> <span id="s842">Yeah [indecipherable] we moved [indecipherable] we live on Division Street, then we moved to Albany Park, from Albany Park, we moved to -- we moved to West Roger’s Park, and I stayed there 33 years.</span> <span id="s843">Here I live six years, going to be next month.</span> <span id="s844">So we keep on moving all the time.</span> <span id="s845">[indecipherable] cames to my door, that she make me to move, which I’m happy here, very happy.</span> <span id="s846">Yes, but here lives a lot of refugees, around other buildings here.</span> <span id="s847">So we get together, we play cards a little bit, we go out together.</span> <span id="s848">We got like a social life here.</span> <span id="s849">Where I live, everybody moved away to Florida, to Las Vegas, Arizona, so I lost the friends over there, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s851">When -- when you, you know, in those early years when you were here, and getting established and all that, did you think much, or talk about much with your husband or other people what had happened during the war, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s853">First of all, we were ver -- very busy making a living, working all the time.</span> <span id="s854">No, we never talked about it, no.</span> <span id="s855">Just recently, when they start to interview people.</span> <span id="s856">A lot of people of my friend don’t want to even talk about it, it’s too painful, they can’t take it.</span> <span id="s857">But I went to Washington a few times, where they, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: But it sounds like from what you’re saying is that, you know, most of your life since, you’ve not talked about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: If someone asked you about it, would you --</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: -- refuse to answer, or would you say I don’t want to talk about this, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: Well, I tell you, most people, even the people who brought us here, they brought another family.</span> <span id="s864">So, she always talked about it, I says, “Stop talking about it.”</span> <span id="s865">I never talked about it, no.</span> <span id="s866">I never say nothing.</span> <span id="s867">But she start [indecipherable], “Oh Sonja, stop talking, it makes me sick, I don’t want to hear about it.”</span> <span id="s868">They didn’t have to tell it to me.</span> <span id="s869">I didn’t save somebody [indecipherable] tell them about not -- pa -- on my own, no.</span> <span id="s870">No, I didn’t tell her nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: The museum would like you to just tell us what the number -- what your number was.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: The number.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s875">25702.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: Right, which is right there on your arm.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: Yes, right here, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: What -- when you got over here, and actually it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: -- up to this day, you have this number tattooed on your arm.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: Yeah, all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: When you go out, do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: -- let it show, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: No, it show --</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: -- do you try to cover it up?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: -- I tell you, when I came to this country in this -- and in the summer, and I went on the train, people moved away, they thought I coming from Sing-Sing, they never saw that.</span> <span id="s888">So, I have a number, I must be a criminal, so they just moved away, they didn’t want to see.</span> <span id="s889">Even now whe -- if I go in the hospital on -- “What is that?</span> <span id="s890">You was in a camp, you got a good time?”</span> <span id="s891">They didn’t know it was a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s892">They never saw that.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: Never saw that, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: Do you -- and -- so, you were going around, it was visible, people were reacting to it?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: Yeah, yeah, people, yeah, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: You didn’t cover it up?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: No, no, never.</span> <span id="s899">I never cover up, no, never.</span> <span id="s900">You can’t cover up if you wear short sleeve.</span> <span id="s901">No, I never cover up.</span> <span id="s902">One of my friends doctor take out, and it was a botched up job, and she looks worse.</span> <span id="s903">So I -- it doesn’t bother me.</span> <span id="s904">You get used to things, you know.</span> <span id="s905">If my granddaughter were little, she asks me, I told her it’s a telephone number.</span> <span id="s906">Like, she was two, three years old, what you going -- I said mine telephone number.</span> <span id="s907">What are you so -- tell a kid, you know, in that age?</span> <span id="s908">No, it didn’t -- I got used to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: What -- as your children were growing up, wa -- did you talk with them much about what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: No, no, never, never.</span> <span id="s911">It was too painful.</span> <span id="s912">You don’t want to upset kids [indecipherable] older, when they’re young, no.</span> <span id="s913">They find out on their own, they find out on their own.</span> <span id="s914">As a matter of fact, I came to visit me, a lady from Milwaukee, and she was in camp -- no, she was hidden, I think.</span> <span id="s915">In how -- those days, a young person, maybe 42 - 43, she said, “Oh, I never saw the number.”</span> <span id="s916">I said, “Didn’t you read in the books, in the paper, in the movie?”</span> <span id="s917">She says, “No, I see the first time.”</span> <span id="s918">So some people doesn’t know, even Jewish people, a lot of them doesn’t know about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s920">But at some point, did your children ever start to ask you questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s922">I told them I was in the camp, and that’s it, you know?</span> <span id="s923">I never talked about it to ma -- it’s too painful, and for children, they would never understand it either, it’s impossible.</span> <span id="s924">To tell things like that, that’s is -- impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: What about when they got to be older, like when they were teenagers, or even --</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: Yeah, well, they find out, but on their own.</span> <span id="s927">They go to the library here, and there they find out.</span> <span id="s928">But I never talked about that, the way it was -- things was, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: So you wanted them to find out about it the way any young person in this country would find out, in history class --</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: -- or by reading, or by seeing a movie?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: But you know, that’s kind of distant.</span> <span id="s934">I mean, you pick up a book and read, it’s a little bit abstract.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: Yes, but at least they have a knowledge now, they teach them in the schools, it’s a little bit knowledge, more knowledge.</span> <span id="s936">I went a couple years ago downtown, it was a lady from Austria, and she’s supposed to tell the people what’s happened.</span> <span id="s937">So, a Gentile guy came in, a young man maybe 38, and she told him she was a child, she’s supposed to be in the movies, and then she was sitting on the street, and the German -- the Austri was spitting on her, you are a Jew, and that then.</span> <span id="s938">And they show the pictures, she is now married, she have kid.</span> <span id="s939">So the guy says, “I’m so happy that I came to the museum to find out, because I would never believe it.</span> <span id="s940">Now I see it in person.</span> <span id="s941">Now I can see it.”</span> <span id="s942">The guy, a young guy, he said.</span> <span id="s943">Some are interested, and some are not interested.</span> <span id="s944">I went into a restaurant last year, and a couple boys come in -- I think they’re from Mexico, and they told me they have Arab friend, and the Arabs say bad things about Israel, and all this thing, the Jews do this.</span> <span id="s945">So I said, “Listen, you don’t have to listen to that.</span> <span id="s946">If you want to know, I’ll tell you the story.</span> <span id="s947">First of all, Jewish people doesn’t go and attack cars, buses the children ardi to school.</span> <span id="s948">Jewish people doesn’t do this thing, the Arabs do this thing.”</span> <span id="s949">If one guy got crazy, he went in one time, got [indecipherable] killed people, that doesn’t mean the Jewish people do.</span> <span id="s950">The Jewish people take him to the hospital to help him.</span> <span id="s951">They don’t attack people like they do, with buses, with cars, whatever they do.</span> <span id="s952">So I -- they have -- says, “Well, it’s good to know.”</span> <span id="s953">16 - 17 years old.</span> <span id="s954">So I tell them, oh, be happy to, because they ask you what the number is.</span> <span id="s955">They was interested.</span> <span id="s956">They learn in the schools, and we explain it to them, those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s958">If -- let’s say one of your daughters, when she was like 20 or something --</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: -- had come to you --</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: -- and said, “You know, I really would like to know what happened to you during the war,” would you have told her --</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: -- or would you say no, I don’t want to.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: No, no, yes I told them, yes.</span> <span id="s966">Mine daughter knows, yes.</span> <span id="s967">I happens to have pictures.</span> <span id="s968">One of my friends, whi -- she got killed in kare -- Canada, she took a lot of pictures.</span> <span id="s969">I belonged to a Zionist organization before the war, so sh-she took the pictures to our neighbor, a Polish.</span> <span id="s970">She says, “If somebody comes back, a Jew, please give the picture.”</span> <span id="s971">So she came back -- my girlfriend came back, she got the picture, she made copies, she gave it to me.</span> <span id="s972">So then I show it to my daughter.</span> <span id="s973">Then, after the war, when I came to the United State, they told us [indecipherable] open up a book with picture.</span> <span id="s974">So I says, “I have some pictures.”</span> <span id="s975">How do I have pictures?</span> <span id="s976">I have an aunt in Pennsylvania, which I didn’t know I had, and her children was born here, so I decided soon I came to this country, I get in touch with my aunt.</span> <span id="s977">I remembered the address, not exactly, but it came the letters to her, what I remember by heart.</span> <span id="s978">And I told her, I says, “I would like to have the pictures from mine family, from mine uncle.”</span> <span id="s979">She says, “It’s too far to give it to you, you better come here, we want to see you.”</span> <span id="s980">That time -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: -- is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Lonia Mosak.</span> <span id="s982">This is tape number two, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: -- have some pictures.”</span> <span id="s984">How do I have pictures?</span> <span id="s985">I have an aunt in Pennsylvania, which I didn’t know I had, and her children was born here, so I decided soon I came to this country, I get in touch with my aunt.</span> <span id="s986">I remembered the address, not exactly, but it came the letters to her, what I remember by heart.</span> <span id="s987">And I told her, I says, “I would like to have the pictures from mine family, from mine uncle.”</span> <span id="s988">She says, “It’s too far to give it to you, you better come here, we want to see you.”</span> <span id="s989">That time planes didn’t run in 1949, you have to take a train.</span> <span id="s990">So we made up they’re going to meet us on the station.</span> <span id="s991">They didn’t find us on the station, I didn’t find them, but a lot of people -- what I got a address, I walked over to them, and I met them, my aunt, she was a elderly lady, very religious, too.</span> <span id="s992">And she get -- took out all the pictures for mine parents, for my uncle, for my other uncle.</span> <span id="s993">My turov -- my uncle was Hank, in na -- mine town -- not mine town, a different town.</span> <span id="s994">So I -- I got all the pictures, and then I went to the museum a -- two times, three times, and I present all the pictures, and the book from Israel what came out, I sent away a picture from mine family, of a [indecipherable] in the book.</span> <span id="s995">So I have a few documents, at least, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s997">Could you just -- actually, the museum asked me to ask you --</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: -- if you could just say the name of -- names of your family members, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: Oh yeah, of course, you mean from my uncles, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: Or j -- or just from mine parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: Well, your parents, your uncles --</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: -- you know, whatever you remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: The names?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: Co -- my father’s names was Mandel, my mother’s name was Esther.</span> <span id="s1009">My younger brother was Shya, and he was taken away by a selection in Auschwitz, he was 15 years old.</span> <span id="s1010">So that was it.</span> <span id="s1011">Then for my uncle, tr --</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: Before you go on -- and then -- but their last name was what, now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: Kirschenbaum, yeah.</span> <span id="s1014">Then I can give you the name for my uncle.</span> <span id="s1015">My uncle ran away from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1016">We already was in a ghetto that -- they decided in mine town, should be a mustard -- they connected to Klein-Berlin.</span> <span id="s1017">They called it Klein-Berlin.</span> <span id="s1018">So they didn’t make a ghetto, they took out the people to -- to each, to other ghettos -- I was in the ghetto in Novidburg in that time.</span> <span id="s1019">So I found out that my uncle ran back.</span> <span id="s1020">The city wasn’t too far, so decided they’re going to hang him.</span> <span id="s1021">And there was another brother, my father’s brother, they arrested him t -- cause you are a brother, you got to be hanged, too, because there were prominent people in the city.</span> <span id="s1022">So the Gestapo paid them off, they shouldn’t make the execution in i -- in our town, because when they hang people, the son have to hang a father, because he took the [indecipherable] around the Jewish cemetery, and tried to hide it.</span> <span id="s1023">So the son have to hang the father, otherwise all Jewish people will be killed.</span> <span id="s1024">So they decided, a committee, they paid off the Gestapo, the execution should be in another town, not -- not the family should [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1025">So they took him to Novidburg, where I was born, but I didn’t live there, only one year.</span> <span id="s1026">After the war, I went there, to Novidburg, and I digged out those graves.</span> <span id="s1027">I find out [indecipherable] the Polish people, they told me exactly how many people, they’re saying seven people.</span> <span id="s1028">Two of mine uncles, and then [indecipherable] the daughter-in-law’s father, and then -- then a boy, maybe 19 years old, they told him he threw away the [indecipherable], and a couple from Plodz.</span> <span id="s1029">In order to dig that out, I find a few people in the city, I went to the city and they helped me.</span> <span id="s1030">We have to have a permanen -- a permit.</span> <span id="s1031">So, the governor told us, only they give us a permit if the -- all of them going to put in one casket, because they was laying in a shallow grave, you know, like that.</span> <span id="s1032">So I decided, yes, whatever they do, it’s all right.</span> <span id="s1033">So we put them in one casket.</span> <span id="s1034">I didn’t see the faces, because you couldn’t rec-recognize the faces from 1942 til 1945.</span> <span id="s1035">And they put them on the Jewish cemetery there, and I put a -- a [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1036">But my daughter went in there, and she said it’s no more there.</span> <span id="s1037">You know what the Polish people did to the cemeteries.</span> <span id="s1038">They make fields to -- to grow food up at the -- the -- liquidate the cemetery over there.</span> <span id="s1039">That’s what I did after the war for mine uncles, you know.</span> <span id="s1040">And they have families -- I have the pictures from them, which I present at the -- Washington They have two daughters and two son.</span> <span id="s1041">One daughter I saw in Auschwitz only one day, then I didn’t see her any more.</span> <span id="s1042">And so they all got killed.</span> <span id="s1043">My other uncle, [indecipherable] was killed, got three daughters.</span> <span id="s1044">They all was killed, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: What were the names of the -- your uncles that were killed?</span> <span id="s1046">Their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: Binjamin Kirschenbaum, and Aaron Kirschenbaum.</span> <span id="s1048">Then was Linden Birkdeboy, but he was killed, and then was mine cousin, she was like 19 years old, she didn’t want to go to the shadar.</span> <span id="s1049">So she took a pin, and marked on the bricks, that here lay in the Kirschenbaum.</span> <span id="s1050">When I came after the war, I couldn’t go to that brick, they build a garage.</span> <span id="s1051">I tried to get in to get out that brick, but I couldn’t, it was already build a garage, and I couldn’t get to that.</span> <span id="s1052">But that what I tried to do after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: Have you gone back to Europe since --</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: No.</span> <span id="s1055">My daughter went, but no, I can’t look at the faces any more, no.</span> <span id="s1056">I wouldn’t go back there for no money in the world.</span> <span id="s1057">I wouldn’t -- I know the Polish people, they very unconsi -- they were worse than the German.</span> <span id="s1058">If th -- if a Jewish -- if a Jewish man, he had a business, you know, he put [indecipherable] to hide the cloth, they report it to the Germans right away.</span> <span id="s1059">Everything [indecipherable] they told them who was rich, and who was that, who was educated.</span> <span id="s1060">You know, they got the -- it was surrounded with enemies all around, even after the war, but no liberation for the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1061">Nobody will ever know how many Jews was killed in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: You were -- you know, all this time, you’re living in the Chicago area, lot of Polish people here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: I hate them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: I hate them.</span> <span id="s1066">I tell you why.</span> <span id="s1067">There is a shul, a Reform shul near Tuye, so the Polish people maybe d -- the third generation, what they were born here, they put in a letter, the Jews are kikes, the Jews are miserable.</span> <span id="s1068">My mother told me when I was a little girl I shouldn’t go near.</span> <span id="s1069">They was born here.</span> <span id="s1070">We took the letter, and we went to Puchinsky, he’s a Polish man, he was a older man.</span> <span id="s1071">They didn’t sign a name who did that.</span> <span id="s1072">No matter the fifth generation they born here, the Polish people are miserable, and terrible, and anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s1073">That’s how they’re born.</span> <span id="s1074">That’s what the Bricha said.</span> <span id="s1075">In the milk, they got in the milk when they was born, from the mother, to be anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s1076">That’s the way they are.</span> <span id="s1077">That’s the way they are.</span> <span id="s1078">I wouldn’t go near him.</span> <span id="s1079">And mine daughter went there when they interview some college professor, they said they’re going to teach in the school, go and make a remark how they treat them after the war, they got red in the face, and they start, “Oh, Poles was killed, too, the Russian killed, too.”</span> <span id="s1080">They wouldn’t say -- apologize even, no.</span> <span id="s1081">That’s the way they are.</span> <span id="s1082">They talk nice, gentle, but you don’t know what they really are.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: So just in town, do you avoid Polish neighborhoods, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1085">I avoid them, yes, I avoid them.</span> <span id="s1086">I don’t want to have nothing to do with them.</span> <span id="s1087">I try not to.</span> <span id="s1088">Now, you know, they come to -- they come here, they clean houses.</span> <span id="s1089">One lady went there to exchange some money with them, and they didn’t know she’s -- she’s a Jew.</span> <span id="s1090">So she says to -- to them, “There’s -- the -- the -- the Jewish people they should only drop dead, and they have such a nice home.”</span> <span id="s1091">They come here to clean.</span> <span id="s1092">They get money for it, pa -- clo -- that’s the way they are.</span> <span id="s1093">I wouldn’t let them into my house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: Did you ever think about going to Israel, moving to Israel?</span> <span id="s1095">Cause you said you were in a Zionist organization when you were young.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: Yes, I went there three times already.</span> <span id="s1097">The first time I went because somebody told me for asthma it’s good in Israel, so I went for a month to dry out, and somebody told me no, somebody seek whatever you go.</span> <span id="s1098">I went there three times already, yes, in Israel.</span> <span id="s1099">But when I got married, in the paper it was for the United State, and we came here, and we start to make a living, and then you have a family, then you can’t pick yourself up and go.</span> <span id="s1100">But I was there three times for mine granddaughter’s Bas Mitzvah, mine grandson’s Bar Mitzvah, we went there back, the last couple of years, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: When you were younger, and you were in the Zionist organization --</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: -- did you have any sort of dream of one day going to Israel, and living Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: Yeah, that -- that was our goal, but how many could go?</span> <span id="s1105">One -- maybe one -- one from each town.</span> <span id="s1106">That was our goal to go to Israel, that was we were dreaming about it.</span> <span id="s1107">We was real organized in that time.</span> <span id="s1108">But I wasn’t the youngest grou, and were older people wi -- that did emigrate to Israel.</span> <span id="s1109">So they make like two people can go on one certificate if they got married, and they come to Israel, and they dissolve it.</span> <span id="s1110">So, older people did go, yeah, from mine town.</span> <span id="s1111">But we didn’t have a chance yet, you know.</span> <span id="s1112">People wanted to go to Israel, but they wouldn’t let us in.</span> <span id="s1113">Remember Vivian from England?</span> <span id="s1114">He didn’t want to upset the Arabs, to let in Jewish people to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1116">Do you ever -- did you ever feel any regret that you didn’t wind up in Israel instead of here, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: No, I don’t feel a regret, I tell you.</span> <span id="s1118">I don’t think I could take the climate there, it’s very hot.</span> <span id="s1119">When I was there about 25 years ago, I got very sick.</span> <span id="s1120">I didn’t know the climate, I went in the summer.</span> <span id="s1121">And I didn’t thought I’ll make it home alive, that’s how sick.</span> <span id="s1122">I could not breathe.</span> <span id="s1123">I -- I could not take the -- if -- in Jerusalem a little better, but in Tel Aviv, impossible.</span> <span id="s1124">An-An-And I tell my friends that -- they were saying I lay on the floor, I couldn’t breathe, I -- they says to me, “ We here a couple years already.”</span> <span id="s1125">I says, “You got adjusted, but I didn’t.”</span> <span id="s1126">I was very sick, but I went back for the kid’s Bar Mitzvah, and the Bas Mitzvah, we went back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: When you were -- one question the museum had was, when you were in the ghetto, before you were sent to Auschwitz --</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: Yeah, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: How long were you in the ghetto, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: A year.</span> <span id="s1131">I live with horses in a stable, because they put in from each town there, and there was no way to go in.</span> <span id="s1132">Like in one room lived [indecipherable] 10 families.</span> <span id="s1133">So we were the last ones.</span> <span id="s1134">When the German brought us over there -- should I tell you how we got on the -- on the boat?</span> <span id="s1135">We have a -- a castle in our town, with kings used to live there, now it’s for -- then it was for recreation.</span> <span id="s1136">So they took all the Jews into that castle, and locked the door.</span> <span id="s1137">Then they start to [indecipherable] the people, if everybody’s dead.</span> <span id="s1138">If a baby fell down, and somebody picked up, they both got show.</span> <span id="s1139">Got to be quiet.</span> <span id="s1140">Then, by going out from the door [indecipherable] door, was standing in the black uniform, with the rifles, beating up everybody.</span> <span id="s1141">Blood was running like water.</span> <span id="s1142">Then they put us on top.</span> <span id="s1143">Between us was a doctor, he came from Germany, I think he got one artificial leg.</span> <span id="s1144">They throw him on the ground, and they step on his face with the boots.</span> <span id="s1145">That doctor came to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1146">We do -- we would do the same thing, he got the pills.</span> <span id="s1147">He, his wife, his child, commit suicide right away, when he came into Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1148">We didn’t have that, he have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: You didn’t have what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: Pills to commit suicide.</span> <span id="s1151">They took us in the ghetto -- so they watched for 20 minutes, they going to beat up people, they have to find a place.</span> <span id="s1152">But there was no place where to go, so we run in a stable, and we live in a stable almost a year.</span> <span id="s1153">Nothing to eat, people were dying from typhus.</span> <span id="s1154">The only thing is they open up a kitchen, the Jewish people open up a kitchen, give a little bit soup, everybody.</span> <span id="s1155">We was begging the German, why don’t you kill us?</span> <span id="s1156">He says, “No, we need the bullets on the front.</span> <span id="s1157">You going to die ever -- anyway.”</span> <span id="s1158">That was in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1159">And then, from the ghetto, took us to [indecipherable] overnight, and right on the -- on the trains, on those closed trains, there were people you -- women used to give urine to drink, the babies was crying for water.</span> <span id="s1160">No water, keep us like that, locked up for three days.</span> <span id="s1161">Dark, no bathroom, no nothing.</span> <span id="s1162">Half of them die anyway.</span> <span id="s1163">And then the -- everything they did at night.</span> <span id="s1164">They put on the train at night, we come to os -- we didn’t know where we were, we didn’t know what’s going on.</span> <span id="s1165">And right away was selection.</span> <span id="s1166">Let’s say we come up 3,000 people in a train.</span> <span id="s1167">They only pick up a hundred women, a hundred men.</span> <span id="s1168">The rest have to go to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s1169">So we didn’t know -- I wa -- right away, didn’t see my parents, nothing, was dark.</span> <span id="s1170">We have to put down our suitcases, whatever somebody got, and they only picked up 200, and the rest have to go.</span> <span id="s1171">You could be young, you could be strong, it didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s1172">That’s how it was.</span> <span id="s1173">And then we find out when we came there, that’s the -- the gas chamber is working day and night, for 24 hours.</span> <span id="s1174">Day and night.</span> <span id="s1175">You know, people were standing in the line, they begged to go in already.</span> <span id="s1176">No washrooms, winter, it’s cold, children are crying, they beat you up.</span> <span id="s1177">They want to get over with it, already.</span> <span id="s1178">They sing the Haptikvah, they know where they going, they see the flames, and a few minutes later, it will happen to them.</span> <span id="s1179">So people don’t understand all these things.</span> <span id="s1180">People who wasn’t there could never visualize.</span> <span id="s1181">Now, everything is p -- fixed up, [indecipherable] taken.</span> <span id="s1182">Can’t -- they can’t visualize those things.</span> <span id="s1183">Day and night, were six crematoriums working.</span> <span id="s1184">But when the war comes to an end, they took apart five, so nobody should know there was six.</span> <span id="s1185">They only left one.</span> <span id="s1186">They didn’t manage to liquidate the one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1188">Today, or -- you know, let’s say the last few years, or whatever, do you -- just in your day to day life --</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: Do you think of this very often?</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1192">You dream at night all the time.</span> <span id="s1193">I -- sometime I scream at night.</span> <span id="s1194">I -- I feel like I’m going to hide, I want to run.</span> <span id="s1195">It’s all the time with that.</span> <span id="s1196">It never goes out.</span> <span id="s1197">[indecipherable] to my daughter when I sleep [indecipherable] come in and wake me up, I’m happy, because when you dream, it looks like real.</span> <span id="s1198">And she waked me up, I said, “Thank you.</span> <span id="s1199">It’s good you woke me up.</span> <span id="s1200">I sleep ala -- alone here, alw -- always ba -- it never goes away from your mind.</span> <span id="s1201">Like you’re running, you [indecipherable] selection, you here and there.</span> <span id="s1202">Never goes away, those things, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: How often do you have these nightmares?</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: A lot of ha -- of the times.</span> <span id="s1205">All the time I dream that I’m with the camp, we going to hide it, we going to run.</span> <span id="s1206">We -- we go out from the ghetto, maybe -- maybe we’ll run here, maybe we’ll run here, and they -- running after the -- always the -- the scary thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1208">You know, now, in this -- in this country now --</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: -- especially, you know, lately --</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: -- when traumatic things have happened to people --</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: -- there’s a disaster, or -- you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q: -- school shootings, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">Q: -- you know, terrible things that happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: They -- instantly they send counselors in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: Psychologists, and therapists.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: We haven’t got none of the -- and a lot of -- and a lot of people were very depressed, and nobody knew about it.</span> <span id="s1224">We didn’t know even [indecipherable] thing.</span> <span id="s1225">No, we didn’t have any help, nothing.</span> <span id="s1226">Not when we came, no, nothing like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: Have you ever thought, in years since, about maybe seeing a counselor, talking about this sort of thing, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Q: That’s -- that’s too different?</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: Beca -- no, because we don’t believe really, in that, you know.</span> <span id="s1231">It’s all behind, you know, and a lot of people kind of pull out, which is a miracle.</span> <span id="s1232">A lot of my friends -- I had a friend from Alsia.</span> <span id="s1233">She said, “I can’t believe it, what you went through, that you -- you got that guts to go to work, and make money, raise a family.”</span> <span id="s1234">But when you depend on yourself, then you do it.</span> <span id="s1235">When you drowning, you try to pick yourself up, no help from nobody.</span> <span id="s1236">So, it’s a miracle [indecipherable] people, but not everybody did it.</span> <span id="s1237">A lot of -- end up institution, a lot of my friend end up insti -- one of my friend which she help me, when I dig out mine uncles at the -- and I want to send her to Israel, send her a present.</span> <span id="s1238">She was a nice -- she took me to the house.</span> <span id="s1239">They took away a girl from [indecipherable] and she -- when they took her away.</span> <span id="s1240">In the camps, the only thing wanting they have a piece of bread to eat, but after the war, when she came to Israel, she went up in institution.</span> <span id="s1241">Beautiful, young woman.</span> <span id="s1242">And I don’t think if she is still alive -- as a matter of fact, the husband survived, too.</span> <span id="s1243">They both survived.</span> <span id="s1244">And he was a very religious man.</span> <span id="s1245">They went up in Israel.</span> <span id="s1246">But a lot of people that was in the institution in Israel, a lot of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: Why do you think that you didn’t wind up in an institution, or go crazy from all this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: Well, I tell you why.</span> <span id="s1249">I have one thing in mind, is to work, and to make money, and not to be poor any more.</span> <span id="s1250">I concentrate on this, you know.</span> <span id="s1251">That was it, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: So you put all your energy into that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: Yeah, yeah, I worked all the time.</span> <span id="s1254">I didn’t want to think about nothing else, only to work, and to make money, because if you have money, you can live a betli -- a better life, you know, and that’s what I try.</span> <span id="s1255">My kids went to college, the piano lessons.</span> <span id="s1256">I tried to give them everything what I didn’t have.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1258">You talked about the nightmares you have.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: Yeah, all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: But what about -- what about when you’re awake, and just, you know, doing things around the apartment, or whatever, do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: No, only when I lay down to sleep.</span> <span id="s1262">You know, I am working, so I am busy, so occupied with my work, so I can think of something else.</span> <span id="s1263">I got to concentrate what I do.</span> <span id="s1264">But when I lay down and sleep, all the time I have dreams.</span> <span id="s1265">I -- I am amazed, myself.</span> <span id="s1266">And -- and sometime, I almost cry.</span> <span id="s1267">I -- I’m in such a bad situation, I start to run, here’s a selection, here’s this, and it always comes back, it’s so real, it’s so real when it comes back.</span> <span id="s1268">So when I get up, I says, “Oy, thanks God I’m out of it,” you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q: In these dreams, are they -- are the -- are the dreams made up of things you actually saw, or it’s just sort of -- it puts you in the place, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">A: No, it puts me in the place where I was standing for selection.</span> <span id="s1271">We have to stay naked, winter, in the coldest day.</span> <span id="s1272">If you have a little pimple on the body, you was gone.</span> <span id="s1273">That was -- one time they told -- I work in ausch -- in Birkenau, I work by bricks, with the tuchkas you know, schlep brick?</span> <span id="s1274">I work by that.</span> <span id="s1275">One time they announced they need 50 girls.</span> <span id="s1276">So I said maybe I’ll have luck to go to work [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1277">I stand there, and I find out, one of my friends from Czechoslovakia come over, she said, “Run away.</span> <span id="s1278">They need 50 girls to sterilize them.”</span> <span id="s1279">So when it’s 20,000 people on the one ground, you can get lost.</span> <span id="s1280">So I kind of turned out away, and I run away from there.</span> <span id="s1281">A lot of from mine town, many women got sterilized, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: What about when there are documentaries on TV about the Holocaust, or this movie, like “Schindler’s List,” or other --</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: Yes, I went there, yeah.</span> <span id="s1284">I we -- I saw “ Schindler’s List.”</span> <span id="s1285">I’m very happy that they showed the list, but I tell you, it’s actually a piece of cake compared to Auschwitz and Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1286">At least they didn’t stay by selection.</span> <span id="s1287">They didn’t watch me -- people get burned all the time.</span> <span id="s1288">They suffered too, they have to live on rationing.</span> <span id="s1289">They went to work.</span> <span id="s1290">They wasn’t beaten up like we were beaten up.</span> <span id="s1291">One time, I j -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1292">We get a piece of bread, we didn’t know should we eat it up, or take each time a crumb.</span> <span id="s1293">Maybe I took a crumb t -- he noticed that, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1294">I was sitting, he gave me with the rifle, maybe 10 times over the head.</span> <span id="s1295">I lost mine conscious, he was sure that I am dead already.</span> <span id="s1296">Then he walked away.</span> <span id="s1297">And I see black rings on mine face.</span> <span id="s1298">Then mine girls came over, and says, “Oh, you still alive, come over.”</span> <span id="s1299">The whole face was bloody, the whole head was bloody.</span> <span id="s1300">I didn’t even know, we didn’t have a mirror, we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1301">So when I came back to the camps, “Oh, you probably were beaten up today.</span> <span id="s1302">Look at what,” -- I says, “Yes, I was beaten up.</span> <span id="s1303">I don’t know why, but I was.”</span> <span id="s1304">They always had to catch somebody.</span> <span id="s1305">It’s a miracle.</span> <span id="s1306">I -- I used to suffer on headaches for many years, on terrible headaches, because it -- it is injure you eventually, not only emotionally, but physically, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1308">If you just sit down and turn on the TV, or something --</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">Q: -- or if you’re going around the channels, and there happens to be some program on about the war --</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">Q: -- the Holocaust, or whatever --</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">A: I’ll never miss it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: So you watch them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: Never miss it.</span> <span id="s1316">I think it’s a crime to miss it.</span> <span id="s1317">You know, it’s [indecipherable] people, and they tell them, “How can you watch that?</span> <span id="s1318">I can’t watch it.”</span> <span id="s1319">I says, “If you don’t watch it, you commit a crime.</span> <span id="s1320">How would the people who was in those closed up train, and give the kids urine to drink, we was starving, they went through it, you can’t even watch it?</span> <span id="s1321">And you sit on a comfortable couch, and you’re not hungry?”</span> <span id="s1322">I never missed anything, I always watch, and call right away my friends to watch it, too.</span> <span id="s1323">I think if I don’t watch it, I commit a crime.</span> <span id="s1324">That’s the way I feel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">Q: Did you always feel that way?</span> <span id="s1326">I mean y-you know, years ago you said you never talked about this, or you hardly ever talked about --</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">A: No, I didn’t talk, but I’m glad now they show on television certain things, that I’m glad they show -- one time, only one time they show on television, how the people, when they put them in the crematorium.</span> <span id="s1328">They didn’t show how they fall out, the bodies.</span> <span id="s1329">That’s one time they show.</span> <span id="s1330">I think they don’t want to show, because people don’t want to watch this thing.</span> <span id="s1331">So they didn’t show it any time, that’s the only time when -- I never witched -- I never miss it, I always watch it.</span> <span id="s1332">Those people suffer, and the other people can’t even watch it?</span> <span id="s1333">I think that’s a crime.</span> <span id="s1334">That’s the -- why I tell everybody, but the American people tell me, “You shouldn’t watch it, you shouldn’t watch it.</span> <span id="s1335">I couldn’t do that.</span> <span id="s1336">I -- I don’t want to see that.”</span> <span id="s1337">I was in Florida, a -- a people come in to see -- it was a film -- I forgot, a certain film.</span> <span id="s1338">They saw the film, they like [indecipherable] then they talk to each other, then they start to co -- show from the camp.</span> <span id="s1339">If I knew that, I wouldn’t even go there.</span> <span id="s1340">That’s how I was talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: Wait, I -- I didn’t follow that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: In Florida last year, they show nice thing, all of a sudden they start to show from the camp.</span> <span id="s1343">Who wants to see them?</span> <span id="s1344">We don’t want to see that.</span> <span id="s1345">I walk over to her, I said, “You very lucky.</span> <span id="s1346">You didn’t have to feel it, not only see it.</span> <span id="s1347">You were see it.</span> <span id="s1348">You don’t want to see how other people -- that’s not nice.”</span> <span id="s1349">I told them right away.</span> <span id="s1350">Oh, we can’t take it, what can I tell, we can’t take it.</span> <span id="s1351">People don’t like to see sad things, you know?</span> <span id="s1352">But I never miss it, if they show a few m -- anything on television, I never miss it, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">Q: Did you, in -- in the years you’ve been living here, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q: -- all the years since the war, did you ever have the feeling, or did you ever worry that something like that could happen again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">A: Of course.</span> <span id="s1357">You remember a couple years ago, Skokie here, builded a -- he was a Jewish guy, he come from a Jewish family, the guy, what he orgaz -- what was his name?</span> <span id="s1358">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1359">He organized the Nazis, they’re going to come.</span> <span id="s1360">Well most [indecipherable] lives in Skokie, maybe 20 percent live there, 80 wa -- they decided that’s not Europe, here we’re going to fight back.</span> <span id="s1361">But the police surrounded them, you know, they want to talk.</span> <span id="s1362">So we organized ourself, everybody come with stones, in the [indecipherable] and we start to throw stones.</span> <span id="s1363">They ran away, they didn’t have a chance [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q: You’re talking about -- I think this was about what, 20 years or so ago, when --</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">A: Fifteen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">Q: -- a local group of Nazis --</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">A: About fifteen years, I think --</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">Q: -- right, was marching in -- in Skokie.</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">A: -- yeah, so -- yeah, yeah, no, they couldn’t come in here.</span> <span id="s1370">Yeah, they couldn’t come in here, because here lives refugee, and they says here we live in a free country, we not -- we not going to let them do it.</span> <span id="s1371">And they did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">Q: So, did you throw stones?</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1374">I came with all my friends.</span> <span id="s1375">Whole packets of them.</span> <span id="s1376">They ran away, the police ran away.</span> <span id="s1377">They was afraid they’re going to be killed here, yeah.</span> <span id="s1378">In Europe you couldn’t do that, but here we could do it.</span> <span id="s1379">That’s the difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: Did you -- did you yell at them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">A: No, it -- we threw stone -- they was far away, you know, they put up a pla -- they got so many stones, they ran away with the light.</span> <span id="s1382">They would be killed if they stand up to throw, that was sure.</span> <span id="s1383">He was arrested, that guy, later on, because he was a gay man, or something.</span> <span id="s1384">So he was arrested, I -- I think he’s still in jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">Q: How many stones did you throw?</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">A: A lot.</span> <span id="s1387">A lot.</span> <span id="s1388">We took -- filled pocket.</span> <span id="s1389">All my neighbors came.</span> <span id="s1390">I don’t think one refugee remain in the house in that time.</span> <span id="s1391">I didn’t live here in that time, I live in [indecipherable] Park.</span> <span id="s1392">But we all came here, and we was waiting for them.</span> <span id="s1393">And wis -- we organized ourself in -- you know, in the shuls, and here and there, they’re not going to take -- let them take care of us here.</span> <span id="s1394">That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">Q: After s -- and then they ran away?</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">A: Oh, they ran away.</span> <span id="s1397">They didn’t come back any more.</span> <span id="s1398">They knew they going to be killed if they come here, that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: So when you were heaving rocks at them or whatever --</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">A: Yeah, a lot of rocks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">Q: Did it feel good?</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">A: Yes, it makes me feel good.</span> <span id="s1403">Here you could speak up, and we do something.</span> <span id="s1404">In Poland we couldn’t do nothing.</span> <span id="s1405">With the Germans, we couldn’t do nothing.</span> <span id="s1406">They have the ammunition, we have nothing.</span> <span id="s1407">But a lot of Jewish people fought in there, in the woods, and all over, they fought.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Q: Do you follow things in the news?</span> <span id="s1409">Like, for instance, now, in the last few months, there’s been the war in Serbia, and Kosovo, and all that, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1411">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1412">I follow all the time the news.</span> <span id="s1413">I want to tell you something.</span> <span id="s1414">I am really surprised that even one Jew remains in Europe.</span> <span id="s1415">They had a chance to go to Israel, to South America, here.</span> <span id="s1416">Not one Jew -- because always wars over there, especially against the Jews.</span> <span id="s1417">If the economy du -- is not good, it’s the Jew’s fault.</span> <span id="s1418">Like in Russia now.</span> <span id="s1419">If the economy, the Jews -- the Jews, all the Jews, it’s all their fault.</span> <span id="s1420">They shouldn’t remain there.</span> <span id="s1421">They have no business.</span> <span id="s1422">I know they di -- the JUF tried to help him -- take him, whatever they do, but they had [indecipherable] they had no business to be in Europe.</span> <span id="s1423">After the second war, nobody should remain in Europe, that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">Q: So, the United States, and the NATO countries, they intervened in Kosovo.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">Q: And one of the reasons that people like President Clinton have said --</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">Q: -- that they have done it is that they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">Q: -- you know, cannot permit this kind of atrocity to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">Q: When you -- when you see this happen today --</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">Q: -- does it make you think about --</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">Q: -- all those years ago, and why nothing happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">A: Yeah, no -- nobody, no.</span> <span id="s1438">Nobody, no, nobody.</span> <span id="s1439">Roosevelt was a big anti-Semite, he didn’t let the Jews come to talk to him.</span> <span id="s1440">They knew what’s going on very well, but they didn’t -- because they only killed Jews, it’s all right.</span> <span id="s1441">The government didn’t do -- they turned back a boat, and the people commit suicide.</span> <span id="s1442">That’s -- that’s how they help.</span> <span id="s1443">Now, it’s like that.</span> <span id="s1444">After the second World War, they fought against the Germans, the other side.</span> <span id="s1445">He’s a bad guy, but he fought against the German.</span> <span id="s1446">The others cooperate with hi -- with Hitler.</span> <span id="s1447">But I don’t like to see people be killed by -- like one lady says her father was a teacher, they took him out -- I don’t like to see people to go in and go out from the house, otherwise you get killed, the young people get killed.</span> <span id="s1448">I don’t care about the war, but I don’t like to see it.</span> <span id="s1449">And I’m glad that the world wake up.</span> <span id="s1450">Came an Englishman on television, he -- he’s not even 30 years old, he said, the politicians have plenty on their -- on their conscience what they didn’t do on the second World War, now they woke up, finally, and a lot of people slaughter.</span> <span id="s1451">At least they gave them a help.</span> <span id="s1452">Us, we just went to the gas chambers, nobody raise a finger, nothing.</span> <span id="s1453">The trains was going day and night, nobody helped us.</span> <span id="s1454">If they ran to the woods, they was killed by the Polish people, too.</span> <span id="s1455">So I’m glad when I see that, I’m glad what I see that, yes.</span> <span id="s1456">They rise up and -- and -- and they do something about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">Q: Do you think that -- especially I think in the last 10 or 15 years, there’s been a lot more talk, a lot more -- more films, documentaries, books, whatever, about the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">Q: More people talking about it, do you think that that has had any affect on things like, you know, them intervening Kosovo now, that it’s a result of -- of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">A: Yeah, I thi -- yeah, people speak up now, which they didn’t speak for many years, and I’m gl -- I am glad, because lot -- how long we going to be on this earth?</span> <span id="s1461">People are 75 - 76.</span> <span id="s1462">People are dying every -- here, just in Skokie, three of the people -- three of the refugees die already.</span> <span id="s1463">I went to a meeting.</span> <span id="s1464">People are dying, wouldn’t be nobody to tell the stories.</span> <span id="s1465">I’m glad that they -- I went to Washington with -- was thinking about building a museum, in that time the beginning, and I was very happy that the -- the result is good.</span> <span id="s1466">I’m very happy to see that.</span> <span id="s1467">But a future generation, they should stand up, and not let a -- something like that happen, because never, never in the history happen what’s happened in the Jews, in the second World War.</span> <span id="s1468">Something like that never happened before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: Have you ever gotten -- some of the people I interview, they get calls from schools or whatever --</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: -- to come -- come and talk to our class --</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">Q: -- about what happened, whatev -- do you ever get any of those calls, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">A: No, I’m not really a speaker, you know.</span> <span id="s1475">I don’t think I’d ma -- I think I -- I -- I n -- I can’t do that, I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">Q: Well, you’re doing okay here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1478">Maybe are people more qualified, you know, to do those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">Q: But you haven’t been -- no one’s ever asked you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">Q: If some teacher did call you, and say, why d -- I heard about you somehow, would you come and talk to my class, would you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">A: Yeah, yeah, if they ask me, I probably will.</span> <span id="s1483">Yes, if they ask me, I probably.</span> <span id="s1484">I tell you, I went to a lecture after the war, I don’t remember the name of the guy, and he says like that, there isn't enough paper yink -- paper and ink, to put down what’s happened in the second World War.</span> <span id="s1485">No matter how many book, that’s impossible.</span> <span id="s1486">It’s just impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">Q: We --</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">A: The people have to dig their own graves, you know, near Russia, where the -- the people have to dig their own graves, and jump in, and they -- and they shot them.</span> <span id="s1489">They enjoy it, they’re very sadistic people.</span> <span id="s1490">They used to take babies, and throw in the air, and shot them like birds.</span> <span id="s1491">They very sadistic people, the German.</span> <span id="s1492">And I still think they still are.</span> <span id="s1493">I don’t believe them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: You don’t think they’ve changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">A: I wasn’t -- I was mad when they took away the wall from -- End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Lonia Mosak.</span> <span id="s1497">This is tape number two, side B.</span> <span id="s1498">We --</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">A: The people have to dig their own graves, you know, near Russia, where the -- the people have to dig their own graves, and jump in, and they -- and they shot them.</span> <span id="s1500">They enjoy it, they’re very sadistic people.</span> <span id="s1501">They used to take babies, and throw in the air, and shot them like birds.</span> <span id="s1502">They very sadistic people, the German.</span> <span id="s1503">And I still think they still are.</span> <span id="s1504">I don’t believe them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">Q: You don’t think they’ve changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">A: I wasn’t -- I was mad when they took away the wall from Germany, you know, they have a dividing wall with the Russian, put up a wall, East Germany.</span> <span id="s1507">They should never take away the wall.</span> <span id="s1508">I saw a woman came on television from England, and she said that was -- that wall should never be taken away, it was a protection for certain -- for other walls.</span> <span id="s1509">A security, like they say, a security blanket.</span> <span id="s1510">They should never take away the wall, made the Germans strong again.</span> <span id="s1511">Because the -- Germany is the richest country in the world.</span> <span id="s1512">They took away everybody from the people.</span> <span id="s1513">If you have a gold teeth in your mouth, they took out.</span> <span id="s1514">If you have a watch, if you have a ring, di -- everything took away.</span> <span id="s1515">They’re going to have for generation, generation, what they have.</span> <span id="s1516">They robbed the whole yeero, the bank, everything, they took over everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1518">So you don’t like the notion of Germany getting stronger?</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1520">They should never ta -- I was always against -- they took away -- and a lot of people come on television, English people, fame -- that said no, that was a big mistake.</span> <span id="s1521">They should be never strong, because they start two World Wars already.</span> <span id="s1522">And you never know the future.</span> <span id="s1523">You know how anti-Semitic they are now?</span> <span id="s1524">When they ga -- they organized themselve?</span> <span id="s1525">They admire Hitler, and everything.</span> <span id="s1526">They didn’t have a lesson.</span> <span id="s1527">This -- and a lot of them got big government jobs, but they were in -- in the Gestapo, and they change their name, they got bi-big jobs there.</span> <span id="s1528">How can you trust these people?</span> <span id="s1529">I would never trust them.</span> <span id="s1530">They -- they came in, a German, to my house, we weren’t rich.</span> <span id="s1531">He told me to open up the drawers, he want to take away everything.</span> <span id="s1532">I says, here is, take this, take this, take -- he says, “No.</span> <span id="s1533">Where did you -- where did you stack your better stuff?”</span> <span id="s1534">I said we were not rich, we didn’t have any better stuff.</span> <span id="s1535">So he says, “You know, I was here in the first World War.</span> <span id="s1536">They chased us out in this country, but this time we staying here forever.”</span> <span id="s1537">That’s how -- they was sure of themself.</span> <span id="s1538">They occupied whole Europe.</span> <span id="s1539">That’s how [indecipherable] that was a man maybe 60 years old.</span> <span id="s1540">He was in the first World War, they were sure, they were so hypnotized they were going to -- they going to counter the whole world.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">Q: Let’s just -- before we -- I’m --</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: -- I’m running out of questions, but before we --</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">Q: -- leave off, I just want to make sure -- we talked about how you got over here --</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">Q: -- and how you were working --</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">Q: -- and that you had children and all --</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">Q: -- and then we started talking about other things.</span> <span id="s1552">I mean, there’s a lot of years went by.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that’s for sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">Q: Any interesting things in there that you want to -- that you want to talk about, or mention?</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">A: Well, I’m glad I’m in this country, and I could build a life, and live a better life.</span> <span id="s1556">I’m -- I’m happy for that, that I could do it, you know?</span> <span id="s1557">Most of the people did it.</span> <span id="s1558">[indecipherable] they know they can’t depend on nobody, and they have to pick themself up, on straps like they say, and do it on their own, and this country give you an opportunity for that.</span> <span id="s1559">So I’m very grateful for that, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">Q: When you came over here, did you become a citizen right away?</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">A: No, it takes five years.</span> <span id="s1562">I didn’t know the language then.</span> <span id="s1563">We have to -- we went to night school, we went to school, we learned the language.</span> <span id="s1564">Five years later we became citizens, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">Q: What -- did you have different activities, or hobbies, or what would you do for fun, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s1567">Oh yes, we -- we organized ourself.</span> <span id="s1568">We got organizations in the newcomers.</span> <span id="s1569">Yeah, I was -- last week -- I’m going next week to the -- how you call it, the new citizen -- we call it the new citizen, B’nai Brith, the -- all this, have meeting once a month, if you -- I always attend those meetings, we always go there.</span> <span id="s1570">We organized themselves, yeah, all the time.</span> <span id="s1571">We stay together, like the refugees stay together all the time, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1573">Were you -- before the war, were you very religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">A: Well, my parents was very religious, I was more progressive.</span> <span id="s1575">I belonged to a Zionist organization, they called the Shemiratsier.</span> <span id="s1576">They was not that religious.</span> <span id="s1577">Traditional, but not religious, not like that.</span> <span id="s1578">Like, you couldn’t take a pencil, write on Saturday, or do things like that, ride a bike.</span> <span id="s1579">We did it, we did those things, yeah.</span> <span id="s1580">But in they -- in the same time, the older peoples in the organization was well educated, so they teach us, we got courses, all kind of courses, book reviews.</span> <span id="s1581">Was very interesting, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">Q: Did that cause any problems with your parents, that you were in this sort of progressive group --</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">A: No, I di -- I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">Q: -- and they were more religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">A: They didn’t like it, they didn’t like it, but we did our own way, yeah.</span> <span id="s1586">They didn’t like it, but in the house we were religious, I didn’t do nothing t -- against them.</span> <span id="s1587">But when we went out with the group, or we ride a bike, they didn’t know about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">Q: With all you, you know, lived through during the war --</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">Q: -- and everything you saw, did that change the way you thought about God, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">A: Yeah, it did change, but I want to tell you something.</span> <span id="s1592">We didn’t believe in God when we was in Auschwitz, when we saw what’s going on, but when I come to this country, and I have children, you sti -- you have to hang up the little tradition.</span> <span id="s1593">It gives you a little, you know, there a lot of things what’s going bad in life.</span> <span id="s1594">There are sickness, all -- you have to hang up with something.</span> <span id="s1595">So I decided we should hang up to something, and believe in God.</span> <span id="s1596">It’s a little bit easier, the life is easier.</span> <span id="s1597">But you get very sick, oy God should I get bet -- should I get better, maybe I’ll get out of it.</span> <span id="s1598">So you always mention that.</span> <span id="s1599">But deep in hearts, people didn’t believe it, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">Q: In Auschwitz, you say, people didn’t believe --</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q: -- did you believe before you went to the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">A: Yeah, before yeah, but not after that, when I saw, no.</span> <span id="s1604">No, nobody believed in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">Q: Why did you feel that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">A: Because we couldn’t see the young [indecipherable] the young kids, and crying, and people go to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s1607">That’s wasn’t -- there is something could control that, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1608">The Germans used to tease us, “You see what we have on our buckle?</span> <span id="s1609">God is with us, not with you.”</span> <span id="s1610">That’s what they told us.</span> <span id="s1611">And when the airplanes start to circle in Auschwitz, and we was looking, they said, “What are you looking for?</span> <span id="s1612">12 -- 12 -- 12 o’clock, the world will be -- all be -- you’ll be killed 15 minute before 12.</span> <span id="s1613">That was their intention to do.</span> <span id="s1614">If the world wouldn’t come to an end, another year or two, nobody would survive, no way.</span> <span id="s1615">How long can you starve like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">Q: So in the camp you decided there’s no God.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">A: No, that’s something --</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">Q: Then when you have kids, you feel like well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">Q: -- you know, you should hang onto some tradition.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">A: Yeah, that’s was mine idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">Q: -- but does that mean -- does that mean you started to believe in God again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">A: Well, yes.</span> <span id="s1624">Maybe, maybe yes.</span> <span id="s1625">I wanted the kids to have a traditions.</span> <span id="s1626">I f -- I felt the holidays and everything, just like my parents did, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">Q: Mm-hm, but is it just, you know, you want the tradition, or you -- I’m -- I’m just trying to get, did --</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">Q: -- do you believe there is a God now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">A: Now I believe it, yes, now I believe it, even though in that time I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1631">When you see bad things happen, you don’t believe.</span> <span id="s1632">Then you change your mind, maybe there is something, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">Q: But then, where was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">A: Yeah, that’s what we ask, our questions, all the time.</span> <span id="s1635">Even the religious people in the camp, women, they were very religious.</span> <span id="s1636">But now, when I come to Florida, and I sit on the bench near the ocean, and I see a lot of men with long beards, with numbers, they very religious, and they suffered during the war, but they very religious now.</span> <span id="s1637">They said, “Thanks God I wasn’t a German, I didn’t have too good a job.”</span> <span id="s1638">That’s what they tell me.</span> <span id="s1639">Because I talk to -- when I see a number, I go over, talk to them.</span> <span id="s1640">[indecipherable] this thing.</span> <span id="s1641">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">Q: Do you -- you have to actually --</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">Q: -- press that button.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">Q: Do you think that there is any answer that can explain the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">A: No, no, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1648">Did -- people didn’t foresee that.</span> <span id="s1649">There was a lot of young men, if they knew what’s coming, they would do something, they would go in the woods, and run.</span> <span id="s1650">Nobody forseed it, because the Germans was lying to us.</span> <span id="s1651">They told us we just going to take -- take another place for war.</span> <span id="s1652">They was lying.</span> <span id="s1653">Then they open up atellager in Auschwitz, or they took in kids like in a kindergarten, and all the thing -- they promise them all in the world, you see, if the Red Cross come, we have kids here, we have good -- everything was covered up, like in Theresienstadt, too.</span> <span id="s1654">And then they took the people to -- to -- the -- the people was fighting [indecipherable] bare naked.</span> <span id="s1655">They says, “You promised us, we [indecipherable] why you do it to us?”</span> <span id="s1656">So they was beaten up over the head.</span> <span id="s1657">They didn’t have it what to fight.</span> <span id="s1658">That was before the Russians came in, took away those people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">Q: So, do you think it was just this tremendous evil, and there was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">Q: -- there’s no other explanation, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1663">A lot of people I know, from mine town, intelligent people, they belong to a Socialist organization before the war, they came to Auschwitz, and they went to the electric wire.</span> <span id="s1664">They said, “In a world like that, we don’t have to live.</span> <span id="s1665">It’s no use.</span> <span id="s1666">Doesn’t pay to live in a world like that, we all going to be killed anyway.”</span> <span id="s1667">And they were big organizers, bele -- believe in Socialism and all these things.</span> <span id="s1668">Very intelligent people, and that’s what they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">Q: Could you tell us again about when you were in Bialystok?</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">A: Yeah, that -- I was in Bialystok, yeah.</span> <span id="s1671">That’s where the police brought us, and ammunition, I have to learn how to use a gun to defend ourself, because he told us it’s going to be a pogrom there.</span> <span id="s1672">And you know why, they told us.</span> <span id="s1673">A lot of women put their babies to Polish families.</span> <span id="s1674">Let’s say a brother, a nephew, survived the war in Russia, they came back for the child, the child was already five, six years old, the child didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s1675">So they steal the kids out.</span> <span id="s1676">They came in the uniform, and they took them by force, to the German border, into Israel.</span> <span id="s1677">So they decided the people killed their kids, to have blood for matzos at Passover.</span> <span id="s1678">They right away have an excuse, you know.</span> <span id="s1679">And that’s when they brought in ammunition, we should defend -- we can do nothing, it’s going to be a pogrom here.</span> <span id="s1680">That’s when I took my brother, went to Warsaw, and I know that the Bricha is waiting for the people, to take them across the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1682">So you -- you left Bialystok at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">A: Yeah, then they come after us, too.</span> <span id="s1684">Little by little, they all left.</span> <span id="s1685">There was no place to stay there now, any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">A: The life was in danger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">Q: While you’ve been living in this country, d -- have you -- do you travel much, just even on vacations go overseas, or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">A: Well, I used to go with my daughter together, and I go to Florida with my friends.</span> <span id="s1690">That’s how far it’s going.</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1692">Did you ever make any trips to any part of Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">A: No, I wouldn’t go back there, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">Q: Not any part?</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">A: No.</span> <span id="s1696">I hate those people, I don’t want to see those faces.</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1698">I think that’s about it for any of my questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">Q: Is there anything that we didn’t talk about, or that you want to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">A: What can I add?</span> <span id="s1702">I told you the whole story.</span> <span id="s1703">I’m -- I’m happy that I’m here.</span> <span id="s1704">I got a chance to make money, and build up a -- to have a nice place to live.</span> <span id="s1705">I’m still work, I like to work.</span> <span id="s1706">I’m very lucky to have two daughters, two children, you know?</span> <span id="s1707">And grandchildren, that’s -- I’m very lucky, which I never dream of that.</span> <span id="s1708">We never dreamed that we going to ever live freely.</span> <span id="s1709">Every day I get up, and I says to myself, “I can’t believe it, I’m free, that I can do whatever I want, I got what to eat.”</span> <span id="s1710">We always think about that, never goes away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">Q: You know one thing I was wondering about is --</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">Q: -- your story, and in fact, every other person I’ve talked to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">Q: -- they talk so much about the food, and how there wasn’t food, and if you got a potato, or an extra piece of bread, or something like that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">A: Yeah, yeah, that was the life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">Q: -- does that -- do you still have sort of a special --</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">A: Yeah, I -- I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">Q: -- feeling about food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">A: Yeah, I can’t see people throw away food.</span> <span id="s1721">That wi -- that hurts me terrible.</span> <span id="s1722">Because there’s still people in the world what is starving now, still.</span> <span id="s1723">No, I can never throw away food.</span> <span id="s1724">No, I -- I think I commit a crime if I throw out food, because I remember how hungry we was.</span> <span id="s1725">We was only -- when we was in Auschwitz, we only have one pray in our life, to have a whole bread, and cut as much as we want.</span> <span id="s1726">We didn’t think about a -- a bed clean, our clothes, nothing exists in your head, only if to have a bread, and to cut as much as you wanted.</span> <span id="s1727">Before the war finished, the German used to di-divided our bread for four.</span> <span id="s1728">Later, they didn’t do that, they gave us small pumpernickel for 10, you got to divide it for yourself.</span> <span id="s1729">So a lot of groups fight over that, there was -- not mine group, mine group was very generous, and we made it every day somebody else will take the end of the bread.</span> <span id="s1730">But we got along, everybody took a little slice over 24 hour.</span> <span id="s1731">But other people was fighting, and killing each other.</span> <span id="s1732">They making little scale, and try to weigh the bread, and this and that.</span> <span id="s1733">We didn’t do that.</span> <span id="s1734">I was with my own people, with my own friends, so we didn’t do this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">Q: So now you can eat as much as you want --</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">Q: -- anything you want.</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">A: Now we’re afraid to eat.</span> <span id="s1739">You got cholesterol, you got this.</span> <span id="s1740">Yeah, but I -- I can’t see throwing away food, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s1742">When you’re --</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">A: I always think about it, some people are still hungry in this world.</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">Q: When you go to the grocery store, do you think about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">A: Yes, I buy -- I don’t buy too much, because I don’t want to throw away.</span> <span id="s1746">I only buy a little, because it hurts me if I have to throw away food.</span> <span id="s1747">I -- I couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s1748">For six years, you know, starving.</span> <span id="s1749">Six years.</span> <span id="s1750">Even one hour when a person is hungry is bad.</span> <span id="s1751">When we were standing by our selection, if you were skinny, you have no chance to live, the German hate skinny people.</span> <span id="s1752">But the women got an idea to drink a lot of water, as a -- have a big stomach.</span> <span id="s1753">So we fooled the Germans, oh you got a big stomach, you -- you still be able to work.</span> <span id="s1754">So we fooled them, we make our cheeks red, to look better, you know.</span> <span id="s1755">We tried to fool them this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">Q: Now, all the -- all the young people today, everybody wants to be skinny, everyone wants to be thin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">A: Yeah, oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s1758">Over there if you’re skinny, even a man, in the man’s camp, a skinny person have no chance to survive, they hate skinny people.</span> <span id="s1759">They gave them a name, musselman, that’s a -- musselman, the -- you’re skinny, you have no right to live.</span> <span id="s1760">And I was chubby, that saved my life, too.</span> <span id="s1761">I was always chubby.</span> <span id="s1762">You know, Europe, you give the kids to eat.</span> <span id="s1763">If you’re skinny they thought you are handicapped.</span> <span id="s1764">So every mother pushed the food to her kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">Q: I believe you said earlier -- you mentioned having grandchildren?</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">A: Yeah, I have four grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1767">Each girl --</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">Q: How -- how old are they, what are their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">A: Oh, oh.</span> <span id="s1770">My oldest is Jennifer, she one more year at college to finish.</span> <span id="s1771">The boy going to be 16 the 27th of June, he’s a high school.</span> <span id="s1772">My other daughter have a girl, she’s going 16, and 13, going to have a Bar Mitzvah in October.</span> <span id="s1773">I’ve got four grandchildren, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">Q: And their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">A: Their name?</span> <span id="s1776">Jennifer from this daughter, and Bradley the other name, and Alila, and Cammy.</span> <span id="s1777">Yeah, they’re the four grandchildren, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1779">Well, I think that’s about it for my questions, if [indecipherable] any --</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">A: Yeah, I went to Israel for the Bar Mitzvah -- for the Bas Mitzvah, twice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">A: We went with my daughter to Israel for that, yeah.</span> <span id="s1783">Yeah, I’m very devoted to Israel.</span> <span id="s1784">I would do anything for Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">Q: Okay, well if there’s nothing else you want to add --</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">Q: -- then I guess that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">A: One of my cousins, she die here -- on the way to Japan, you know.</span> <span id="s1789">But she die here in the war.</span> <span id="s1790">So he left me 2,000 dollars.</span> <span id="s1791">So I gave thousand dollars for Israel for scholarship, and thousand dollars for the museum.</span> <span id="s1792">They need it more than I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">Q: Well, listen, thanks for taking all this time this afternoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">A: Yes, thank you for interviewing me, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">Q: My pleasure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">A: I -- I not too many time talk about these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">A: No, never, I never really talk about it.</span> <span id="s1799">Sometime w-we get together with my friends, we talk a little bit about it, and sometimes some of them don’t want to even hear about it, “Oy, you make me sick, please don’t talk about it.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">Q: So, well we’ve been talking about it for almost two hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">Q: So how’s that make you feel now, do you feel better somehow, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">A: No, I feel better that it’s going to be on paper, and it’s going to be a document for the future generation.</span> <span id="s1804">So that’s how it makes me feel good.</span> <span id="s1805">I don’t mind how many times I get interviewed, really.</span> <span id="s1806">That doesn’t bother me.</span> <span id="s1807">You know, a lot of people -- of my friend can’t talk, they get very sick, they don’t want to hear about it.</span> <span id="s1808">They have heart trouble here, they have high blood pressure, they didn’t want to be interview at all.</span> <span id="s1809">I couldn’t convince them, but most of them I did convince, yeah.</span> <span id="s1810">It’s very hard for some people to talk, you know, it’s very hard.</span> <span id="s1811">Maybe I am strong in my nature, you know?</span> <span id="s1812">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">Q: Well, you’re not talking into the microphone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1815">So I’m mar -- I talk about it, you know, if I have a chance, but my friends, a lot of them get sick, they don’t want to hear about it.</span> <span id="s1816">So if I see a film, they show something, I’m very happy.</span> <span id="s1817">I went to see a film last year, “In Our Hands,” how the -- the Israeli society and the English army, you know, but not on the Israeli [indecipherable] that they shouldn’t tell, but to the end, they raise up, and they says, “We going to fight our own flag.”</span> <span id="s1818">And then they mentioned how they took out the people from Poland, that group, but I was glad to see that, you know, a lot of people don’t know about it.</span> <span id="s1819">Some of them don’t know about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">Q: Which group are you talking about now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">A: The Bricha, from Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">Q:

still there in Israel, yeah.</span> <span id="s1825">They did a lot, whatever they could, you know?</span> <span id="s1826">Actually, we very proud to have our own country in Israel, and we should always support them.</span> <span id="s1827">We see what’s happened when we don’t have a country.</span> <span id="s1828">Now Israel go to every corner of the world where Jewish are in trouble, they take them out, they help them.</span> <span id="s1829">We didn’t have it bef -- before, in the second World War.</span> <span id="s1830">Nobody could help us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">Q: Well
