This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mr. Allan Jaffee, on May 21st, 2016, in Manhattan, New York.</span> <span id="s12">Thank you very much Mr. Jaffee, for agreeing to meet with us today, to share part of your story, to let us into a world that is no longer there, and in this way to kind of leave for the future, a picture of what once was.</span> <span id="s13">We much appreciate it.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Answer: Well, I’m very happy to do this for the Holocaust Museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s16">I’m going to start with the most basic questions, and we’ll take the story from there.</span> <span id="s17">So please tell me – can you tell me the date of your birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: 3-13-21.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: So that would have been May 13th, 1921?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: March.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: March 13th.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: March 13th, 1921, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: ’21.</span> <span id="s24">And where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: I was born in Savannah, Georgia.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: And what was your name at birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: At birth my name was Abraham Jaffee.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s29">Tell me a little bit about how it came to be that you were born in Savannah, Georgia.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: The reason I was born in Savannah, Georgia was that there was a – a pawn shop in Savannah that was operated by a – a – an elderly Jewish man, and he wanted to have somebody take over for him in the – you know, the daily duties.</span> <span id="s31">So he sent word out to New York that he would be prepared to move a Jewish couple down to Savannah and get them lodging, if the – the man in the family would take over the running of the pawn shop.</span> <span id="s32">And he interviewed my father, and he felt my father was qualified, and my father had recently been married to my mother, who came over from Lithuania to – I think she was encouraged to come over to meet my father, but I wasn’t there, so I don’t know anything about that.</span> <span id="s33">Anyway, they did get married and go – and went down to Savannah, and s-so that’s where I was born, and my three younger siblings were born there, too.</span> <span id="s34">Eventually the pawn shop turned into a large department store, and my father became the manager of the department store.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: Ah, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: And i – the – you know, and our life in Savannah was quite interesting and exciting.</span> <span id="s37">As a young child, I remember adventures in Savannah that – that I really cherish.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Well, I’m going to get – want to explore some of those, but right now I’d like to talk a little bit more about your immediate family.</span> <span id="s39">You anticipated one of my questions, which is, did you have any siblings.</span> <span id="s40">And so you did, and it sounds like you were the oldest of the – of the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: Yes, I had three siblings, and I was the oldest, and sadly I’ve outlived them all.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Oh dear.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: It’s – some of them died fairly young.</span> <span id="s44">Two of them actually contracted illnesses in Lithuania during the very severe winters that we experienced there.</span> <span id="s45">One of them had spinal meningitis, which –</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: Wow, wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: – did not affect his life, other than it was a great shock to us to find out that –he was just a little baby – well, not a baby, but he was about two years old, or so, and – or three.</span> <span id="s48">And after he – he recovered from the spinal meningitis, we discovered that he could no longer hear anything.</span> <span id="s49">So he became a deaf mute.</span> <span id="s50">But he – he –</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Bernard.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: And when was he born?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: You know, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: I – I don’t know the birthdays of anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s58">That’s okay.</span> <span id="s59">I ask, but if it – and if it’s there, it’s fine –</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: – and if it’s not – it’s just to –</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: – it’s just to get a sense of –</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Yeah,, I wish I knew all these things, but since our family was pretty much broken up with all the trips back and forth, and my father losing his job as – as a consequence of these interruptions in our lives, we didn’t have family affairs like birthday parties, and – and celebrations.</span> <span id="s65">I mean, it was just get what you could get out of life, you know, so that’s why I don’t – I really don’t – I – I never put much store in anyone remembering my birthday, or – or me remembering theirs.</span> <span id="s66">In any case, he did – he did grow up as a deaf mute, and worked, and had a family, and had a – a reasonably successful life.</span> <span id="s67">My brother David, the youngest, was actually spirited out of Lithuania as the Nazis were invading.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: We’ll come to that.</span> <span id="s69">Right now I just – I’m sorry that I interrupt.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: Yes, that’s all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: But right now what I want to get a sense of is just who your family – the names of the people, a little bit about your parents and so on.</span> <span id="s72">So when we come to chronologically, let’s say 1939, 1941 –</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: – things like that, then we – we’ll explore some of these important parts of their lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: So right now we have you as the oldest, then who was the next brother in line?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Harry.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Harry.</span> <span id="s81">And then –</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Bernard –</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Bernard.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: – and David.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Okay, and how many years were there between you?</span> <span id="s86">I mean, were you very much an older brother, or were they close to you in age?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: We were approximately – we – each one of us was separated from the next one by a year and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Wow, close.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Pretty close.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Very close.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s93">Tell me –</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: And I suspect that my mother took us all to Lithuania so she wouldn’t become pregnant again.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: That’s a rather drastic trip, you know, a lot of distance.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: Well, my father stayed in America, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s98">Well, we’ll come to that.</span> <span id="s99">But let’s now stop with your – no, not stop, but turn to your mother and your father.</span> <span id="s100">Tell me your mother’s full name and maiden name, if – if you have it.</span> <span id="s101">What was her first name, and her – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Her first name was – the English version was Mildred.</span> <span id="s103">In – i-in the – in Jewish it was Miechla(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Miechla(ph), mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Yeah, but it became Mildred in – in – in English.</span> <span id="s106">My father’s name was Moishe, but which became Morris, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Were they first generation immigrants to the United States?</span> <span id="s108">Had they –</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Yes, they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: First to general – first generation.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: And where did your fa – you said your mother came from Lithuania.</span> <span id="s113">Where did your father come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: The same town they – as a matter of fact, it was at my father’s urging that my mother’s sister, who was here in America, negotiated to have my mother brought over for my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: Oh, as a potential bride?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: I see, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: They may have had contact in Zarasai.</span> <span id="s119">I’m not sure, because eventually our family got so separated, that with all the trips and spending time first with both parents, then with one parent, you know, you lose a lot of –</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Yeah, of course.</span> <span id="s121">It sounds like chaos.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: So y – both parents are from Lithuania, from the same town.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: They’ve come over to the United States, your father first.</span> <span id="s126">Did he have siblings, by the way, your father?</span> <span id="s127">Did he come from a larger family?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Yes, he came from a large family, and curiously, considering what I mentioned earlier, as just an observation, my father was very angry at his father, because he – his – his mother was pregnant all the time, and he had a – a large number of siblings.</span> <span id="s129">So, it’s ironic in a way that I – I think that maybe my mother felt the way he felt.</span> <span id="s130">But i-it wa – it was really not unco-uncommon at – in those days for large families –</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: – to grow and grow and grow.</span> <span id="s133">And of course my father loved his mother so much that she – she started to become sickly with all the work attendant to having lots of children, that I think he felt like that – that – like, you know, a lot of children felt, that as they got more and more siblings, and their mothers were being –</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Worn down.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: – worn out –</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: – they worried about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: So – but my mother’s family, there were a lot of siblings also.</span> <span id="s140">Some remained in Lithuania, and some went to Russia, and two of them – two of my mother’s siblings went to Russia and became doctors.</span> <span id="s141">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: In the tsarist times?</span> <span id="s143">During the tsarist regime?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: No, it was – it was probably the Soviet.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Yeah, because during the tsarist regime, everyone was fleeing, I d – from what I’ve heard, and I – I have no reason to know whether it’s true or not.</span> <span id="s147">They mainly feared being in the tsarist military, and being sent to fight in Japan, or some – you know, strange place in the world.</span> <span id="s148">So tha-that was the reason why a l – a lot of young Jews took off and emigrated.</span> <span id="s149">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: It’s a reason I also heard.</span> <span id="s151">Nobody wanted to fight in the tsarist army, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Nobody wanted to – particularly as it wasn’t their home and their fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Did your family always come from this part of the world?</span> <span id="s156">I mean, this is the [indecipherable] settlement, and a lot of Jews weren’t allowed to live in other places of the Russian empire.</span> <span id="s157">Do you know anything beyond th-the stories and the lives of your grandparents, of where they ca – their families came from, or does it pretty much start from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: I don’t know a-a – I don’t know where my grandparents came from.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: I – the only rumors that I heard as a child was that they – when they could, they escaped to Lithuania, and in fact, Lithuania is surrounded by lakes, and one of the thrilling stories that we cousins would talk about was that our various parents spent nights in the lakes, breathing through straws to avoid being recaptured by the Russian military people who were looking for – for the young men.</span> <span id="s161">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Can we cut for a second.</span> <span id="s163">[break] Rolling?</span> <span id="s164">We’re rolling.</span> <span id="s165">Okay.</span> <span id="s166">So – so Zarasai was surrounded by lakes, and you heard stories and rumors of some of the relatives staying underneath –</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: – breathing through straws, to not be captured.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: That’s – that – that’s – those are the stories I’ve heard when I was in Lithuania, and of course to me, these were very brave people with great adventures.</span> <span id="s170">And I was caught up in it, I – you know, as –</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: Of course, there’s great – they’re grand stories, and it’s very dramatic.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s173">And survival was really – you know, was a daily business.</span> <span id="s174">Whether it was a shortage of food, or – or you’re being persecuted by one group or another.</span> <span id="s175">My cousin Daniel, who is my age, and was very bright, he was so happy about the fact that Japan defeated tsarist troops.</span> <span id="s176">Oh, he celebrated, he had little soldiers, and he would play the Japanese knocking over the Russians.</span> <span id="s177">For some reason, tsarist Russia was very unpopular in the circles that I was in –</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: – which was predominantly Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Not all – not a hundred percent.</span> <span id="s182">My – my father figure was a Polish man.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: That’s Zarasai, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: That’s when you’re in Zarasai?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: When I was in Zarasai, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Hold that thought.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: We’ll get there.</span> <span id="s190">Right now though, I want to find more out – more about your parents, as personalities.</span> <span id="s191">What kind of a person was your father, what kind of a person was your mother?</span> <span id="s192">Can you tell me that, can you talk to me about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: I ca – I can tell you as much as I know about my parents, which is, considering our frequent separations, is limited.</span> <span id="s194">One thing I can tell you for certain is that both my parents had amazing senses of humor.</span> <span id="s195">Unfortunately, they didn’t deploy it all the time, because they were in a certain – in certain areas of conflict.</span> <span id="s196">My father disdained the religious community, my mother embraced it.</span> <span id="s197">So there was a –</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Tension.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: – there – and of course, when my father took me and my brothers out on a weekend trolley ride to some amusement park, he would buy us hot dogs, and he would say, do not tell your mother.</span> <span id="s200">You know, these were not kosher hot dogs.</span> <span id="s201">So – but as far as humor is concerned, my mother, when – when we – when we visited Lithuania, and I met her relatives, and friends of hers when she was a young girl, and they would say, oh, your mother, the greatest entertainer in the world.</span> <span id="s202">She could mimic people, and she could do skits about the tsar and the tsarina and – and e-everyone was rolling on the floor with laughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Is this a mother you knew?</span> <span id="s204">Did you recognize that?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: I – I – yes, she was very creative, and she was also very intelligent.</span> <span id="s206">I mean, she went to night school in America as soon as she arrived, to learn English.</span> <span id="s207">And she became so proficient at it, that she collected books, and she would read to us every night to go – when we were going to sleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: In English?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: In English.</span> <span id="s210">And even when we were in Lithuania, every day sh – almost, she would come to me and say, write to your father and tell him to send English books, because you need to keep up with your English.</span> <span id="s211">And she constantly corrected our grammar.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: I can remember so vividly, her look glaring at me and saying, who is her?</span> <span id="s214">You refer to me as your mother, not as her, or she.</span> <span id="s215">I mean, she – she was a stickler for –</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Propriety, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: – correctness.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: – yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: And it’s – it’s – has served me well, because I’ve written tons of material myself, and I – you know, I – I think I learned to speak properly because of her.</span> <span id="s220">When I returned from Lithuania, and they stuck me into classes that were younger than th –</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: – where the people were younger, I was skipped frequently, because I knew – I knew the stuff.</span> <span id="s223">My mother –</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: She made sure you didn’t lose the language.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s226">Read wonderful stories to us from English books.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: Now, at home in Savannah, that begs this question of what was the language you spoke to one another in?</span> <span id="s228">If English was something that was special, does that mean you spoke another language with one another?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: No, we spoke English en-entirely.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: No Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: No Yiddish whatsoever.</span> <span id="s232">When I – when we landed in Lithuania, it was first yi – I did hear some Yiddish.</span> <span id="s233">We had an – an elderly – not my aunt, but my mother’s aunt, and my mother would talk to her in Yiddish, and my Aunt Frieda would talk to my mother in Yiddish if she didn’t want us to understand what she was saying.</span> <span id="s234">So I heard Yiddish.</span> <span id="s235">I had no idea what it – any of – anything meant, except maybe a few simple words.</span> <span id="s236">But when I arrived in Lithuania I knew none of it, and – but I learned to speak it fluently.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s238">Now tell me a little bit about your dad.</span> <span id="s239">You said he also had a sense of humor, but he had a different value.</span> <span id="s240">He was not religious, whereas your mother was religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: What kind of a personality did he have?</span> <span id="s243">What do you remember from that?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: He – he was – I met people in Lithuania who would, when they heard who I was, and they remember going to school with my father would say, oh, your father was the smartest guy in the classroom.</span> <span id="s245">He also was – he became a well-known calligrapher.</span> <span id="s246">He could write a s – a Spencerian hand, that was – people used to ask him to fill out papers for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Wow, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: All self-taught.</span> <span id="s249">And he was an avaricious reader, but of newspapers –</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: – and magazines.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: What were the newspapers in your home in Savannah?</span> <span id="s253">What were the newspapers that he would read?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: Well, there was a local paper – papers, but I – I don’t remember the – the names of the papers.</span> <span id="s255">My only interest in those papers were the Sunday funnies, and the daily funnies as well.</span> <span id="s256">My brother Harry and I were crazy about the cartoons, because we were bo-both had art talent.</span> <span id="s257">And part of the art talent we had came from copying the cartoons from the newspaper strips, which were taught to us by our father.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s260">He would sit us down on a Sunday, and take out a large sheaf of white paper, and start drawing Jig – Maggie and Jiggs, and Dick Tracy, and all the car – cartoons of those days, and it was like magic to me and Harry, and we became professional artists, and – but my father was very good at it.</span> <span id="s261">He – I think that had he pursued it as a career, he could have succeeded.</span> <span id="s262">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: But isn’t that interesting, that he bequeathed to you – in some ways you se – you talk about sense of humor as something your parents both had, his talent in calligraphy, and how that translates to – to kind of fostering this – this drawing talent in young boys to – you know, copy the funnies out.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: That these are sort of like legacies in – in a way.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: Yes, they are.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Well, he – he was – he was, unfortunately, a beaten man.</span> <span id="s269">And that took a lot out of him.</span> <span id="s270">Took a lot of the fun out of him.</span> <span id="s271">And the reason he was beaten is that, because of his frustration at not being able to keep his family in America, my mother was constantly taking us to Lithuania, he lost his job because of that.</span> <span id="s272">He – the first time we went to Lithuania, h-he – he ga – he just took off from his job as manager of a department store, and spent months and months trying to get us to come back.</span> <span id="s273">And when he returned, of course the Great Depression struck, I think that was 1929, and his job was eliminated.</span> <span id="s274">And he – the only job he could get was in the post office, because he had veterans benefits.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: He fought in World War I?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: He was in World War I.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: Where did he fight?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: He was – he was captured by the Germans, and suffered terribly in World War I.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: And I remember I was so fascinated with World War I when I was a little boy, because there was still a lot of talk about it –</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: – there was a lot of – a lot of veterans around.</span> <span id="s283">And I would constantly say to my father, you know, typically, Daddy, tell me what you did in the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: And he – I’ll never forget his answer, it was always the same, I shot lions.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: Oh God.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: I said, Daddy, you didn’t go hunting for lions in the war.</span> <span id="s288">He says, oh, I did.</span> <span id="s289">The rest of them were shooting each other, but I was looking for lions.</span> <span id="s290">He didn’t want to talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: I later found out from his brother, my Uncle Harry that he was captured by the Germans.</span> <span id="s293">And Germany was not – did not have the Nazi –</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: – anti-Semitic attitude at that time, so he was not mistreated as a Jew, he was di – mistreated as – as an – as an – not only as an American, but by the fact that there was not enough food for the German people, the captive Americans were given no food at all.</span> <span id="s296">So he – he starved, and s – like they all did, all the captives.</span> <span id="s297">So, he didn’t want to talk about the war at all, but my Uncle Harry filled me in on the months and months and months that he lived in – in a – in hovels, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Was this when you were older that he filled you in on this?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Yes, when I was older.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: When my father was no longer alive, he told me.</span> <span id="s302">I think my father must have told his brother, d-don’t – don’t tell them about – you know, what –</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: People want to spare their children these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: They really do.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s307">He never wo – he never once mentioned a single thing about the war, and he would hide photographs of him in uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Yeah, I – I – I foun – I got some sent to me by relatives, cousins of mine who inherited photographs from their mothers, and their mothers were sisters of my father.</span> <span id="s310">And there he was, looking very, very snappy in – in a doughboy uniform.</span> <span id="s311">I think I included a picture in the book, if I – but I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s313">But what di – I mean, in some ways, for someone who doesn’t want to talk about it, what a charming answer he gave you, you know.</span> <span id="s314">I was shooting lions.</span> <span id="s315">And so you have to go on that tread – on that thread of, no Daddy, you weren’t, it can’t be that way.</span> <span id="s316">Oh, yes I was, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Yeah, it wa –</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: – and he’s distracted you from the real question.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: Well, he distracted us and he entertained us.</span> <span id="s320">He took me and my brother Harry to all kinds of wonderful places, in and around Savannah.</span> <span id="s321">He took us to an airport to see airplanes doing their stunts.</span> <span id="s322">You have to remember that these are little – they look like model airplanes.</span> <span id="s323">And we were overjoyed.</span> <span id="s324">And of course, again, the admonition, don’t tell your mother what I bought for you to eat, you know, cause it’s not kosher.</span> <span id="s325">But – and he took us to merry-go-rounds, and loop-de-loops, and you know, all kinds of –</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Fun things.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: – fun things.</span> <span id="s328">He – on his day off, he was wonderful.</span> <span id="s329">By the way, one of the things that was thrown at him when he was fired, was hi-his children’s destructiveness.</span> <span id="s330">He used to invite me and Harry – Harry and me – I hear my mother correcting me – to the toy department of the big department store, and give us leave to play with the toys.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Oh my goodness.</span> <span id="s332">Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Well, we broke them, and we did all kinds of terrible things, which my father told us not to worry about, he will pay for it.</span> <span id="s334">But just the same, they threw that up against – to my father when he was being let – let go.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: He sounds like a very doting father.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: He was.</span> <span id="s337">He would lie on the floor, copying those cartoons half the Sunday, you know, we – and he took us to the park, and introduced us to this – the friends he made in the park, and you know, h-he – he – and he bought us candies, and he did buy us hot dogs, cause we begged for it.</span> <span id="s338">And candied apples.</span> <span id="s339">You know, he wa – he was – he was a good daddy, and we loved going places with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: So what happened at home?</span> <span id="s341">Was home life tense because yo – you – your – we’re going to come to that part when you’re leaving, but did they get along, as far as you knew, your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: They seemed to get along, but there were little problems that from – from a child’s point of view – and you have to remember that I’m six years old, five or six years old – my mother would complain about how much work there is to do.</span> <span id="s343">You know, typical – you have a lot of children, and you – you – you’re tired, and you complain.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: And my father would take charge, and he’d hire an African American lady – where he got her, I don’t know, be – probably by asking questions.</span> <span id="s346">He was very friendly towards African American people.</span> <span id="s347">In fact, his – his favorite helper in the di – in the store was James, whom he would send on his bicycle to pick me and Harry up and bring us to the store, on a bicycle.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Whoa.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Which my mother wasn’t crazy about either, but no – nothing bad ever happened, and we li – we li – we loved James.</span> <span id="s350">But then he would send – probably he would ask someone like James, do you know somebody who could – who could help out in the house and clean and wash dishes?</span> <span id="s351">And then he’d come home and my mother would be hysterical and say that she mixed the milk dishes with the meat dishes.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: Non-kosher.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: There are certain basic things that do stick with people, even if they’re not strictly observant.</span> <span id="s354">You have two sets of dishes, just the way Catholics have certain things.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: No fish on Friday.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Yeah, no fish on Friday.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: I mean, no meat on Friday.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: No meat on Friday.</span> <span id="s360">I’m sorry, you’re right, no meat on Friday, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: No meat on Friday.</span> <span id="s362">And you put a – a hamburger on their plate and they’ll – they will recoil.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: And with my mother, if you put a hamburger on a plate that’s used for dairy products, she wouldn’t touch it.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: So, these are centuries of religious practices, but they’re not religious, they’re customs.</span> <span id="s367">They become customs.</span> <span id="s368">And even non-religious people are observant of customs.</span> <span id="s369">So she would become hysterical and then say, I have to throw the dishes out.</span> <span id="s370">And my father would argue and say, you can’t throw dishes out just because someone made a mistake.</span> <span id="s371">You know, and that – those are the kinds of conflicts that they would have.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: That the children would hear, that you would hear.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: We would hear it and it would be upsetting.</span> <span id="s374">But – and sometimes m-my mother’s creativity – she was very creative – aside from being a fi – an unbelievable mimic, she could act out poems and – and things like that, but she also had picked up notions that – about bathroom habits, and she decided that we must – that the children must go to the bathroom every day.</span> <span id="s375">And the only way to guarantee that was to serve castor oil every day.</span> <span id="s376">Well, we rebelled against that, we wouldn’t – we’d disappear.</span> <span id="s377">So, her creativity, she built a witch in the closet that was so real, and she would say, you will take your castor oil, or I’m putting you in the closet.</span> <span id="s378">And she’d open the door, and there was this living witch.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Oh my God, oh my God.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: By today’s standards, this is abusive treatment of children.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: But – but it – you’re right, it’s very creative.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: It was very creative.</span> <span id="s383">We took – we took our castor oil.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Castor oil.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: Yep, we did take it.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Oh my God.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: But she had an obsession about that because even in Lithuania, she would send me to some woman in town who was – had a – a private apothecary, you know, not – not licensed by anybody, it wasn’t a drugstore or anything, but she made up potions.</span> <span id="s388">And one of the potions she made was a – a laxative.</span> <span id="s389">It was made from boiling the leaves – those little things that come down from a maple tree.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Oh, the little – the little –</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: With two wings.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah, the – I don’t know what they’re called, but I know what you’re talking about.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: They would float down like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: She would boil them, and it would turn into a black sludge of some kind, and supposedly my mother believed that that was a good laxative.</span> <span id="s396">But we wouldn’t go near it, witch or no witch.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: So – well, the – you get older and the witches lose some of their power, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: But I don’t look back on it with bitterness.</span> <span id="s401">I – you know, I thought it – I – I really thought she was very inventive, and I – I kind of admired that, and it’s – has stood me in good stead all these years because being inventive is the name of the game for me.</span> <span id="s402">I’ve created a lot of stuff, physical stuff, intellectual stuff, artistic stuff, and I think she imbued me with that idea.</span> <span id="s403">She inf – she created a lot of o-other things as well; a good deal of her own clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Mm-hm, what about your clothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: I – I can’t recall that – that she specifically sewed anything, she must have.</span> <span id="s406">But she did take us to specialists in Lithuania who made shoes, made shirts, made volekkes(ph) and –</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: I don’t know what that is, volekkes(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: It’s a – a boot made out of felt.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Oh, wai – what are they called?</span> <span id="s410">Boots made out of –</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q2: Veltiniai.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Veltiniai.</span> <span id="s413">In Lithuanian it’s veltiniai.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: Velkiniai?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: Veltiniai, with a T.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: All right.</span> <span id="s417">So in Yiddish they – they pronounce it volekkes(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Volekkes(ph), volekkes(ph), yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: But it was a felt boot.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: And you put a galosh over it to keep the –</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: The water out.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: – the water out.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: And we wore it all winter.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Were they warm enough?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Oh, they’re warm.</span> <span id="s430">They’re very warm.</span> <span id="s431">It’s a very clever boot.</span> <span id="s432">It didn’t smell too good, but – but anyone who goes around smelling volekkes(ph) –</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Has an issue.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: – deserves what he gets.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Yeah, exactly, yeah.</span> <span id="s436">Was she a warm mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: She could be.</span> <span id="s438">At times she was very warm, especially when she put her arms around us and read us the stories, or told the stories from her experiences as a young girl growing up in Zarasai.</span> <span id="s439">And – and talking about – you know, holidays were very, very big time things, just like Christmas is for non-Jews, Simchas Torah, which is celebrating the Torah, well it’s a joyous holiday, where you give each other gifts, and bags full of nuts and candy and all that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s440">Simchas Torah – Torah, yes, the happiness of the Torah.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Well, a lot of holiday – Passover was another holiday where – for – that children loved, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: And this you remember from Savannah?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Not from Savannah, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: From Zarasai.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: From Zarasai.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s448">Tell me a little bit about – now let’s get to – to the part where – where you – you leave.</span> <span id="s449">I mean, what are the conditions of the first time that you leave, how did it happen?</span> <span id="s450">It sounds like from what you’ve told me so far, the picture that’s been painted, it kind of comes out of the blue.</span> <span id="s451">Why would she want to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: The reason my mother wanted to leave, as far as I can understand it, was really very simple one.</span> <span id="s453">She had a father in Zarasai.</span> <span id="s454">She had a sister, Liefa(ph) in Zarasai, who was married to Moysai(ph) and – and they had a son, Danke(ph), Daniel, and – and she had friends that she had left behind.</span> <span id="s455">So she convinced my father that she would just like to go for a visit.</span> <span id="s456">Now of course, I wasn’t old enough to know – to be privy to their conversation, did she say to him, I want to go for a month, or two weeks.</span> <span id="s457">There must have been some kind of time limit discussed.</span> <span id="s458">Well, all I know is, the time was dragged on and on and on.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: When did you leave, by the way, what year was it, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: 1926.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: So you were four years old – five years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: I was five, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: You were five.</span> <span id="s464">Do you remember the leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Oh sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Tell me about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: We left Savannah, and got on a train, and arrived in New York City.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Was the first time you see New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: The first time I – I saw New York.</span> <span id="s470">And ostensibly, we were in New York, where the ship would be, and we stayed with relatives.</span> <span id="s471">And it was exciting for me, but also terrifying, because my mother took all of us – well, there were four of us.</span> <span id="s472">The youngest, David, must have been around six months old, I mean, he was very –</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: A baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: – he was a baby.</span> <span id="s475">He may have still been nursing, for all I know, I’m sure he was.</span> <span id="s476">And I remember she – she took us on a subway, and the doors were opening and closing, and people were getting on and getting off, and I would – I remember being so terrified that either I’ll get off and she’ll stay on the train, she’ll get off and I’ll – you know, and we’ll all get lost.</span> <span id="s477">Well, I couldn’t wait to get out of there, and then we wound up at some Muma’s(ph) place, an aunt.</span> <span id="s478">And – and that also was kind of crazy, because these were not mansions.</span> <span id="s479">They were lit – tiny little apartments in – in poor neighborhoods, and all the people squeezed into one big room, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: And I – I don’t even remember if we ate there, or what we did, it was – i-it was – the – the experience was terrifying, but eventually we were schlepped onto a boat, and we – we left and arrived in – I believe in Hamburg, Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: That would be logical.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: That would be logical, that’s where a lot of the boats –</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: We were on the German Lloyd line, I know that.</span> <span id="s486">We arrived in – in Hamburg – and by the way, we had return tickets on the German Lloyd line.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Which my father, when he came over after a year – I suspect that he was expecting us to come back every month, because my grandfather, I heard him yelling at my mother, go back to your husband.</span> <span id="s489">Are you crazy staying here with this whole bunch of children?</span> <span id="s490">Oh, they used to have terrible fights, because he really thought she had it made by going to America while they’re all stuck in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: Sure, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: This was a poor place.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Y-You know, it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: I mean, she was a return immigrant.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: And it was just not logical, no one was doing that.</span> <span id="s499">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: And so what was the train ride?</span> <span id="s501">Then you took a train from Hamburg into Lithuania?</span> <span id="s502">Do you ha – do you have any memories of that train ride?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: I – I have very little – I think it went into Kaunas.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: Bec – and the reason why I think it went into Kaunas is because on the way home, we got on a train in Kaunas and got off in Hamburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: It had to be that way the other way too, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: Yeah, it had to be that way the other way.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: Do you remember what your first impressions are when you come from the United States; from Savannah, which you knew well; and New York, which you had gotten just a glimpse of, and you come into either Kaunas or to Zarasai; what kind of image there was in your mind of these places that you had arrived at?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: Well, I – I – I really thought that I was going into pre-history.</span> <span id="s512">I mean, people were barefoot in the street, and we were surrounded by – my brother Harry and I were surrounded by local little kids who were all barefoot and – and wearing ragged clothes that were patched, and – and we wear – wearing our little fl – Lord Fauntleroy s-suits that my mother insisted on.</span> <span id="s513">We hated those clothes, you know, we felt like clowns, you know, those little –</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Oh God, it’s death to a little boy when everybody else is dressed the other way.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: With a tam o’ shanter and – I mean – and – and – and neither shorts nor long pants, but something that came just below the knee.</span> <span id="s516">And we – we felt so out of place.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: This was Zarasai?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: This was in Zarasai?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: In Zarasai, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: And of course we didn’t understand, we were surrounded by little kids who are yammering away in a foreign language, and we didn’t know what they – the only thing that I understood is one kid said, you boxer.</span> <span id="s523">He goes like – you boxer.</span> <span id="s524">And then a chorus of them, you boxer.</span> <span id="s525">And I looked at Harry, I said, what is he saying?</span> <span id="s526">I didn’t understand.</span> <span id="s527">It was only later on that I found out that their hero was Jack Sharkey, a Lithuanian boxer in America who had won the heavyweight champion, and had become wealthy.</span> <span id="s528">The dream of wealth was just the only dream anyone had in those days.</span> <span id="s529">So – but also –</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: Do you know if these were – do you know if these were Jewish kids, or these were Lithuanian kids –</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: These were Jewish kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: These were Jewish kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: We – we lived in the – in the Jewish section –</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Of Zarasai.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: – o-of Zarasai.</span> <span id="s538">Although, the area that we rented a house in was not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Can we cut?</span> <span id="s540">[break] Okay, this is just to say that we cut the camera because there’s drilling outside, and unfortunately the noise is such that it will be captured, but we’re going to keep on going.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s543">So you lived in the – in the Jewish section of Zarasai, and so you remember these little kids surrounding you when you first arrive, and you couldn’t understand what they were saying.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: And how long did it take until that changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: I c – I couldn’t be sh – I – I – I couldn’t place a time as to how long it took me to integrate with the li – local language, but it – for one thing, my cousin Daniel, who was my age, grew up in a house with my Aunt Leifa(ph) and Uncle Moysai(ph), where they spoke French and English in addition to knowing Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: That’s pretty –</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: They did – they did not speak Yiddish among themselves.</span> <span id="s549">Of course they knew it because they had to speak it to certain clients and people like that.</span> <span id="s550">So I – I could have conversations with Daniel, and he would translate what the kids are saying, and then I would question Daniel, and I would say, tell me again, what does this mean?</span> <span id="s551">And he would explain it to – he was very bright, and he would explain it to me, and little by little I picked it up, and before long – you know, kids can learn things very quickly through experience rather than by rote.</span> <span id="s552">And just having the need to find out something, you learn the words, so you can do what you want to do.</span> <span id="s553">I learned Russian that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Well, that was one of my questions, is did they speak Russian as well, did they speak any Lithuanian, did they – what were the number of languages, what were the languages that they spoke?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: Li-Lithuanian was not spoken within the family f-for whatever reason that I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: Did you hear it outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: It – not often.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: You heard it in the post office, and you heard it in the movie house.</span> <span id="s560">Of course, Lithuanians would come in.</span> <span id="s561">Th-The – the land around the town was the Gentile area, where the Polish landowners and Lithuanian landowners had farms and orchards and things like that.</span> <span id="s562">J-Just like my landlord, Karowlka(ph), he – he and his brother and sister were of Polish descent, but they had a very large orchard, and a bath house, and a – an estate, really.</span> <span id="s563">And it was a beautiful place, they had cows, and provided us with milk.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Was he the person you said was your father figure?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: Yeah, he became a f – at least a big brother.</span> <span id="s566">He wasn’t that much older, he was like – I remember when he went down for the test to be conscripted into the Lithuanian army, so he was 21.</span> <span id="s567">But to – to someone who was, at that time maybe 10, 21 is – is –</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: An adult.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s570">And he would take us s-spearfishing, regular fishing.</span> <span id="s571">He would – he – he – once a month it was his assignment by my mother to take us to our little bathhouse, which was a steam – a sauna.</span> <span id="s572">And we had great times with him, he was – he was – he really was like a big brother or a father.</span> <span id="s573">He taught us a lot, and we didn’t speak – he di – he could not speak a word of Yiddish, so even by the time I was fluent in Yiddish, I knew enough Russian.</span> <span id="s574">And Russian was the lingua franca there during tsarist times.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: So, whether you were Jewish, Polish or whatever, ye – if you wanted to get by you had to speak Russian.</span> <span id="s577">So I learned a lot of basic Russian, and I could communicate with Karowlka(ph), with Anna and Ziegmund(ph) very, very easily in Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: How did they come – how did they intersect with your life: Karowlka(ph) and Anna and Ziegmund(ph), and how did you meet?</span> <span id="s579">What was – how was it that you got to know them?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: I – my mother was looking to rent a place, and they had one big house which they lived in, and then they had a little cottage next – nearby – next door, that they rented, and my mother rented it.</span> <span id="s581">And so we were on the same grounds, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: How did she pay for this?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: How did your mother pay for this?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: Pay for it?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: Well, my father sent money regularly.</span> <span id="s588">As a matter of fact, she was constantly telling us to write to our father that we are desperate for money, that we have no food.</span> <span id="s589">And later my father told me, I was sending money – he had postal receipts that he showed me, about that high.</span> <span id="s590">He was sending money all the time.</span> <span id="s591">But she was also giving money away.</span> <span id="s592">She believed in the Talmudic, or Torah thing about Tzedakah, which is giving to the poor.</span> <span id="s593">And whoever – who-whoever she found out about through the synagogue or people she knew, that so and so was desperately out of money and couldn’t survive, she would give them a chunk of money.</span> <span id="s594">So I – I didn’t object to that really, except, you know, we all have the feeling of, your first duty is at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: But we survived, so it – there were other people who were good to us.</span> <span id="s597">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: Tell me a little bit about your wider family there.</span> <span id="s599">You mentioned that your grandfather, your mother’s father, still lived there.</span> <span id="s600">How did – what was his way of – of making a living?</span> <span id="s601">What did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: He was loosely called an avokat(ph), which is an attorney.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: Now, I don’t think that he had a formal lawyer’s education.</span> <span id="s605">First of all, it was a big joke about getting into the gymnasium.</span> <span id="s606">You could only get into the gyna – gymnasium if you found a Gentile kid and got him in, then the two of you could get in.</span> <span id="s607">That was the rumor.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: And gymnasium is – is – is the high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: The high school, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: So going to – going to higher education was virtually impossible –</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: For a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: – for Jews, yeah.</span> <span id="s614">They – well, you know, I was too young to know the details, and I would really love to know what the restrictions were.</span> <span id="s615">Maybe – maybe they just couldn’t pass the test, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s616">But f – from the information I was getting, if you’re Jewish, you can’t get into the gymnasia.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s619">So we accepted that.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: And a lot of Jewish kids did not go to public schools, they went to cheders or yeshivas.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: And what about you when you were there?</span> <span id="s623">Did you go to – which kind of school did you go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: My mother sent us to a cheder, which I hated and I stopped going to it, because I was not interested in the religious part of it.</span> <span id="s625">I mean, I must have gotten that from my father, but my mother wanted us to – so then she hired tutors, and I found the religious part interesting, as long as it wasn’t hammered into our heads.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: In that cheder, can you describe to me what it was that you hated about it?</span> <span id="s627">What was – what were the instruction like, what were the teachers like?</span> <span id="s628">What were some of the other kids like?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: Well, there was a lot of hitting, you know, rulers on the hands and there was a – a lot of disciplining, and since I didn’t understand what the discipline was for, it was frightening, and – and I really did – I hated going to school.</span> <span id="s630">But I enjoyed having the tutor because my mother hired a – a very bright young man who not only went through the Bible and made it – made the Bible stories interesting, like Noah’s ark and stuff like that, but he also dealt with science, and explained science and geography.</span> <span id="s631">I remember him telling us – and I used to be able to recite all the Japanese islands, because he – he taught us all about China and Japan and India, and it was like going on a trip.</span> <span id="s632">It was – that was very enjoyable.</span> <span id="s633">But that was one to one and he wasn’t threatening us and telling us if we don’t behave we’re going to get hit, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: So school was – first of all, in school, you had a – a lo – a – a lot of unruly kids.</span> <span id="s636">I like to believe I wasn’t one of the unruly ones, but the – the guy running the thing was – didn’t care about distinctions, he just walked around with a stick or a ruler or something and it was very scary.</span> <span id="s637">I guess I – I just didn’t like the discipline of the – the religious discipline –</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Well, you hadn't been old enough to start school in the United States, had you?</span> <span id="s639">When you left at age five or six, had you already started any kind of education here in the States?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: I did go to – I – I did go to something in school.</span> <span id="s641">I – I ke – I don’t want to use the term kindergarten.</span> <span id="s642">I started school in Savannah, I remember that.</span> <span id="s643">And I remember being bullied by the older kids, and especially with my name, Abraham, which, if I didn’t get bullied by anti-Semites, then I got bullied by confederates, you know, because the name Abraham Lincoln was poison in Savannah.</span> <span id="s644">I mean, you gotta remember, it’s almost a century ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: So this is – this is still living me – in the 20s, with still living memory of the Civil War.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s649">I mean wa – the minute I would mention my name in polite company, people would look at me like – with daggers.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: And your parents would have had no idea when they named you that it could have this kind of effect?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: They’re totally from a totally different tradition.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: Yes, the Bible.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: Now th – it happens that the southern people are very – they’re very Bible conscious, and the – the – the Old Testament and the New Testament are, I think revered by Christians everywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: So that wasn’t the problem, but the association they were making – nobody was naming their child in the south, Abraham.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: I mean, any more than after the American Revolution, I don’t think anyone was calling their kid King George.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: Exactly.</span> <span id="s661">No Georges.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: No Georges.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: [indecipherable] we had George Washington, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: No, George Washington was the revolutionary.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: That’s right, but we have a King George who was defeated, and we have a George Washington, so maybe George is a neutral name, cause both of them had it.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: Well, George Washington had his name while he was a subject of the king of England.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: He just didn’t change his name after defeating King George.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: So anyway –</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s674">So you experienced – there’s something I wanted to pick up on.</span> <span id="s675">Did you experience, you know, anti-Semitism in the world of children, when you were in Savannah?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: In Savannah, yes, to some minor degree.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: How did that express itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: No, it – I can’t say it was anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s679">Maybe from the neighborhood that I lived in.</span> <span id="s680">You know, people of similar interests tend to congregate.</span> <span id="s681">It – people of color, of course, were segregated by color.</span> <span id="s682">But very – I – I – I remember when I mo – came back from Lithuania and moved – moved in – my father and I shared a r – a room, and rented a room in the Bronx.</span> <span id="s683">And the building I lived in, I made friends with a couple of Jewish kids, and they warned me not to go on certain streets, where the Italians lived, and on another street where the Irish lived.</span> <span id="s684">And it wasn’t that there were – they were – none of these streets had a hundred percent Jews, a hundred percent Irish, a hundred percent Italian, but they were predominantly of one ethnic or religious group.</span> <span id="s685">And if you – if I walked to school on the wrong street, I’d be sure to get beaten up.</span> <span id="s686">I was chased, and I found out.</span> <span id="s687">So then, after being chased, my friend Hilton said, never go on that street.</span> <span id="s688">They’ll catch you, they’ll – they’ll take your shoes, they’ll take everything away from you.</span> <span id="s689">So I said okay.</span> <span id="s690">It was just – those conflicts go on and on.</span> <span id="s691">I mean, even in Ireland where they were all Christian and they were killing each other, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: Well, what about – what about Lithuania?</span> <span id="s693">Did you also have – I want to make a comparison.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s695">We s – we stayed pretty much in the Jewish areas.</span> <span id="s696">Now, that’s not to say that there weren’t some Gentiles living in Jewish areas, and some Jews living in Gentile areas.</span> <span id="s697">There are people who find acceptance because they integrate and they’re not threatening, and they – they just don’t develop friendships, they don’t eat at each other’s houses and thing – they don’t have coffee klatches, but they leave each other alone.</span> <span id="s698">They don’t hit them –</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: Pick on each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: Yeah, they don’t hit each other.</span> <span id="s701">So – but I knew all the areas in – in Zarasai that were – that had Jewish homes mixed in with non-Jewish homes, and no one was likely to attack me, because they knew that I would run to the Jewish home, and then it would be a whole big hullaballoo between grownups.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: So it was a safer area.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: A safer area, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: We – you automatically – but I didn’t feel threatened anywhere.</span> <span id="s706">I – Harry and I wandered all over town, and into non-Jewish areas.</span> <span id="s707">And certainly no grownup would ever do anything to a child in Lithuania, that I never even thought of it, but you ought to watch out for the – for kids your own age, because fighting was, you know, what kids do –</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: – for any reason, you know, that they can think of.</span> <span id="s710">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: When – when you came to Zarasai, what was, if there is one thing, or two things, that struck you as the strangest things you’d ever seen?</span> <span id="s712">Because you’d come from a different world.</span> <span id="s713">You’d come from – I mean, Savannah is certainly different than New York City, but that’s the world of the United States, and you come to this one, and you’ve mentioned that it’s like being in pre-history, but what was the strangest thing that you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: The strangest thing to me in Zarasai on my first experience was the lack of automobiles.</span> <span id="s715">There was not a single automobile.</span> <span id="s716">In fact, when one would be coming in from Kovno, that we had heard about, all the kids would gather to run after the car.</span> <span id="s717">And we used to stand behind the car to smell the gasoline from the exhaust, because it was such an unusual smell.</span> <span id="s718">And that struck me.</span> <span id="s719">The other thing was that you could find food on trees everywhere.</span> <span id="s720">All you had to do was walk in a certain area where the apple tree was hanging over the street, and get a stick and hit it, and get an apple and eat it, or a pear, or a bunch of cherries.</span> <span id="s721">We used to go after those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Well, that sounds lovely –</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: – you know?</span> <span id="s725">That’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: We were constantly eating fruit of some kind or another.</span> <span id="s727">The currant bushes were hanging over fences everywhere.</span> <span id="s728">You could walk along and just with your hand pull off big loads of yellow and red, what we called paretsky(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s730">And – and what about – you said your grandfather was sort of like an advokat(ph), maybe without formal training, but nevertheless, that.</span> <span id="s731">What was – what would he do?</span> <span id="s732">What was he –</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: He – he interceded on behalf of Jewish people who needed to go to court about s-some – some matter.</span> <span id="s734">It – it wasn’t things like divorce, or – or suing a storekeeper.</span> <span id="s735">What it was, I think, is these people received a notice that there was a – some kind of violation.</span> <span id="s736">Either they left their horse out in the street, or who knows what?</span> <span id="s737">And my grandfather – now, I never heard him speak Lithuanian, and I suspect that he really couldn’t speak Lithuanian because they really were refugees from Russia.</span> <span id="s738">But he did speak Russian fluently, and he might have learned enough Lithuanian to get by, for all I know, I just never heard him speak it.</span> <span id="s739">So he would – a – a Jewish person who had received a notice that he has to come to the court, my grandfather would represent him.</span> <span id="s740">And as a large landowner in town, he – he did, he ow – he owned a – a very big house on what would be in New York a sw – an entire square block.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: Yeah, it was a large property, filled with lumber that my unc – Uncle Moysai(ph) was dealing in, and – and also poppy fields, and fruits and vegetables growing there –</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: In town?</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: Oh, it was a fantastic garden.</span> <span id="s745">Fantastic.</span> <span id="s746">And we used to go there all the time to pick fruit and stuff.</span> <span id="s747">So he was a prominent landowner.</span> <span id="s748">How he got it, I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: Haim Gordon.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: Gor – so is that your mother’s maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: My mother’s maiden name was Gordon.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: So she was Mildred Gordon in English, but in – in Yiddish it would have been Milcha(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: Michla(ph) Gordon.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: Michla(ph) Gordon.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: Michla(ph) Gordon.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: And – and his name wa – again, his first name, your grandfather’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: Haim.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: Haim Gordon.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: That’s Hyman.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: And can you paint a picture for me about what the house looked like that he lived in?</span> <span id="s766">Was it a brick, a stone, a wood?</span> <span id="s767">How many floors, things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: My grandfather’s house was a wooden house, but very, very elegant.</span> <span id="s769">It was not very wide, but very, very long.</span> <span id="s770">When I say not very wide, it – it – I – my guess would be, let’s see, it had bedrooms on each side, and then a long hallway.</span> <span id="s771">It might have been say 50 feet wide, but maybe a – a 120 feet long, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: That’s large.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: It was very large, and made of wood, and it had many, many big rooms: music room, bedrooms on both sides, a huge kitchen and a huge dining room, where my grandfather entertained local big shots, which is – was where he got his power in the courtroom, because he was – now he must have spoken a language – I’m sure he was fluent in Russian, and probably all the big shots in Lithuania were fluent in Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: Yes, they would have been.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: Yeah, because it was a part of Russia –</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s777">They would have –</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: – shor – you know, I was there in the 1920s.</span> <span id="s779">Well, in 1914, it was Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: That’s right, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: So it’s not that far back.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s783">Educated people got their degrees, their higher education at Russian universities.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: They did.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: I mean, there was no university in la – in Zarasai.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: And in Kovno there was a university, but who could travel from –</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: Zarasai –</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: – Zarasai to – there were no cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: How did you get from Kovno to Zarasai?</span> <span id="s794">So did you take a bus?</span> <span id="s795">Was there a bus route, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: We took a bus.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: Okay, so they did have bus routes at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: They did have a bus that came once in a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: Once in a while.</span> <span id="s801">I did have a fantastic experience wher – all the kids did.</span> <span id="s802">It was in the winter, and the Lithuanian air force – I’m saying this slowly, so it should sink in, we found out that the Lithuanian air force was going to land on the lake.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: So it must have been winter, with – it’s frozen.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: The wi – lake must have been frozen.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: The lake would freeze.</span> <span id="s807">They pulled out six foot slabs of ice from the lake in the wintertime.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: They used to saw it, and then pull it out, and put it in a barn, and cover it with straw, for it – later in the –</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: – spring, you know, to preserve butter and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s812">Well, the air force, three airplanes came in and landed on the ice.</span> <span id="s813">And all the kids and half – a lot of the grownups, we all ran out on the ice.</span> <span id="s814">And there was some talk, what if the ice cracks, you know, and we all go down into the lake.</span> <span id="s815">But it couldn’t.</span> <span id="s816">Th – I think the ice froze to six or eight feet.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: That’s how far north it was, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: Mus – then it was cold in the wintertime.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: It had a nickname.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: What was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: Lithuania is the Siberia of Lithuania – Zarasai is the si –</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: Siberia of Lithuania.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: Siberia of Lithuania.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: Yeah, we used to kid about that, but it was a – it was a lovely little town, and you have to picture the town – I-I-I’ll draw a word picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: Here is a big lake.</span> <span id="s829">In the middle of the lake is a mountain.</span> <span id="s830">And you cut off the top of the mountain, and you build a town on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: So, in the wintertime, any road going down to the lake became a sledding thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: Opportunity.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s835">We would ride the sled down, out onto the ice, it would go out 500 feet out onto the ice after going down the hill.</span> <span id="s836">It was terrific.</span> <span id="s837">And everyone had a sled.</span> <span id="s838">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: You – going back to your grandfather’s house, it sounds like a very well-to-do house, actually, if he had separate rooms for different functions, and a large kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: Now, to get a sense of, you know, the differences in modernity, did it have electricity?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: Did it have indoor plumbing?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: How was it heated?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: I – it was heated by fireplaces.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: Coal, do you think, or by wood?</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: By wood.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: By wood, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: I mean, my Uncle Moysai(ph) had 2,00 logs out in the – in the big garden.</span> <span id="s851">No, they – they had plenty of wood.</span> <span id="s852">I di – I – I don’t remember seeing fires going in a lot of fireplaces.</span> <span id="s853">I – I – I slept there during the winter and y-you climbed under quilts this thick, and it was cold.</span> <span id="s854">I mean, if you got out of bed it was freezing.</span> <span id="s855">And you didn’t want to have to go outside to the outhouse.</span> <span id="s856">That’s – that was the plumbing.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: So, during this time, you’re – you’re still a little boy, even though you’re the oldest in the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: You’re still th – you know, you’re little.</span> <span id="s860">Did you miss your dad?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: Oh sure, but you know, children are amazingly adaptable.</span> <span id="s862">They – they can be put off, you know.</span> <span id="s863">You may not be – be able to put them off if you promised them an ice cream cone.</span> <span id="s864">They’ll nag you for that ice cream cone forever.</span> <span id="s865">But if you tell them, you’ll see your father in six months – you don’t even know what six months are.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: You know, so you say, all right, so I’ll wait, so I’ll wait.</span> <span id="s868">And – but you nagged.</span> <span id="s869">Now, don’t forget my father wrote to us all the time, and we looked forward to those.</span> <span id="s870">He would write to us in a roll of funny papers that would be a roll like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: So he’d send you funny papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: Sent.</span> <span id="s873">We got a notice every month or so, to come to the post office and pick up this roll of funny paper.</span> <span id="s874">And Harry and I would like on the floor reading these things for hours on – we maintained our English – our abilities in English, I think by reading and rereading these funny papers over and over and over again.</span> <span id="s875">And then we would read them and translate them to our friends as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: Well, that’s so cool.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: They get to see these, and – did they have – did they have anything like funny papers or cartoons that were from the area, from Lithuania [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: Not – not from Lithuania, but from Germany –</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: – there was something Ziegmund(ph) and Ignatz or something like that, you know.</span> <span id="s882">Little – little mischievous kids who were playing tricks on older people, and stuff.</span> <span id="s883">And we used to laugh hilariously at those.</span> <span id="s884">But they were hard to get.</span> <span id="s885">Only once in a while someone who traveled came back and brought papers with them, and we were dropped off at my grandfather’s house, and then my cousin Daniel would bring it to us, and they were s – they were very cosmopolitan so –</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: Well, it sounds that way, with that many languages in the home –</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: That speaks of not – it could be a remote area, it could be the Siberi – Zarasai being the Siberia of Lithuania, but it still means that there is a wider perspective of the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s890">Daniel, we never spoke Yiddish with him, only English.</span> <span id="s891">But his parents spoke English to him, as well as French.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: And so where would they have gotten those?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: I cannot figure it out, they – they must have been eager beavers.</span> <span id="s894">Or you could chalk it up to upwardly mobile, you know, pretentious.</span> <span id="s895">Snobs, even, you know.</span> <span id="s896">I mean, let’s face it, if you learn a language – if you learn Chinese and you live in a country there’s not a single Chinese person, then it’s out of curiosity more than anything else, but the – English and – and French were considered very high class.</span> <span id="s897">And just being able to flaunt it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: What about German in the 1920s?</span> <span id="s899">Because for so many people, Jews and non-Jews alike, Germany was the land of culture.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s901">And we saw many, many German language films in my Uncle Moysai’s(ph) theater, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: This is in Zarasai, or in Kovno?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: In Zarasai, and in Kovno as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: So there was a – so there was a theater in – in Zarasai, there was a cinema there.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: He had the Bongo there, and then he opened another one in Kovno.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: So he owned a cinema?</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: He owned two – two mo-movie theaters.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: Well, that’s a good uncle to talk up, my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: Yeah – no, Moysai(ph) was – oh, he was such a spectacular guy.</span> <span id="s910">He even survived the war, and he survived his wife, survived his son, and wound up with a family in Israel.</span> <span id="s911">He – he – he was doer.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: Moysai(ph) Gordon was his name, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: He took the name Gordon.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: Mm-hm, because of his wife, yeah [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: Because of his wife, yeah, I don’t know what his real name was.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: Who was your mother’s sister.</span> <span id="s917">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: Btu he was like adopted by my grandfather, I guess, and lived with my grandfather.</span> <span id="s919">But Moysai(ph) was a go-getter.</span> <span id="s920">I mean, he was a very big, tall, handsome guy.</span> <span id="s921">I mean, I used to look up to him.</span> <span id="s922">And – but when the German films, when he showed the German films, I could understand everything because of Yiddish.</span> <span id="s923">It’s close enough, and it’s especially when they – they’re just using common everyday things like [speaks German]</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: [German] you know.</span> <span id="s926">It’s easy enough to understand.</span> <span id="s927">If s – if someone recently – in recent times asked me if I had any interest in the Jewish newspaper in New York, and I said –</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: You mean [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: “The Forwards.”</span> <span id="s930">I said, I can read it, but I said, you gotta remember that my Yiddish speaking was up to the age of 12, I – so I don’t have an intellectual connection to Yiddish, I just know basic Yiddish.</span> <span id="s931">And if you start going into complicated philosophical stuff, I don’t know what it – what it’s about.</span> <span id="s932">But the movies, everything was, are you going out, are you coming in, are you – you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: Do you love me, do you not?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: Do you love me?</span> <span id="s935">Are you going to eat?</span> <span id="s936">You know, so that I could understand cause it’s the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: So Zarasai itself, it had a movie theater, I didn’t know, in the 20s.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: It had –</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: You say it had a movie theater?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: And it was named The Bongo.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: The Bongo.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: And did it have any kind of like, department store, or general store?</span> <span id="s944">What did the town square look like?</span> <span id="s945">I’m asking two questions at the same time, my apologies.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: Since I didn’t have any money, and shopping was also somewhat of anathema, I’m not aware of store – everything was made to order.</span> <span id="s947">All my shoes were made to order, all my shirts, my coat.</span> <span id="s948">When winter was approaching, my mother started to schlepp us to the –</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: Tailor’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: – to the tailor’s, to the bootmakers, to the – you know, to the – stockings.</span> <span id="s951">I had to go to a place to have stockings made.</span> <span id="s952">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: What about bakeries?</span> <span id="s954">Were there bagels?</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: There were places where you could buy bagels.</span> <span id="s956">There were also ladies who walked down the street with strings of bagels, shouting [speaks Russian] That’s in Russian.</span> <span id="s957">There were bakeries, yeah, you could – you could buy bread.</span> <span id="s958">I know we didn’t bake anything.</span> <span id="s959">And we scratched for food.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Were you hungry?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: I was hungry a lot, yeah.</span> <span id="s962">My mother didn’t pay much attention to supplying food.</span> <span id="s963">That’s one of the things where she fell down.</span> <span id="s964">And we’d be waiting and starving and she’d – finally she would come home and we figure, maybe there’s something to eat.</span> <span id="s965">And you never knew what it would be.</span> <span id="s966">Sometimes it would be – once it was a big bag of grapes.</span> <span id="s967">Somebody brought it in from somewhere.</span> <span id="s968">But on – another time – and I hated this – she brought like a pound of butter, and a pound of white cheese, and mashed it all together, and – and we ate that with bread, and it was not fulfilling.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: Was that a change from how she had been in Savannah, if in Savannah she was so careful about kosher food?</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: Oh, all of this was kosher.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: Still kosher.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: But sh – it sounds like you never went hungry in Savannah.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: I don’t know, I wa – in Savannah you c – it’s important to remember that I was not yet six.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: I know.</span> <span id="s976">I’m asking such unfair questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: No, no, it’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: If someone asked me, what were you doing at five years old, and I – you know, in details –</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: Yeah, I –</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: – I couldn’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: – I honestly don’t remember what food was about.</span> <span id="s982">The thing we looked forward to in Zarasai was something called cholent.</span> <span id="s983">Cholent is a big iron pot, about the s – bigger than a basketball – about the size of a ba-basketball.</span> <span id="s984">A s-s-solid iron pot.</span> <span id="s985">And all kinds of stuff went into it: sliced carrots, peas, chicken, potato, even onion.</span> <span id="s986">And [indecipherable] water, and it was just a huge stew in there.</span> <span id="s987">Must have been five pounds worth of food in there, and I had to carry it to a communal oven, Friday before sundown.</span> <span id="s988">And it would be shoved into a communal oven.</span> <span id="s989">And then Saturday night, after sundown, I would go pick it up and carry it for five kilometers.</span> <span id="s990">Oh God, what a chore this was.</span> <span id="s991">I’m not yet 12 years old, I’m a – maybe 10 or 11.</span> <span id="s992">And a – it – well, we built a wagon, Harry and I, and we used to pull it.</span> <span id="s993">Someone gave us broken parts of yo-yos.</span> <span id="s994">They were making yo-yos in a mill, a wooden mill.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s997">And they would break apart, and they wouldn’t bother putting it together, so they gave it – we had a friend there, and he gave me a bag full of –</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: Yo-yos.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: – y-yo-yo discs.</span> <span id="s1000">We made wagons out of it and all kinds of toys out of it, and I think one of them was a wagon that we could pull –</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: The cholent –</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: – with this heavy thing in it.</span> <span id="s1003">Now, I gotta tell you that when that came home, it was still piping hot, because it’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: The iron kept the heat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: – an iron pot, and – and that stuff was boiling when we picked it up.</span> <span id="s1006">And it cooled off enough to be able to eat it, and it was delicious.</span> <span id="s1007">That – you know, it’s a great stew, I mean, potatoes and carrots and chicken and – I think she put some honey in it too, I – but it was – it was just delicious.</span> <span id="s1008">And that’s the best meal of the week that we had.</span> <span id="s1009">Otherwise it was a lot of herring.</span> <span id="s1010">It re – herring was easy to get.</span> <span id="s1011">Is – this comes in a barrel.</span> <span id="s1012">So we’d each get a herring and a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1013">But it’s not a fulfilling diet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: How – how did your mother spend her days?</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: Either with friends, or she was in the shul, I don’t know which one she was doing.</span> <span id="s1016">We – I – I’m – I’m sure she had a lot of friends, or she pref – or took care of sick old people.</span> <span id="s1017">That was part of her charity work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: But her kids na – it sounds like you were kind of raising yourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: We were raising ourselves, yes, we were.</span> <span id="s1020">And then Karowlka(ph) and Anna and Ziegmund(ph), they would – they would grab hold of me and Harry – my mother very often took the younger ones with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: They’d grab hold of Harry and me and they’d bring me into their house, kitchen, big dining ta – table, and they’d say, are you hungry?</span> <span id="s1023">And we’d say yes.</span> <span id="s1024">And Karowlka(ph) would say, well, we have some good food, but if you tell your mother, you will never, ever be able to eat here again.</span> <span id="s1025">So we s – Harry and I would say, we won’t tell, we won’t tell.</span> <span id="s1026">And I think we even got pork chops.</span> <span id="s1027">But we didn’t care.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: Do you remember that kind of food?</span> <span id="s1029">Was it very different from the food you were used to at home?</span> <span id="s1030">Or was it just, it’s a meal?</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: Not the chicken, very – chicken and fish, you know.</span> <span id="s1032">You used to go out and spear fish.</span> <span id="s1033">So you get a nice big pike, about that long, and that was delicious, you know.</span> <span id="s1034">Had a lot of little Y bones, but you learn to spit them out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: And oh, I loved going there, you know, that was great.</span> <span id="s1037">And they were very sweet people.</span> <span id="s1038">Ziegmund(ph) was a tailor by – taught himself to be a tailor, and you know, freelance tailoring.</span> <span id="s1039">Anna was the housekeeper, she took care of the cow and the sheep and the chickens and all of that kind of stuff, and the garden.</span> <span id="s1040">And they had a lush garden, so we got plenty of vegetables.</span> <span id="s1041">And fruit galore.</span> <span id="s1042">In fact, his orchard was so productive that he would rent it out in the summer to a entrepreneur who would come and pick loads of the stuff and sell it to the stores.</span> <span id="s1043">But we could go in there and pick apples and pear and currants and gooseberries, wonderful stuff.</span> <span id="s1044">But that’s in the summertime.</span> <span id="s1045">In the wintertime you have to rely on slaughtering the chickens, and – I had pet chickens, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: Did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: Did they have names?</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: Did they have names?</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: They did, but I forget.</span> <span id="s1052">I had one favorite chicken and – and I thought she was lost.</span> <span id="s1053">And then one day, she’s found, she marches out from under the outhouse, I think, I can’t know where she was.</span> <span id="s1054">And she’s followed by little chicks.</span> <span id="s1055">So I – I became a father.</span> <span id="s1056">And I know that was very exciting.</span> <span id="s1057">I really thought that either somebody had grabbed her and eaten her –</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: – or she just got lost, but she just was in confinement.</span> <span id="s1060">And she marched out with the little things peeping.</span> <span id="s1061">It’s very exciting life, you know I – I feel like I was a Jewish Huckleberry Finn.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: You know, it sounds that way.</span> <span id="s1063">There sounds li – the picture that you’re painting alternates between a place that is backward technologically, but has a lot of wonderful features to it, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: Oh, it – I had a wonderful time.</span> <span id="s1065">We did – we did have a certain amount of fear, because there was conflict, and it wasn’t – it’s – it shouldn’t be confused with institutional anti-Semitism, such as Nazism.</span> <span id="s1066">No, it was just the conflicts of religious belief.</span> <span id="s1067">And this goes on between Muslims and Hindus, between northern Ireland and southern Ireland, you know, it goes on all over the world; Nigeria, you name it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: So you wouldn’t say if I – if I – it doesn’t sound like it would be more different than in other places of the world.</span> <span id="s1069">It would be what you have in other places in the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1071">It’s just that there were – there was tribalism, cliques.</span> <span id="s1072">But tribalism is really what it is.</span> <span id="s1073">Gentile kids hung out with Gentile kids, Jewish kids hung out with Jewish kids, and if the two came together, there would be conflict.</span> <span id="s1074">So – and then, of course, there were terrible rumors that were spread about Jews drinking the blood of Christian children on Passover, you know.</span> <span id="s1075">Someone starts a terrible story, and it gets passed along, because people – there are people who want to create trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: Well, you know, I don’t know enough about this, I would like to research it more.</span> <span id="s1077">But, you know, sometimes I connect dots and I have to research to find out whether or not the connection is really valid.</span> <span id="s1078">But the part of the world you’re talking about, which we’ve already emphasized, was part of the tsarist empire at one point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: And when the revolutionary movements were happening in the 19th century, that alarmed the authorities that were in power.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: That there were these revolutionary movements.</span> <span id="s1083">And the secret police, the Okhrana, secret police – this is what I have heard, and I’d have to research it – created The Protocol of the Elders of Zion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: And so, if this was the place where this was created, and it then had a power, you know, it got disseminated, this is in those territories.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: Something sticks.</span> <span id="s1088">Something –</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: It was even picked up here in America by –</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: – the head of the Ford motor company, Edsel Ford –</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: He picked up the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: Protocols.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: – Protocols of Zion, which is why he was – he favored Hitler’s solution, and he was a major anti-Semite, and – because he believed The Protocols of Zion, which was a fabrication.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: Yes, complete.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">A: Complete fabrication.</span> <span id="s1098">You could do this with any group, you could do it with black people, you could do it to Irish people, to a-anybody.</span> <span id="s1099">Just pick some little –</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: Thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: – thing, and enlarge it into a big fairy tale.</span> <span id="s1102">So – and the – the spreading of notions like Christ killers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: That’s right, I was going to mention that too.</span> <span id="s1104">So that comes from one force, and then you have – and then you have unfortunately, the Catholic church and other Christian denominations.</span> <span id="s1105">But mostly, it would have been the Catholic church that, for centuries, talked about that, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: Yes, well, I – I’m – I’m not well enough educated in these matters to – to take sides as to who the guilty party is, and who the innocent.</span> <span id="s1107">The innocent party, as we always know, are the ones who are singled out for attack.</span> <span id="s1108">They – no group is as guilty o-o-of any crime – first of all, you can’t make a group guilty, they’re – they’re – within a group, even a – a group of bigots, there’s somebody who says, wait a minute, we’re going too far with this.</span> <span id="s1109">This is not – yo-you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: – this is not a human attitude.</span> <span id="s1112">So I’m sure there were Nazis who had doubts about what they were doing, but you either go along, or you’re – you become part of the pariah group.</span> <span id="s1113">So it’s – it’s a – it’s a tu – it’s a tough call, but it – tribalism has been going on since the – since time began, and it un – it undoubtedly will go on forever and ever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: The best we can do is learn lessons from these things, and try to pass along the notion that people aren’t inherently bad.</span> <span id="s1116">People are born into certain circumstances beyond their ability to do anything about, you know, and – and if they become part of the cursed, they are in terrible trouble, that’s all there is to it.</span> <span id="s1117">So I think the Holocaust Museum’s function, in my view, is to set the record straight about bigotry, and depression, and indiscriminate intolerance –</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: – and – and – and creating victims.</span> <span id="s1120">We have to – we have to not do that to any human being.</span> <span id="s1121">I wouldn’t torture Hitler if I had a chance to do so.</span> <span id="s1122">I would – I would separate him from – from others so that he can’t do any more harm, but I certainly wouldn’t take revenge on him by, you know, doing terrible things to him.</span> <span id="s1123">He’s a – he was a human being as well, but – this is just my feeling is that revenge gets you absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s1124">The only – the only terrific revenge is to educate, so that terrible things are looked upon as terrible things, and they turn everyone’s stomach, and no one wants to do them any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: We can hope.</span> <span id="s1126">We can hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">A: That’s what we want.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1129">Can we cut here?</span> <span id="s1130">[break] When did your father show up?</span> <span id="s1131">You know, you – I’d like to get the chronology straight, because you say there was some back and forth, and that your mother took you to Lithuania not just one time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: So that means there was a time that you had to come back to the States, or you did come back to the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1135">The chronology of events with my father were basically; one year in Lithuania, 1926 to 1927.</span> <span id="s1136">Then back to – my father comes to Lithuania and takes us back to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: Does he take your mother, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: Yeah, all of us, we all come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: And do you – do you remember what that was like when he arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1141">It was a – well, it was a great relief and a great surprise when I – we found out, Harry and I were – we got a message to come to our grandfather’s house.</span> <span id="s1142">So we go there, and there’s our father.</span> <span id="s1143">So our father said, well, I’ve come to take you home, on and on and on.</span> <span id="s1144">And I don’t – here my memory is a little shaky.</span> <span id="s1145">I don’t know if he came with me and Harry to the house that my mother was renting, and told her – or if she came to my grandfather’s house.</span> <span id="s1146">But in any case, we were all ordered to pack up and get ready to go back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: So that’s pretty sudden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: That was very sudden.</span> <span id="s1149">It – I don’t know if my mother had any warning.</span> <span id="s1150">She probably received mail that said I’m – you – if you don’t come back by such and such a date, I’m coming to get you and I’m going to drag you all back here.</span> <span id="s1151">So it wa – now this is 19 – somehow I’m remembering prohibition, because my father picked up a – a – a – a prized bottle of wine – [sirens] have to wait til that – [break]</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: So you were mentioning something about your father and prohibition and a bottle of wine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: Yes, and it –</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: When he opened the suitcase, and it was Prohibition, I think he wanted to celebrate in New York with the family that we were staying with, relatives, and he went for his bottle of wine and it was broken in the suitcase.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: I mean, during Prohibition, to lose such a valuable – I thought I – he was gonna cry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: Poor guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: Anyway, that’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: So did your mother not protest about going back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: I think there must have been a m – an ultimatum of some sort.</span> <span id="s1162">He – she – I’m sure she didn’t want to come back, but in any case, we – we did come back, and – but she didn’t want to go to Savannah, she wanted to stay in New York.</span> <span id="s1163">So she made him rent a house in the Rockaways.</span> <span id="s1164">So I had a year of living on the water in Rockaway beach, and becoming an American beachcomber, you know.</span> <span id="s1165">Another experience entirely.</span> <span id="s1166">But my father was out of a job, because of this problem of –</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: You mentioned that earlier –</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: – that he had – he – because he took off to get you, he was away from the store.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: Too much.</span> <span id="s1171">And he was threatened with being fired if he went – if he went off, and sure enough he was fired.</span> <span id="s1172">So when he came back – however the son of the man who owned the department store had a bank in the – one of the Carolinas, North Carolina or South Carolina.</span> <span id="s1173">And he offered my father the opportunity of operating a refreshment stand in the bank, with Coca-Cola and – you know, sandwiches and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s1174">So my father hired somebody down there to help him, and established this little business, from which he was ma-managing to send money to my mother in the Rockaways, to pay for the house we lived in.</span> <span id="s1175">And that went along smoothly for almost a year, when she hysterically notified my father that I was – I was – that I was in the hospital, after being hit by a car.</span> <span id="s1176">Which was true, but she made it sound much worse than it really was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: Well, being hit by a car does sound kind of serious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: Well, it was Christmastime.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: And I was on the street, in ra – in Rockaways, and across the street was Santa Claus.</span> <span id="s1181">And I wanted to run over and see Santa Claus.</span> <span id="s1182">Now, I was probably around eight at this time, so I ran across and got hit by a car and was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1183">So my father came to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1184">At this point, the thing in the bank collapsed, that he had.</span> <span id="s1185">That was taken away from him because what happened was, the man he hired to help him, stole everything, and moved it out of the bank.</span> <span id="s1186">So, you know, it’s like a soap opera.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: Well, he had – you know, if he didn’t care about his family, then he probably could have saved everything, but it – clearly, he cared about you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: Oh, he did, he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q: – he cared about – and so, that took priority.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: We survived the Holocaust because he cared.</span> <span id="s1191">And that I can get to very quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: I’d like to hear that part, yeah.</span> <span id="s1193">We can talk about it now and then go back and fill in the gaps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: All right.</span> <span id="s1195">You mentioned that he cared about us.</span> <span id="s1196">Well, here’s how he cared about us.</span> <span id="s1197">In 1933, Hitler became chancellor of Germany, and was going to clean all of Europe, if not the world, of Jews.</span> <span id="s1198">Judenrein, it was going to be.</span> <span id="s1199">Well, my father ba – at that point, the only way he could survive after losing the thing in the bank, was to apply to the post office for a job, which, he took the test, but because he was a veteran of World War I, they gave him extra points so that he – he was one of the chosen.</span> <span id="s1200">Otherwise, he would have had to wait for years in line –</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q: To get a job at the post office.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: – to get a job at the post office.</span> <span id="s1203">But his – his ex-extra points from being a veteran, made it happen quicker.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: What was his job?</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: He was a – a postal car – not a postal carrier, he was a substitute postal carrier.</span> <span id="s1206">He only made money when he was sent out on a job.</span> <span id="s1207">He sat in Grand Central Station waiting for a 59 cent an hour assignment.</span> <span id="s1208">But those were – it was the great depression.</span> <span id="s1209">This is 1933 – ’32 - ’33.</span> <span id="s1210">So he borrowed money from – his father died, and left a little bit of money to him and siblings, and he bother – borrowed some of the money from siblings, and he went over to get us, to save us from Hitler, or whatever is gonna happen in Europe.</span> <span id="s1211">I don’t know that he specifically decided that he was saving us from Hitler, I think he was just simply getting very lonely after all these years.</span> <span id="s1212">This second time, we were in Lithuania for four years.</span> <span id="s1213">First time, one year, this time, four years.</span> <span id="s1214">So he wou – I – I was – we were living in Kovno at the time, or the – the suburb of Kovno, called slub – Sluborda(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: Slobodka, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: Slobodka.</span> <span id="s1217">And Slobodka was essentially a Jewish enclave.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">Q: Poor.</span> <span id="s1219">Very poor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: Very poor and Jewish and with yeshivas and synagogues, and later became a concentration camp when the Germans came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: A ghetto.</span> <span id="s1222">It became a ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: A – a ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">A: But sort of like a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1226">You couldn’t leave it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1228">No, no, no, no, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: So my father came and we got a notice from our – from relatives to – to come in and visit them.</span> <span id="s1230">Their name was the Simonses’ and they lived in Kovno proper in a very nice place, with a courtyard and wagons and horses, and very nice.</span> <span id="s1231">So they used to invited us periodically, and feed us.</span> <span id="s1232">And we always looked forward to that.</span> <span id="s1233">And we had a couple of cousins there, too, relatives of my ma – my mother’s.</span> <span id="s1234">So, we arrived there and my cousin takes me and Harry into another room and says, look who’s here.</span> <span id="s1235">And it was my father, whom we hadn't seen for three and a half years.</span> <span id="s1236">Well, it was a shock.</span> <span id="s1237">I mean, he embraced both of us, and it was very shocking.</span> <span id="s1238">And he – then he told us, he said, I’ve come to take you all home, and let’s go and get your mother and the younger brothers, David and Bernard.</span> <span id="s1239">So we went there, and they had a big discussion which I – we – I – we didn’t listen to, they held it in private.</span> <span id="s1240">And finally they came out and they had an agreement, and the agreement was that he should take the three older boys to America, and leave the youngest one with her, and she’ll join us later.</span> <span id="s1241">Well, I don’t think she ever had any intention of joining us later, she – we went to America with my father, and she returned to Zarasai from Kovno from –</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: With your youngest brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">A: With my youngest brother.</span> <span id="s1244">And – and that’s the last we ever saw of her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: Now this is what year?</span> <span id="s1246">A: 1933.</span> <span id="s1247">May of 1933.</span> <span id="s1248">And the reason I remember that so well is that when I came to America, I had to be put into school in – it was May, it was still school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">Q: School time, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: What about your brother?</span> <span id="s1252">Did he ever – what happened to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: My youngest brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: David, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A: Now we go back to my father’s caring.</span> <span id="s1256">When – when my father brought us back to America, he o – he obviously couldn’t take care of us.</span> <span id="s1257">He was a substitute postal carrier.</span> <span id="s1258">He took me to live with him in a furnished room.</span> <span id="s1259">My Uncle Harry and my Aunt Pauline in Brooklyn took my brother Harry in.</span> <span id="s1260">And Bernard, the deaf mute, was put into the New York School for the Deaf, which he never stopped crying.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: Oh, the poor fellow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: It was so sad, because he had grown up with us through thick and thin in Lithuania, and we’ll – had our own language.</span> <span id="s1263">He didn’t know sign language or any of that, he knew our language.</span> <span id="s1264">But things settled down a bit, and throughout my school days, every Friday I went to the New York School for the Deaf to pick Bernard up and bring him, and we all slept in one double bed, my father, Bernard and I, in a furnished room.</span> <span id="s1265">And then on Monday he had to be – no, Sunday night he had to be taken back to the New York School for the Deaf.</span> <span id="s1266">And that’s how we lived.</span> <span id="s1267">But now going back to my father’s caring.</span> <span id="s1268">He took care of all of us.</span> <span id="s1269">He did.</span> <span id="s1270">He checked on Harry, who was living with my – his brother, and he – for the summer he sent me to live with his sisters in South Fallsburg, and it was a wonderful treat for me, because South Fallsburg was as close as to Zarasai as you could get, surrounded by rivers and lakes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: Where is it?</span> <span id="s1272">What state is it in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">A: It’s in new – upper –</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: Oh, it’s up near –</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: – in the Catskills.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: I see, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: Catskill mountains.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: That’s why I didn’t recognize it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: Yes, Catskill mountains.</span> <span id="s1280">We had rivers and lakes and fishing, and everything that I had in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1281">And I had cousins, and I did everything with them.</span> <span id="s1282">And then, much later on, in s – when the war was already starting, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Q: 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A: 1939.</span> <span id="s1285">My father made arrangements for a young Polish man, who was emigrating to the United States – he must have done this through HIAS, or one of the Hebrew organizations, or Jewish organiza – I think it must have been HIAS, but I’m guessing.</span> <span id="s1286">He arranged for this young Polish man, on his way to America, to st – to go to Zarasai, and to go to the address where my mother was living with ber – with David, and tell David that he has tickets for them to go to America.</span> <span id="s1287">And I guessed they must have discussed the fact that if he told his mother, she wouldn’t let him go.</span> <span id="s1288">He was 14.</span> <span id="s1289">So they kept the secret, and he wound up on a train to Memel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q: Klaipėda, yeah, the port city.</span> <span id="s1291">The port city, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: No, first they – they – they wound up first in – in a Dutch city.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: Oh, then it wouldn’t be Memel, that would be further west.</span> <span id="s1294">Memel is what – in 1939, March 1939, it had been part of Lithuania and then Hitler took it back, right after Czechoslovakia –</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: – he took it back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: It wasn’t Memel, it was – it – it was a Dutch city.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: And the reason that I re – now remember that it was a Dutch city, is when the – this Polish young man and my brother went to the hotel to – to a hotel, to stay til their boat left in Antwerp, they were told n-no Jews.</span> <span id="s1300">By that time the Fifth Column of Germany had already invaded the low countries of Holland and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: Belgium and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: Belgium and Holland.</span> <span id="s1303">And they couldn’t find a place to stay, so they made their way to the port city, and just went looking for the – their –</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Q: Could it have – could Hoek von Haven – could it be – there’s a – a town called Hoek von Haven or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">A: I don’t know the details, but I – I do remember one fact that – that I think may stir something in your mind.</span> <span id="s1306">They were on a train from the Dutch city that they had landed in, they needed a train to go to where the boat was.</span> <span id="s1307">When they got on the train – and I don’t know where the train was going, but it was filled with German soldiers, and my brother told us that he started speaking Yiddish, which he was fluent in, to the German soldiers, and they shared their lunch with him, and with the Polish fellow.</span> <span id="s1308">They thought he was speaking some kind of –</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: German dialect.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: – germ – German dialect.</span> <span id="s1311">And they all got along swimmingly, and they safely got off the train to where they were going to catch the boat, and eventually they did – they must have had to go to England though, to get on a boat, because they came over on – my father had tickets for them on the German Lloyd line, but they couldn’t be used, so they had to go on a different boat.</span> <span id="s1312">Now, we were switched – originally we were switched from a German boat to the Gripsholm, which was a Swedish boat.</span> <span id="s1313">But I don’t know what –</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: That was in 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: In 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: And would have that been for political reasons, because the Nazis were in power by then –</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: – and they weren’t going to take Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: They weren’t going to take Jews on their German Lloyd line boats.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: So we sw – we switched to the Gripsholm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">A: And that was a wonderful trip, wonderful.</span> <span id="s1324">And – but now, my memory is sort of – none of this was written down, so my memory is getting a little shaky with my brother’s experiences.</span> <span id="s1325">I remember he told us all about this, but that was in 1940, or 1939, 1940.</span> <span id="s1326">I can’t even remember –</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">Q: And 75 years later we’re asking you details.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">A: I – I – the Rotterdam, I think he was on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: Ah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: I think it was the Rotterdam.</span> <span id="s1331">But he – he and the Polish guide were – just barely got onto it.</span> <span id="s1332">They arrived late, they barely got on, and so he arrived here, and unfortunately he brought – he brought his – the Lithuanian winter with him, in the form of rheumatic fever –</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">A: – which he contracted in Zarasai.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A: That’s why earlier I said, two of my brothers got sicknesses from winter, that’s all, it’s – and – and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q: They’re cold winters and they’re damp winters.</span> <span id="s1338">And it –</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">A: Damp and cold, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: Everybody was a little sick.</span> <span id="s1342">You know, you just couldn’t get enough heat in the houses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">Q: You know, but it really does speak to the extraordinary devotion your father had.</span> <span id="s1344">For somebody who was earning a living as a substitute postal carrier, to – to care and borrow and – you know, his own career, such as it would have been, was kind of shattered.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Q: But to care to that extent, that even if he had nothing, he was going to get his kids out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">A: Oh, he gave us everything.</span> <span id="s1348">He – he even eventually got a – he was still in the post office, he’d never le – never got out of the post office, but he did take the test to become a regular, so he had a regular salary, not just a pick-up salary.</span> <span id="s1349">Cause he was a temp really, before.</span> <span id="s1350">So now he was – had a regular salary, and he got a small apartment, it was a – a one bedroom apartment, but we used the living room as a bedroom also.</span> <span id="s1351">And he – he installed me into that apartment, and of course, every Friday I’d pick Bernard up and brought him to that apartment.</span> <span id="s1352">And – and then later on David arrived, so he – he ministered to all of us.</span> <span id="s1353">He didn’t let a single one of us down.</span> <span id="s1354">And when David was in the hospital with his rheumatic fever bouts, my father was there all day long.</span> <span id="s1355">Certainly on his day off.</span> <span id="s1356">And on his work days he came up as soon as he could, skipping dinner and just going straight to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1357">No, he was – he was a devoted father.</span> <span id="s1358">There’s a lot he couldn’t do for us, but I’ll even tell you this little anecdote: I had – I had to cut class in the high school in music and art, a class that went on beyond the school day, which required us to go to a museum, a art museum, and I cut it, and I went to pick up my brother Bernard, brought him home.</span> <span id="s1359">Subsequently, I was called down to the dean’s office, and was reprimanded, and I explained why, and the dean was sympathetic, but she sent a note home to my father that I’d – it was her duty to report that I had cut a class.</span> <span id="s1360">And my father gave me a note to take back to her.</span> <span id="s1361">And she called – and I met with her, and I sat with her and she opened the letter that my father sent, and it said, how do I know where he was?</span> <span id="s1362">You see him more often than I do.</span> <span id="s1363">But he – he was going to ride herd on me, you know?</span> <span id="s1364">It’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: And – no, it was at that point that I explained to her what it was all about, not before.</span> <span id="s1367">I said, well, Mrs. Dorkin(ph), let me tell you why I cut the class.</span> <span id="s1368">I have a deaf mute brother who is waiting at the gate for me to arrive, cause he is dying to be with us, and I can’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">Q: Leave him there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">A: – be late for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">A: And she said, don’t worry about it, never happen again.</span> <span id="s1373">You don’t have to ever worry.</span> <span id="s1374">So, you know, it’s like a soap opera.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: Well, it’s – it’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: But it’s real life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q: Yeah, it’s real life, and when you hear of – this is also real love, you know?</span> <span id="s1378">It’s real devotion.</span> <span id="s1379">It is when you sacrifice because they’re your kids, and they come first.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">Q: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">A: My father did that with whatever means he had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A: And sometimes he had no means at all, and he borrowed money, and hopefully he repaid it, and I’m sure knowing him, he would have.</span> <span id="s1385">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">Q: I mean, tha – I thi – I’m very touched by it.</span> <span id="s1387">I really am.</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">A: Yeah, well, when I think about it, I sometimes think, Pop, I wish you were here, just so I could show you what I’ve done.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: You know, that – I’m – that I’ve – I’ve followed your principles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1392">And that what he first – with – with the – with the funnies, you know, that it started with the funnies that he introduced you to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A: The funnies, the people in the funnies became part of our family.</span> <span id="s1394">Maggie and Jiggs, and the Katzenjammer Kids – we identified with the Katzenjammer Kids, but the Maggie and Jiggs were real weirdos to us, because she was always throwing a rolling pin at Jiggs, which I couldn’t understand.</span> <span id="s1395">It would have killed him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">A: But no, it – it’s – he created – he – he did create in us, a desire to be something, succeed at something, to follow our hearts and our – our imaginations and our creative impulses.</span> <span id="s1398">He had them, but he had to subdue them in order to be loyal to us, and take care of us.</span> <span id="s1399">He never let us down.</span> <span id="s1400">I can’t remember him ever letting me down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">Q: That’s amazing.</span> <span id="s1402">And that’s a wonderful tribute.</span> <span id="s1403">It’s just – it’s just a wonderful tribute.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: And we had our arguments, and we – I was – at times you can’t help – when you’re a callow youth, you can’t help be a ca – but be a callow youth.</span> <span id="s1405">And I would – I would say things to him like, you won’t let me have that white sweater, so I can wear, you know, the letter that I won in basketball.</span> <span id="s1406">And he’d say, get a job after school and get yourself a sweater.</span> <span id="s1407">And I said, the other kids parents pay for these things, and then we’d get into a –</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">A: – squabble over it.</span> <span id="s1410">But I, of course, with the benefit of time, I realize that he had enough on his plate that he just couldn’t carry off everything.</span> <span id="s1411">He – looking back, he did more, I think, than most people would ever do.</span> <span id="s1412">A majority of people would not – they would have given up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">A: They mu – they – even good people would have said, I can’t – I can’t handle this.</span> <span id="s1415">I can’t raise four little boys by myself, and take care of all their needs.</span> <span id="s1416">I don’t know that I could have done that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">Q: And first of all pull them out of Europe.</span> <span id="s1418">He pulls you all out of Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">A: He pulled us out of the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">A: I mean, you know, when he came over, people were not able to escape the Holocaust by then.</span> <span id="s1422">1933 was a rough time in many parts of Europe.</span> <span id="s1423">I mean, he was a bit prescient.</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">A: I mean, he beat – he beat the – the system, because it wasn’t, I think, until 1936 that things started to get really bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">Q: Well, in Germany, it was, of course, some people i-i-in Germany, as – as you probably well know, the depar – the de – the – amongst Jewish families, the question of to leave, to stay, should we leave, can we ride this out?</span> <span id="s1427">If we leave now will – what will we lose?</span> <span id="s1428">You know, all of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">Q: Some people left earlier, some people left later, some people left in 1940, almost unheard of.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">Q: But – but this – this whole question became very relevant after Hitler came to power, and from other countries, like Lithuania, it was – it were – other – there were other issues –</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">Q: – that came up.</span> <span id="s1435">But it was – then, it would have been – you know, when I’ve interviewed people who were – it would have been 1940 – 1941, that’s when the cutoff is, you know, that you can’t leave, because the Germans have come in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">Q: And before – so, but let’s go back to – let’s go back to your mother.</span> <span id="s1438">When you leave in 1933 to go back with your father, is that the last time you saw her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">A: That is the last time I ever saw my mother.</span> <span id="s1440">We did get a couple of pieces of mail, and very warm, loving letters pleading with us not to forget her.</span> <span id="s1441">Very touching.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">Q: Any explanation?</span> <span id="s1443">Was any explanation ever given to you why she did not come to the United States again?</span> <span id="s1444">Why she stayed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">A: None that I know of.</span> <span id="s1446">I have never heard any explanation.</span> <span id="s1447">The – the counterpoint to what we were talking about, my father’s loyalty, and his dedication to saving his children, the counterpoint to that – to that puzzle is my mother not seeming to care.</span> <span id="s1448">I mean, you would think that she would have rushed – she would have written letters to my father – she could have communicated, there was no question about it – and saying get me out of here, I want to see my children.</span> <span id="s1449">Now, the – the only thing I can conclude is that there must have been some kind of mental breakdown, which would be understandable, certainly in the co – in the context of her letting her husband take three children away, and eventually losing the fourth one as well.</span> <span id="s1450">So, I could see a – a breakdown, but I have no – I tried, through the Red Cross to – to – I wrote to the Red Cross and asked them if they had any kind of way of tracing someone in Lithuania, and the answer I got was basically that while the Germans kept meticulous records of everything, which is typically German, the Lithuanians did not keep records at all, she s – they said.</span> <span id="s1451">So I didn’t turn to the Holocaust Museum, I thought about it many times.</span> <span id="s1452">But I wonder if the Holocaust Museum might have a record of what happened in Zarasai, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">Q: Oh, what happened in Zarasai, we probably do, and we will see ho – what we could supply.</span> <span id="s1454">But for this interview, it is that you’ve never found out.</span> <span id="s1455">Is that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">A: I never found out anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">Q: So, do y – and was it a handful of letters you got since 1933?</span> <span id="s1458">You know, between the time she could write, until the time she could not write any more?</span> <span id="s1459">Was it once a month, like you said –</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">A: No –</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: – your father would send you something once a month when you were in Zarasai.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">A: I – I don’t recall getting – I – I think we got one – one thing that – there’s a little bit of a mystery here.</span> <span id="s1463">When my book was being done, I – I received a package from my cousin in the Catskills with – whose family I had lived when I was a bo – a little boy, and Bernie sent me a package that his parents had left behind when they died.</span> <span id="s1464">And one of them contained a whole bunch of photographs of my mother and father, including my father in uniform.</span> <span id="s1465">These were things that ma – apparently wound up in my father’s sister’s hands.</span> <span id="s1466">And there was also a picture of my mother, and written on the picture wa – back of the picture was – it was in Lithuania, and it says, do not forget me.</span> <span id="s1467">That was where that came from.</span> <span id="s1468">So there were mix – a mixture of – of artifacts, but I have no direct mail, nothing that I can recall that she wrote directly to us.</span> <span id="s1469">She might have written to my father, she might have written to her sister, or other people, but I have nothing.</span> <span id="s1470">I don’t recall anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: It’s quite a gap.</span> <span id="s1472">It’s quite a gap, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">A: It is a gap there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1476">And you’d think something would have happened after she lost my youngest brother, when he was wi – whisked away by –</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">A: – this fellow who brought him to America.</span> <span id="s1479">No, it’s all a mystery.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">Q: Did you think about it much over the years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">A: Yeah, I think about it periodically.</span> <span id="s1482">It’s – it’s unfinished – it’s unfinished, important in – life story.</span> <span id="s1483">But you know, our defenses rise up.</span> <span id="s1484">You – in order to survive, you can’t dwell on – on horror of the past, or a-any – anything.</span> <span id="s1485">You just have to move on.</span> <span id="s1486">And so, that’s been my defense, I – I just move on.</span> <span id="s1487">Fortunately, my father didn’t have that attitude.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">Q: Well, you know, it sounds to me like you lost your mother more than one time.</span> <span id="s1489">You lost her in a very personal way, as a family, as a mother, and then you lost her because there was the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1491">I had heard that, like in all the countries of Europe, and that includes Italy and Spain and Bulgaria; and you just name them all: Hungary, Romania, they all had local Nazi sympathizers.</span> <span id="s1492">And so the – the story I heard was, once the Germans came in, even in a small group, and empowered the local se – sympathizers, they had people joining their group, local bigots, anti-Semites, or what have you, opportunists, and they just did what the Germans wanted them to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">Q: It did happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">A: That happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">Q: That happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">Q: Now, had you heard about that in general, or about your mother’s pi – situation, or Zarasai in particular.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">A: In sizi – yes, I heard about Zarasai.</span> <span id="s1499">I can’t remember fr – exactly from whom, but the thing that I heard about Zarasai was the main road out of town was cut off, so that the Jews were trapped with no –</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">Q: In the town, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">A: – in Zarasai, with nowhere to go.</span> <span id="s1502">And then they were all rounded up and taken to the woods that I loved, where I used to get my fishing poles, and pick strawberries, the little ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">Q: They’re delicious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">A: They’re wonderful, the little, tiny things.</span> <span id="s1505">And we used to get baskets full of them.</span> <span id="s1506">And well la – you know, it was like Huckleberry Finn, I’m te – I’m telling you, Tom Sawyer.</span> <span id="s1507">And we lived the good life when – you know, when we were able to go to these things.</span> <span id="s1508">So th-the story is that they cut off the exit from town on the main road, and then rounded them up and took them to the woods and killed them.</span> <span id="s1509">And this di – not only happened in Lithuania, it happened in Poland, it happened in Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, every – you know, everywhere.</span> <span id="s1510">It’s a strange kind of opportunism to curry favor by killing people, but that’s what people did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">Q: There’s some things that we try to find answers for, and sometimes we find partial answers, but some parts of those always remain inexplicable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A: Inexplicable is the correct answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">A: Yeah, because we just don’t expect human beings to behave in an inhuman way, and – but they do, oth – if they didn’t, we wouldn’t have any more wars.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: Well, you know, this is one of the reasons why earlier, when we were talking about relations between Jews and non-Jews, and whatever your personal experience might have been in Zarasai, I wanted to get a sense of how you viewed whatever was going on there, in the context of other places, because if – if the message is that this was just as normal, you had a normal kind of life there, as there could be in any other place, that means that – that means a very spooky thing.</span> <span id="s1516">That means that you put the right kind of forces together, and these things can happen anywhere.</span> <span id="s1517">They didn’t ha – genocide didn’t happen everywhere.</span> <span id="s1518">It happened in particular places, within a hor – historical context, when there was a final solution.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">Q: But it’s the ingredients in the cauldron.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1522">I think self-preservation is a consuming motivation, because you either – the thinking among certain people who are very scared of everything, if you don’t join them, you become the victims.</span> <span id="s1523">You – your choice is to join the bad guys, or die as the good guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">Q: Oftentimes, that is how people saw things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">Q: Oftentimes – is that a full answer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">Q: I still think that there is –</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">A: Well, I just can’t picture being with a large armed Jewish group, out to have sport by killing Gypsies, or some other unfavored – black people, you know.</span> <span id="s1530">I – I just can’t picture even entertaining such a notion, it’s – it’s – it’s so preposterous.</span> <span id="s1531">And yet, there are people who get down to where they say to themselves, if – if I don’t join that gang, the gang is gonna kill me, so I better join the gang.</span> <span id="s1532">That’s how gangs recruit people, they threaten them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">A: And I think it would be very easy to threaten a non-educated farmer in Lithuania and tell him, if you don’t get rid of the Jews in the next farm, we’re gonna burn your farm down, you know.</span> <span id="s1535">So what are you going to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">Q: Well, you know, that’s how – what the – that’s what we do when we don’t know – we suppose.</span> <span id="s1537">We suppose.</span> <span id="s1538">And it could very well have been this, it could have been, I want his cow, I want his – the one car that’s in town.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">Q: It could be –</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">A: It –</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">Q: – it could be –</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">A: It could be any number of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">Q: It could be any number of things –</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">Q: – but there is something different when a war comes on when – when you have a force that, you know, an occupying power that has this policy.</span> <span id="s1547">And so what do they do in order to convince you to take part in somebody else’s repression and – and annihilation?</span> <span id="s1548">You know, how do you – how do you explain that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">A: It’s Schadenfreude.</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">A: Thank God it’s not me they’re after, you know.</span> <span id="s1552">It takes a lot of courage to stand up with the persecuted and say, you want to do things to them, you do them to me, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">Q: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">A: You know.</span> <span id="s1555">So – but it’s – it’s – courage is not an easy thing to come by.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">A: And I don’t claim to have any of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">Q: Well, we don’t know what we’d be like in – in any sit – I mean, unless you’re tested, you don’t know how you’d react.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">A: You don’t – you really don’t know.</span> <span id="s1560">And that’s why I appreciate the Holocaust Museum’s efforts so much, is that it’s not – in my view, it’s not so much remembering the fallen as to hold a mirror up to humanity and say, you want to be like these people, you want a world that – like that to live in?</span> <span id="s1561">It’s – it’s horrible.</span> <span id="s1562">Let’s not ever allow this to happen again.</span> <span id="s1563">And course it can – you know, of course today it’s Jews, tomorrow it’s black people, the day after it’s Chinese people.</span> <span id="s1564">It – it’s always a –</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">Q: Take your pick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">A: – you can pick a victim anywhere you look.</span> <span id="s1567">But no, we’re all part of the same race, we’re human beings and we need to treat each other that way.</span> <span id="s1568">Of course, I’m only, you know, sounding off about something that’s – everyone knows is a basic truism.</span> <span id="s1569">But it bears repeating.</span> <span id="s1570">I mean, I’m not ashamed that I repeat myself with these kinds of things.</span> <span id="s1571">Yes, we’re all in it together.</span> <span id="s1572">It’s one world, we’re all brothers, we’re all eating – eating and drinking and – and trying to preserve things for our children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren and the millions of others who are yet to come.</span> <span id="s1573">And hopefully, by example, we can – by doing something about it, by at least talking about things, showing how bad things are not to be – that shouldn’t be repeated, perhaps someday it’ll happen, that people will no longer hate each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">Q: Well, the point – I think also, if we don’t do it, it will be a lot worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">A: Yes, it will be a lot worse, because the world is becoming more crowded, and there’s less of it, because of climate change, which is encroaching on the lowlands.</span> <span id="s1576">Islands are disappearing slowly, continents are shrinking and populations are growing, and food sources are becoming less abundant.</span> <span id="s1577">And so we’re either gonna have to get along together, or perish together, eventually.</span> <span id="s1578">I mean, I know a lot of people say I won’t live long enough to see the horrors of – o-o-of – of global warming.</span> <span id="s1579">And in my case that’s certainly true, I – I mean, I don’t have to worry about it happening in the next 25 years, because I’m not going to be here in 25 years.</span> <span id="s1580">But my great-grandchildren, whom I love dearly, will be here in 25 years, and I want them to have a future, as I want everybody’s children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren to have.</span> <span id="s1581">So that’s wh – that’s why we – we talk about remembering.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">Q: Thank you, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">A: You’re welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">Q: I couldn’t have thought of a better way to conclude our interview today than that.</span> <span id="s1585">I really, really appreciate it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">A: Thank you, Ina.</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">Q: You’re welcome.</span> <span id="s1588">And I’ll say with this, that concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum’s interview with Mr. Al Jaffee, on May 21st, 2016, in Manhattan, New York.</span> <span id="s1589">Thanks again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">A: Thank you.</span> <span id="s1591">[break]</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q: Okay, so we started talking about a few things off camera, that I really asked if we would be able to repeat on camera.</span> <span id="s1593">So this is going to be an accretion to the interview with Mr. Al Jaffee on May 21st, by the U.S. Holocaust Museum, and we were talking about – about legacies in some ways, so if you could – if you could give me a sense of what is it that you got from having lived in Zarasai that you couldn’t have here, and what is it that you got from here that you couldn’t have there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">A: Oh, what an interesting question.</span> <span id="s1595">I can quickly tell you what I brought from here to Zarasai, and how – how it helped me integrate into s – z – the children’s society of Zarasai.</span> <span id="s1596">First of all, most of the little guys that I met in Zarasai had never seen a train, a plane.</span> <span id="s1597">They have seen maybe one or two automobiles in their lifetime so far: they were six or seven years old.</span> <span id="s1598">But there’s – there’s so much that never arrived in Zarasai for them.</span> <span id="s1599">And I would regale them with stories about subway trains that arrive every five minutes and 2,000 people shove their way in, and go to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">Q: The ones that terrified you so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">A: Yes, the one that terrified me.</span> <span id="s1602">And – but they – you know, their mouths would hang open, and they would ask questions: how fast does this train go, and is it above the ground?</span> <span id="s1603">And I said, well, some of them are above ground; they’re known as the elevated tracks, and some are subways, they go underground.</span> <span id="s1604">And there’s a new train every 10 - 15 minutes.</span> <span id="s1605">And the kids would say to me, how many trains are there?</span> <span id="s1606">And I would say oh, there are – they go around the whole city, and it’s just a continuous train tr – bunch of trains every 10 - 15 minutes.</span> <span id="s1607">And I would tell them about trips I had taken in buses and cars and with my father.</span> <span id="s1608">And air – airplanes that we watched take off and land.</span> <span id="s1609">And they – they were staggered with – with curiosity.</span> <span id="s1610">And – but then, I learned a lot from them.</span> <span id="s1611">I learned how to – I – I didn’t know how to swim, so I learned how to make swimming – what do you call a –</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">Q: A raft of some kind?</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">A: Thing that you lie down on that supports you in the water, and you – you practice swimming.</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">Q: Oh well, it’s not a raft then, but I know what you mean –</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">A: Water wings, or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">Q: Yeah, something like that, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">A: Anyway, I learned how to make so many things.</span> <span id="s1618">We made our own toys, we made our own wagons, we made our own sleds.</span> <span id="s1619">We – we – [phone ringing] [break]</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">Q: So, you said you learned how to make things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">A: The – I learned a lot of how you – in Zarasai you didn’t have Woolworth’s and other stores that you could go in and buy whatever device you needed.</span> <span id="s1622">If you needed a device, you either made it, or you went without.</span> <span id="s1623">And the way to find out how to make it was to consult the local people.</span> <span id="s1624">My friend Karowlka(ph) taught me a lot of things; how to – how – how to – I’ll give you an example of something – to go fishing was a – a very interesting occ – pri – you know, business for us, and – because the town was surrounded by lakes.</span> <span id="s1625">But you need a fishing pole.</span> <span id="s1626">Well, that’s very easy.</span> <span id="s1627">You go to the local woods, and you find a sapling that’s just the right length and the right size, and you cut it down, and that’s your fishing pole.</span> <span id="s1628">Now you need fishing line.</span> <span id="s1629">Well, you can’t use just anything.</span> <span id="s1630">But there are white horses, and white horses have long, white tails, and you just pull out a few strands here and there, and you braid them, and it turns into the – a-and then you – you have like a – maybe a two or three foot length, and you get about six or seven of those, and now you have a terrific fishing line.</span> <span id="s1631">The – the bobber is simple, a goose quill and a cork, and you put a hole in the cork and you put the goose quill through it, and then you run your line through it.</span> <span id="s1632">The only think you have to buy is the fish hook.</span> <span id="s1633">Nobody knows how to make a fish hook.</span> <span id="s1634">And the store always has fish hooks.</span> <span id="s1635">So we went fishing all the time with these things, and we caught the fish, we fried the fish and we ate the fish and we had a wonderful time.</span> <span id="s1636">But we also – you could buy sleds in the wintertime, but my brother Harry and I loved to play – play with wood, and we would make our own sleds, they were simple things, but – but we di – we didn’t bother wi – sl-sleds were really so cheap that we were able to get a few pennies to buy sleds.</span> <span id="s1637">But we made our ice skates.</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">Q: You made your own ice skates?</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">A: We made our own ice skates because all it took was le-leather straps, a piece of wood, and then you go to the local blacksmith and he puts a little strip of iron underneath as – as a runner.</span> <span id="s1640">And you put the straps – nail the straps to the piece of wood, and you put it on your feet.</span> <span id="s1641">It worked.</span> <span id="s1642">I mean, we went ice skating with these things and had a wonderful time.</span> <span id="s1643">So, we learned how – we learned how to swim, we learned how to ice skate, we learned how – how to catch fish.</span> <span id="s1644">In the wintertime we got – we got sp – poles that were similar to our fishing poles, only heavier, and we put a – a spear at the end of it, and you could spear fish through holes made in the ice.</span> <span id="s1645">So – but all these things were local lore, and you ask people, and they showed you how to do it, and then you did it, and – also, there were no street lights.</span> <span id="s1646">And when we would go visit our friends at night, you would overstay too long, and no – there was no one nagging you who said you better go home, it’s going to get dark and all that.</span> <span id="s1647">It just got dark, and the p – the parents of our friends said, you better go home now.</span> <span id="s1648">And now we got a couple of kilometers to walk in absolute pitch darkness, imagining that there are wolves out there.</span> <span id="s1649">So, you make a lantern.</span> <span id="s1650">And it’s very easy to make a lantern, Harry and I made so many lanterns, all made out of little pieces of wood, you – and you – you go to a glazier, they cut you a little – a little rectangle of glass, and you slip it in – on thr – three or four sides of this little thing.</span> <span id="s1651">It’s not easy to describe, but just –</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">Q: But you made it, you made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">A: But we made it.</span> <span id="s1654">And we felt very jolly marching home in the absolute darkness with our little lanterns.</span> <span id="s1655">And we did this with everything.</span> <span id="s1656">We did this for capturing fruit from trees.</span> <span id="s1657">The same kind of pole that we made the fishing pole out of, also served to have a hook at the end that you could reach up and snare an apple.</span> <span id="s1658">So we never went hungry, because the whole town had nothing but apple trees and pear trees and plum trees, and – depending on what time of the season, we could always get something to eat that way.</span> <span id="s1659">And – but being creative, making things, making what you need instead of going out to buy it, was an experience I’ll never forget, and it has served me well in the rest of my life because before I go out to buy something, I think, what do I have around that I can make it out of?</span> <span id="s1660">And when I had a house and a basement and a – and some tools, I made a – a lot of things.</span> <span id="s1661">I made toys for my children.</span> <span id="s1662">I made, you know, all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s1663">So I learned a lot in Zarasai, Lithuania, which I will never forget, and it’s – any time I’m feeling a little bit blue, with nothing to do, I think back to those days when I made all those things that gave us so much pleasure.</span> <span id="s1664">And so Lithuania – for me, Lithuania was a wonderful experience.</span> <span id="s1665">I – I enjoyed the country boy life.</span> <span id="s1666">I mean, it was – it was just like Tom Sawyer or Huckleberry Finn.</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">Q: Well, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">A: You’re welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">Q: Thank you for bringing it to life for us.</span> <span id="s1670">Thanks again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">A: My pleasure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1673">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">Conclusion of Interview</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">PAGE</span></p>
