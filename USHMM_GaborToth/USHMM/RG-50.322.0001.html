Orenstein</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Typed Maureen Barash</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Q: This is an interview with Mrs. Helen Abramowitz.</span> <span id="s8">This is Julie Orenstein.</span> <span id="s9">It is July 30, 1984.</span> <span id="s10">We are in the dining room of her home.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">What is your name?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: My name is Helen Hofmann Abramowitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: How old are you?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: I am 57 (Fifty-Seven Years Old.)</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: In Nevarask, Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: Did you grow up there?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: I lived there until I was eleven.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: Do you know when or why your family came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s21">My father came there after graduating from medical school in Vienna.</span> <span id="s22">There was a good opportunity for him there to open a practice.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: Did he meet your mother there?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: No they married in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: So your parents were from Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: No.</span> <span id="s27">No.</span> <span id="s28">My parents are both from what was then the Austrian-Hungarian monarchy.</span> <span id="s29">After 1918 it became Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s30">They were both from Bohemia.</span> <span id="s31">(This is the province which includes Prague).</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Had their families lived there for generations?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: So your father was a doctor?</span> <span id="s35">Did your mother also work?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: My mother was also a doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Was that not rare at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: Yes, very rare, for a woman to go to medical school.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Did she also go to school the same place your father did?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s41">At the University of Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: So they had quite a lot of education then.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s44">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Had that been in the family to have advanced education?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s47">Her father was an attorney.</span> <span id="s48">His father was a businessman, but he had had some training in accounting.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Had their mothers also had advanced education?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: No!</span> <span id="s51">Neither of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: First, since your parents moved away from the family home I will ask about your grandparents.</span> <span id="s53">Were they Orthodox?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: No.</span> <span id="s55">No.</span> <span id="s56">My mother’s parents were very assimilated.</span> <span id="s57">They were what you might call ultra-reform.</span> <span id="s58">My father’s parents, originally may have been orthodox, but they were not in later years, not when I knew them.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: Your parents, were they religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: No.</span> <span id="s61">Not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Did they attend services on the Shabbat and the High Holy Days?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Not on the Shabbat.</span> <span id="s64">Maybe three times a year.</span> <span id="s65">They considered themselves Jewish, but they did not practice in any way.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Do you have any siblings?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: I do not have any.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q; Just out of curiosity, do you believe that, if you had had a brother, he would have been Bar Mitzvah?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Yes, I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Did you receive Religious Education?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Some.</span> <span id="s72">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: What kind?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: From an after-school program.</span> <span id="s75">That was run during the school day by the Jewish Community.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">You know like the new law which got passed on the grounds of the school.</span> <span id="s77">I learned to read Hebrew and I learned a little Jewish History.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: That was in the public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: It was housed in the public school, it was not part of the public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Were your school friends mostly Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: No.</span> <span id="s82">Not at all.</span> <span id="s83">There were no Jewish schools in the town I grew up in.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Did you have other members of the family living in the house, besides your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: No.</span> <span id="s86">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: What was the language that was spoken at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: German.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Did your parents know any other languages at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: They spoke Czech fluently, my mother, at that time, spoke French reasonably well and some English.</span> <span id="s91">This is about all.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: Did you think of yourself as among the upper class of society or middle class?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Upper middle class.</span> <span id="s94">In retrospect I would say, probably middle class.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Your parents had non-Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Do you have any idea what percentage were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Actually most of the people they were close to were Jewish.</span> <span id="s99">They were also very assimilated.</span> <span id="s100">These were the people, who, in central Europe, felt that if you had the intelligence you did not need to be religious.</span> <span id="s101">That was the Intelligencia’s rejection of what was traditional orthodox Judaism, that is the modern version of orthodox Judaism.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: They probably did not socialize much at the synagogue then?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: No.</span> <span id="s104">No.</span> <span id="s105">The synagogue was not a place to socialize.</span> <span id="s106">It was not a community center type of thing, it was a synagogue, a house of worship.</span> <span id="s107">I believe that it had a small school with it.</span> <span id="s108">I am not sure about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: What kind of activities or social groups did they belong to?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: They really did not belong to any group.</span> <span id="s111">My father belonged to B’nai Brith (a Jewish fraternal organization which exists also in the United States).</span> <span id="s112">I do not believe he went often, but he belonged.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: What kind of things did they do?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: As far as I know, mainly social things.</span> <span id="s115">They also had some lectures, if I remember right.</span> <span id="s116">He was active in the medical society.</span> <span id="s117">My mother was not active in anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Did they go to the theater or to the opera?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: No.</span> <span id="s120">There was not much of that in the town where I grew up.</span> <span id="s121">When they had the chance and they went to Prague.</span> <span id="s122">they went to the opera.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: What was the town like that you grew up in?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: Light industry; it was a small town.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: What kind of industry?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Mainly textiles.</span> <span id="s127">It was mostly textiles there.</span> <span id="s128">As far as the cultural life is concerned, I really do not know.</span> <span id="s129">You know at the age of eleven you do not give that much thought.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: What kind of political activities did you have?</span> <span id="s131">I realize that you were a little young for that.</span> <span id="s132">Do you remember any political activity on the part of your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: My parents considered themselves liberal, very liberal.</span> <span id="s134">They went along with the very liberal orientation of the Czech government.</span> <span id="s135">It was not really safe in the Sudetenlandt (that was the area between Prague and Breslau centered around which Hitler claimed initially from Czechoslovakia under the pretext that it had been settled by “ethnic Germans”) to be politically active, as a Jew.</span> <span id="s136">You simply did not do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: So they kept their sympathies a secret.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Oh, yes!</span> <span id="s139">People knew who they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: How would you describe your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Oh, I was an only child of older parents.</span> <span id="s142">They had pretty much developed their own interests and really did not have much understanding for a child.</span> <span id="s143">My parents were not very amicable, as a matter of fact they separated when I was only ten.</span> <span id="s144">They demanded a great deal from me, and I got to demand even more of myself.</span> <span id="s145">It was not a very child oriented home.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: So you were expected to perform in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: Yes -- that is right.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: Did you rebel?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: No.</span> <span id="s150">I performed in school.</span> <span id="s151">I think that I rebelled in other ways.</span> <span id="s152">I was not the most obedient child which my mother would have loved to have had.</span> <span id="s153">You know when you have your first child when you are thirty-five, you are not as elastic as, or as giving, or as mobile as when you have your first child a lot younger than that.</span> <span id="s154">I think that I was difficult to raise and my mother was very resentful of that.</span> <span id="s155">She liked children, but I just did not fit that well that mold of the kind of children she would have liked to have had.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Did they expect talent from you, such as musical talent?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Not really, no.</span> <span id="s158">They accepted that fact, that I was tone deaf, pretty well.</span> <span id="s159">They did not want me to become an actor because that was too hard a life.</span> <span id="s160">They wanted me to do well in school, and naturally to go through the Gymnasium (the high school to which you did not have to go in that area since the law required you only to attend school until you were fourteen years old) and then to the university.</span> <span id="s161">As to what I was going to do.</span> <span id="s162">Well, at age ten, you do not really worry about that, much.</span> <span id="s163">Well, during the last few years in that town, they were involved with their own safety.</span> <span id="s164">It was very obvious that things were going to happen and my father was getting himself set up so that he could leave the country, which he did.</span> <span id="s165">He traveled a lot.</span> <span id="s166">He did quite a few things outdoors.</span> <span id="s167">He took me along for that.</span> <span id="s168">We went skiing and vacationing on lakes, and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Do you recall any special events?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: No.</span> <span id="s171">Not particularly.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: You said that you had regular school and that you had religious training after that.</span> <span id="s173">How many years did that go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Oh I would say four or five maybe.</span> <span id="s175">I attended a German public school for the first four years and then it was no longer safe for a Jew to attend German school.</span> <span id="s176">So I attended a Czech public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: When you speak of German school, do you mean a school in another part of your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: No.</span> <span id="s179">The part of Czechoslovakia I grew up in is the Sudeten Land which is essentially a German speaking area.</span> <span id="s180">That was north of the border of Bohemia, up to the Silesian border.</span> <span id="s181">It includes the mountainous area called the Sudetes which provided a defensible buffer between Germany and Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s182">This was the reason why it was selected as the border when Czechoslovakia was set up at the end of World War I.</span> <span id="s183">A great percentage of the people living in the area were German oriented although they considered themselves Czech.</span> <span id="s184">The influx of the Hitler movement made it so that Jews just did not go to German speaking schools anymore.</span> <span id="s185">Actually the German school was a private school, so that they had a right to say: “We do not want you anymore”.</span> <span id="s186">This resulted in my learning Czech very quickly!</span> <span id="s187">I had to do that to attend the school.</span> <span id="s188">The Czech school was the public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: So that is where you had your religious education.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: No.</span> <span id="s191">I actually had had that in the other school also (all schools, by regulations, have to operate under the same set of rules), but now I had it in the Czech school.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: This religious education, how did the government relate to that?</span> <span id="s193">Did they support it at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: I do not think so.</span> <span id="s195">I believe that it was supported by the Jewish Community, which sent a teacher to the public school building.</span> <span id="s196">Come to think of it, when I attended the German school, we had to go to a Czech school building.</span> <span id="s197">I do not know: the government may have supported it.</span> <span id="s198">I really do not know.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Were you aware of anti-Semitism in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s201">That was the big reason why we left the German speaking school.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Was it from the teachers or mostly from the students?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: No.</span> <span id="s204">It was rather subtle, but it was there and my parents tried to shield me from it.</span> <span id="s205">This was one of the big reasons why they took me out of there.</span> <span id="s206">However, you learned that you did not associate with German children anymore.</span> <span id="s207">Then you began to make friends among the Czech speaking population.</span> <span id="s208">These were the people who were not anti-Semitic, as a matter of fact they were anti-Germans who had gone toward the Nazi (National Socialists, i.e., the party formed and led by Hitler which took over the German government in January 1933) movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: So in the Czech school, it was a little bit better?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s211">By that time the Jewish children who were left in my town -- and I do not remember numbers -- were attending Czech schools.</span> <span id="s212">We had gotten the word that we did not belong in the German school.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: How did you feel about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: That is a long way back, you know.</span> <span id="s215">I can only assume to remember.</span> <span id="s216">I am not sure that I actually do remember.</span> <span id="s217">You know there was a good deal of fear on the street.</span> <span id="s218">There was also a good deal of fear from the people whom we used to know, who no longer talked to us.</span> <span id="s219">They actually went across the street when they saw you.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Were you ever physically attacked?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: No.</span> <span id="s222">I was never physically attacked.</span> <span id="s223">I never saw anybody being physically attacked.</span> <span id="s224">In our community, it was a matter of being ostracized.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: As I talk to many people, most of them older than you, who were adults when that happened, they had such a long history of anti-Semitic acts against them that they did not seem at all surprised when it escalated to this.</span> <span id="s226">Did that apply to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: No.</span> <span id="s228">We were very surprised.</span> <span id="s229">I remember that by the time my mother had moved to Prague which was in the center of Bohemia, the Anschluss (the German army moving into Austria after civil unrest and a plebiscite) had taken place with Austria and Hitler made it known that the Sudeten Land was next in his planned expansion of Germany.</span> <span id="s230">So it was just a question of time until he occupied it.</span> <span id="s231">So the drama which was involved, when I realized that he was going to march, is what I remember most, because I thought the march was going to take place immediately, so I had great fear.</span> <span id="s232">We had been in Prague for the weekend and I felt that I had to come back to go to school.</span> <span id="s233">That Monday night, I remember it very clearly, Hitler spoke over the radio and we listened.</span> <span id="s234">My father had left word with our maid – at the time we had a live-in maid -- that if Hitler had indicated that he was going to march into the Sudeten Land, friends were to take me back to Prague.</span> <span id="s235">Prague was still going to be free.</span> <span id="s236">This was in 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Your parents separated in 1937?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Yes, in 1937.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Your mother lived in Prague?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Yes, in Prague.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: You stayed with your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Yes, I stayed with my father.</span> <span id="s243">Then in 1938, we all left the Sudeten Land and we all lived in Prague a while.</span> <span id="s244">(On September 30, 1938, the Munich accords were signed by Neville Chamberlain of Great Britain, Edouard Deladier of France, Adolf Hitler of Germany, and Benito Mussolini of Italy to transfer the Sudeten region from Czechoslovakia to Germany over the objectives of the Czech president Eduard Benes).</span> <span id="s245">My father had already applied for a visa to the United States.</span> <span id="s246">His and my visa came through, but I did not want to leave.</span> <span id="s247">I do not believe that he was too anxious to take me either.</span> <span id="s248">He left in 1938, with the understanding that they would extend my visa and that I would, eventually follow him.</span> <span id="s249">(On March 15, 1939, German troops crossed the Czech border at dawn.</span> <span id="s250">No shots were fired.</span> <span id="s251">Hitler was in Prague for a speech eight hours after the border crossing.)</span> <span id="s252">I was to follow him in the beginning of 1939.</span> <span id="s253">In the meantime, I stayed with my mother, in Prague.</span> <span id="s254">I went to a Czech school.</span> <span id="s255">I think those who thought and those who were prepared knew that it was only a matter of time.</span> <span id="s256">My father was amongst those people who thought and were prepared.</span> <span id="s257">He had put money into a Swiss bank and he left, as he did.</span> <span id="s258">He was able to get most of his furniture out.</span> <span id="s259">He had a lot of very good connections, people who did a lot of this for him.</span> <span id="s260">People who packed the furniture to be shipped to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: How was it possible to get all these possessions out?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: I believe that this was less difficult from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s263">It was less (probably meaning more?)</span> <span id="s264">difficult in the Sudeten Land.</span> <span id="s265">(It was of course no longer possible after the German occupation of the area).</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: He left in 1938?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Yes, in 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: You stayed with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: I stayed with my mother.</span> <span id="s270">When we went to the United States consulate in the beginning of 1939 to renew my visa the consul said: “No way!</span> <span id="s271">You need to get out.</span> <span id="s272">We will not renew it because we know this is serious.”</span> <span id="s273">So I left on March 3rd, so I arrived in the United States on March 3rd?</span> <span id="s274">My mother took me to Paris and to the boat and my father met me in New York City.</span> <span id="s275">She stayed for another year because her mother was still there, and her sister was there.</span> <span id="s276">My mother had applied for a visa to go to both America and to go to Australia.</span> <span id="s277">That was with her sister and brother-in-law who wanted to go to Australia where they had some business connections.</span> <span id="s278">They went to Australia in 1939 and my mother came to this country in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Now what was that year like after your father left and you were with your mother (it was more like six months than one year) -- did you attend school at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: Oh sure.</span> <span id="s281">It was fairly normal in Prague, especially if you spoke Czech.</span> <span id="s282">That made you part of the native scene and it was pretty comfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: So it was just a matter of waiting for visas?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s285">Well I was not aware that things were going to happen that quickly.</span> <span id="s286">I do not think that my mother was.</span> <span id="s287">However, obviously the United States government was, since they would not renew the visa.</span> <span id="s288">However in 1940, even a year later, my mother was able to get out (that however was much more difficult and dangerous since a shooting war was in effect since September 1939).</span> <span id="s289">Czechoslovakia was occupied by Germany, a warring nation, and steam ships were being torpedoed.</span> <span id="s290">United States passenger ships no longer sailed to Europe.</span> <span id="s291">Italian steamships sailed until June 1940 and the Trans-Siberian railroad operated until June 1941.</span> <span id="s292">Things were not that tough in Czechoslovakia until much later.</span> <span id="s293">My mother was able to send possessions out.</span> <span id="s294">In 1940 my aunt and uncle sent all their things to Australia (this may be slightly in error since Australia had entered the war in September 1939 against Germany, so the things may have left earlier), so they were able to get things out.</span> <span id="s295">I suspect that it may have cost them money, but I do not know that for sure.</span> <span id="s296">Now my grandmother did not get out.</span> <span id="s297">She was in the B’nai Brith Home for the Elderly and they did not get out.</span> <span id="s298">The whole home was apparently deported to Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: How was the boat ride to the United States?</span> <span id="s300">Were you alone or were you with someone you knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: My mother had made the acquaintance of a lady who proposed to look after me.</span> <span id="s302">You know, I was twelve.</span> <span id="s303">She was seasick all the time.</span> <span id="s304">I looked after myself pretty much.</span> <span id="s305">I guess being on the boat was just it.</span> <span id="s306">I am assuming that some people looked after me, but I am not certain.</span> <span id="s307">I was pretty big in size and pretty self-sufficient.</span> <span id="s308">So I guess I was all right.</span> <span id="s309">I was also pretty shy of people, so I did not let anyone do much helping.</span> <span id="s310">Actually, I let them do as little as possible.</span> <span id="s311">Well, I remember getting into this country and I did not know any English.</span> <span id="s312">While I was in Prague I had studied a little bit of English, but you know how much you learn in this short time.</span> <span id="s313">I was of course, concerned about that, but my father met me and so it worked out.</span> <span id="s314">By then he already spoke some English.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: How did your perception of yourself as a Jewish person develop or change?</span> <span id="s316">Did you find yourself wishing that there was more religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Yes, but not until much later.</span> <span id="s318">Not actually until I went to college.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: I find myself wondering how this persecution changed your feelings.</span> <span id="s320">Obviously, I did talk to many people who had no conception of themselves as Jews, and then who suddenly find themselves suddenly, faced with a very negative concept, changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: I guess I never experienced really that much anguish or danger that I really can remember it having much effect on me.</span> <span id="s322">Well, I remember that when I went into New York, and there I did not continue my religious education.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: You did not?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: No.</span> <span id="s325">But we did go to synagogue for the Holy Days.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Was that the first time you went?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: No.</span> <span id="s328">I had gone in Prague.</span> <span id="s329">I went with my father on occasion.</span> <span id="s330">My mother never went, but I went with him on occasion.</span> <span id="s331">You see we were a totally assimilated home, with Christmas, the whole bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Did you ever attend church?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: No.</span> <span id="s334">No!</span> <span id="s335">They tried it themselves.</span> <span id="s336">My father was very proud to be a Jew.</span> <span id="s337">My mother never felt very strongly about it.</span> <span id="s338">It did not matter to her whether I married someone Jewish or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: What did you think would happen if Hitler had overrun the Sudeten Land while you were there?</span> <span id="s340">What were your fears?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: I remember that.</span> <span id="s342">It was of being killed.</span> <span id="s343">However that was not part of your everyday life.</span> <span id="s344">It was kind of an instantaneous moment.</span> <span id="s345">I remember walking through the street, after we listened to the radio that night, and I remember distinctly worrying that the troops were coming.</span> <span id="s346">They actually did not come for another two weeks, or whatever.</span> <span id="s347">I have no sense of that kind of time.</span> <span id="s348">I was worrying how we were going to get out of the Sudeten Land in time.</span> <span id="s349">I was being concerned about being killed.</span> <span id="s350">But, when you go to Prague, where there is no anti-Semitism, that I experienced -- you know that I really don’t know whether there was or not -- I stopped worrying.</span> <span id="s351">You see, when you are eleven years old you really are much more concerned about that is going on in your little world, where my parents were using me as a football in their marital strife, than about the real world.</span> <span id="s352">So these kind of things were much more important.</span> <span id="s353">The emphasis on academic education was pretty hot and heavy and I worked hard in school.</span> <span id="s354">You know that I was in a Czech Grade School and then in a Czech Gymnasium which is the equivalent of a heavy- duty high school program.</span> <span id="s355">I was working hard while thinking that that would influence my parent’s concern for me, or their care for me.</span> <span id="s356">I played on the street with Czech children.</span> <span id="s357">We played regular children’s games such as marbles, jacks, and so on.</span> <span id="s358">I had very few friends really.</span> <span id="s359">A couple of friends from Nevarask went to Israel.</span> <span id="s360">They were trained.</span> <span id="s361">I remember wishing I could go.</span> <span id="s362">They were older than I was.</span> <span id="s363">There was no way my parents would let me go.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: In 1938 (after the occupation of the Sudeten Land).</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: So it was still Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s368">A couple of other friends, whom I was also close to, they and their mother went to New Zealand.</span> <span id="s369">Most of the others with whom I had any relationship with I met up with in New York.</span> <span id="s370">This was just a group of people who had decided that they knew what was ahead and they took care of themselves and of their families.</span> <span id="s371">That is what they did.</span> <span id="s372">My parents always lived a very self- involved life, so they were not too concerned.</span> <span id="s373">I know that my father was not too concerned about his relatives.</span> <span id="s374">He felt that they were safe.</span> <span id="s375">Some of them had intermarried and were very nationalistic Czechs and some of them had ties with some of the government bureaucracy and they believed that they would be safe.</span> <span id="s376">His mother and father, by that time had died.</span> <span id="s377">He had a brother who was running the family business and who thought that he was safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: He was taken away to a camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: I was not aware of that.</span> <span id="s380">I never knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: So of your family, your relatives, your father’s brother and his wife, or was it your mother’s brother….</span> <span id="s382">.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: My father’s brother was single and we do not know what happened to him or to cousins.</span> <span id="s384">Some of those who had converted are still living in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s385">We went back, about ten years ago.</span> <span id="s386">We did not go to their homes because we were not sure that they wanted us to.</span> <span id="s387">We had received some input which implied that that was not such a good idea.</span> <span id="s388">We knew that they were there because we had met some who had emigrated to England and who had converted.</span> <span id="s389">Inside of Czechoslovakia that was considered to be safer.</span> <span id="s390">My mother’s only sister and her husband and daughter emigrated to Australia.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: So that was pretty much the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Yes, pretty much.</span> <span id="s393">That was a very small family.</span> <span id="s394">There were some cousins who came to this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: So then, by 1940, your parents were both here.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Your parents remained separated?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Yes, as a matter of fact, they were divorced in 1941, I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Did they both live in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: They did for a while, then my father had taken his medical exams for his license and he moved to Ohio.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: So he had a pretty good command of English.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Yes, yes -- (a command of English was required for a doctor to get his license) and my mother’s English was not bad.</span> <span id="s403">She had studied English at home.</span> <span id="s404">She was a linguist.</span> <span id="s405">She was always studying one language or another.</span> <span id="s406">She was in New York for a while.</span> <span id="s407">She did not take her licensing exams until 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: What did she do until then?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: All kinds of things.</span> <span id="s410">She was a housekeeper in a residential school.</span> <span id="s411">She did private duty messages.</span> <span id="s412">She worked in hospital administration for housekeeping kind of things.</span> <span id="s413">She finally remarried and decided that she did not have enough support and she really wanted to practice medicine.</span> <span id="s414">She had never practiced in Europe.</span> <span id="s415">My father would not permit her to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: That is interesting.</span> <span id="s417">You lived at your father’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s419">While I was in high school I lived in a boarding school, because neither of my parents really wanted me.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: That was the time you came to New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: Well soon after that.</span> <span id="s422">When they split in 1941.</span> <span id="s423">My mother had been a camp doctor at the boarding school which, in the summer, became a camp in Connecticut.</span> <span id="s424">I got a scholarship to stay there.</span> <span id="s425">So I went to high school there.</span> <span id="s426">My father remarried.</span> <span id="s427">My parents were still using me as a go-between, you know the typical kind of divorce proceeding.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: So your father returned to life as a doctor rather quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: He did all right financially?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: He did very well.</span> <span id="s432">He was a dermatologist and apparently a good one.</span> <span id="s433">He did very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: It sounds as if your mother went through some rather hard years.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s436">Very difficult years .</span> <span id="s437">You know, for her to go back to school was a real feat.</span> <span id="s438">She had been away from practicing medicine.</span> <span id="s439">In this country she turned to internal medicine, since she felt that she was too old to do pediatrics.</span> <span id="s440">She never built up a good practice.</span> <span id="s441">She was living in Philadelphia in a neighborhood that was not very conducive.</span> <span id="s442">She also did not want to push that hard.</span> <span id="s443">She did all right.</span> <span id="s444">Then she finally gave up the practice and was a school physician for a long time.</span> <span id="s445">Philadelphia schools at that time had about thirty schools, involving so many days a week so she had several schools to which she went.</span> <span id="s446">Later she worked for the Red Cross Blood-mobile.</span> <span id="s447">Then she finally retired, and a year ago died at the age of ninety-two.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s449">A long life.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s451">She never could understand what it meant to be Jewish.</span> <span id="s452">She never could understand how I had become more religious.</span> <span id="s453">She never could understand that.</span> <span id="s454">She was very resentful of all that, for a long, long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: Her lack of religion mattered to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s457">To her, in the same way as to many of her contemporaries to be religious was for the lower classes.</span> <span id="s458">It was the Eastern European Jews who were religious and they were definitely lower class people.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: The ghettoized Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s461">You could find hundreds of Jews of that type.</span> <span id="s462">In order to live they had to get out of Europe.</span> <span id="s463">I can tell you that much.</span> <span id="s464">That was the case whether they wanted to be Jewish or not.</span> <span id="s465">There was no way of hiding it, but being Jewish, being actively Jewish, not really.</span> <span id="s466">I think that they all wanted to be buried in a Jewish cemetery and those kinds of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Was your mother buried that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s469">Yes.</span> <span id="s470">She was buried with her second husband.</span> <span id="s471">He was also a Viennese Jew.</span> <span id="s472">We saw to that.</span> <span id="s473">You know that that was important to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: That was not necessary to your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s476">She wanted to be buried in a small community (the name could not be understood by the transcriber) she had a lot of attachment to.</span> <span id="s477">So that is where they were buried.</span> <span id="s478">Now there was not any question about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Did you live with your father after you arrived in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s481">My mother was there for a little while, after she came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Did they live together?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: In the same apartment.</span> <span id="s484">There were also other people living there.</span> <span id="s485">My parents were from the “Free Thinker School”.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: They had attachments?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: They had their own attachments.</span> <span id="s488">I just think they could have all done better without me around.</span> <span id="s489">But what could you do.</span> <span id="s490">When I first came to the United States I lived with my father.</span> <span id="s491">I was his housekeeper and I took care of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: Then you went to boarding school?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: Not for another year or so,</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Did you go to school while you were living there.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Where was that apartment -- in Manhattan?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s498">In Manhattan.</span> <span id="s499">On 91st Street and Central Park West.</span> <span id="s500">That was a really nice neighborhood at that time.</span> <span id="s501">I went to an American school.</span> <span id="s502">At that time they had classes for foreign born however, I moved up pretty quickly.</span> <span id="s503">My father had the good sense during the first summer I was here to send me to live with a family for a month -- a family who had a teenager so I would not speak anything but English.</span> <span id="s504">Within that month, I spoke English.</span> <span id="s505">After that I was able to do well in school.</span> <span id="s506">Coming out of a good European school, you know a lot more than you do here.</span> <span id="s507">I got out of eighth grade at the same age as anybody else.</span> <span id="s508">They just took me along then.</span> <span id="s509">I started high school in New York (at that time the New York system had the reputation of being a top notch system, if not the very best in the United States, then nearly so).</span> <span id="s510">They had special high schools for gifted students and for special interests for which you had to pass stiff entrance tests.</span> <span id="s511">Then I went to the boarding school.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: What was the boarding school called?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Grodes School (At least that is what it sounded like).</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Where was it located?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: In a very small town.</span> <span id="s516">Up in Connecticut, not far from New Haven.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: What kind of economy did the town have?</span> <span id="s518">Was it mainly the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: No.</span> <span id="s520">It was not the school.</span> <span id="s521">It was very much in a rural area.</span> <span id="s522">The name of the founding physician was on the sign.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: Was there any industry.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: A very small kind of machine tool and die shops.</span> <span id="s525">I do not know why they ever located a school there, except that it was nice country.</span> <span id="s526">In that respect they took over some buildings.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: I think that they often have a boarding school where the parents like to vacation.</span> <span id="s528">Did you feel abandoned?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: Yes I guess so.</span> <span id="s530">All my life I felt that way, at least all my youth I did.</span> <span id="s531">My parents did all kinds of crazy things.</span> <span id="s532">“We did not do this, so you do not get to do this…”, you know that kind of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: To get you to behave?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: To get me to do whatever.</span> <span id="s535">If I did not do right or my father’s messages to my mother did not bring back the right answers there were repercussions.</span> <span id="s536">There were all kinds of things like that.</span> <span id="s537">Examples were: “Tell your mother that….”</span> <span id="s538">and “You tell your father that he promised me that….</span> <span id="s539">.”</span> <span id="s540">.</span> <span id="s541">I was better off being where I was, at least at boarding school I could be a person, not just a pawn.</span> <span id="s542">I think that they were very unhappy people and always had been.</span> <span id="s543">My mother was always a distant kind of lady.</span> <span id="s544">At least toward me.</span> <span id="s545">I never got close to her.</span> <span id="s546">She told me that not too long ago, shortly before she died that during the last six years I behaved all right.</span> <span id="s547">When you are fifty-seven, that is something since it means that for the first fifty years of your life you were not behaving properly.</span> <span id="s548">My father was a very bitter man.</span> <span id="s549">He did not have much to be bitter about.</span> <span id="s550">We lost contact.</span> <span id="s551">At least he used to keep contact with us pretty much until he retired.</span> <span id="s552">He had been practicing in Camden, Ohio.</span> <span id="s553">When he retired he and his wife moved to Florida.</span> <span id="s554">He left some possessions at some flea market so that if I wanted them to set up housekeeping with my mother, I should go and get them or something of the kind.</span> <span id="s555">When I got there they did not have them.</span> <span id="s556">That was kind of the nature of things.</span> <span id="s557">So in a way whatever I experienced was more intrafamily rather than the external, the fact that I was a refugee which had the most effect on me, on my growing up.</span> <span id="s558">We did not really feel that much.</span> <span id="s559">We never went hungry.</span> <span id="s560">We never went without clothing.</span> <span id="s561">(Note that she never lived in an area under the authority of Germany, she took refuge from what was anticipated, once Hitler overran her homeland).</span> <span id="s562">We never went without shelter.</span> <span id="s563">We were never physically attacked, in any way, or even imposed upon.</span> <span id="s564">The people we knew closely, all were also safe.</span> <span id="s565">So this is different, a lot more tangential than you could imagine.</span> <span id="s566">It never took on the reality it took on for other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: What was the school like?</span> <span id="s568">How many years were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Four.</span> <span id="s570">It was a very liberal school.</span> <span id="s571">It was mainly for children with emotional problems.</span> <span id="s572">It was rather small.</span> <span id="s573">There were not more than forty children there.</span> <span id="s574">I also got a good education, a very good education.</span> <span id="s575">I spent the last year in town school, that meant that I walked to school, since they did not have anybody else who was a senior.</span> <span id="s576">However, those were the years where high school was overly decent.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: It was very small.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: Yes, very small.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Was it an all girls’ school?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: No it was a co-ed school.</span> <span id="s581">The staff was essentially Jewish.</span> <span id="s582">But, again, totally uncommitted.</span> <span id="s583">They were Jewish.</span> <span id="s584">It was totally unrelated to Jewish life in any meaningful way; yes, in any religious way.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: How about the students -- were they Jewish also?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: Yes, they were for the most part.</span> <span id="s587">The ones whom I remember were.</span> <span id="s588">But you know again it was the same kind of story.</span> <span id="s589">They came from very assimilated families who sent their children to boarding school, that was the thing to do.</span> <span id="s590">This happened to serve some other needs.</span> <span id="s591">Whether they were Jewish or not did not really matter all that much.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: How did you come to Dayton?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: He had a job in Columbus, after we were married and he wanted to go into some kind of public sector.</span> <span id="s594">The City of Dayton offered him a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: Where did you meet him?</span> <span id="s596">(Obviously meaning her husband).</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: At Ohio State.</span> <span id="s598">(The main campus of Ohio State University is located in Columbus).</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: You came to Ohio State after the boarding school?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: Was there a reason?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Well, my father was a resident of Ohio.</span> <span id="s603">In those years that made a lot of difference.</span> <span id="s604">Tuition was reasonable.</span> <span id="s605">I tried to get into Antioch University (the main campus is located in Yellow Springs, Ohio) but neither my husband nor I, we did not make it.</span> <span id="s606">My father would only pay for tuition in a state school.</span> <span id="s607">And my mother was in no position to pay.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: Did you get married after you graduated?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: Then you came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: He was in Columbus for two years, he was working there for a large engineering firm.</span> <span id="s612">By that time he had made the decision that he would like to go to work in the public sector.</span> <span id="s613">He was particularly interested in working for a city.</span> <span id="s614">He applied for a job with the City of Dayton.</span> <span id="s615">He got the job and so we came.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: When did you experience your renaissance of Jewish feeling, actually it was not even a rebirth but the individual birth of feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: Well, while I was in college pretty much.</span> <span id="s618">I had no ties at home.</span> <span id="s619">I went to every club I could go to and I went to every class I could go to.</span> <span id="s620">I learned Hebrew.</span> <span id="s621">I did not know that much.</span> <span id="s622">I got a scholarship to a Jewish camp.</span> <span id="s623">That led from one thing to another and when I met Chuck, who was a very strongly conservative Jew, very committed.</span> <span id="s624">It was either, or.</span> <span id="s625">He came from a Kosher home and that is how he wanted to live.</span> <span id="s626">It was the matter of making the decision that that was OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: That was difficult.</span> <span id="s628">I kept thinking about living Kosher and decided we could not possibly do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: I never said this but really, it is not all that difficult.</span> <span id="s630">If you have never kept a house and if you are starting over at his apartment which was already Kosher.</span> <span id="s631">So it is just the matter of learning some technicalities on the use of some details and stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">[Here the side of the tape was changed and some part of the interview was lost in the process.]</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Who knows what tomorrow will bring, right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: You had no trouble fitting into synagogue life?</span> <span id="s635">I am asking this because I was not raised Jewish and I am finding that I would have trouble working with children.</span> <span id="s636">Obviously, I would not know what to teach them.</span> <span id="s637">However, you had no trouble making up for the fact that you had very little background.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s639">I think I can attribute that to the fact of having started in college to find out about things, on my own, before actually becoming active in a synagogue or a temple.</span> <span id="s640">So that there was not the transition to temple membership or synagogue membership, that did not happen until later.</span> <span id="s641">I believe that that eased things.</span> <span id="s642">Somehow I found the need to be more Jewish.</span> <span id="s643">I do not remember, as a child, what my needs were.</span> <span id="s644">I remember the few times that my father took me to the synagogue I liked to be there.</span> <span id="s645">However, my memories of anything actively Jewish were nil.</span> <span id="s646">We never observed any holidays that is any Jewish holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: You now attend services regularly.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s649">I am not as active any more since I worked there.</span> <span id="s650">That is neither one of us.</span> <span id="s651">My husband is very active in the federation, at this point.</span> <span id="s652">I also do some work there.</span> <span id="s653">I am not as active at Beth Abraham (that is the Jewish Conservative Congregation of Dayton of which Helen and Chuck Abramowitz are members) any more for reasons into which I will not go into now.</span> <span id="s654">(Federation means the Jewish Federation of Greater Dayton).</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: The thing which I am now curious about is to know whether you encountered any anti-Semitism here, in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Having worked where I work during the last five years, I have been very careful to play down anything -- and I am not saying that I am hiding -- it has to do with the population I work with, but my religion was never a subject for discussion.</span> <span id="s657">When clients would ask me I would say we do not discuss it; I do not think that it is appropriate.</span> <span id="s658">The eastern population, at least the ones I worked with, is pretty willing.</span> <span id="s659">I know that in some situations, with some clients who are fundamentalists, it would have been a real issue, so I thought that it would be better not mentioned.</span> <span id="s660">It really was not appropriate.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: I shake hands with some Presbyterians.</span> <span id="s662">Some would not.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s664">Exactly.</span> <span id="s665">The children who, even though we go to Israel every year, and they know that we went, do not quite make that leap.</span> <span id="s666">I just let it go at that.</span> <span id="s667">I encourage joining and I am pretty active in Christian-Jewish dialogue situations.</span> <span id="s668">I believe that anti-Semitism is based on a lot of mis-information, a lot of insensitivity.</span> <span id="s669">However, I am not sure that we can equate that with anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: I have the feeling that the fundamentalist population does not really understand until you begin to develop what a Jewish person really is.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s672">You know that a lot of insensitivity, comes from a lack of listening.</span> <span id="s673">I do not know whether it is anything beyond that.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: What do you mean by that; lack of listening?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: After you work with it, with a Christian-Jewish group, or with a non-Jewish group and you talk.</span> <span id="s676">I have done a lot of speaking for Beth Abraham.</span> <span id="s677">Every other day there is another group coming through.</span> <span id="s678">The main thing which I try to teach them, is that they can learn some of the vocabulary of the Jews.</span> <span id="s679">You know that it is pretty easy to say that -- this is not a church but a synagogue.</span> <span id="s680">No-way.</span> <span id="s681">We deal with it and with these kind of things.</span> <span id="s682">It is just terribly hard for people to understand.</span> <span id="s683">It is not a question of Kashrut or even the concept of the Shabbat, of not working.</span> <span id="s684">The concept of what “Not-Working” means, you know what is work.</span> <span id="s685">In the extreme, that turning on the light is considered work, is a concept that is really hard for people to understand.</span> <span id="s686">You try to interpret it as much as you can, it is just hard to understand…having so little experience.</span> <span id="s687">No.</span> <span id="s688">I have not found any real anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s689">A lot of Jews say: “I can not understand why you do this, that or the other thing.</span> <span id="s690">Really what difference does it make”.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: I find that to be the big difference between Jews in the Midwest and on the east coast.</span> <span id="s692">Here there is so much self -deprecating humor.</span> <span id="s693">I hear more Jewish jokes from Jews here, than I hear from anyone else.</span> <span id="s694">On the east coast it bothers me because anyone would tell a Jewish joke.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: So there is a big difference in the Midwest of even the Jews perception of themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s698">I think that that is very true.</span> <span id="s699">I think that the Jews here have a much harder time.</span> <span id="s700">I like this much better.</span> <span id="s701">I know that when we first started being more active, the idea that you had non-Jewish associations outside of business was very very hard for people to understand.</span> <span id="s702">They just were not comfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: This was here?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s705">It has gotten better.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: With people at Beth Abraham.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: With a lot of our Jewish friends and acquaintances.</span> <span id="s708">Such remarks as “Oh, you have non-Jewish friends!</span> <span id="s709">My goodness”.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: I know that up to a few years ago this area (the area close to Good Samaritan Hospital but just south of Salem Avenue) here was just about all Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: Not all Jewish, but heavily Jewish.</span> <span id="s712">You know, at that time the Jews lived at this end of town.</span> <span id="s713">However, I am talking about even the time before that.</span> <span id="s714">My husband and I had moved in the non-Jewish community.</span> <span id="s715">They were accepting of us.</span> <span id="s716">If he does not eat meat outside of the home, that is no problem to order a fruit plate.</span> <span id="s717">However, if this happened in a Jewish group, that always was a big issue.</span> <span id="s718">You know, I am talking about that kind of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: Would anyone in the Jewish community of Dayton think of this?</span> <span id="s720">I have no sense of the Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Oh, there was a very strong kind of interphase.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Do you think that it was the migration out to areas of Englewood that changed that?</span> <span id="s723">I know that Beth Jacob is completely moved (Beth Jacob moved from Kumler Avenue in Daytonview to North Main Street, just South of Westbrook Road in the late 1970’s, but of course, not all the congregants moved and certainly not all at that time).</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: That had a lot to do with it.</span> <span id="s725">Other Jews moved south.</span> <span id="s726">I am still not sure how many social friends people have who are not Jewish.</span> <span id="s727">I still think that they are a pretty small number.</span> <span id="s728">We have rarely gone to a home, a Jewish home, for a social occasion that there was a mixed group.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: That is very interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: Even those people who have non-Jewish friends will think “Well, you know, is this person going to be OK, comfortable with everybody else who is coming?”</span> <span id="s731">Not because the host has the problem, but because of the guests.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: Well, I think that this is a good place to stop.</span></p></body></html>
