<p><span id="s16">Q: Tell me what your name was at birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: St -- Steven Joseph Fenves -- Fenyves.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: Fenyves --</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: -- you say actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: And wha -- how do you pronounce it now?</span> <span id="s23">Just Fenves?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: Yes, when I got my citizenship I -- I dropped it, th-the J, because the -- the Croatian spelling is with a J rather than the Y.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: And nobody could pronounce it so I -- I just dropped it.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s28">And what was it -- what was your date of birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: June sixth, 1931.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: And where?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: In Subotica, then part -- then Yugoslavia, now it’s part of Serbia.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: And then in the middle it became part of something else, right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Well, before World War І, it was Hungary; 12 years before my birth it became Yugoslavia and during the war it was re-occupied by Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Let’s get a sense of your family a little bit.</span> <span id="s35">You have a mother, father and a sister, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Let’s talk about your dad first.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: He was born Louis Friedman.</span> <span id="s41">He and his brother changed their name.</span> <span id="s42">That was the great vogue in Hungary that everybody was taking on Hungarian names, so they changed their name to Fenyves.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s44">And he was born in?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: He was born in Mako.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: In southern Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: And what was he doing for a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Well, let me say a little bit on my family history?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: His older brother Ferenc, even in high school, became very much in-involved with literature and journalism.</span> <span id="s52">Went to the University of Budapest to get a degree in law, although there is some claims that he never got his law degree, which doesn’t surprise me because he -- his interest was in -- in journalism.</span> <span id="s53">He came back to Subotica and at some very early age, still in his 20’s, became editor of a newspaper.</span> <span id="s54">My father, as soon as he finished high school went to work for a lumber mill in what is now Croatia, to support his brother.</span> <span id="s55">My uncle married very well.</span> <span id="s56">He married a woman from Temesvar, now Timisoara.</span> <span id="s57">The daughter of a very well-to-do porcelain manufacturer.</span> <span id="s58">And I suspect with hi -- with her dowry, my uncle bought the newspaper -- the printing plant.</span> <span id="s59">And he was the editor, my father was the manager.</span> <span id="s60">My uncle died in 1935, and then my father became the editor and my aunt became the manager.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: And did your father actually have an interest in journalism too?</span> <span id="s62">He must have.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: He had an interest in journalism; he was not a journalist.</span> <span id="s64">I’m sure th-there is a -- a booklet that came out in 90 -- 1994, there was a commemoration of the 50th anniversary of -- of the deportation, and there was a booklet about Jews in Subotica, and it talks at length about my uncle and then a short paragraph that after his brother’s death, Louis Fenyves became nominally the editor, but most of the editing was done by x and y.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: So yeah, he was not a journalist, my dad.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: So you think he was more of an administrator than --</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: He was a -- yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: -- than he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: And -- whereas your uncle was really a journalist?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s74">What kind of a person was your father in your memory of him as a kid?</span> <span id="s75">Were you close?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Yes, we were close.</span> <span id="s77">The printing plant was in the same building where y -- where th --</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Where you lived?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: -- where we lived.</span> <span id="s80">We had a two story building.</span> <span id="s81">My uncle’s apartment on -- on the first floor, ours on the second floor editorial offices, business office and then a big plant.</span> <span id="s82">So we were always very deeply involved with the plant, and I -- as a child I couldn’t go to sleep unless I heard the presses rolling.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: And why was that, it wa-was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: I mean, that -- that -- that was the --</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: -- it -- you don’t -- that was just --</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: -- that was -- uh-huh, the normal way of things.</span> <span id="s87">So I -- I would visit my father’s office and yeah, we -- we spent time together, but -- we -- I -- my friends and I would -- did a lot of roaming around the plant -- plant, we liked to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Was your father a serious guy, was he a -- a sort of a lighter person?</span> <span id="s89">Do you -- do you recollect as a kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Ah -- yeah, he was a serious guy, he -- he would -- enjoyed helping his workers.</span> <span id="s91">Several people started small businesses.</span> <span id="s92">One of them started a small machine shop where during the occupation I actually worked.</span> <span id="s93">So he was very helpful to -- to -- who -- very involved in the lives of the -- his employees.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s95">And his brother Ferenc, was he older?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: He was, yes, three or four years older.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Three or four years older, and did he -- wh-what did he die of, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Heart attack.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: He had a heart attack.</span> <span id="s100">Do you have any recollection?</span> <span id="s101">You would have been four years --</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Oh yes, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: -- yeah, my -- my cousin says it’s impossible, but I -- but it -- coming home from nursery school, had to get -- go up the stairs and in the landing was the door to their apartment and my uncle was there, waiting to be admitted.</span> <span id="s105">He never carried a key, he rapped on the frosted glass window to be let in by the maid.</span> <span id="s106">And I always timed that -- that I would get in there the same time, and we all -- he always had jokes for me [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: So you liked him a lot, you can tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: Oh yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Was your father like him, or were they very -- quite different?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: I think my father was like him, he -- yeah, he -- yeah, enjoyed, yeah.</span> <span id="s113">He certainly enjoyed life, I -- I remember after school -- after the paper was put -- put to bed, he would go to the coffee house and -- and have coffee with his friends and I would go and -- and sit on his lap, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: Really, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: And tell me about your mother.</span> <span id="s117">Wa-was there -- they were similar in age, or was he consi -- older, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: My father was born in 1889, my mother was born in 1997.</span> <span id="s119">So there was eight years age difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: You me -- 1897.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: 1897.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: And she was born in -- in 18 -- in --</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: Cause you said 1997.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s126">18 -- I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: 1897.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: And she was born in -- I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s131">He was born in 1887, she was born in 19 -- in 1899.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: 1899, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: She was a -- I think she was sort of a withdrawn person in a way.</span> <span id="s134">She -- she came from a -- a much more prominent family than my father.</span> <span id="s135">My fathers -- was -- my -- my grandfather started out as a tanner in -- in this small shtetl in Mako, then moved to Subotica and -- and a lumber dealership.</span> <span id="s136">And s -- I think both my uncle and my father married up.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Up.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: My -- my mother’s family father was a lawyer.</span> <span id="s139">The first Jewish professor at the high school was a relative, couple univers -- professors at the University of Budapest were relatives.</span> <span id="s140">My grandmother’s family was Taussig.</span> <span id="s141">He was one of the more -- her father was one of the more prominent merchants.</span> <span id="s142">And the -- so my mother was raised in a much more upper class family.</span> <span id="s143">She finished high school in Subard -- in what was then Subard, to coin the Hungarian name.</span> <span id="s144">Went to Budapest, got her degree in -- in graphic -- graphic arts, and came back to Subotica.</span> <span id="s145">My understanding is that she did some artwork for my father’s newspaper and that’s how they met.</span> <span id="s146">My understanding is that the family was opposed to the marriage and they sent her off on a grand tour, and the few pieces of -- of her work that we have is mostly ‘25 - ‘26 - ‘27, Vienna, Italy, France.</span> <span id="s147">But then they got married.</span> <span id="s148">She did not continue her art as -- work as seriously as my sister and I think she should have.</span> <span id="s149">Her studio was shared wi-wit-with -- our playroom was her studio.</span> <span id="s150">She -- she, especially when my aunt became the manager of the printing plant, for all practical purposes, my mother was her social secretary.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Her coffee -- my aunt’s coffee was at our house, hosted by my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: I see --</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: So it changed --</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Yeah, so it -- it -- it was a -- strange relation -- I mean, all the important gifts, my first watch, my first bicycle, etcetera, came from my aunt, not from my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: That’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: But my mother was a very, very warm person.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: But you said she was withdrawn in some [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: She -- yeah, she -- she had a close set of friends, but -- but she wa -- I wouldn’t call her outgoing at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s162">And what was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Claire Gered.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: That’s Gered -- g -- g-e-r --</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: G-e-r-e-d.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: -- e-d.</span> <span id="s167">Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s168">You know, I forgot to ask you, what was the name of the newspaper?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: The name of the newspaper is Naplo, which means daily.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: The name of the -- of the plant was Minerva.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s173">Now, what -- was it unusual for a woman -- and I know you wouldn’t know this as a kid, but as you grew up an adult, to go and get as much edu -- education as your mother did?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: No, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s175">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s176">Several of the -- my aunts, several of the woman I knew --</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: -- had -- had university degrees.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Do you think your mother felt bad because she was not continuing her art?</span> <span id="s180">Do you think -- you don’t -- you have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: I don’t know, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: She certainly encouraged the two of us to -- to do art.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: To do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Did she teach you?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: She coached, she -- yeah sh-she supervised and she didn’t explicitly teach us.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: But she certainly encouraged us.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: That’s interesting because you were in the same room with her, so I imagine imitation --</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Oh yes, definitely --</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: -- was something that you wanted to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: -- definitely, right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: And tell me about your sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: My sister is two years older than I.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: And her name.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: Ear -- her name is Esther, and she still uses the Hungarian wording of Eszti rather then Esther, with the Hungarian spelling of s-z.</span> <span id="s200">She was always a very outgoing, very precocious, very headstrong girl.</span> <span id="s201">The few pictures that we have, always are red hair, and very long plaits.</span> <span id="s202">She -- a -- during the Hungarian occupation she didn’t get into high school, so her education was sort of stopped at sixth grade, although in Paris she attended the Sorbonne.</span> <span id="s203">She’s very knowledgeable, very, very bright person.</span> <span id="s204">We -- we [indecipherable] reconnected after the war, we left Yugoslavia together, were in France together, came to the States together.</span> <span id="s205">And for the last 20 - some years she has been living in Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: She’s been living in Washington?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s209">So that must be very nice for you, living nearby.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Oh yes, yeah, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s212">And as children, she was a couple of years older --</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: -- were you close, or was this be --</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Oh yeah, we were quite close, we -- we had -- I mean our life was governed by our governess.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: And so we were always together.</span> <span id="s218">We were both -- you can tell from our age, depression children.</span> <span id="s219">Most of -- most of our friends were single children, or one or two children, particularly many of her -- her classmates were -- were s -- only children.</span> <span id="s220">And one of the things I didn’t care for is that I was dragged through all the birthday parties of her -- of her girlfriends.</span> <span id="s221">Which --</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: You didn’t like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: I didn’t like that at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Was she dragged through the birthday parties of your --</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: -- your friends?</span> <span id="s227">No?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Only you?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: So tell me, you had a governess and -- throughout your childhood, until --</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: Til the -- the -- the day of the occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: The day of the occupation.</span> <span id="s234">Was -- w-would you have considered your family middle class, or more than that?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Well, cook, maid, governess, chauffeur.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: That seems like a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: But you have to recognize that Yugoslavia was a det -- dirt poor country, and if you could afford to buy a car, you could certainly afford to build a second story on top of the garage and support one more fa -- one additional family.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: That’s how it worked.</span> <span id="s240">Our -- the governess was an important thing.</span> <span id="s241">My parents generation was totally saturated with German culture.</span> <span id="s242">And the town had a large number of -- of ethnic Germans, Swabians.</span> <span id="s243">So -- so as not to learn that ugly street dialect, you had to have a governess to teach you Volksdeutsche.</span> <span id="s244">And yeah, governess was a large part of -- of the life of most of my -- most of my friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: It was?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Was just typical in your [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Yeah, terrible woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: Yeah, I was going to ask you what’s she like?</span> <span id="s250">She was terrible?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Aha, aha, cold, cold woman.</span> <span id="s252">Incredibly cold woman.</span> <span id="s253">Fanatically religious, Catholic.</span> <span id="s254">Dragged us to churches and services all the time.</span> <span id="s255">The day -- the day they occu -- a-army came in, she left in a big show, and I thought that was the greatest thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: That was the best thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Did you complain to your mother and father about this woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Oh yeah, but that, I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Didn’t matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: But it seems like an odd choice, given your description of your parents, that they would choose someone who was quite like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: [indecipherable] you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: I mean -- I mean it’s -- it’s di -- I’m just trying to make a mental image.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: So what did she --</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: I can’t think of any governess of any of my friends that was a pleasant person.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s270">Now, I mean, that thought was going on while you were asking a question.</span> <span id="s271">No, I can’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: You can’t think of any one?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: So what -- what did she do for you?</span> <span id="s275">I mean, what di -- what was the -- what -- what did a governess do?</span> <span id="s276">Cause I’ve never had one, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: Well, first of all, in her presence we only spoke German.</span> <span id="s278">You know, the fact that I spoke Hungarian at home, Serbian in school, and German with my governess, that -- that never s-seemed to me strange un-until my children were all speaking one language.</span> <span id="s279">Well, after school -- I think she would wait for us at sc-school, and we had to go on long wa -- take long walks.</span> <span id="s280">The -- one of the daily excitements of the city is that the Orient Express changed engines.</span> <span id="s281">Hungarian engine was uncoupled, and the Yugoslav engine was --</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s283">Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: -- coupled in.</span> <span id="s285">So that was a big event to go to, to the railroad station to see the Orient Express.</span> <span id="s286">First time I saw a black person was -- was on that train.</span> <span id="s287">Then -- then we had another circuit for a longer trip, longer walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: Was that -- let me go back for a second, was that a big deal, that you saw a black person?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Well no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: You just didn’t -- you just wouldn’t -- clearly you --</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: I -- it -- it --</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: -- it’s a long time memory for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: -- right, right, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: Long walks.</span> <span id="s296">So, you know, we were just in her presence much more so than in our par -- parents presence.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Did she smile?</span> <span id="s298">I mean, did she have any -- she had no ni -- she apparently had no nice qualities as far as you’re concerned?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: No, she was not a nice person, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: And Esther felt exactly the same way?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: Oh yes, yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s302">And we were much closer to the -- to the cook and the maids.</span> <span id="s303">Maids never lasted very long, I don’t know why, but the cook wa-was the same one for -- for years, for all that I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: And we were close to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: And did the maid and the cook live in their own apartments and the governess lived with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: The governess lived with us.</span> <span id="s308">The apartment building had sort of an extension and past the kitchen was -- was a two room apartment that the -- the maid and the cook shared.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: The cook was married and would take off some nights.</span> <span id="s311">I think she had Wednesday afternoon off.</span> <span id="s312">But they had a -- a two bedroom apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s314">And who cooked when she had time off?</span> <span id="s315">Did your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: My mother prepared -- da -- did a lot of planning, I don’t -- meal planning, I don’t know --</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Whether she cooked.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: -- whether she cooked.</span> <span id="s319">One of --</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: -- one of the -- one of the few things that our cooked saved for us was, in addition to -- to the small portion of my mother’s artwork was my mother’s very thick recipe book.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s325">Did you ever go in the kitchen?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: Oh yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: So you were allowed to roam around the --</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: Oh yeah, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: And did you like -- you liked the cook and you liked the maid?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: Oh yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: Did you have an animal?</span> <span id="s334">Any pets?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: My cousins downstairs had a -- had a cocker spaniel, I -- I didn’t have one.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: You didn’t have any?</span> <span id="s337">Did you like --</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: -- did you like the cocker spaniel?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: Oh yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s343">And then in the late 30’s, my oldest cousin, who was yu -- slated to take over the -- the company, decided that he didn’t want that, that he wanted to be a gentleman farmer.</span> <span id="s344">And my aunt, in her usual fashion, went out and bought a large farm, and converted it to sort of a model farm.</span> <span id="s345">Brought -- mi -- sent her son to -- to Zurich, to [indecipherable] Federal Technical Institute to get a degree in agronomy.</span> <span id="s346">And she brought back Swiss cows and a -- prize cows, and -- and I spent a good part of my summers on the farm.</span> <span id="s347">So tha -- surrounded by animals.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Did the governess go with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: No.</span> <span id="s351">She stayed home?</span> <span id="s352">She stayed in the house?</span> <span id="s353">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s354">I don’t think my sister was there.</span> <span id="s355">I -- I liked to be on the farm, I enjoyed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: You liked that?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: You liked the cows?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: Yes, we were herding the cows.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: And they were do -- they were milking the cows, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: -- it wasn’t for slaughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s364">And there was a prize bull --</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: -- and I -- I exhibited him at -- at fairs.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s370">It didn’t -- it -- it was easy for you talking these three languages because you just --</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: Oh yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: And were you s -- were you speaking Serbian very well when you were in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Oh yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: So you were fluent?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s376">I remember after the war, after we returned from Auschwitz, a new -- a crop of teachers came, and I presumed school in -- in Serbian.</span> <span id="s377">And there was this literature teacher who came storming in the -- in the room and handed out papers with terrible grades on that.</span> <span id="s378">He said, “None of you think Serbian, you just all think Hungarian and then translate it into Serbian.”</span> <span id="s379">And we took that as a terrible affront, a terrible insult.</span> <span id="s380">I -- I felt that I was in good in Serbian as anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: As in -- right.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: Now, why were you speaking Hungarian to your parents rather than Serbian or even German?</span> <span id="s384">Do you -- do you know why?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: They were part of the Hungarian Jewish culture.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s387">But still, German was very important to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: German was very important to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: And th -- what -- they were fluent in German, I gather, as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s392">Tell me about school, did you like school?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: At first I had -- I remember I had terrible sep -- separation anxieties in -- in kindergarten.</span> <span id="s394">They delegated me to recite a poem about motherhood and I couldn’t get through it, I broke into tears.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: But after that, it was -- it was great, yeah.</span> <span id="s397">Again, Yugoslavia was a dirt poor country.</span> <span id="s398">It had compulsory education except it couldn’t afford it.</span> <span id="s399">So any organization, religious community, etcetera, that could put up a building and hire three teachers, the government supplied the fourth teacher and it became a government school.</span> <span id="s400">So they -- directly ac-cross the street from our house, in the -- in the courtyard of the -- of the synagogue was the Jewish grade school.</span> <span id="s401">I mean, it was a state school, but it was run by the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s402">Probably 80 percent of the students Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Jewish, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: And that’s where I went for first four grades.</span> <span id="s405">I -- I liked it a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: You did.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: At -- so the neighborhood you lived in was primarily Jewish, or all Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: Jews -- well, again, Subotica had about 6000 Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: Divided, from what I understand, sort of equally between one large Reform congregation, and mult -- multiple, multiple small shuls.</span> <span id="s412">The -- the Jewish community was very divided.</span> <span id="s413">They -- those that immigrated -- that came from -- came in the middle of the -- of the 19th century, mostly from Arabia and Bohemia, n-now Czechoslovakia, where German speaking touched by the Mendelssohn [indecipherable] enlightment and belong to a Reform congregation in ha -- hung -- Hungary had a three way split th -- Reform, which it was called neolog, and the Orthodox, and a third group that didn’t last very long called sinaqua al -- as before, that didn’t accept the separation.</span> <span id="s414">So there was this large Reform congregation, a huge temple designed by my great uncle.</span> <span id="s415">I don’t like the word assimilated, I -- I think acculturated is a better term.</span> <span id="s416">The other half came almost exclusively from across the mountains, from Galicia, touched by -- you know, influenced by Baal Shem Tov and Hassidism and there was very little contact between the two communities.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: So even though the community is very small, it’s very divided.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: It’s very divided.</span> <span id="s419">The -- now, to ans -- long answer to question, the Orthodox community was highly concentrated.</span> <span id="s420">The Reform Jews lived all -- all over town, all over the better parts of the town, so it wasn’t a Jewish neighborhood at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s422">W -- so, you had a mixed bunch of friends, as did your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: My school friends were largely Jewish.</span> <span id="s424">Yeah, I had so -- some neighborhood friends who were not Jewish, but most -- most of my friends were -- were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: And -- and Jews make up a tiny, tiny portion of the Yugoslav population, let alone it the area where you lived --</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: -- right through --</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Or the six percent in the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s430">So how were Jews treated within this context.</span> <span id="s431">Is -- di -- di -- were you raised feeling as if there were some anti-Semitism or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Absolutely not, I didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Absolutely not.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: -- that -- that existed.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: I mean, that all started with the war in 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s438">Now a-as you’re growing up, I mean you’re very young when the Nazis take over, you’re only two years old in 1933.</span> <span id="s439">But before the war, before ’39 and before ’41 when it really affects you strongly, do you hear about the Nazis?</span> <span id="s440">Do you hear your parents talking about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Oh yes, I -- I -- ye -- well, my mother’s brother emigrated to the States in the 1920’s.</span> <span id="s442">She -- she had a -- the ticket for the maiden voyage of the Normandy in ’39 to visit her brother, to go to the World’s Fair.</span> <span id="s443">And she decided not to go because the war made -- might break out and she might not be able to get back.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s445">Huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: So, yeah, lot of things I remember.</span> <span id="s447">I me -- one -- one thing I clearly remember, the radio making the announcement that the -- the [indecipherable] the cardinal, whose name just escapes me was elected Pope Pius, and my father said, “That’s bad for the Jews.”</span> <span id="s448">I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s451">So we knew s --</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: You knew s -- you knew something.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: We’re going to have to stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: Okay, Steven, I have a few sort of disparate questions to ask you.</span> <span id="s459">[tape break] Okay, Steven, I have a few different questions to ask you --</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: -- that don’t necessarily all go together.</span> <span id="s462">But when you were talking about your governess, it was interesting to me that she was a very Orthodox Catholic woman --</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: -- and here you are in a Jewish family.</span> <span id="s465">Did it bother you that you were going to the church?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: Mm, I -- I don’t recall at that time that it did, but -- no, I -- I don’t recall it.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: No.</span> <span id="s468">And she wasn’t trying to impose her belief on you --</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: -- she was just clearly Catholic?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s473">Did you like going to the church?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: No, not particularly.</span> <span id="s475">Particularly not kneeling.</span> <span id="s476">Kneeling in the church with -- with bare knees.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Ah, cause you were wearing shorts.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Uh-huh, okay.</span> <span id="s482">And what about then, religion in your home?</span> <span id="s483">Were your parents religious, was --</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: My parents weren’t particular religious.</span> <span id="s485">We observed all the holidays, we didn’t keep kosher.</span> <span id="s486">We didn’t observe the Sabbath, except that my paternal grandmother always furnished a bowl of -- of cholent for the midday meal on Saturday.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: And can you describe what cholent is?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: It’s a bean dish.</span> <span id="s489">The -- the traditional thing because it can be -- be baked the day before and it doesn’t have -- require work to -- to make it.</span> <span id="s490">The synagogue was across the -- the street from us.</span> <span id="s491">My maternal -- my mother’s uncle was -- was one of the two architects, so my father inherited his father-in-law’s seat directly behind the cantors in the fr -- in the front row and all I needed to was look up and my mother and grandmother and sister were sitting in the front row of the women’s balcony.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: So this was an Orthodox?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Sort of.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: I was ultra-Reform, but still, men wore hats, women were on the second floor, service was entirely in Hebrew, except for one prayer for the king once a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: And that was in Hungarian, or Serbian?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Serbian.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Serbian.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: But -- but in comparison to -- to -- to the Orthodox, it was considered ultra-Reform.</span> <span id="s500">A main factor is that the synagogue had a -- had an organ.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Which is what -- what really set apart the two communities.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: But on Yom Kippur -- I’m -- I mean Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, we went to the services then for Yithzcore, the children were chased out and we were running around the courtyard.</span> <span id="s505">But we participated in all the services.</span> <span id="s506">And af -- after regular school, three afternoons a week, we had Jewish education.</span> <span id="s507">A -- a teacher who was a very strong Zionist, and we were taught not just Hebrew for the services, but we were taught the language spoken in Eretz Israel.</span> <span id="s508">And since school went on til noon on Saturday, after lunch on Saturday was a children’s service in the small subsidiary chapel, which -- which was sort of a interesting event because a -- you know, there was no Kaddish itha -- and -- and the [indecipherable] at which all hell broke loose, because at two o’clock the matinee started in the three cinemas and everybody was running at full speeds to get out of the service to get -- to get to the --</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: To the matinee.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: To the matinee.</span> <span id="s511">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: And you were one of those kids --</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: -- who went.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: I didn’t have to run as fast -- fast as the others because I had passes to the -- to the paper’s press box, so I didn’t have to line up to get tickets.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: Really --</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: -- there was a press box?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s523">So did you go every Saturday?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: Every Saturday.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: No kidding?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: And were these mainly movies that were made in Yugoslavia --</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: No, no, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: -- or you show a lot of American movies?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: -- I’m -- lots of American movies.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: And who did you like?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: I don’t remember, I -- we liked the cowboy movies.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: I was going to say, that’s what I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: Yeah, yeah, right, right, oh yeah, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: So did you see Hopalong Cassidy?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: I don’t remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: You don’t remember who it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: -- individuals, no, no.</span> <span id="s541">But I do remember, you know, yeah -- subtitles, it wasn’t dubbed -- I don’t remember if it was dubbed or not.</span> <span id="s542">But certainly the publicity material was in Serbian.</span> <span id="s543">And there was a movie ap-apparently when Technicolor was use, cowboys in color.</span> <span id="s544">And that was translated in Serbian as Kovboji i koloru, in someplace called color.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: So yeah, that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: And were these double features, cause at that time wi -- did see two movies or what --</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: I don’t remember, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Were adults with you, or you all went alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: No, no, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: You just went alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: We went alone, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: And who sat with you?</span> <span id="s554">Did Esther go with you and sit in the press box?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: Ah -- well, well.</span> <span id="s556">Ah, yeah, and my older cousins, I mean, and e-each of us brought a friend or two.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Or we took turns, I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Now, the fact that you were not kosher, although you celebrated the holidays, you went to synagogue a lot, you got a lot of training, in a certain way.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: Oh yes, yes.</span> <span id="s561">Yes, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: So you would have considered your childhood a -- you were in some sense religious, clearly.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: Yeah, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: Definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: Another question.</span> <span id="s567">Did your mother’s family every approve of this marriage?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: My father never set foot in my grandmother’s house.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: You’re kidding me.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: Yup.</span> <span id="s571">We went -- my mother visited her mother, I don’t know if it was once a week or twice a week, we met her there.</span> <span id="s572">I liked to go there because her brother was sending his mother old issues of “Life” magazine.</span> <span id="s573">And I --</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: You liked to read them?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: -- I could leaf through them.</span> <span id="s576">Th-The Dionne quintuplets and other news items --</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: Right.</span></p>

id="s607">Q: It’s scary, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: I wanted see my mother, I -- I bolted out of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: -- the

Israel, who we visit every time we -- we go to Israel.</span> <span id="s626">And then trips to Budapest, but exciting, it was a exciting place.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Now, you know what I was thinking, given the relationship of your mother’s family to your father, does this mean that when they got married there was no dowry, which would have been traditional, because they didn’t go to the wedding, I gather.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: Oh I presume they d -- I mu -- they must have, yeah, yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: You think they must have?</span></p> <p><span

<p><span id="s645">A: We -- w-we were seven cousins and Wednesday afternoons was the traditional day when maids and governesses had half day off.</span> <span id="s646">And wi -- my grandmother had a -- had a rather modest house, we were all parked there on Wednesday afternoons and we did terrible pranks, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: Yeah, my cousins were really pranksters and -- and I as the youngest was always goaded into doing the worst of the things.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: So like what did they do?</span> <span id="s650">What’d you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: Like taking all of the years worth of preserves and soaking the labels off, and exch-exchanging the label.</span> <span id="s652">Like -- like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: And what did your grandmother do, did she think this was funny?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: She did?</span></p>

<span id="s660">So you liked being there, I guess?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: Did you sp -- learn to speak Hebrew, as well as these other three languages?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: No, ne -- I -- I -- I never did, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: I still read in the most halting way.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: But you obviously can read some.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: Because of that training that you had as a kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: Well, life changes fairly radically in 1941, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: -- doesn’t it --</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: -- when the Germans attack Yugoslavia?</span> <span id="s675">What is that like?</span> <span id="s676">What do you remember [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: I don’t know whether school closed early or what -- but I was upstairs in the apartment and father came up.</span> <span id="s678">And we had this big radio console with lots of dials and he was fiddling with the dials, and a German attack was announced, and Hungary was -- was joining, and on the way to re-occupy the former Hungarian provinces.</span> <span id="s679">And to a lot of people it was sort of a holiday at first.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: A holiday?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Yes, my uncle owned a bank and he took down the -- the Serbian sign and behind it was the original Hungarian name of the bank.</span> <span id="s682">And lot of people did that.</span> <span id="s683">And so the Hungarian army marched in.</span> <span id="s684">A small amount of resistance, a few pockets of -- of -- of gunfire.</span> <span id="s685">And on that day or the following day, a officer appeared in my father’s office and ordered him out at gunpoint, and that --</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: Hungarian officer did this?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: Yeah, and that was that, they -- the plant was confiscated, newspaper taken over.</span> <span id="s688">A Aryan administrator was appointed, who kept all the charges -- directed all the charges to my father and my -- my aunt’s personal accounts.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: And in weeks he -- he bleeded everything that the two families had in cash.</span> <span id="s691">A third of the apartment was requisitioned for housing Hungarian officers.</span> <span id="s692">Cook, maid, governess left the same day, even before the ordinance came that Jews were not allowed to have --</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: So they -- they left on their own, as far as you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: Yup.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: So, a very intense shock.</span> <span id="s697">We lucked out with the -- with -- with the quartering, because the three officers who were -- who were quartered in the house were -- one was a -- one was a Count Esterhazy, one was a Count Karolyi, the son of the prime minister just before World War І.</span> <span id="s698">The third one I don’t remember, but also a count.</span> <span id="s699">Great gentlemen.</span> <span id="s700">Oh, we understand that Madame’s cook has left, our servant man would -- whatever the -- the -- the orderly, is at Madame’s disposal for whatever Madame wishes.</span> <span id="s701">So it was -- was very tense.</span> <span id="s702">I used to have a large stamp collection, that was one of the many things that went with the -- the china and silver and crystals and every --</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: They just took stuff?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: No, no, th -- that we had to sell.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: Ever -- everything we owned had to sell.</span> <span id="s707">My mother did handicrafts, knitting, weaving, to sell -- to produce things that could be sold.</span> <span id="s708">My father became quite ill.</span> <span id="s709">The big event that summer, as tha -- I had finished fourth grade so I was a-about to enter the fi -- first year of academic high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: Which is gymnasium?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: Gymnasium.</span> <span id="s712">And the Hungarian numerus clausus law was put into effect, the number of Jews admitted equaled the number of -- the proportion of the Jews of the population.</span> <span id="s713">So eight -- it was decreed that eight Jews would be admitted.</span> <span id="s714">And that summer, my father had nothing else to do, so he coached me all summer in Hungarian literature and history, which I knew nothing about, which I had no exposure to.</span> <span id="s715">And so I took the exam.</span> <span id="s716">Were rough, very hostile questioning.</span> <span id="s717">I remember one, wh -- where did the Hungarian renaissance king defeat the Turks, the only successful battle against the Turks.</span> <span id="s718">And I knew the answer was Belgrade, but I knew that if I gave the Serbian pronunciation, that would be curtains.</span> <span id="s719">I didn’t know the Hungarian prun -- pronunciation.</span> <span id="s720">Then I remembered that Belgrade means white castle and Feher Var is white castle in Hungarian, that was the -- the Hungarian name.</span> <span id="s721">And then I knew -- I remember enough of my grammar that the declension o-of Var is irregular.</span> <span id="s722">And to say at Belgrade, you had to say Feher Var otage and not Feher Var ohn.</span> <span id="s723">And I said that, and the guy said fine.</span> <span id="s724">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: And you passed.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: And eventually I was one of the eight that were -- were admitted.</span> <span id="s727">My sister was not -- I don’t know if she didn’t take the exam or -- or wasn’t admitted, I don’t remember, but she went to a parochial school.</span> <span id="s728">The -- the -- this particular order of nuns and a order of -- of teaching priests called the en -- the Piarists, rel -- related to the Jesuits but not Jesuits.</span> <span id="s729">They refused to honor the numerus clausus and they accepted Jewish students.</span> <span id="s730">So I went three years to the gymnasium.</span> <span id="s731">Hostile teachers sitting in the back row.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: Jew -- the Jewish students had to sit in the back row?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: Sit in the back row.</span> <span id="s734">If you raised your -- raised your hand they ignored you, most of the time.</span> <span id="s735">A fren -- a father of a friend was -- a few years ago was doing a history of -- of that gymnasium, and I asked him to -- to look up the names.</span> <span id="s736">And he gave me the names and he said, “There’s this strange notation.</span> <span id="s737">The tuition is -- tuition charge is listed.”</span> <span id="s738">So in -- you know, in addition to everything else they -- they charged tuition to the Jews in -- in nominally free public school.</span> <span id="s739">So -- so it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: It was really tough for you, wasn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: So it was a very tough life.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: Tough on m -- very tough on my parents and to see that, it was very tough.</span> <span id="s744">I st -- in the afternoons after school and in summers, I started working in this machine shop of a former employee that my father bankrolled into getting this shop.</span> <span id="s745">He was the only mechanic who could repair the -- the printing presses, but he was a Serb, and so the Hungarians threw him out.</span> <span id="s746">And the presses never ran after that.</span> <span id="s747">And so I worked in his machine shop, and that -- and had some income, but -- but it was a very, very tenuous and tough life.</span> <span id="s748">And -- and my mo -- my father was getting -- was -- was physically ill, he -- he was in -- in the hospital in Szeged, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s749">I remember going to a temple, must have been Passover of -- of ’43 or ’44, I don’t know, but my sister and I went to the temple and there was no place to go after that because my mother was in Szeged with my father and a -- visiting him in the hospital.</span> <span id="s750">That was -- it was -- it was very harsh.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: Do you know what sort of sickness he had?</span> <span id="s752">A: He -- he -- he had angina.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: He had angina.</span> <span id="s754">And do you think he had this before, or that we --</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: I don’t know, I don’t know --</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: -- the shock of what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: -- but the -- I don’t know, but he is -- the stress on him was very --</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: Was ha -- was very high.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: Was very high.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: Now was there an early trial of your father over the business?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: Yes, yeah, the hung --</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: What was that about?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: -- the hu -- the Hungarians had to legitimize all of these takeovers.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: And there was a trial of my aunt and my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: Of your aunt as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: Oh yeah, well, she was the owner.</span> <span id="s768">My father was the manager.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: And a horrible -- the -- the people who had worked for my father -- you know, there’s horrible, horrible anti-Semitic statements and accusations and -- I -- I n -- I know that was ver -- very hard on his -- father.</span> <span id="s771">And the end of the trial was that the -- the takeover was justified.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: I see, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: It was legally sanctioned.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: -- so there was no additional punishment other than the taking --</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: No, there was no addition --</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: But that still must have been horrible for your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: Oh yeah, well.</span> <span id="s780">Yeah, wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: It certainly affects you now when you think back on it, doesn’t it?</span> <span id="s782">Yeah.</span> <span id="s783">What was it like every day in your family now that this -- was it very depressing, or scary, or -- or --</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: Depressed, I don’t know if it was depressing, but all scrunched together.</span> <span id="s785">I think at the end we only had the two rooms.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: The what?</span> <span id="s787">You --</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: Two rooms.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: Sa -- two rooms in the -- yeah, on the back side were taken, the large dining room was taken and I think we were scrunched into two rooms.</span> <span id="s791">Yeah, it was v -- very tou -- very tense, is what I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: And what about friends?</span> <span id="s793">Your non-Jewish friends stopped playing with you when you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: Yeah, largely, although in -- in the high school, in -- in the gymnasium, there were a couple -- a couple of kids who were -- who were very decent.</span> <span id="s795">I remember one -- one thing I remember clearly is that we had to go on a -- on a -- a nature hunt and collect mushrooms of a -- or plants or whatever.</span> <span id="s796">And these two guys came and asked if -- if I would join them and -- but at that -- that was sort of isolated in a -- oth-otherwise we were totally isolated.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: And do you think that these people were -- because you describe your life before as no anti-Semitism, I mean Jews and Catholics and people are intermingling in Yugoslavia.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: But the Germans come, and even in the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: Well, remember, from ’41 to forty f -- f -- forty phone -- four, there were no Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: Right, there’s Hungarians.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: Hungarians.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: With there -- yeah.</span> <span id="s805">I think they -- they sanctioned anti-Semitism of the -- of the occupying forces let things -- encouraged things to boil on the surface.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: But then it’s -- becomes -- it’s interesting as to what people really believe.</span> <span id="s807">Do they really believe this, or are they just doing it because it’s sanctioned, and you know, there are [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: I don’t know, I don’t know, a -- a -- a lot of people became pardoned, members of the Arrow Cross party, but by the time I got back in ’45, they were wearing the insignia that they had been partisans since 1941, the same people.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Right, sure, sure.</span> <span id="s810">Do you remember anti-Semitic laws that the Hungarians put into place in ’41?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: You do?</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: And what -- what were -- what do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: Oh, t-turning in everything.</span> <span id="s816">Turning in radios, turning in alarm clocks, I don’t know what else, but there was always a new law about --</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: -- things you couldn’t do, which we laughed off, because we couldn’t afford to do them anyhow.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: And -- and these interminable laws about this had to be turned in and that had to be turned in.</span> <span id="s821">And trooping to the -- to the police headquarters to turn these things in.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: And did you have to wear a Jewish star?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: Not until the --</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: Or did that come later?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: -- Germans came.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: Not until the Germans came.</span> <span id="s827">What about movies, could you go to the movies still?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: Movies were prohibited, the beach was prohibited.</span> <span id="s829">The beach, which was a big part of our summer events --</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: -- that was prohibited.</span> <span id="s832">There was a -- a steam bath with a sort of a small makeshift beach, that -- owned by a Jewish businessman, that sort of became the hanging out place in the summer.</span> <span id="s833">La -- and movies were out.</span> <span id="s834">Beach was out.</span> <span id="s835">The promenade up and down the main drag was out.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: Was out.</span> <span id="s837">Were you able go to synagogue still, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A:

Three</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: Steve, did you notice that the treatment of Jews and Serbs were sort of equally as bad during this period before the Germans come?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: Yes, definitely.</span> <span id="s854">Yeah, very definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: So e -- so everybody is suffering under this, except --</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A:

this story at the -- this magazine that was published in 90 s -- ’94 for a 50th anniversary.</span> <span id="s963">The big section where my uncle and -- and -- and my father are described, the heading of that section is Jews as the guardians of Hungarian culture during -- during the Yugoslav years.</span> <span id="s964">That’s how they --</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: That’s how they put it.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: -- they viewed themselves, and that’s how the world viewed them.</span> <span id="s967">And so they -- I mean, we heard about the -- the slaughter at Nowy Sad,

she could shove into it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: And took it.</span> <span id="s1155">That’s quite an act.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A: Yup.</span> <span id="s1157">And she gave it back to us when -- when we came back.</span> <span id="s1158">So we went into this one room.</span> <span id="s1159">My maternal grandmother was bithu -- was moved in with us.</span> <span id="s1160">My paternal grandmother did something else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: Uh-huh, the maternal, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: Yup.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: The paternal grand --</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: My -- my father’s oldest sister Rose married a Christian, converted at such an early age that by Hungarian law she was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s1165">By German law she would have been.</span> <span id="s1166">Not only she was not deported, but my grandmother moved in with her.</span> <span id="s1167">All of us were going one way --</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: She was going --</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: -- and everybody knew that old Mrs. Friedman was living there for a year with -- with her daughter, and nothing happened to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: Huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: She was there when we came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: How interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: Yup.</span> <span id="s1176">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: Did you see the cook?</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: No, not -- no, I don’t -- no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: You didn’t see the cook at that mo -- you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: No, I-I’ve thought about that before, no I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: It’s interesting what she took, isn’t it, Steve?</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: Yup.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q: That she took your mother’s things, and no -- nothing else.</span> <span id="s1186">It’s quite extraordinary, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: It turns out, we discovered this just a few years ago, that within this thick cookbook, somehow stuck into it, were two other things.</span> <span id="s1188">One was a blueprint of the parlor furniture that my mother’s uncle, the architect designed for her as his wedding gift.</span> <span id="s1189">That’s framed in my -- my sister’s apartment.</span> <span id="s1190">And the other a slim diary that my mother had kept, which is sobering, because it’s two and a half years of my sister from her birth, and about four months of me after my birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: And then they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: And then it stops?</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: And then it stops.</span> <span id="s1195">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: And it’s about you as a [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: Oh, yeah, yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: -- it’s just every detail of what you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: -- like every detail, measurements, not just height and weight, but the he -- circumference of the head and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: -- and -- and food, and how much food and how much weight, yup.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: That must --</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A: And first words and -- and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: That’s extraordinary to have, isn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A: Yes, yes, yup.</span> <span id="s1208">So -- so that’s where we wound up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Q: And what’s this ghetto like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">A: Well, it wasn’t a connected ghetto.</span> <span id="s1211">It was several areas dissected by major roads that were open.</span> <span id="s1212">And, you know, broken down old houses that were requisitioned and we were squeezed into them.</span> <span id="s1213">Terrible sanitary conditions, terrible.</span> <span id="s1214">Some communal food, but that was terrible.</span> <span id="s1215">No medical attention whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1216">But you’re still allowed to go from one to another.</span> <span id="s1217">And I, working in a plant that was doing some military work, had a pass to get out of the -- the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">Q: Is this in an -- it’s not enclosed, is there a fence, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">A: There was some kind of a gate, guarded by --</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: There was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A: Yeah, it was enclosed at night.</span> <span id="s1222">I -- but not -- not -- not as --</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: Not like a wall?</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: -- not like the Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1225">Yeah, not a wall, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: Did you have toilet facilities in your apartment?</span> <span id="s1227">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A: A privy in the -- in the back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Q: In the back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Q: Water?</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">A: Like everybody else, y-y-yeah.</span> <span id="s1233">Artesian well in the back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: Was there a kitchen?</span> <span id="s1235">No kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">Q: No, so it’s all communal eating --</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">A: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: -- which is not eating.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: So you -- do you start being hungry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: No, I work outside.</span> <span id="s1243">My boss’s wife fed me lunch, and had a satchel for me to take back to the family.</span> <span id="s1244">So I was probably better off than most people.</span> <span id="s1245">But I was in the shop on my birthday, June six, 1944, and I her -- when we heard about the -- when I heard about the -- about Normandy.</span> <span id="s1246">And I must have been the first one to come into the ghetto to -- to tell people about it.</span> <span id="s1247">I -- I don’t know, I -- it’s -- it’s -- when I recall I -- it was sort of a hothouse atmosphere.</span> <span id="s1248">I mean, we had, at age 13 we had this -- this horribly serious love affairs with 12 year old girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: You too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1255">All -- I mean, everything was -- was very intense and very concentrated and very pres -- precocious for age, shall I say so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: So when you say affair, you mean there were -- there was a lot of sexual relations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: Was this shocking for the adults?</span> <span id="s1259">Were they all like what’s going on here, or did nobody care any more?</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">A: Nobody cared any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: Nobody cared.</span> <span id="s1262">And did -- did it feel as if -- well, we may die, so -- or is --</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely, definitely.</span> <span id="s1264">And things can get only worse was -- I think that was the [indecipherable] yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1266">So did you have a steady girlfriend?</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1268">I was more enamored of her than she was of me, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q: Well, it happens, doesn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: And did you bring her some of the food that you’ve brought back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: Oh yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1273">But that only was -- that was -- a-again, I can go back to the -- this thick book by the gentleman from Columbia University.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s1275">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A: No, no, no, no, they -- the gentleman who did the two volume on the genocide in Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">Q: Oh, Braham.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: Br -- br -- yeah, Braham.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q: Braham, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">A: I mean, I can get all the dates out of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">A: I was one of the main plaintiffs in the -- in the slave labor suit, because I -- because I had better documentation than anybody else, because I just went to Braham’s book and copied out all the dates.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A: So mid-June were -- order came, leave the apartments with one piece of luggage.</span> <span id="s1285">We’re lined up facing the railroad yards.</span> <span id="s1286">We were put into these railroad cars and that was just a very short trip to Bacsalmas which was a -- a village that Hungarians took over and made it as the ghetto for putting in people from Nowy Sad and the whole region.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: And that became -- that’s the ghetto that ends -- ends up being a weigh station to other places.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: To -- right, right --</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1290">Cause you’re not there for hugely long time, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">A: No, five, six days, I think, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">Q: Is that all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">A: I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">Q: And who of your family goes?</span> <span id="s1295">It’s your sister and your mother and your maternal grandmother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">A: My -- my a -- maternal grandmother.</span> <span id="s1297">My Uncle [indecipherable], my aunt and her mother, and her sister-in-law, German speaking Gerda.</span> <span id="s1298">That’s it.</span> <span id="s1299">Now I’m told, I don’t remember that, but I’m told that the church bells were ringing and that te deum masses were held in the churches as the trains pulled out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: Like a celebration.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">A: Yup.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">A: So Bacsalmas was -- was even more -- I mean -- I mean that -- housed in a chicken coop, I believe, terribly cramped.</span> <span id="s1304">We kids were running around the camp, all -- that’s all I remember is -- is we -- running around, all kinds of rumors about ways of getting out, some of which turned out true.</span> <span id="s1305">There was one train -- I’m -- I’m -- I’m not sure I can reconstruct the whole story, but it’s in Braham’s book.</span> <span id="s1306">Eight --</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: Can -- I -- I hate to interrupt you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: -- we have to take a break --</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q: -- we have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">End of Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Beginning Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: Steve, you were talking about people saying there were ways to escape somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: Well there was rumors flying everywhere.</span> <span id="s1317">It turns out that two tr -- one train -- I don’t know how many cars, but one trainload, mostly of prominent people was diverted and sent to -- and went to Switzerland, maybe 100 - 150 people.</span> <span id="s1318">A much smaller group which may have been just one car, was diverted and taken to Budapest and opened up there.</span> <span id="s1319">And one of -- one of my classmates from grade school who now lives in Israel was in that group, and it was a relative of hers who was in the Hungarian equivalent of the ghetto leadership, whatever it was called, arranged for that carload to be brought to Budapest, which at that time was still quite free.</span> <span id="s1320">See ha -- the Hungarians -- yo -- as -- as eager as the individual gendarmes were to do the job, the horti -- Admiral Horthy and -- and his government was not that e-eager.</span> <span id="s1321">So they started on the periphery of the -- re-occupied provinces from slova -- Slovakia, Transylvania and -- and Backa in the south.</span> <span id="s1322">And delayed deportation from Budapest as we -- as long as they could.</span> <span id="s1323">And so my friend Lilly survived in Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">Q: This was your girlfriend?</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">A: No, this is a fre --</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Q: Oh, this is ano -- other friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">A: -- a classmate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1329">And she survived in Budapest?</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: Yeah, she and her mother survived in Budapest and walked back -- walked back and got back to Subotica.</span> <span id="s1331">Subotica was liberated in October, ’44.</span> <span id="s1332">We w -- we were deported in -- in June, and by f -- by October, the partisans were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s1334">So these trains were diverted by the Jewish Council?</span> <span id="s1335">I mean, they were sa -- some --</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A: I tha -- that one -- one carload --</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q: That one car?</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: -- was -- was -- my understanding is that it was diverted by the Jewish Council.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s1340">So did -- when you heard this did you believe it and did you try to get on these trains, or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: Well, we tried, but I mean -- one of my classmates, whom my wife met once, whom all the other, the few survivors left bitterly hate -- bitterly dislike.</span> <span id="s1342">He was a [indecipherable] from day one.</span> <span id="s1343">He was on that group.</span> <span id="s1344">He went -- a-after the war he came back, he went to Israel, he -- he was appointment secretary for s -- for some minister, but he assured everybody that he was running the country.</span> <span id="s1345">You know, I -- total -- impossible character, but he was telling us about all of these things, so -- so it was -- it wasn’t easy to believe him.</span> <span id="s1346">I mean, none of us believed him.</span> <span id="s1347">But anyhow, it was just a few days before the real train ride took place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">A: 60 some people per car.</span> <span id="s1350">No food, no water, no sanitation.</span> <span id="s1351">People dying.</span> <span id="s1352">And then the doors opened and we were in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">Q: Now, go back for a moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q: Do you get a notice, or they just say, out, the -- just -- th-the same way they did with the other?</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">A: Yeah, right, yes, just out, yeah.</span> <span id="s1357">Line up, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">Q: Now, you also said that you kids, when you were in this second ba -- barc --</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">A: Bachal -- Bacsalmas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: Bacsalmas.</span> <span id="s1361">Is that right, Bacsalmas?</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: That you were just running around like crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q: What was that?</span> <span id="s1366">I mean, why were you running around?</span> <span id="s1367">What -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">A: Well, chasing rumors, trying to find food, trying -- seeing if possible we could get out.</span> <span id="s1369">Just -- just busy-ness, but I -- that’s what I remember is -- is this relentless restlessness of trying to do something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1371">Were the adults as restless as you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">A: No, no, the a-adults were very passive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: My grandmother had had mental problems before.</span> <span id="s1375">She’s not a Freda Kahlo, but like Kahlo she -- she lost a leg in a streetcar accident, I don’t know when.</span> <span id="s1376">And she had -- she had mental trauma.</span> <span id="s1377">She was going crazy, there’s just no question about that.</span> <span id="s1378">And it -- my mother was -- was very, very upset.</span> <span id="s1379">And so getting out of there was just -- you know, just -- we just had to get out of there, and that’s why I was never in that place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: So you didn’t stay with them, if you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">A: I crawled in at night, I guess, but I don’t remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">A: At dawn I was out of there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">Q: But it clearly is very chaotic for you there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">Q: And did you have an idea where they were sending people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">Q: No idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">Q: And you had never heard of Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q: And what had you been hearing about the killing of Jews?</span> <span id="s1393">Cause here you have two years between ’42 and ’44, and so many Jews are killed in ’41 and ’42.</span> <span id="s1394">Do you hear anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">A: Yeah, we heard some.</span> <span id="s1396">There were -- there were a couple people who had escaped from -- I don’t know whether it’s from the camp, but certainly from the -- from Galicia, from the -- occupied Poland.</span> <span id="s1397">And we were warning, but nobody listened to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">Q: [indecipherable] didn’t believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">A: No.</span> <span id="s1400">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">Q: Do you remember this train ride?</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: Can you see it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">Q: You can s -- you can see the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">Q: Are you sitting, standing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">A: Mostly standing, sometimes pushing thr -- my way to the crack at the door.</span> <span id="s1409">Certainly I wasn’t tall enough to push myself to the -- to the barred window.</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">Q: How tall are you?</span> <span id="s1411">Cause you’re now 14 -- or 13, you’re 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">A: I -- I don’t know how tall I was, I was -- I was sort of reasonable ral -- height for my age.</span> <span id="s1413">Not -- not necessarily very tall.</span> <span id="s1414">Tall enough to survive the -- the -- the selection.</span> <span id="s1415">Yeah, I remember that -- that train ride quite well.</span> <span id="s1416">And I remember that chaos that greeted us.</span> <span id="s1417">Yells, shouts, dogs barking, people shoved out of the cars.</span> <span id="s1418">My grandmother sitting on a pile of -- of suitcases and stuff in her gown, with her prosthesis lacking, waving to us and saying -- saying, “I’m healthy, I’m healthy.”</span> <span id="s1419">[indecipherable] I forget now what she said, but she cheerfully waved to us.</span> <span id="s1420">And we were lined up.</span> <span id="s1421">First I was with my mother and sister and then they -- women to one side, men to the other side.</span> <span id="s1422">And that’s the last time I saw my mother.</span> <span id="s1423">And eventually five of us, we were marched past this SS officer in white gloves, whether it’s Mengele or not I don’t know, I -- I couldn’t tell, couldn’t remember.</span> <span id="s1424">But I guess I was tall enough and healthy looking enough that I was waved this way and not that way.</span> <span id="s1425">So I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">Q: Was he wearing a white coat as well as white gloves?</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">A: White gloves, no, no, mi --</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">Q: Just white gloves?</span> <span id="s1429">White gl --</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">A: -- wi -- military uniform and white gloves, medical gloves.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">Q: Was he actually touching people?</span> <span id="s1432">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1434">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">A: So this endless processing, being stripped naked, being shorn, disinfected, sitting, waiting, sitting naked on the floor.</span> <span id="s1436">Eventually rushed, always rushed from barrack to barrack, tha -- at -- at -- at double time with guards barking and hitting.</span> <span id="s1437">Thrown some mis -- ill -- ill-fitting prison uniforms and broken down shoes, and marched into the compound in a barrack across from the Gypsy barracks, where there were about 10,000 -- abi -- about a thousand kids my age.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q: You were with kids your age?</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">A: That was a barrack only for kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">Q: Now, are you tattooed at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">A: No.</span> <span id="s1442">You were not tattooed til you left the place.</span> <span id="s1443">I was tattooed when I -- in October when I left.</span> <span id="s1444">Until then you weren’t even a number.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: Now that’s a little unusual, so I’m just wondering whether it was because you were a group of kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">A: No.</span> <span id="s1447">When they -- the huge onslaught in summer of ’44, of -- of the Hungarian --</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q: You were not tattooed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">A: They were not and when they -- when -- later when the Lódz ghetto was emptied and they were brought in, they were not tattooed until they left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1451">So w --</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">A: You -- you can check my --</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1454">No, no, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">A: -- you can -- you can check the -- the Auschwitz, the big Auschwitz diary doesn’t have it on a weekly basis, but occasionally it has a list of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">A: -- of serial numbers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">A: Mine is from October --</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">A: -- not from --</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Q: No, no, it [indecipherable] right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">A: -- not from June.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">Q: But it’s a -- it’s an unusual circumstance --</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">A: Well, I mean that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">Q: -- so it’s interesting.</span> <span id="s1467">Maybe it’s only for the Hungarians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">A: That n -- I mean, that -- that load on the system --</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: -- the -- the gas chambers, crematoria and the processing area was -- was -- I don’t think there had been that much of it, that volume, before that summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: Do you come in with the large Hungarian transports, or do --</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: Yes, all of Bacsalmas.</span> <span id="s1473">I mean, I don’t know how many trains from Bacsalmas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">Q: You don’t know how many.</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">Q: So you’re in a barrack, you’re in B2D, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">A: Something tha -- yeah, yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">Q: Something like that.</span> <span id="s1479">And B2E has some Gypsies?</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">A: The whole row, [indecipherable] on the fem -- if I can visualize the map, the norther -- the northeastern quadrant of the compound was all Gypsies, all Gypsy families.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">Q: Cause there’s a big killing of Gypsies in May before you come.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">Q: But there are some Gypsies left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">A: But there’s one in August.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">Q: Right, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1487">That one I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">Q: That’s what -- that’s what the one that you remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">A: Right, yup.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: Do you get a number on your uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: Nope.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">Q: You have nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s1494">I -- I have my ID card, I mean my index card from Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1495">I don’t know how it worked in Auschwitz, but everything was recorded and everything was in the books.</span> <span id="s1496">I got these terrible broken down shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">Q: Were they wooden?</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">A: Wooden.</span> <span id="s1499">The wooden sole broken.</span> <span id="s1500">Terrible sores on my foot.</span> <span id="s1501">I took myself to the revier -- to the hospital wing, and I sat there waiting, nobody would service me.</span> <span id="s1502">Appel started, and the entire compound was on block -- on lockdown because one number was out of order.</span> <span id="s1503">And I remember very clearly this very large SS officer, and this small, owlish, Polish kapo came to get me and marched me in front of all of the assembled people back to my barracks and I remember clearly the Polish kapo whispering to me in Polish, “If you were not this young, you would be long dead.”</span> <span id="s1504">Yup, I -- for a day I upset the entire accounting system.</span> <span id="s1505">How they knew that, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">Q: Wait a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">A: How they knew that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q: How -- how are you upsetting the counting system?</span> <span id="s1509">You don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">A: The barrack was short one and the revier was -- was one more than was supposed to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">Q: Supposed to have.</span> <span id="s1512">And were -- were they identifying you by name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1514">I have no --</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: You don’t know.</span> <span id="s1516">You have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">A: -- th -- the -- no, they found me and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">Q: Now you said this guy, the Polish kapo spoke to you in Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">Q: How did you understand Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">A: Serbian and Polish are --</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">Q: Are so close?</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">A: -- si -- six weeks later I -- I was fluent in Polish because I was working for the Polish kapos.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s1525">Huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">A: So okay.</span> <span id="s1527">So you know enough about Auschwitz, you know that camps C and D were largely warehouses of labor personnel.</span> <span id="s1528">German civilians came in, selection was set up, usually in the -- naked, not always.</span> <span id="s1529">They selected the workers and those people were marched out ta -- a -- first into compound A and then registered, tattooed and sent out.</span> <span id="s1530">Digression.</span> <span id="s1531">A number of years ago at Pittsburgh, we hosted a small exhibit from the Auschwitz museum.</span> <span id="s1532">There was an opening night for the survivors.</span> <span id="s1533">Was a big map of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1534">And seven or eight people there asked me to take them over to the map and show them where they had been, because most of them were there three, four days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">A: And I was there four months.</span> <span id="s1537">And I have a reasonably good graphic memory and so I showed them anyway.</span> <span id="s1538">So that was camp life.</span> <span id="s1539">At that time wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">Q: Wa -- when -- when you’re showing them the map, they’re looking at the outside commandoes that they were on, they didn’t know that they were all --</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">A: No, they were not on there, they were all in one of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">Q: So they were -- but they didn’t know where they were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">A: The people who were there only three days were there in one --</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">A: -- in either C or D.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">Q: Right, and they didn’t know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">A: They didn’t know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">Q: Of course, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">A: So the boys barrack was treated like every other, you know, once a day allowed to run to the ra -- latrine.</span> <span id="s1550">You know, you learn things on the way, like a elder -- older inmate telling you to -- to pick up a pebble on the way to the latrine, so you have something to wipe yourself with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">Q: A pebble?</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1553">Food, ladled out from these big cauldrons.</span> <span id="s1554">Somehow you had -- an -- and the slice of bread, somehow you had to save enough to have enough on -- on the black market to get yourself a broken down tin cup, otherwise the soup was ladled in your hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">Q: So you were not given a cup at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">Q: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">A: No.</span> <span id="s1559">And we could see people coming and going in the barracks, in the barrack that we were in, nobody was coming, and the only going was -- was to the selection and to the -- to the crematoria.</span> <span id="s1560">My -- all my classmates, one by one, becoming walking corpses, musselmanner, and dying.</span> <span id="s1561">I rem -- I mean, I still remember the sequence of the last three or four, until I was alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">Q: Until you were alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">A: Out of the group from Subotica.</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">Q: And how do you account for your being able to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">A: Well, one thing my gra -- my governess did me a great service.</span> <span id="s1568">The kapos were all red fr -- were all green triangles, German political prisoner -- German criminals, and they needed an interpreter and one of them came around asking for an interpreter and I volunteered.</span> <span id="s1569">I spoke much better German than he did, much purer Volksdeutsche than he did.</span> <span id="s1570">And so I became an interpreter, and one of the privileges that came with it at -- after the soup was ladled out, you were allowed to scrape out the bottom of the -- of the pot.</span> <span id="s1571">And that was the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">Q: That was the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">A: -- increment that kept me alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">Q: Were you losing weight?</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">Q: You was -- you lost a lot of weight?</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1578">So, as I say, one by one, there were about seven or eight of us that were together, that knew each other, were together, and then --</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">Q: And they died from starvation, or they were killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">A: Yup.</span> <span id="s1581">They was -- died from starvation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">Q: They died of starvation.</span> <span id="s1583">When you say the word musselmanner now --</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">Q: Is that a word that you knew then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">Q: This is what the terminology was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">A: Yes, this shuffling corpses, glazed eyes, yeah.</span> <span id="s1589">That was the definitely the -- the term.</span> <span id="s1590">So then came August, this night in August we were locked down.</span> <span id="s1591">I remember very clearly yelling, shouting, firing of weapons.</span> <span id="s1592">And we didn’t know what was going on.</span> <span id="s1593">We started singing, just to give ourselves strength or something.</span> <span id="s1594">And the following morning, as an interpreter, I could be out in front when the soup arrived.</span> <span id="s1595">And I looked around, the row of barracks was empty.</span> <span id="s1596">There were inmates clearing and later whitewashing the barracks.</span> <span id="s1597">And what was most startling is that the kapos that supervised them had red triangles.</span> <span id="s1598">So one o -- one of them, man by name Tadek, came over and said that he needed an interpreter who spoke Polish, German and Hungarian.</span> <span id="s1599">And I said Serbian and Polish are close enough, I volunteered.</span> <span id="s1600">And so that day I moved across to the barrack that he supervised.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">Q: Which was E, into E. Or is that not --</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">A: I -- if you give -- show me a ma -- if you give me a map, I’ll -- I’ll --</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">Q: Okay [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">A: -- I’ll locate the number.</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">Q: But le-let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s1606">Why was it so shocking to you that those who were supervising that barrack, where they had ex -- grabbed the Gypsies --</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">A: No, supervising the new -- new inmates, so it [indecipherable] the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">Q: Wa -- why -- oh, and why was it surprising that they were political prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">A: Because -- because up til then we were surrounded by the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">Q: By the greens?</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: By the greens.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">Q: By the criminals.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">A: Yes, except a coup -- one or two in the higher administration of the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1615">And having the political prisoners meant it would be better in some way, was that true?</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">A: Well, it meant it would be different.</span> <span id="s1617">The political prisoners at -- in Auschwitz as well as in -- later in Niederorschel, in front of the Germans were as loud and cussing.</span> <span id="s1618">They were as adroit with their batons in hitting you as the criminals.</span> <span id="s1619">But when the Germans were gone, then -- then things were different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1621">Which wasn’t true with the criminals.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">A: Which was not true with the criminals.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">A: And so I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">Q: So you joined them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">A: So I joined them, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">Q: What was Tadek like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">A: He was a university student, communist.</span> <span id="s1629">Caught up in the -- the big catching up ca -- round up of Polish intellectuals.</span> <span id="s1630">Not a terribly bright guy, but eventu -- I mean, he promised he would take care of me.</span> <span id="s1631">There were others.</span> <span id="s1632">There was a somewhat older guy, a kapo of one of the other barracks, who had been a c-communist organizer in Yugoslavia, so he -- he helped me occasionally with things I couldn’t translate.</span> <span id="s1633">And there was a third one by name of Piotr, who was a Russian studying in Poland, who was caught up and was deported with the Poles.</span> <span id="s1634">And he was by far the most entrepreneurial and enterprising of all of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">Q: Can you explain what you mean, why -- ho --</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">A: Well, black market was -- was the staff of life in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1637">Everything could be had.</span> <span id="s1638">We [indecipherable] work with Tadek and Piotr.</span> <span id="s1639">They -- the compound backed onto the railroad side [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1640">We would -- when a train arrived, we would be there sweeping the gravel between the last barrack and the -- and the electrified fence.</span> <span id="s1641">Guard towers at either end.</span> <span id="s1642">Occasionally whis -- whistle would sound, you would look up and tins of sardines, other thing liberatable.</span> <span id="s1643">You know, liberating was the -- the codeword to stealing, or flying over the fence, from the inmates who were cleaning the trains.</span> <span id="s1644">So that’s how you started accumulating black market goods.</span> <span id="s1645">Piotr -- well, I had my -- my duties, I was an interpreter.</span> <span id="s1646">Very often German people were lined up, German foreman will -- would come.</span> <span id="s1647">I would walk behind them and do whatever translating, if -- if they had questions for the inmates.</span> <span id="s1648">And most inmates always pretended that they didn’t know German, whether they knew it or not.</span> <span id="s1649">So I would translate.</span> <span id="s1650">Occasionally I actually esc -- was ordered to go up to the front, to the SS barracks at the top of the compound and escort the German to the -- to the site, to whatever barrack they were selecting from, and then escort them back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">Q: What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">A: Past the -- passing the gallows every day twice, it was not -- not pleasant.</span> <span id="s1653">But in addition to that, eventually Piotr organized a roof repair detail.</span> <span id="s1654">And we went from compound to compound pretending to patch roofs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">Q: Pretending?</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">A: I have a -- a -- I don’t have a full sense of equilibrium, I have a fear of heights.</span> <span id="s1659">I would have remembered if I had been on a roof, I’ve never been to -- on a roof.</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">Q: Did he go up on a roof?</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">A: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">Q: He went up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">A: Yeah, we -- we had this -- this cart with rolls of felt paper, barrel of pitch, both of them very good for hiding things as you go from -- as you’re frisked from compound to compound.</span> <span id="s1664">And they -- you know, they pretended to be patching roofs and -- and most of -- I mean it was spent trading black market goods, trading lists of prisoners to be smuggled out to the outside.</span> <span id="s1665">Typical day to day work of resistance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">Q: So you were the ground crew --</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">Q: -- for the roofer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">Q: I guess, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">Q: And unfortunately we have to stop the tape again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">End of Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">Beginning Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">Q: Steve.</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">Q: When we last were taping, you were talking about not being a roofer, but walking around with -- was it Tadek who was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">A: No, that’s -- that was Piotr.</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">Q: Piotr, who was going on the roof.</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">A: A-Actually, I -- I will correct myself.</span> <span id="s1682">I was on the roof of our old barracks, number 12, with couple others, there was an opening in the roof.</span> <span id="s1683">And we tried to pull out my last classmate.</span> <span id="s1684">Lowered a rope and tried to pull him up, and he didn’t have the strength in his arms to -- to hold on.</span> <span id="s1685">That’s -- that time I remember being in the roof, and I remember this incident because a number of years ago, when I was at the tekneon, this -- the guy’s sister came to see me because she understood that I had -- had seen him in Auschwitz, and she wanted the story of her brother.</span> <span id="s1686">But that’s the only thing -- only time I remember being on the roof.</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">Q: And why were you trying to pull him out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">A: Trying to save him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">Q: Uh-huh --</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">A: Trying to get --</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">Q: -- so you were -- you were going to put him someplace else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">Q: And you were able to be on the roof in spite of your problems with --</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">Q: But that must have been a horrible day then, not being able to pull him out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">A: Yeah, right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">Q: And wa -- going around fixing roofs, did he -- did Piotr actually fix roofs or was it mainly --</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">A: Oh, I think, yeah.</span> <span id="s1699">I mean this -- the barracks were shoddily built and shod -- and totally u -- not maintained and so there were roof leaks and we had pitch and felt paper and we did -- the crew did some repairs, but -- but that was really a cover for -- for black market operations.</span> <span id="s1700">He had a girlfriend, a female kapo in -- in one of the compounds in -- in Mexico, the -- the new -- the new women’s compounds in the other side of the main road.</span> <span id="s1701">And we were -- often went there.</span> <span id="s1702">I met my sister there.</span> <span id="s1703">I found out that she wa -- she was there and we met.</span> <span id="s1704">Sh -- this was late in the fall, and she was in a short sleeve dress, reddish hair, maybe centimeter long, no -- no longer than that.</span> <span id="s1705">Face and arms red raw from the wind.</span> <span id="s1706">She remembers that I was this fat, that’s how she described me.</span> <span id="s1707">Well, probably in -- in Auschwitz comparisons, I was fatter than -- than what her image was.</span> <span id="s1708">So I -- I found out that she was being shipped out on a transport and whatever black market goods I had, I cashed in and managed to get her a -- a sweater and scarf and gloves before she was shipped out.</span> <span id="s1709">Managed to get somebody to get it to her, after the -- the -- o-on exit.</span> <span id="s1710">But we went everywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">Q: So he had the right to go everywhere, whether it was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">A: Yeah, we -- well [indecipherable] right -- yeah.</span> <span id="s1713">Frisking at ev -- every entrance and every exit from a compound.</span> <span id="s1714">In Auschwitz the -- the common black market currency was a gold watch.</span> <span id="s1715">Everything was counted in -- in terms of gold watches.</span> <span id="s1716">And I was thin enough, I usually had dozen or more gold watches strapped to my thigh, so we went through frisking and I was never caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">Q: How could that be?</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">Q: But you had them on your thigh and they didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">A: Yeah, under my pants, and they didn’t frisk that far down.</span> <span id="s1721">I don’t know, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1722">So Kanada was a great place to go because lots of -- lots of good could be interchanged.</span> <span id="s1723">They were ke -- contact with the under -- with the Polish underground, they were -- you could pass information to the outside commandoes and they -- they were working outside the fence, and they -- the Polish underground was never more than a couple kilometers from the perimeter.</span> <span id="s1724">So we knew about the -- the Sonderkommando uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">Q: Did you hear it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">A: We her -- I don’t remember hearing, but I do remember the -- the extreme anxiety and the extreme unusual severity of the -- the controls in the watchtowers and that’s -- that’s all I remember about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">Q: We -- were you anywhere near when the women were hung because of the stealing of powder from [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">A: No, no, n-n-no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">Q: You weren’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">A: No.</span> <span id="s1731">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1732">I mean I’m just not [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">Q: You just don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">Q: When you went to see your sister, wasn’t she on the same transport with you when she came into Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">A: Yes, but then we were separated, and she was separated from our mother right -- almost right away.</span> <span id="s1737">She had the information that our mother was -- my mother had asthma and she thought that -- that she had an asthma attack and -- and that she was not yet dead she wa -- when she was carted away with the -- the day’s corpses to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s1738">It’s the best she could determine.</span> <span id="s1739">So -- so you know, th -- I last saw her in June, and this must have been September, thereabouts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">A: I remember it was beginning to get cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">Q: So you didn’t know until then that she was alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">A: I knew -- right, right, right,</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">Q: You thought she might have been --</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1746">Well, either shipped out or s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">A: -- killed, I don’t -- didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">Q: And her condition, was she okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">A: She was emaciated, and as I said there, you know, totally unprotected from the weather.</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1752">So what did it mean for you to be in this group?</span> <span id="s1753">Were they really doing resistance, were they doing it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">A: Well, it was something to do.</span> <span id="s1755">It was a will to live.</span> <span id="s1756">I mean, seemed to be some purpose to life rather than just waiting to be carted away to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s1757">And you know, I think back, I -- I -- the chance of surviving, the expectation to survive was very low, and you just did whatever you could to keep yourself busy.</span> <span id="s1758">And -- and quite frankly, on occasions they -- they certainly -- the kapos certainly used me for being much smaller to get into places where they couldn’t get into, to do hand-offs that -- that they felt they were too exposed, so yeah, I -- I made myself useful any -- any way I could.</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">Q: So what -- what would it be for you to hand off?</span> <span id="s1760">Is this a bartering system?</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">A: No, ma -- it was mostly issues of -- of handing off lists of prisoners to the -- to the outside commandoes, to be sent out to the -- to the -- to the out -- Polish underground on the outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">Q: So people would have names, so they would know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">Q: -- what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">Q: And where do the lists come from?</span> <span id="s1767">They weren’t -- w-were they paying for [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">A: Well, all the orderlies in the -- in the -- in the offices were also political prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">Q: So there’s a very extensive underground system --</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">Q: -- that’s going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">Q: And are you involved with people who are mainly doing informational resistance, or are they also connected with the people who are going to do an uprising?</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">A: There was no -- I -- I -- I -- not in Auschwitz, there was no -- I don’t recall any talk of any physical resistance because it was just -- just not possible.</span> <span id="s1775">[indecipherable] was different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">Q: But there was an uprising, so that there was physical resistance because the crematoria was blown up, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">A: Yeah, well -- well, yeah, but the Sonderkommando had privileges that even the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">A: -- the kapos in the regular compounds didn’t have.</span> <span id="s1780">They [indecipherable] access to food, to -- to alcohol, to bribe the -- the guard and all kinds of other things that -- I mean, they were privileged prisoners [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">Q: But when you -- when one says privileged, they’re still in a horrible situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">A: Oh yes, yes, of course, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">Q: Right, so it’s privileged in a very --</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">A: Right, right, and very relevant, very relevant --</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">Q: -- specific [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">A: -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">Q: Would you have considered yourself a privileged prisoner?</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">A: Oh definitely, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">Q: But were you actually protected from selections?</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">Q: You were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">A: Especially in the fall when things got severe, th-they hid me.</span> <span id="s1795">One time I was hiding in a latrine, up to my mouth in excrement.</span> <span id="s1796">Then I had to find a -- the lavatory barracks and sneak in and get a -- take a sh -- cold shower with clothes on to get some of the smell off.</span> <span id="s1797">Yeah, they protected me, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">Q: So they protected you, it’s not like as if you were in a protected kommando so that the SS wouldn’t get you.</span> <span id="s1799">It’s that the -- that these men themselves were protecting you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">A: Yes, right, right, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">Q: But going into latrine doesn’t sound --</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">A: Well, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">Q: -- to a normal perso --</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">Q: -- regular person, like it’s terribly much protection.</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">A: Well, if that was the place to hide, then that was the place to hide.</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">A: Yup.</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">Q: When you think about this now, thinking about yourself as you’re close to 14, or thirt -- you were really 13 actually --</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">A: Yup, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">Q: -- right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">Q: Doing this, can you conceive of yourself in this, or just this seems like, well it’s my history, it’s just the way it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">A: Oh, I th -- yeah, I can conceive myself doing it, I -- I did what I could, I -- I -- I -- I’m grateful to have had the opportunity to -- to do something, not to just sit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">Q: Now these -- these -- when you say that these are Polish kapos, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">A: Yeah, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">Q: -- you -- you mean that they’re Polish Gentiles --</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">Q: -- these are not Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1822">But they know you’re Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">Q: And there’s not a problem in terms of [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">A: No, they were violent anti-Semite, all of them, without exception.</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">Q: They were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1828">Without exception.</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">Q: So what was that like for you?</span> <span id="s1830">On the one hand they’re protecting you, on the other hand --</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">A: Well -- well, now, for the duration of the hostilities, they suspended their -- their animosity, or hatred, or whatever you want to call it.</span> <span id="s1832">But you -- you know, the ordinary talk, ex -- especially after a few vodka, the cuss terms for Jews was -- was as sharp as -- as the terms that the SS guards used.</span> <span id="s1833">No -- no distinction.</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">Q: Did it make you feel f -- strange, as a Jewish person, or not want to be Jewish, or that didn’t occur to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">A: That didn’t occur to me, no.</span> <span id="s1836">Just was part of the surroundings.</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">Q: So those years of living under the Hungarian occupation, while there’s not violence so much --</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">Q: -- there’s still a lot of anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s1840">So do you think you start getting used to it, you just expect this to be the case for a lot of people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">A: Yeah, yes, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">Q: Cause certainly it doesn’t seem to be easy to accept it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">A: It definitely was something to accept, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">Q: Now, do you kno -- are -- are you still involved at -- where are you living?</span> <span id="s1845">Are you living in B2 bi -- D, or are you living in the same place that you began?</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">A: In the same co -- in -- in -- in compound D, but in one of the barracks on the opposite side and further down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">Q: Than when you started.</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1850">And are you with any Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">A: Everybody’s Jew --</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">Q: Everybody’s Jewish, except these guys --</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">A: Except the -- except the -- the kapos, yeah.</span> <span id="s1854">All the orderlies wi --</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">Q: Now do they mistrust you because you’re with these other guys, and being an interpreter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">A: I mean, the front office in the barracks is -- is -- you know, maybe eight or 10 orderlies, and by that time they were all Lódz Jews.</span> <span id="s1859">And then in the back, or -- eight - 900, thousand inmates who rotate out on -- on very short time basis.</span> <span id="s1860">That was the life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">Q: And what do you understand what the Nazis are doing?</span> <span id="s1862">I -- you -- you know that they’re killing Jews in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">Q: Do you know at this point that there’s widespread killing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">Q: And that they’re trying to kill all Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">Q: You know this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1870">Def -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">Q: So you -- you don’t have much of an expectation of surviving this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">A: Like zero.</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">Q: Zero?</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">A: Yup.</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">Q: But you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">A: But I never gave up, I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">Q: But you never gave up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">A: Every opportunity I could to -- to do something like that.</span> <span id="s1879">I never allowed myself to -- to give up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">Q: Was your sister a similar way --</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">Q: -- when you spoke to her afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">A: Yes, yup.</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">Q: And are you hearing things about the progress of the war also?</span> <span id="s1885">Are the rumors going around --</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">A: Ah yes, some of the smuggling was the other way, from the underground on the outside, so yes, we knew something about the -- well, in -- in that location we knew a lot more about the -- the eastern front than the -- than the western front.</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">Q: So is some of your -- not desire to live, but ability to keep going, also a function of thinking well maybe the war will end, maybe they’ll be ri --</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">A: Oh yes, de -- yes, by that time it was beginning to -- to look like that, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">Q: It wa -- it was beginning to look up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">A: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">Q: Are there many kids around your age, or are they mostly gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">A: I don’t remember if the kid’s barrack continued.</span> <span id="s1893">Now, among the later transport -- among the Budapest Jews that came later, July or -- or August, there were quite a few father son groups -- pairs.</span> <span id="s1894">And I think among the Lódz Jews also.</span> <span id="s1895">So you’d did doos -- did see some kids teen -- in their teens.</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">Q: But they don’t necessarily stay very long in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">A: They not necessarily stay in Auschwitz, and I don’t remember many of them being alone, they were usually with their fathers.</span> <span id="s1898">I remember that very clearly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">Q: Do you feel protected, do you feel close -- a-and close to these guys?</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">Q: You do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1902">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">Q: So, are they nice to you in some ways?</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1905">Yup.</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">Q: Are they warm as well, when --</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">A: Yeah, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">Q: Because this must be difficult, you are still a child, in a way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">Q: And not receiving affection and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1911">A: Oh, I me -- in those circumstances, ya -- normal emotions don’t -- don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">Q: Don’t count.</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">A: -- don’t do much.</span> <span id="s1914">But you’re better off without them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">Q: You’re better off without them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">A: Oh, it’s ha -- it’s -- it’s -- it’s just baggage, it -- it -- very ha-hard to carry around.</span> <span id="s1919">Lot of ri -- writers have -- have said that.</span> <span id="s1920">Kids had an easier time surviving than adults, that you were not conditioned by civilization, and I -- that’s definitely the case that I remembered.</span> <span id="s1921">That I dare to do things that adults would -- would not do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">Q: Do you think that you became more primitive in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">A: Oh yeah, by all means, yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">A: -- yes.</span> <span id="s1926">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">Q: Does -- when you look back, does it surprise you how easy it is to become so different than what you were before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">A: Yeah, in a -- tha -- yes, definitely.</span> <span id="s1929">But you know, it -- it was -- entrance to Auschwitz was this deep, deep, deep immersion into hell that you couldn’t con -- possibly conceive.</span> <span id="s1930">And you either got out of it, or you didn’t get out of it.</span> <span id="s1931">And I don’t know what in my make-up helped me to -- to get out of it, other than the -- my governess’s effort to teach me German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">Q: [indecipherable] terrible governess.</span> <span id="s1933">You saw a lot of hangings.</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">Q: Was that the first time you saw a dead person?</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">A: No, in -- no, in 1941, at -- when the Hungarians came in, 13 young people were hung in the public square, including the -- the rabbi’s son, and I remember seeing that hanging.</span> <span id="s1937">So I -- I -- yes, I’d seen a hanging before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">Q: You had seen it before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1940">Q: Did you see beatings in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">A: All the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">Q: All the time.</span> <span id="s1943">Was there sort of a gen -- you know, people just walk around and all of a sudden they would be hit, or did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">A: Yes, oh yeah, ra -- yeah, random violence all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">Q: And did you see people who were being punished and beaten?</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">Q: What did it make you think about human beings?</span> <span id="s1948">Did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1949">A: Hoping that it wasn’t me.</span> <span id="s1950">I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">Q: Oh, you hoped it wasn’t you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">A: Yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">A: -- I mean, you get -- you become very selfish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">A: Self-centered and selfish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">Q: Did you see the people who were helping you, being brutal to other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">Q: And did you ever say to them, how can you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1962">Were you ever afraid that they would ask you to do that kind of thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1963">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">Q: You weren’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">A: No.</span> <span id="s1966">They would --</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">Q: They wouldn’t have done it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">A: No, they wouldn’t have asked me, no.</span> <span id="s1969">But, I mean, I have some recollections which I’m not very proud of.</span> <span id="s1970">I remember one day very clearly having a snack before di-di-distribution of dinner -- in -- in -- a slice of bread, and three slices of cheese on it, and going outside for a [indecipherable] standing for the appel, and one of them said, “What is the ration tonight?”</span> <span id="s1971">And I said, “One of these slices of cheese.”</span> <span id="s1972">And I was eating three or four as a snack.</span> <span id="s1973">And another time -- shoes were always an issue, and mine were -- were again, very beaten up and Tadek saw a pair on a man, a pair of ski boots that he thought would be good for me and made him take them off and take my broken down shoes, and he gave him a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s1974">And I didn’t feel good about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">Q: But you now have ski boots?</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1977">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1978">So that was -- that was life in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1979">I became very callous.</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">Q: Yeah, makes perfect sense though.</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">A: Clawing t -- clawing through life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">Q: Was there a canteen in Auschwitz that you knew about where you could go and get, I don’t know, juice or cigarettes or something.</span> <span id="s1983">Was there a place that people could exchange?</span></p> <p><span id="s1984">A: Yeah, there was a canteen in th -- I-I mean, I understand Auschwitz itself there were several canteen --</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">Q: You mean Auschwitz one?</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">A: -- in -- in -- in Birkenau, Auschwitz two, I think there was a canteen.</span> <span id="s1987">I don’t know who had access to it, but we -- we got things with black market things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">Q: So you didn’t go to the canteen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">A: Oh, I’d -- I’d been to the canteen many times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">Q: You were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">A: Yeah,</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">A: But bartering.</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">Q: As opposed to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">Q: -- purch -- I don’t know what they purchased.</span></p> <p><span id="s1997">A: There -- yeah, there was some -- there was some scrip.</span> <span id="s1998">Yeah, everything was bartered [indecipherable], passes to the women’s b -- to the -- to the prisoner’s brothel was so many gold watches.</span> <span id="s1999">And then you got --</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">Q: So many gold watches.</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">A: -- and then you got a pass.</span></p> <p><span id="s2002">Q: And did you know people who went?</span> <span id="s2003">A: Yup.</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">Q: Did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">Q: No.</span> <span id="s2007">Could you have gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s2008">A: I guess not, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">Q: A-As a Jewish boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">Q: You don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2012">A: The kapos around me all had girlfriends in a -- in -- kapos in the -- in the women’s barracks, they didn’t have to go to the brothel.</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">Q: And were they ab -- they were able to go in and out of the women’s barracks?</span> <span id="s2014">A: Well, one time I -- I remember -- I remember one times very clearly Piotr was in bed with this woman and an SS came in and I was in the out -- outer room, and all I -- and all of these women orderlies had these beautifully elaborate ta -- beds -- beds with silk bedcovers and silk pillows, everything pilfered or bar -- bartered from Kanada.</span> <span id="s2015">And all I could think of is slide under bed [indecipherable] bed with the bedcover to the floor, and then it was over and they started asking each other whether they had seen me or whether the SS woman had taken me, and then I climbed out from under the bed.</span> <span id="s2016">I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2017">Q: You just went under because you wanted the feel of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">A: Ah no, I just slid --</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">Q: Oh, slid on top?</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">A: -- I slid on the floor, I slid on the floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s2021">Q: I see, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">A: Under the -- and the bedcover came all the way down to the floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">Q: Oh, oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2025">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">Q: Did you know -- di -- did people talk about who were the women in the brothels?</span></p> <p><span id="s2027">A: No, I don’t remember ever -- but when I got to Niederorschel which will sooner -- come sooner or later, one of the questions I was asked, is it true that women were selected on their looks to go to work in brothels?</span> <span id="s2028">And I said no, I don’t know if anything that -- that -- I’ve seen many women’s selections, I’ve never seen women being selected on the basis of looks.</span> <span id="s2029">I lied, but I --</span></p> <p><span id="s2030">Q: You lied?</span></p> <p><span id="s2031">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2032">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">A: Because I’d seen that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2034">Q: That they were selected and you knew they were going to be prostitutes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2036">But to these men --</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">Q: You didn’t want them to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">Q: Steve, how did you know that they were selecting women to go to the brothels?</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">A: Because kapos were talking about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">A: And comparing the -- particularly the women kapos were comparing the -- the condition -- the relative conditions of the various brothels, that’s why, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">Q: Comparing --</span></p> <p><span id="s2044">A: Some -- some were better than others.</span> <span id="s2045">You know, don’t ask me why, but that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">A: -- that’s what they were talking about, so I knew what this meant.</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2049">So you were in Auschwitz for how long?</span> <span id="s2050">Six months?</span></p> <p><span id="s2051">A: From mid -- end of June til mid-October, July, August, September, four months.</span></p> <p><span id="s2052">Q: Four months.</span> <span id="s2053">So you leave after the uprising?</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2055">Q: Now what are the conditions?</span> <span id="s2056">How -- how come you get out of Auschwitz and go to Niederorschel?</span></p> <p><span id="s2057">A: Well, the conditions were getting harsher and harsher, and the kapos decided to smuggle me out.</span> <span id="s2058">And they were looking for a safe transport because the word was that sometimes people were turned around at the railroad siding and taken to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s2059">So this one transport appeared safe, they pushed me in the line.</span> <span id="s2060">I -- I got tattooed -- no, everything gets counted.</span> <span id="s2061">One of the kapos, I don’t know if it was Tadek, I don’t remember any more, went up, who -- who will trade places with this boy, we’ll give you food and we’ll make sure that you get out on another transport.</span> <span id="s2062">And this man volunteered and I was pushed in.</span> <span id="s2063">Piotr slipped me a gold watch in my hand, he -- for the doctor.</span> <span id="s2064">So we were stripped, examined.</span> <span id="s2065">Had a Jewish inmate doctor examining.</span> <span id="s2066">I passed him the watch, he said, “Thank you, I would have passed you anyhow.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2069">Next station is tattooing and this inmate working, these huge, crude numbers and he looks up at me and he gives the tiniest number that I’ve ever seen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">Q: Do you still have it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">A: Yup.</span> <span id="s2072">But you know, that is -- it’s almost illegible now because it’s so small.</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2074">And your number is?</span></p> <p><span id="s2075">A: B13174.</span> <span id="s2076">Shower, cold shower in October.</span> <span id="s2077">At the next station Piotr appears and shoves a bundle of clothes in my hand, including the -- the ski boots, which I left with him and he -- and so I was quite well dressed.</span> <span id="s2078">I have -- I’m sure it was a woman -- woman’s tight fitting ski jacket, because it buttoned like a woman’s jacket, and my boots and an overcoat, which just had a stripe painted in the back, not the cut in.</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">Q: Not the what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2080">A: Not the piece of striped clothe cut in, which is what all the other clothes were.</span></p> <p><span id="s2081">Q: Right, this is one stripe?</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">A: Just a piece of, maybe two inches wide and few inches long.</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">Q: And what was the color?</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">A: Blue and -- and gray stripes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">Q: I thought you said there was a paint stripe.</span></p> <p><span id="s2086">A: This one was just a red paint stripe.</span></p> <p><span id="s2087">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2088">A: The patch on my pants and on my jacket were not cut in, were just sewed on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">Q: I think -- can you hold that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">Q: I think we have to stop the tape before we -- End of Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s2092">Beginning Tape Six</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">Q: Steven, we were talking about your leaving.</span> <span id="s2094">Do you have a sense of who this group of people were?</span> <span id="s2095">Were these Hungarians that were going to Niederorschel, or this --</span></p> <p><span id="s2096">A: I can show you the -- the bill of lading that I got in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s2097">I’m listed as a Slovakian Jew, because this was a group from -- from Slovakia, and I was pushed in between them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">Q: And you were pushed in between those.</span></p> <p><span id="s2099">A: Yup.</span> <span id="s2100">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">Q: When -- why was there a Jewish doctor standing there?</span> <span id="s2102">It’s a little hard t --</span></p> <p><span id="s2103">A: Well, th-the -- the -- the processing line involves a absolutely cursory medical examination, and that was a inmate doctor who was doing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2104">Q: Were these people -- had they come from outside of Auschwitz, and they were passing through after a --</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">Q: -- day or two?</span> <span id="s2107">Do you have any idea who --</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">A: No, no, no, these were --</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">Q: These were Slovakian Jews who were in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">A: Oh, oh, oh, the ones who were going out?</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">A: Yes, they -- they had just been there days.</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">Q: Now, were they all tattooed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">Q: On the way out?</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">A: On the way out.</span> <span id="s2117">But the doctor, you asked, I’m sure he was a -- a standard inmate wa -- of some standing, I -- I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2118">Q: And Tadek gave you the gold watch?</span></p> <p><span id="s2119">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2120">Q: And did he assume that there wou -- there could be a problem --</span></p> <p><span id="s2121">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">Q: -- that the doctor would not pass you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2124">Q: -- and you would be sent to the gas?</span></p> <p><span id="s2125">A: I -- I wou -- I wou -- what happens if they s -- I -- I mean it was unclear what would have happened if the doctor found reason for me not to be put on the outgoing transport, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2126">Q: And do you have any idea why they allowed you to be showered, because you were leaving?</span> <span id="s2127">I mean, what was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">A: Well amid this -- this incredible barbarity and filth, there was also the German fascination with cleanliness.</span> <span id="s2129">And all these slogans in the barracks, where you had to use pebbles to wipe yourself, there were big slogans on the wall about healthy body keeps you alive and God knows what else.</span> <span id="s2130">So ever -- every process involved a shower in cold water and -- and disinfection of some -- walking through some disinfectant like [indecipherable] and I mean, that’s was just part of the routine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2131">Q: Was there soap?</span></p> <p><span id="s2132">A: Aaarrrgh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">Q: No soap, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">A: No soap.</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">Q: No towel, I’m sure --</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">A: No towel --</span></p> <p><span id="s2137">Q: -- to wipe yourself.</span> <span id="s2138">So -- this is cold weather, cause it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">A: It’s cold weather.</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">Q: -- Poland in October.</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2142">Q: Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2144">And there were -- I was naked and shivering, running from one barrack to the next with my bundle of clothes, and a guard stops me and he said, “Where are you going?</span> <span id="s2145">How old are you?</span> <span id="s2146">What is your birth date?”</span> <span id="s2147">And I said, “April 16, 1929,” because the -- the kapos drilled me to use my sister’s birthday so I -- that I would appear older.</span> <span id="s2148">And he say -- said okay, and he passed me.</span> <span id="s2149">So -- so we got dressed, marched to the trains, and I remember very long wait on the siding.</span> <span id="s2150">Eventually the train started.</span> <span id="s2151">Three days on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">Q: Three?</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">A: Three days.</span> <span id="s2154">Wa -- once a day we were let out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2155">Q: And this is a cattle car similar to what you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2156">A: Right, right, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2157">Q: -- had in coming to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s2158">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2159">I remember looking in the window.</span> <span id="s2160">I remember seeing kids my age romping in the snow and building snowmen and thinking about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">Q: But now you’re tall enough so you can see out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2162">A: I guess so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">Q: You guess so, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2164">A: I guess so.</span> <span id="s2165">And so eventually we arrive, railroad siding.</span> <span id="s2166">We get out, station sign says Niederorschel, and barking orders from an SS.</span> <span id="s2167">A few words from German foreman, translation by Hungarian interpreter.</span> <span id="s2168">And then to my horror, the German foreman comes up to me and says, “Why are you here, I did not select you.”</span> <span id="s2169">I was the one who escorted him in Auschwitz through the sel -- through the selection.</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">Q: So he knew who you were.</span></p> <p><span id="s2171">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2172">So this was one thing that the kapos didn’t train me for, and so I thought very fast and I said, “Well sir, with this many new m -- inmates, they decided that you need another interpreter and I was sent as an interpreter.”</span> <span id="s2173">And he shrugged his shoulders and said okay.</span> <span id="s2174">And we were left -- let into this --</span></p> <p><span id="s2175">Q: Now is th -- is this a German pri -- this is not a German prison.</span> <span id="s2176">This is --</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">A: No, German civilian --</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">Q: -- civilian.</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">A: -- foreman.</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">Q: I see, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">A: So Niederorschel was these two [indecipherable] but now I know is a textile factory right next to a railroad siding and a plywood factory further up, were enclosed as a camp, with a narrow walkway between them with barb wire fence.</span> <span id="s2182">And we were marched into this dining room and sat at tables and there was warm meal, which was quite a shock.</span> <span id="s2183">And we were all eating and the Hungarian interpreter and another guy who I was very close to later, came in, sat down, really crowding me on both sides.</span> <span id="s2184">Who are you, where are you from, how come your clothes are different, how come the foreman knew you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">Q: You must have been scared out of your mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s2186">A: Oh yeah, yes.</span> <span id="s2187">I was very s -- I was very scared.</span> <span id="s2188">So I tried to explain myself.</span> <span id="s2189">That evening I was taken into this little side room of where the two kapos lived, both German -- German political prisoners, both of them communists and in prison since 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s2190">Q: Oh my God, wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">A: Oh -- it -- in -- next month, in April, the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Niederorschel, there’s a ceremony, including the Israeli ambassador to Germany.</span> <span id="s2192">The kapo is -- kapo’s family is receiving a posthumous award as a Righteous Gentile, because only -- only 19 people died there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2193">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2194">A: Yup.</span> <span id="s2195">And that was due entirely -- entirely to him.</span> <span id="s2196">So the quest --</span></p> <p><span id="s2197">Q: What -- what was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2198">A: Otto -- I’ll think of it in a minute.</span> <span id="s2199">I have the invitation from the ambassador on -- on my desk.</span> <span id="s2200">Otto -- no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2201">Q: It’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2202">A: So, the questioning.</span> <span id="s2203">The two kapos in German, a Gypsy who -- who was the camp orderly, I-I forget what language we -- we usually sp -- spoke.</span> <span id="s2204">Polish, a couple of the -- the labor orderly who was Czech, all crowding around me and questioning me.</span> <span id="s2205">And, so at -- at the end of that night, I convinced them.</span> <span id="s2206">And I was only 13 years old, but I was accepted as -- as a full member of their resistance organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">Q: What -- what were they trying to fi -- what -- why were they so suspicious of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">A: Once a plant, a plant, a -- a -- a --</span></p> <p><span id="s2209">Q: A German plant?</span></p> <p><span id="s2210">A: A German plant, a -- a [indecipherable] I mean, I did stick out like a sore thumb.</span></p> <p><span id="s2211">Q: Because your uniform was so different.</span></p> <p><span id="s2212">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2213">Yeah, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">Q: But Tadek got this uniform in Auschwitz for you, I mean he just gave it to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2215">A: I mean, a collection of clothes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2216">Q: So there’s a collection of clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2217">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2218">Q: So it can’t have been so unique.</span></p> <p><span id="s2219">A: No, but it was bet -- better fitting, warmer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2220">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s2221">So you were better prepared [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2222">A: I was better -- yup, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2223">Q: It’s also funny that they would suspect a 13 year old as being a plant.</span></p> <p><span id="s2224">A: I don’t know, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2225">Q: I don’t know, it seems like an odd plant to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2226">A: I don’t know, I mean, yeah right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2227">Q: So how did -- I mean wi -- wa -- how did you convince them?</span> <span id="s2228">Just by being honest with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2229">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2230">I told the Gypsy -- orderly wanted to know about the Gypsies, I said -- that was one of the very difficult things I remember.</span> <span id="s2231">I told him a -- what I had witnessed.</span> <span id="s2232">This young Slovak Jew wanted to know about the women.</span> <span id="s2233">I lied to him, but I -- I thought I had to, and I answered all of their questions and I convinced them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2234">Q: Okay, so now you’re one of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2236">Q: What does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s2237">A: Well, all right, let me tell you a little bit about Niederorschel.</span> <span id="s2238">There is the story -- okay, Niederorschel was a factory producing wings for Messershit -- schmitt fighter planes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2239">Q: And Niederorschel is really a sub-camp of Buchenwald, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2240">A: It’s sub -- yeah, in Buchenwald, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2241">Q: So it’s in that area.</span></p> <p><span id="s2242">A: Yup.</span> <span id="s2243">About 700 inmates, about 50 or 60 German civilian workers.</span> <span id="s2244">12 hour work shifts, six and a half days a week.</span> <span id="s2245">Every 30 minutes the bell rings and the wing moves up on the assembly line from one station to the next station.</span> <span id="s2246">That was the life.</span> <span id="s2247">Food somewhat better than Auschwitz -- it’s better than Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2248">Fortunately there was this absolutely first rate Czech cook.</span> <span id="s2249">He was fat, he was really fat, who, I don’t know how he did it.</span> <span id="s2250">Kitchen scraps from the guard’s food, I’m sure table scraps from the guard’s food.</span> <span id="s2251">Vegetables that the si -- the town crew managed to steal or whatever.</span> <span id="s2252">He provided some taste and some variety to the -- to the daily soup.</span> <span id="s2253">So it was -- life was on the edge of being bearable, not quite.</span> <span id="s2254">I still, after all of these years I think back with amazement at what people in this circumstance still managed to do.</span> <span id="s2255">Obviously there were shoemakers who could prepare your shoes with sole from discarded tires that the grounds crew found and shoe nails that were cut from scrap lumber.</span> <span id="s2256">Obviously there were tailors who -- who with needle and thread gotten on the black market from the -- from the civilians could fix your clothes.</span> <span id="s2257">Those kinds of things you expect.</span> <span id="s2258">You don’t expect to see these two brothers, Hungarian Jews deported from Holland, diamond grinders by trade, who ground prescription glasses out of bottoms of discarded milk bottles.</span> <span id="s2259">Jewelers who took scraps of aluminum from the plant and created these carved boxes that could be traded.</span> <span id="s2260">Beautifully carved, elaborately carved boxes.</span> <span id="s2261">Some others made these very elaborate boxes out of pleated s-straw that could be bartered with the -- with the German civilians for ne -- needle, thread, soap, tobacco, few things.</span> <span id="s2262">There were about five or six -- maybe five to eight kids my age, mostly, as I said, Budapest with their fathers.</span> <span id="s2263">One -- one kid I remember from Transylvania with his father.</span> <span id="s2264">These gentlemen decided that our education could not be interrupted, so after 12 hours workday, they sat us down, classes in algebra and French.</span> <span id="s2265">Oh, everything, of course, was punishable by death, particularly smuggling o-out of the plant.</span> <span id="s2266">Everybody who had a opportunity smuggled out scrap aluminum, scrap tools, sharpening them into weapons at night.</span> <span id="s2267">The lights went out about half an hour after meals were served.</span> <span id="s2268">You could hear for hours stone bowl -- pebbles being scraped against metal to create wa -- knives.</span> <span id="s2269">I was very proud of a knife I made for myself out of a -- a -- a hacksaw blade.</span> <span id="s2270">There were -- of the 700, probably a hundred were Soviet POWs.</span> <span id="s2271">The Germans did not honor the Geneva convention, and the Soviet POWs were in the same boat as we were.</span> <span id="s2272">And some of them were the strongest, in terms of trying to make weapons.</span> <span id="s2273">Training for a uprising.</span> <span id="s2274">Throwing knives.</span> <span id="s2275">Many of them had fashioned these heavy knives with very heavy handles and practiced.</span></p> <p><span id="s2276">Q: So there was real intention to have an uprising?</span></p> <p><span id="s2277">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2278">You asked about my role.</span> <span id="s2279">First few weeks I was on -- on the detail with the -- under the Gypsy orderly that went to town to -- for collect -- for getting goods that -- bread and vegetables and that was brought in from the local market.</span> <span id="s2280">I was well enough dressed, if the other inmates detracted the guards attention, I could sn-sneak in the apothecary and with Reichsmarks from the black market, get aspirin and medication that the medic wanted; to get ethyl alcohol for Molotov bombs.</span></p> <p><span id="s2281">Q: Ethyl alcohol for --</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">A: For Molotov cocktails.</span></p> <p><span id="s2283">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2284">A: Then the SS lieutenant decided I was not strong enough to carry these loaves of bread, and so they put me from that detail to the factory, and next to the Hungarian interpreter, the next to the last line on the assembly line, the inspection line.</span> <span id="s2285">I was given a dentist mirror, and it was my job to look at every single rivet to see that it was properly driven.</span> <span id="s2286">Badly -- o-occasionally -- I mean, sabotage was going all the time.</span> <span id="s2287">Occasionally I would see a rivet that -- that wasn’t right.</span> <span id="s2288">I could pass it, occasionally I could stop.</span> <span id="s2289">Our station was the only one that could stop the assembly line to drill out a rivet and insert the explosive driven rivet, that you apply heat on the top and the bottom explodes and that tightens the -- the connection.</span> <span id="s2290">Whatever sabotage we could do, we -- we did.</span> <span id="s2291">It didn’t really matter because it turns out -- well, eventually, by January, the railroad line was bombed.</span> <span id="s2292">We were getting fewer and fewer parts, and the wing -- the partial wings that we produced were piled in the snow outside, was no place to put them.</span> <span id="s2293">The story I heard -- it’s th -- it’s known that no single wing produced here ever flew.</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2295">A: Yeah, the Germans made this a known -- the camp was only started in the spring of ’44.</span> <span id="s2296">The Germans made this enormous effort to disperse war production because of the bombings.</span> <span id="s2297">And none o -- not all of it worked.</span> <span id="s2298">In fact, I’ve heard a rumor that this was a ruse by a small group of people to -- to found this factory and escape from being drafted to the eastern front.</span> <span id="s2299">How true it is, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2300">So -- so life was little bit more bearable, much more to do.</span> <span id="s2301">Looking forward to that half day on Sunday afternoon where we had a little rest.</span> <span id="s2302">Then as spring -- as weather became -- came to war -- warm up in -- in March, we would -- especially the Russians would set along the fence, which was the promenade to the townspeople, and -- and sing Soviet songs loudly, which upset the promenade -- naders.</span> <span id="s2303">That was the life.</span> <span id="s2304">As I said, only 19 people died.</span> <span id="s2305">Two were Soviet POWs that escaped, were brought back -- were captured by German civilians, brought back and they were ha -- hanged.</span> <span id="s2306">I have the list of the others, got it last November.</span> <span id="s2307">But mortality was -- was quite low -- were -- I mean, remarkably low.</span></p> <p><span id="s2308">Q: These classes that you talked about that they said they were --</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">A: Yup.</span></p> <p><span id="s2310">Q: When did -- when did they give you these classes, after work?</span></p> <p><span id="s2311">A: After work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2312">Q: After you eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s2313">A: After you eat, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2314">Q: So how long would they last?</span> <span id="s2315">I mean, you must have --</span></p> <p><span id="s2316">A: Half an hour.</span></p> <p><span id="s2317">Q: Half an hour.</span></p> <p><span id="s2318">A: I mean, we were all asleep, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s2319">Q: I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2320">A: -- we were all asleep by halfway through, but I guess [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2321">Q: And you did the classes in the barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s2322">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2323">Q: And obviously these are all verbal things you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2324">A: Right, oh yes, sure, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2325">Q: Did you learn anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s2326">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2327">I -- I -- I was -- again, there was a fairly -- especially if you have red -- yellow star, there was a fairly sharp dividing line between the religious Jews and the secular Jews.</span> <span id="s2328">I was a -- in the -- the room -- there was some self selection, who went to what room.</span> <span id="s2329">I was certainly in one of the rooms that was very secular, but they -- the -- the religious ferwer was -- was equally impressive.</span> <span id="s2330">I mean, to know the entire daily and Sabbath prayer book by heart, I mean that’s for -- taken for granted.</span> <span id="s2331">To know the parsha, the -- the week’s Torah portion and Aftorah portion by heart, well, there was always room for debate, th-the great Talmudic debates on -- on what was the correct memory.</span> <span id="s2332">All of the festivals are observed, every -- I mean, yeah they -- they -- the Orthodox inmates were totally immersed in -- in their religion.</span> <span id="s2333">So we knew there -- most of the workers just sort of came and went as if we were invisible.</span> <span id="s2334">You know, very little contact.</span> <span id="s2335">One of them ev -- every day, would eat his lunch and read his paper and then make sure that he got my eye and he made -- and signal on where he was hiding the paper, so that later, just before we were herded back to the -- the barracks, I could retrieve the paper and bring it in the barracks.</span> <span id="s2336">So whatever the German newspaper said, we knew that.</span> <span id="s2337">So, April first, we had just finished -- I -- I finished work is no longer ap-appropriate.</span> <span id="s2338">We just finished our 12 hours and went back in the barracks, the whistle sounded and they were moving -- moving us out.</span> <span id="s2339">There was a big debate in the kapos rooms.</span> <span id="s2340">Lot of people would -- lot of people wanted to stage an uprising.</span> <span id="s2341">We had counterfeit keys to all of the guards’ rooms.</span> <span id="s2342">That’s not eas -- not hard to do.</span> <span id="s2343">The inmates were -- were taking the -- the food across several locked doors.</span> <span id="s2344">With the key you just chew some -- some bread dough in your mouth, make an impression in the key and there were locksmith who could duplicate that.</span> <span id="s2345">The SS, the officers were living upstairs, we didn’t think we could get to them.</span> <span id="s2346">So there was a big debate and the kapo decided that -- that we didn’t know where the American front was.</span> <span id="s2347">It seemed to have slowed down after the -- after the Battle of the Bulge, that we would march out.</span> <span id="s2348">The kapo gave orders to the leaders of the brigades that everybody was free to escape if they could.</span> <span id="s2349">The cook had some emergency rations.</span> <span id="s2350">Chicory grounds, molasses, something that you could carry, and we were marched out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2351">Q: Were you disappointed that there was no uprising?</span></p> <p><span id="s2352">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2353">Q: You were?</span></p> <p><span id="s2354">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2355">Q: You wanted to do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2356">A: Oh, I was -- well, yes, but when it came to the vote in the room, the Czech work orderly and I voting no swung the -- sw-swung the balance.</span> <span id="s2357">I could have voted for --</span></p> <p><span id="s2358">Q: And so why didn’t you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2359">A: I didn’t think we had the -- the troops to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2360">Q: Ah, so you’re distinguishing between wanting to do it --</span></p> <p><span id="s2361">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2362">Q: -- but realizing that you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s2363">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2364">I didn’t think we could do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2365">Q: How many people do you think could have been involved?</span> <span id="s2366">How wa -- wa -- or were creating these weapons, of some kind?</span></p> <p><span id="s2367">A: 150 out of 700, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2368">Q: And do you know about how many guards you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s2369">A: 40 - 50.</span></p> <p><span id="s2370">Q: That’s a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2371">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2372">They were -- the officers were SS.</span> <span id="s2373">The guards were Wehrmacht, regular army reservists in their 40’s and 50’s and 60’s.</span> <span id="s2374">I mean, tottering old men, but still, they had automatic rifles.</span></p> <p><span id="s2375">Q: So that was the problem, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2376">A: Yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s2377">So that’s when -- that’s -- that’s how we got --</span></p> <p><span id="s2378">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2379">A: -- going on the march.</span></p> <p><span id="s2380">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2381">Well let’s -- we have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2382">End of Tape Six</span></p> <p><span id="s2383">Beginning Tape Seven</span></p> <p><span id="s2384">Q: Okay, Steven, did you bring your knife that you had fashioned, with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2385">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2386">Q: You didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s2387">A: I -- I -- I traded it with -- with the -- the Gypsy orderly during the march, and he gave me another knife, and I -- I lo -- I -- I -- no, I haven’t -- I haven’t got any -- anything from -- I don’t have any artifact from --</span></p> <p><span id="s2388">Q: No, but when you left --</span></p> <p><span id="s2389">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2390">Q: You did take it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2391">A: Oh yeah, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2392">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2393">A: Stuck in my --</span></p> <p><span id="s2394">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2395">A: -- stuck in my boot, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2396">Q: And did all the guys that you know, who had -- who had made weapons, did they prob --</span></p> <p><span id="s2397">A: Oh, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2398">Q: -- they -- th -- everybody took them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2399">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2400">Q: And the intent was in case something happens they’ll use it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2401">A: Yeah, we almost ca -- we almost came to that on the -- on the ninth day.</span> <span id="s2402">I’ll tell you -- I --</span></p> <p><span id="s2403">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2404">A: Do you wa -- do you want sa --</span></p> <p><span id="s2405">Q: So -- well --</span></p> <p><span id="s2406">A: -- okay, so it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2407">Q: -- all right, so you all leave --</span></p> <p><span id="s2408">A: -- 10 day -- 10 days --</span></p> <p><span id="s2409">Q: 10 days of marching?</span></p> <p><span id="s2410">A: -- of march -- let’s see, la -- in October we covered the same route by car, probably two hours at 50 kilomet -- say it’s about 120 - 150 kilometers, less than a hundred miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s2411">Q: And you’re marching towards --</span></p> <p><span id="s2412">A: Towards Buchenwald, yes, towards Weimar --</span></p> <p><span id="s2413">Q: -- towards Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s2414">A: -- right, right.</span> <span id="s2415">Escapes almost every night, shootings I’m -- I’m -- most every night.</span> <span id="s2416">People falling behind shot and left to die in the -- left dead in the -- in the gutter.</span> <span id="s2417">Farmers watching us, standing in their fields, clutching their pitchforks.</span> <span id="s2418">Walking through these -- marching through these villages.</span> <span id="s2419">People peering out behind lace curs -- curtains.</span> <span id="s2420">We went through Sonderheim, which was an only large city on the way, broken up cobblestone streets, and that city had been bombed.</span> <span id="s2421">So it was very long march, very arduous.</span> <span id="s2422">The follo -- we were being marched with the guards on the side, following the train -- following the marchers was a very old army truck, with a platform in the back, on which the relief guards slept, and it also carried couple rows of a barb wire fence which they used to enclose every night.</span> <span id="s2423">And pulled this, which was obviously World War І vintage field kitchen, which sometimes worked and most of the time didn’t work, so sometimes we had ersatz coffee or some -- something resembling soup.</span> <span id="s2424">Most of the time we didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2425">Q: So then, but there was an attempt?</span></p> <p><span id="s2426">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2427">Q: They didn’t just --</span></p> <p><span id="s2428">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2429">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2430">A: So after eight days we arrived at another satellite ca-camp called Berlsteed, which some of the old time prisoners recognized.</span> <span id="s2431">That had been a brick factory which produced the -- the bricks for Buchenwald and for the other camps.</span> <span id="s2432">So we had a little bit more freedom cause we’re inside the fence, inside the barb wire fence, and not the enclosure of rolls.</span> <span id="s2433">And we had some food.</span> <span id="s2434">We also found some -- some frozen potatoes on the ground and everybody started making fires and -- and grilling these potatoes and usually get -- taking them out barehanded before they were cooked.</span> <span id="s2435">And suddenly we were called to a -- a second appel.</span> <span id="s2436">A contingent of SS guards came in a truck from -- from Buchenwald, replaced our Wehrmacht guards, and these officers took count.</span> <span id="s2437">In the officer’s staff car was an inmate, and even it was dusk I could recognize first the red triangle on his chest, and the red beret on his head.</span> <span id="s2438">So as dusk was falling and the officers were chatting, I inched up to him.</span> <span id="s2439">The guar -- the -- the -- the kapo was sitting on the running board of the SS staff car and I inched up to him and sort of crouched without looking at him, as -- as if there was no contact.</span> <span id="s2440">And he said, “Do you speak Polish?”</span> <span id="s2441">Yes.</span> <span id="s2442">“You have a resistance group?”</span> <span id="s2443">Yes.</span> <span id="s2444">“Send me one of them.”</span> <span id="s2445">All I could say is, “I’m one of them, you can talk.”</span> <span id="s2446">And he said, “Whatever you do, stall.</span> <span id="s2447">Buchenwald is being emptied, trainloads of Jewish prisoners are -- are being taken -- taken in open cars.</span> <span id="s2448">We don’t know what’s happening, we don’t have control.”</span> <span id="s2449">The re-resistance organization in Buchenwald was always very strong.</span> <span id="s2450">“We don’t have control, stall.”</span> <span id="s2451">So I shuffled back to the -- actually I ran back because a SS sergeant was kicking at me, ran back and when we were bedded down, I reported that to the kapo and the -- the others.</span> <span id="s2452">How do we stall?</span> <span id="s2453">And this Czech government bureaucrat who was a high level -- I think he was deputy secretary of something in Czech Republic, he realized what we had to do, that the SS took e -- that up to that point the local SS were in charge, they could do whatever they wanted.</span> <span id="s2454">Now a count had been taken up to Buchenwald, our SS had to deliver that many bodies, dead or alive when they arrive in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s2455">There’s no -- no question.</span> <span id="s2456">So if some people would hide, the count would come short.</span> <span id="s2457">Well the -- the Gypsy orderly had been in -- in bel -- Berlsteed, he knew where the brick ovens were, and it was decided that three of -- he and two others would hide in the brick ovens at night.</span> <span id="s2458">We woke up, our kapo -- our -- SS took a head count, it was three short.</span> <span id="s2459">So they were thr -- dispatching people all -- all -- guards all over to search, we just stood at attention for a good part of the day.</span> <span id="s2460">They he -- the SS lieutenant singled out the organization, he knew everybody.</span> <span id="s2461">Others were allowed to -- to sit, to lie down, we were standing.</span> <span id="s2462">He threatened to start killing us.</span> <span id="s2463">Nothing happened.</span> <span id="s2464">He s -- that’s when he sent all but four to six guards for another search.</span> <span id="s2465">And that was when I thought that they -- he -- that Vladya, Russian off-officer would yell one word and the breakout would start.</span> <span id="s2466">I knew that.</span> <span id="s2467">Facing the guards were all the -- the sharpshooters with their heavy knives.</span> <span id="s2468">And I expected that those people would -- would kill the guards and get their guns and s -- and face the other guards coming back.</span> <span id="s2469">And then, for the first time that I recall, we heard the sound of -- of gunfire from the west.</span> <span id="s2470">I -- I don’t recall having it er -- having heard it earlier.</span> <span id="s2471">I don’t know how -- how far the front was, I -- I never checked.</span> <span id="s2472">I could check by date on where the front was.</span> <span id="s2473">But anyhow, the SS chickened out, and decided to march us out.</span> <span id="s2474">Long, torturous, very difficult walk up the steep slope.</span> <span id="s2475">Buchenwald means beech forest, and the camp is at the tip of this somewhat sizable hill.</span> <span id="s2476">The SS made the resistance group march in front and SS officer behind us and then rest of them.</span> <span id="s2477">The inmates -- and it was definitely silence, and everybody was shuffling, and I decided I had something to -- I had to do something, and I stopped as if to tie my shoe, and turned around and yelled pasnia in Russian, a song.</span> <span id="s2478">And the Russians heard me and pretty soon the entire column was singing.</span> <span id="s2479">And that was a tremendous relief.</span> <span id="s2480">Me -- I mean, we all we -- on Sundays, the Sunday afternoons we were singing Russian songs, Polish partisan songs, Yiddish songs.</span> <span id="s2481">Never Hungarian songs.</span> <span id="s2482">Nobo -- nobody Hungarian wanted anything Hungarian.</span> <span id="s2483">We were singing elements of -- of the choral movement of the Ninth Symphony, because that was a -- one of the musicians from the Budapest orchestra taught it to us.</span> <span id="s2484">So that singing started and that somehow got people the -- the strength to march the last couple of kilometers up -- uphill, and we arrived at the gate in Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s2485">Q: You remember the song that you sang -- that you started to sing, this Russian song?</span></p> <p><span id="s2486">A: [speaks Russian here] A Russian folk song, the -- the Volga -- the Volga boatman song, some partisan songs.</span></p> <p><span id="s2487">Q: So that gave everybody a --</span></p> <p><span id="s2488">A: That -- that was a -- a big lift.</span> <span id="s2489">So we arrive at the gate of Buchenwald, which was described to me by the people who had been there, and we marched in.</span> <span id="s2490">First thing I noticed that the crematorium, the chimney was -- was cold, there was no smoke coming out of the chimney, which I thought was a good sign.</span> <span id="s2491">We were marched through the sanitation delousing area right at the top, and that was a good sign.</span> <span id="s2492">And we were faced by a group of -- of political prisoners in the red beret coming to meet us.</span> <span id="s2493">On that day there were no more transports out, there were no more SS inside the camp, and the resistance organization controlled the camp.</span> <span id="s2494">So -- so we were marched in one of the barracks and told to go to sleep, and I fell asleep.</span> <span id="s2495">And I don’t have a very heroic closing because next thing I remember is in following day at mid-afternoon, somebody shook my shoulder to say that the Americans were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2496">Q: Did it feel like the end of this hell?</span></p> <p><span id="s2497">A: Yeah, in many ways it did.</span> <span id="s2498">We all raced up to the -- to the barb wire fence, we yelled, and I tried to catch somebody’s attention and report on the -- on the crimes of the SS lieutenant that I knew of, and then I collapsed against the fence.</span> <span id="s2499">Spent six weeks in a field hospital run by the American army.</span></p> <p><span id="s2500">Q: And the field hospital was on the site?</span> <span id="s2501">On the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2502">A: Ah -- buchenw -- you’ve not been to Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s2503">Q: Yeah, on top.</span></p> <p><span id="s2504">A: On top.</span> <span id="s2505">The camp is that side, on the other side is the crescent of these large buildings which were SS barracks, which now house the museum, library, etcetera.</span> <span id="s2506">In 24 hours, Americans converted that to one field hospital, recruiting nurses and doctors from [indecipherable] I don’t know how many thousand of people were there.</span> <span id="s2507">So I was there for --</span></p> <p><span id="s2508">Q: Six weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2509">A: -- six weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2510">Q: Were you awake a lot of this time, or were you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2511">A: I was awake [indecipherable] uh-huh, yup.</span></p> <p><span id="s2512">Q: And what was wrong with you at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s2513">A: Dehydration, broken arm --</span></p> <p><span id="s2514">Q: Broken arm?</span></p> <p><span id="s2515">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2516">Q: Where’d that come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s2517">A: Oh, that came from one of the guards.</span> <span id="s2518">I spoke back to him and he swung his rifle at me and I -- I -- the only time I lost my -- my cool, spoke back to the armed guard.</span></p> <p><span id="s2519">Q: When did this happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2520">A: On the march.</span></p> <p><span id="s2521">Q: Oh, on the march.</span> <span id="s2522">So you’re marching with a broken arm?</span></p> <p><span id="s2523">A: Yeah, with a -- with a -- yeah.</span> <span id="s2524">The medic -- the Russian officer cut some -- cut some tree limbs and made a s -- they made a splint, medic made a splint and I was walking with a ar -- marching with a broken arm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2525">Q: He could have shot you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2526">A: Oh yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2527">Q: Do you have any idea why he didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s2528">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2529">Q: No, you don’t know.</span> <span id="s2530">He just broke your arm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2531">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2532">Q: He smashed you with it -- with a baton?</span></p> <p><span id="s2533">A: With -- swung his rifle and -- and I just put my arm up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2534">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s2535">Well, I’m glad you told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2536">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2537">So I don’t know how far beyond you want to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s2538">Q: I want to go a ways down.</span> <span id="s2539">So you’re in the hospital for six weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2540">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2541">Q: And you know that your mother is not alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s2542">A: I didn’t know that -- I mean, yes, I knew that from my sister.</span> <span id="s2543">I knew what -- I didn’t know about my sister, I didn’t know about my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s2544">Q: Your father, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2545">A: While I was there in the hospital, a rabbi from the Backa area came by.</span> <span id="s2546">He -- he was taking names of liberated inmates from the Backa area, and came to interview me.</span> <span id="s2547">I said ah sa -- Subotica.</span> <span id="s2548">Date of birth -- 16 -- April 1929 and s -- s -- wait a minute.</span> <span id="s2549">He goes through notebooks and says, you have a twin.</span> <span id="s2550">So he had met -- seen my sister in Bergen-Belsen, and so that’s how I knew that she was there.</span> <span id="s2551">She was alive.</span> <span id="s2552">So yeah, the Iron Curtain was down in ’45.</span> <span id="s2553">Not -- didn’t wait for Truman -- for Churchill’s speech.</span> <span id="s2554">The French, Norwegians, Danes, Dutch, Belgians were out of there in 48 hours.</span> <span id="s2555">The people who wanted to go to the Soviet side were there for weeks and weeks and weeks.</span> <span id="s2556">I was informed when I registered with the American -- that there was a provision for DP orphans to be sent directly to the States.</span> <span id="s2557">And they notified my uncle who was a doctor in -- in New York, that they found me.</span> <span id="s2558">And my ga -- my uncle would take me -- and I said no, I can’t do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2559">Q: This is the brother of your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s2560">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2561">Q: Right?</span> <span id="s2562">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2563">A: I said, “I have to go back.</span> <span id="s2564">If anybody is alive, they will do -- will do the same thing, I have to go back.”</span> <span id="s2565">So it wasn’t til July or August that we were taken by American trucks to Pilsen in Czechoslovakia and then by train, Pilsen, Prague, Budapest.</span> <span id="s2566">And I arrived in Subotica.</span></p> <p><span id="s2567">Q: And had you all said this to each other, as a family, that we’ll go back --</span></p> <p><span id="s2568">A: Never said it, never said it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2569">Q: You never said where you would go?</span></p> <p><span id="s2570">A: No.</span> <span id="s2571">We just knew that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2572">Q: So did you go back to your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s2573">A: At the railroad station, my two surviving cousins were waiting for me.</span> <span id="s2574">They were in the Yugoslav army, and they were coming out daily, whenever a returning train was coming, they did that regularly.</span> <span id="s2575">So we went to our -- my Gentile aunt’s house.</span> <span id="s2576">Going back to my house made no sense.</span> <span id="s2577">So I stayed there.</span> <span id="s2578">Couple weeks later my sister came back omai -- on a train from Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s2579">And then in late August, maybe early September, my father came back on a Russian hospital train.</span> <span id="s2580">I still have the admission diagnosis from the Russian mi -- military hospital.</span> <span id="s2581">Angina, kidney failure, 15 serious maladies, from a coal mine in Silesia.</span> <span id="s2582">But he came home.</span> <span id="s2583">He tried to start a new life.</span> <span id="s2584">He was told that if he asked for the plant they’re going to try him for collaboration with the enemy because he didn’t put up armed resistance when the plant was taken away.</span> <span id="s2585">He eked out a miserable living, and he died sixth of February, 1946.</span> <span id="s2586">Three months after he came back.</span> <span id="s2587">Totally broken, physically, emotionally.</span></p> <p><span id="s2588">Q: So he wasn’t the same man that you knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s2589">A: Uh-uh.</span> <span id="s2590">One picture that I don’t have in my album -- most of the pictures I have in my album -- my sister it was bet -- had better connections, got more pictures back, and mo -- large majority of what I have is -- is photocopies from her album.</span> <span id="s2591">There is this small passport size picture of our father, I don’t want a copy of that in my album.</span> <span id="s2592">It’s so horrible that I don’t want it.</span> <span id="s2593">But at least we could bury him in this big, elaborate tomb that was put up for his brother.</span> <span id="s2594">My wife, Norma is n -- November, this October was the first time that she wa -- she had seen somebody [indecipherable] and of course we went to the cemetery.</span> <span id="s2595">And she said, “You had sow -- shown me this picture before,” it’s a big, white marble thing with [indecipherable] and projecting letters.</span> <span id="s2596">But on a photograph it’s -- they’re almost invisible.</span> <span id="s2597">And then underneath, carved in very crudely are the names of my father and all the relatives who died in the Shoah.</span> <span id="s2598">Then my wife said, “This solves one mystery.</span> <span id="s2599">I could never bring up myself to ask you, but I could never understand how, in those circumstances you could afford to have such a fancy grave for your father.”</span> <span id="s2600">She never realized that that was a -- the tomb f -- for my uncle.</span> <span id="s2601">So after he died --</span></p> <p><span id="s2602">Q: Is your mother’s name up there, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s2603">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2604">Q: So all the family members who died --</span></p> <p><span id="s2605">A: All the family mem -- yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s2606">Q: -- whether they’re there or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s2607">A: -- a -- a -- through the entire cemetery, everywhere, there are the -- the names of the -- of the -- you know, one engraved name on the name and 20 chiseled in names of sur -- of people who didn’t survi -- of people who died.</span> <span id="s2608">So, went back to school, I’d lost a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s2609">Q: And where are you living?</span></p> <p><span id="s2610">A: We got this apartment, which was a terrib --</span></p> <p><span id="s2611">Q: You and your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s2612">A: Well, first my father --</span></p> <p><span id="s2613">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2614">A: -- and I and sister.</span> <span id="s2615">We had a terrific maid, a Volksdeutscher, a [indecipherable] woman who was let out of the camps to be our servant until they were booted out to Germany.</span> <span id="s2616">All -- all they -- all the Volksdeutscher were -- from mo -- all of these countries were booted out.</span> <span id="s2617">You know, the -- the German -- the German foreign minister’s name is the same as my nickname, Joschka.</span></p> <p><span id="s2618">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s2619">Oh that’s right, yes it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2620">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2621">I mean ob -- obviously his family came from -- fr -- came from -- was expelled in the -- at the end of the war.</span> <span id="s2622">So we had this miserable apartment, cold, with my father, and until she was deported, this -- this woman, who was quite, quite nice.</span> <span id="s2623">And then my -- my younger aunt -- my three younger so -- aunts -- my father’s three younger dau -- sisters survived, two of them in Budapest and one in -- in Subotica and she moved in with us.</span> <span id="s2624">And that was it, we -- I mean, going to school in communist Yugoslavia was no fun at all.</span> <span id="s2625">You know, obligatory membership in the communist youth party and I was there -- I -- I’m very grateful.</span> <span id="s2626">I still correspond with two of my classmates who sort of pick me up and provide a lot of support.</span> <span id="s2627">So I did two years there.</span> <span id="s2628">And my sister came back on a train with many Yugoslav army officers coming from POW camps, and she was corresponding with one of them, who wrote back -- wrote her that he had a position in the foreign ministry.</span> <span id="s2629">I went to Belgrade, we saw him and he issued us passports and exit visas.</span> <span id="s2630">I’m not quite sure it was legal for him to do so.</span> <span id="s2631">But of all of us, two of us, my two cousins, and my two cousins fiancés, of the six of us who found ourself together in Paris, we were the only two that had legal ways of getting there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2632">Q: Let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s2633">Did anybody, when you came back and you’re going to school, you’re there for a couple of years --</span></p> <p><span id="s2634">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2635">Q: -- before you leave for Paris, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2636">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2637">Q: Does anybody ask you what happened?</span> <span id="s2638">Do you talk to your sister, is there -- or do you just simply go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s2639">A: No, there was a lot of talk, there -- there was a -- a friend of my aunt’s who invited me to talk, who im -- who told me that I have to sit down and write all of this down.</span> <span id="s2640">Yeah, some people were interested.</span> <span id="s2641">The majority -- I mean, all of us -- most of us just wanted to get on and let --</span></p> <p><span id="s2642">Q: Did you -- so you didn’t want to talk?</span> <span id="s2643">This was not something --</span></p> <p><span id="s2644">A: Oh, I -- I talked to them.</span> <span id="s2645">I me -- when people asked, I talked.</span></p> <p><span id="s2646">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2647">A: But I didn’t want to dwell too much on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2648">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2649">And your sister the same?</span></p> <p><span id="s2650">A: Yeah, me -- much more so than I.</span></p> <p><span id="s2651">Q: More so than you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2652">A: Oh yeah, yeah, I mean she -- she had ter -- totally divorced herself, she -- she said she didn’t want to have anything to do with it.</span> <span id="s2653">I mean, she --</span></p> <p><span id="s2654">Q: Did you talk together so she knew what happened to you and you knew what happened to her?</span></p> <p><span id="s2655">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s2656">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s2657">Q: But that was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2658">A: That was it.</span> <span id="s2659">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2660">Q: So you went to --</span></p> <p><span id="s2661">A: -- so -- so we escaped.</span> <span id="s2662">I mean, in -- with all -- in -- with all respects, we escaped.</span> <span id="s2663">If --</span></p> <p><span id="s2664">Q: Were there any questions at the border with these papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s2665">A: Well, we were very careful.</span> <span id="s2666">On the basis of Yugoslav passport, French -- Americans were not very helpful.</span> <span id="s2667">“Oh, you missed your chance as a DP.</span> <span id="s2668">There is a Yugoslav quota, but it’s kept in the west.</span> <span id="s2669">If you manage to get the west and register, we’ll register you.”</span> <span id="s2670">Period.</span> <span id="s2671">French were very nice, “We’ll give you a three day transit visa, if [indecipherable] you get to France, the police will extend it indefinitely if you renounce your citizenship.”</span> <span id="s2672">On the basis of that we go to Italians, 24 hour transit visa.</span> <span id="s2673">You wait, th -- Trieste was being run by [indecipherable] arrangements.</span> <span id="s2674">You certainly don’t go the month when the Russians control it.</span> <span id="s2675">You don’t go the month when the British control it, because they read stuff.</span> <span id="s2676">You wait til the Americans control it, they put a stamp on it --</span></p> <p><span id="s2677">Q: Then you just go.</span></p> <p><span id="s2678">A: Then you just go.</span> <span id="s2679">The train -- in Ljubljana the train was locked.</span> <span id="s2680">The train was unlocked when we got to Milan.</span> <span id="s2681">And from there we went to Paris.</span> <span id="s2682">I usually break down when I talk about that.</span> <span id="s2683">I came back maybe a dozen time to the Milan train station, going to Florence, going conferences in northern Italy.</span> <span id="s2684">But that’s really the place where I feel my freedom began.</span></p> <p><span id="s2685">Q: In Milan?</span></p> <p><span id="s2686">A: Just a railroad station, hour of waiting for the train to Paris.</span> <span id="s2687">But that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2688">Q: That’s the place.</span></p> <p><span id="s2689">A: That’s the place.</span></p> <p><span id="s2690">Q: We have to stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2691">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2692">End of Tape Seven</span></p> <p><span id="s2693">Beginning Tape Eight</span></p> <p><span id="s2694">Q: I know it’s hard to remember feelings.</span> <span id="s2695">Did you actually feel when you were in Milan that this was the break --</span></p> <p><span id="s2696">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s2697">Very strongly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2698">Q: You did feel --</span></p> <p><span id="s2699">A: Very strongly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2700">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2701">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2702">Q: And when you go back there, you feel [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2703">A: Oh yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2704">Q: And did es --</span></p> <p><span id="s2705">A: And my sister’s comment is, “You were a good little boy until then, you haven’t been one since.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2706">Q: And you’re still a little boy to her?</span></p> <p><span id="s2707">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2708">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2709">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2710">Q: So from Milan, you go into Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s2711">A: We get to Paris, we registered with the Joint, American Joint Distribution Committee, they provided housing and -- and meal tickets at a cafeteria.</span> <span id="s2712">Went to the Yugoslav consulate, asked for a interview with the consul, we walked in, handed him the passport -- two passports, and walked out, went to the Yugoslav royal military mission.</span> <span id="s2713">They gave us a -- a certificate.</span></p> <p><span id="s2714">Q: That said what, you’re no longer citizens?</span></p> <p><span id="s2715">A: That -- that we are recognized by them, whatever that was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2716">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2717">A: Went to the French police prefecture, got our three month visitor -- a three months permit.</span> <span id="s2718">Went to the arrondissement headquarters, got our ni -- our rations, it was still rationed.</span> <span id="s2719">And the fren -- I mean, the stay was extended for two years.</span> <span id="s2720">Every three months we had to go to police for an extension.</span> <span id="s2721">Visited England the following year, and then c-coming to the States I had -- we both had [indecipherable] stateless passports issued by the French.</span></p> <p><span id="s2722">Q: And you went to school in France, did you not?</span> <span id="s2723">Both of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2724">A: Well, at first -- at first al -- Joint had thousands of us, so they contracted out to French social service agencies to take care of groups of people, and we were -- we were at a outfit called Service sociale des jeunes.</span> <span id="s2725">Youth social services.</span> <span id="s2726">And that’s where we went monthly for money, some clothing, I mean, really subsistence money, clothing, meal tickets, etcetera.</span> <span id="s2727">There was nothing else to do.</span> <span id="s2728">There’s this great institution called Alliance Française, which gives free French lessons -- free lessons in French three days a week, morning sessions, afternoon session, evening session.</span> <span id="s2729">Allowed to progress as fast as you’re ready.</span> <span id="s2730">I went through three sessions a day, had nothing else to do.</span> <span id="s2731">And so I -- the next year, I’m now a proud owner of a certificate that allows me to teach French as a second language al -- any-anywhere outside of France.</span></p> <p><span id="s2732">Q: So that was your fourth language?</span></p> <p><span id="s2733">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2734">Q: At least.</span></p> <p><span id="s2735">A: That’s my fourth language.</span> <span id="s2736">There was this great urge that we all should learn a trade.</span> <span id="s2737">I ne -- I know social workers who -- handling DP persons in this country, and always that same urge.</span> <span id="s2738">So they put us into this school, e-electrician school, majorly make-shift sort of thing.</span> <span id="s2739">The directress -- the -- Madame le Directeur of the social service agency thought I could do better.</span> <span id="s2740">She used her personal contacts, and I got accepted in a private high school.</span> <span id="s2741">Of course [indecipherable] you know, one of the government lycées never take somebody like that.</span> <span id="s2742">She got me into a private school.</span> <span id="s2743">She got her octogenarian former teacher to coach me.</span> <span id="s2744">And in ’49 I passed the first part of the French baccalauret and in ’50 I passed the second part.</span> <span id="s2745">How did I do it?</span> <span id="s2746">My French teacher said -- the -- the nice thing about the French baccalauret is that it’s administered by the universities, not by the high schools, so nobody knows you.</span> <span id="s2747">He said, “You’ve got to establish right away that French is not your native language.</span> <span id="s2748">Make a atrocious colloquial error in the first sentence.</span> <span id="s2749">And after that, do the best that you can.”</span> <span id="s2750">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2751">Q: And it was -- was that because they would be sympathetic?</span></p> <p><span id="s2752">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2753">I mean, they would understand that it’s not my native language.</span> <span id="s2754">So that’s what I did in the first year in French, second year math -- I mean, math I was okay.</span> <span id="s2755">And physics, chemistry, etcetera.</span> <span id="s2756">Se -- yeah, first year there’s a written -- written foreign language and a second oral only.</span> <span id="s2757">That year I took English because I had a little bit more sc-schooling in English than I had had in French -- in German.</span> <span id="s2758">Second year it’s only an oral exam, so I took German.</span> <span id="s2759">Exam was running late, I was the last one and I -- I was totally exhausted, I just propped myself in there, in front of the examiner, and in German I said, “Wass soll ich übersetzen?”</span> <span id="s2760">What is it that you want me to translate?</span> <span id="s2761">He said, “That’s it.”</span> <span id="s2762">He closed the books, and I passed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2763">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2764">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2765">I was beginning t -- m-my s-sister and I were both beginning to think about staying there --</span></p> <p><span id="s2766">Q: Staying?</span></p> <p><span id="s2767">A: -- staying in France, yeah.</span> <span id="s2768">She was start -- she started with the Sorbonne, I was thinking about which preparatory school I would take in the fall to -- to get into one of the architecture schools.</span> <span id="s2769">And then the American visa arrived in August of 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s2770">Q: And you had applied for a visa?</span></p> <p><span id="s2771">A: Yeah, yes, we registered with a -- but yugos -- Yugoslav quota and then there was the McCarran Act --</span></p> <p><span id="s2772">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2773">A: -- which said let’s start from scratch, throw away all the accumulated quotas that were not exercised during the war.</span> <span id="s2774">Yugoslav quota is 400 year or something like that, but it wasn’t exercised since ’41.</span> <span id="s2775">I would ha -- you know, if Truman hadn’t vetoed that I would never have been here.</span> <span id="s2776">In between we tried various places where we could go, with our two cousins and that didn’t work out, because we had affidavits from my uncle on the maternal side.</span> <span id="s2777">They eventually wound up in Venezuela and we came to the States.</span> <span id="s2778">So we went to Chicago because that’s where our uncle lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s2779">Q: Wait, let me -- hold it for a second.</span></p> <p><span id="s2780">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2781">Q: Did you like being in Paris, in France?</span></p> <p><span id="s2782">A: Oh, tremendously.</span></p> <p><span id="s2783">Q: It was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2784">A: I mean, we lived -- I mean, miserably.</span> <span id="s2785">You know, I -- when I went -- on weekend you decide whether to use your money to eat or to go to the -- the weekly visit to the se -- to the public baths to -- to take a shower.</span> <span id="s2786">You know, it’s a different level of living than -- than what you normally is -- are accustomed to.</span> <span id="s2787">But -- but it was great, I mean, yeah, I mean every other -- in most respects it was great.</span></p> <p><span id="s2788">Q: Did you feel like orphans?</span> <span id="s2789">A: I was the token refugee in this high school which was very upper class French high school.</span> <span id="s2790">I mean, several of my classmate’s fathers were still in prison for -- for their role in the Vichy government.</span> <span id="s2791">I felt very well accepted.</span></p> <p><span id="s2792">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s2793">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2794">Q: But the two of you are still children, in a way.</span> <span id="s2795">Your sister is what, 16 - 17?</span></p> <p><span id="s2796">A: Seven -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2797">Q: And you’re 15?</span></p> <p><span id="s2798">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2799">Well, it didn’t matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s2800">Q: Didn’t matter?</span></p> <p><span id="s2801">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s2802">We were quite self-sufficient.</span> <span id="s2803">My -- I no longer keep conta -- I kept contact for a couple decades with my classmates from high school.</span> <span id="s2804">You know, the -- the number of people who passed the baccalauret is exactly equal to the number of openings in the university at the following fall.</span> <span id="s2805">So they consider me as a traitor to France for having dropped out of that.</span> <span id="s2806">And I’ve often thought what it would have been.</span> <span id="s2807">I mean, there’s no question in my mind if I’d become a professor at the Ecole Superieure des Ponts et Chaussee, in relative terms that would be something higher than being a professor at Carnegie Mellon University.</span> <span id="s2808">But the -- the odds of a foreigner getting that far in France, it’s sort of near zero.</span> <span id="s2809">So I -- I -- I don’t -- never regretted it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2810">Q: So you came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s2811">A: Came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s2812">Q: And was your uncle, your mother’s brother in Chicago?</span></p> <p><span id="s2813">A: He was a -- well, he had a practice in -- in New York, he contacted Multiple Sclerosis, and decided that the best way to heal himself is to heal others, and gave up his practice, moved to a veteran’s hospital in Chicago as a -- as a physical therapist.</span></p> <p><span id="s2814">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2815">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2816">But he was not in a position to support us.</span> <span id="s2817">He died -- yeah, I think I introduced Norma to him once, he met my wife-to-be once.</span> <span id="s2818">There were some other friends of my parents, who were terrific.</span> <span id="s2819">Took us over and sort of nurtured us and I got -- I was disin -- by that time I was absolutely disenchanted with architecture but I decided I would study civil engineering.</span> <span id="s2820">I started na --</span></p> <p><span id="s2821">Q: So your original intent was architecture?</span></p> <p><span id="s2822">A: Yeah, there’s a expectation of my parents, because of --</span></p> <p><span id="s2823">Q: Because of your --</span></p> <p><span id="s2824">A: -- of my uncle’s prominence.</span> <span id="s2825">But at Beaux Arts -- I -- I’m still -- I’m sure that if I’d started at a decent, modern architecture school I would have stayed.</span> <span id="s2826">But in the Beaux Arts, the first year there’s only one subject, free hand sketching, nothing else.</span> <span id="s2827">And I passed the mathematics option of the baccalaureate.</span> <span id="s2828">I wanted to do some other things beside free hand sketching.</span> <span id="s2829">So that was out.</span> <span id="s2830">So a friend of -- our friend in Chicago suggested that I was not qualified to work as a draftsman.</span> <span id="s2831">I didn’t know the English units, among other things, but at that time engineering drawings still had to be traced in ink on -- on vellum.</span> <span id="s2832">So I got a ma -- job as a -- as a tracer.</span> <span id="s2833">Eventfully they promoted me to draftsman, that’s -- was fine.</span> <span id="s2834">I started night school at IIT [indecipherable] technology in Chicago.</span> <span id="s2835">And I had a path laid out and in seven and a half years I would have my bachelor’s degree.</span></p> <p><span id="s2836">Q: Working at night?</span></p> <p><span id="s2837">A: Working at night.</span> <span id="s2838">Except that in January ’52, 15 months after I came to the States, I got drafted in the United States Army, because I came as a -- with my intention of becoming a citizen, so I was qualified for the draft.</span></p> <p><span id="s2839">Q: But you weren’t a citizen yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s2840">A: No, but -- but my --</span></p> <p><span id="s2841">Q: But they can still draft you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2842">A: The intent -- the green ca -- the -- the cert -- the certificate of intent, or whatever you sign, qualify --</span></p> <p><span id="s2843">Q: Qualifies you to be drafted.</span></p> <p><span id="s2844">A: -- makes you subject to the draft, yes.</span> <span id="s2845">Korea -- not to citizenship because the Korean war was not a declared war, so peace time rules applied.</span> <span id="s2846">And peace times rules are, after three years in the continental -- three years of service in the continental United States, you qualify for citizenship.</span> <span id="s2847">Well, people were drafted for two years, not three, and they were sent overseas.</span> <span id="s2848">That’s why they were drafted.</span> <span id="s2849">And then, in Korea, the Chinese captured a few kids in my situation.</span> <span id="s2850">At least one of them was -- was taken back to -- to Warsaw and paraded on the streets of Warsaw as a traitor.</span></p> <p><span id="s2851">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2852">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2853">At which point congress passed the wartime regulations, after 180 days without -- without a dishonorable discharge you qualify.</span> <span id="s2854">And so everybody in Korea in one weekend -- a federal judge was flown to Tokyo, all of these kids were pulled out and sworn in in one weekend.</span></p> <p><span id="s2855">Q: As citizens.</span></p> <p><span id="s2856">A: As citizens.</span> <span id="s2857">In -- in the European sector we were just told that we qualify as soon as we get out.</span> <span id="s2858">So anyhow, I had basic training, I had orders to Korea, blanket orders to Korea, which made me wonder what it will be like to have a weapon to shoot back.</span> <span id="s2859">Last minute I was -- a few of us were pulled out and sent to Europe -- sent to Germany as interpreters.</span> <span id="s2860">So I arrived in Bremerhaven, arrive in Stuttgart, intel -- intelligence battalion attached to the seventh army headquarters, after four or five weeks of doing nothing, the executive officer calls me in and says, “Soldier, we can’t get you clearance.”</span> <span id="s2861">Obviously they couldn’t check in Yugoslavia [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2862">Security status -- “without a clearance, you -- we can’t use you in this battalion.</span> <span id="s2863">The normal procedure under these circumstances is to send you back to infantry.</span> <span id="s2864">You look a little bit more intelligent than that, what else can you do?”</span> <span id="s2865">And I -- I said, “Well, sir, in attempt to be a civil engineer I also passed the draftsman test, not just the language test.”</span> <span id="s2866">He called across seventh army headquarters, engineer section, oh yeah, they need draftsmen.</span> <span id="s2867">And so for a year and a half I was a --</span></p> <p><span id="s2868">Q: A draftsman.</span></p> <p><span id="s2869">A: A draftsman.</span> <span id="s2870">In a few weeks I got promoted and I was chief draftsman.</span> <span id="s2871">So that was a very interesting lesson because the first time I was responsible for other people’s work, which was interesting.</span> <span id="s2872">Being stationed in Stuttgart was interesting.</span> <span id="s2873">I met two or three -- two other guys that sim -- situation very similar to a -- to mine.</span> <span id="s2874">One of the very inexpensive entertainments was the opera.</span> <span id="s2875">One -- four marks, one dollar, running 10 months a year, and so you know, twice a week, three times a week we would go to the opera.</span> <span id="s2876">There were a lot of young German men and women working in various positions at army headquarters.</span> <span id="s2877">I s-sort of became part of the group.</span> <span id="s2878">Mit -- at that time it was still an army of occupation, you couldn’t wea -- wear civilian clothes.</span> <span id="s2879">It didn’t matter, I -- I met this girl, I kept my clothes at her -- her house.</span> <span id="s2880">I would change, we would go out to dinner, and get changed and get back on the last bus at midnight going up to army headquarters.</span> <span id="s2881">If I was -- whenever I was challenged by the MPs in restaurants, I spoke better German -- better German than they did, I -- I was ne -- I was never caught.</span> <span id="s2882">I never -- never --</span></p> <p><span id="s2883">Q: So they thought you were a German?</span></p> <p><span id="s2884">A: Yes, I had this -- there was a Hungarian laborer in the kitchen at the -- at the -- at the army headquarters and he would lend me his -- his I.D. [indecipherable] car -- I.D. card and [indecipherable] MPs didn’t faze me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2885">Q: They didn’t faze you, no?</span></p> <p><span id="s2886">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2887">Q: You figured they can’t be worse than what you already went through, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2888">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s2889">So it was a very interesting experience because several of these kids wanted to talk about what happened and what they -- what their parents role was, and what happened to their parents, and I was very much interested in what their parents role was, and what happened to their parents.</span> <span id="s2890">So we had very long conversations with -- weekend long conversations.</span></p> <p><span id="s2891">Q: Were you honest about yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s2892">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2893">Q: You were?</span></p> <p><span id="s2894">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2895">Q: And they were very interested to know --</span></p> <p><span id="s2896">A: Absolutely, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2897">Q: -- how this connection was?</span></p> <p><span id="s2898">A: Yes, I was -- absolutely.</span> <span id="s2899">Yup.</span> <span id="s2900">Certainly that was a very -- intellectually very interesting part.</span> <span id="s2901">The other part is that with the leave I had -- and -- and money, I had opportunity to travel.</span> <span id="s2902">One thing I forgot to mention about my childhood is that this room that was my mother’s studio and our play space, on four walls, three rows of black and white reproductions of -- of artwork, most -- mostly renaissance, mostly classical, very few modern ones.</span> <span id="s2903">I was raised with that.</span> <span id="s2904">So over the years, but certainly starting with the period, I must have seen all the originals by now.</span> <span id="s2905">My sister and I couple times have started to make a list and we always stop, because the list gets aha -- longer, and longer, and longer of things we think should -- that should have been there, which weren’t there.</span> <span id="s2906">But, you know, going to Berlin, to the Dali museum to see the [indecipherable] which with the -- the owl [indecipherable], yup, that’s -- that’s part of my -- my traveling schedule anywh -- anywhere I go.</span> <span id="s2907">So I got out of the army.</span> <span id="s2908">I got early discharge so I could start at the University of Illinois.</span> <span id="s2909">I started February ’54, got my Bachelors in February ’57.</span> <span id="s2910">In the meantime I met Norma, we got married.</span> <span id="s2911">50th anniversary is coming up in three months.</span></p> <p><span id="s2912">Q: Where did you meet?</span></p> <p><span id="s2913">A: In Chicago.</span> <span id="s2914">My sister and her sister-in-law met through a common friend and they had both had children of the same age.</span> <span id="s2915">Her sister-in-law was born in Vienna, sent on a kindertransport first to England, and from there to -- family went to Latin America before they came to the States.</span> <span id="s2916">And so we got married in ’55.</span></p> <p><span id="s2917">Q: And she’s American?</span></p> <p><span id="s2918">A: She’s American.</span> <span id="s2919">First son was born in ’57.</span> <span id="s2920">I was valedictorian of the ’57 class.</span></p> <p><span id="s2921">Q: That’s quite an accomplishment.</span> <span id="s2922">Same year, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2923">A: Yup.</span> <span id="s2924">Commencement speaker was the junior senator from Massachusetts, John Kennedy.</span> <span id="s2925">I didn’t -- I wanted to design suspension bridges, I didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s2926">Q: You wanted to design suspension bridges --</span></p> <p><span id="s2927">A: Yeah, that’s -- I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s2928">Q: -- that was the thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2929">A: -- that was the thing.</span> <span id="s2930">I didn’t think about s-staying in academia, but I -- I got it -- I had very good record, I got a fellowship for the first year of graduate study, department [indecipherable] offered me a instructorship for the sec -- for the succeeding years.</span> <span id="s2931">So in seven and a half years, I had my Ph.D..</span> <span id="s2932">Never paid a penny for it, because I was on the G.I. bill, and then the Illinois Veterans scholarship [indecipherable] so I never had -- I never had to pay tuition.</span> <span id="s2933">And so I -- I stayed in academia all my life.</span> <span id="s2934">One -- one serious consideration for one -- to work in company in New York, but other than that, I stayed in academia.</span></p> <p><span id="s2935">Q: Now, did Norma work while you were getting your Ph.D.</span> <span id="s2936">?</span></p> <p><span id="s2937">A: Norma worked until Gregory was born in ’57.</span></p> <p><span id="s2938">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2939">A: And we were never as well off as when I -- I was a graduate student, and I had a -- the -- the small amount from G.I. bill, and the stipend.</span> <span id="s2940">I mean, we never lived as well within our means as we did then.</span></p> <p><span id="s2941">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2942">A: Oh yes, yes, I mean -- campus time -- you could go to concerts for a pittance, and -- and I mean, we had a -- a great life.</span> <span id="s2943">So I became an instructor.</span> <span id="s2944">I did be -- then things slowed down because I was working full time, I didn’t get my Ph.D. til ’61, when I was 30.</span> <span id="s2945">But I was full professor by ’65, in four years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2946">Q: That’s amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2947">A: And so I -- I had a very, very satisfactory career.</span> <span id="s2948">I got into computing very early.</span> <span id="s2949">Took my first -- my one and only programming course in ’57.</span> <span id="s2950">Machine language programming.</span> <span id="s2951">But I affected personally -- had a great affect on how structural engineers earn their living by taking part of the dull hand tracking computations off their -- off their hands and putting -- and substituting computer programs for that.</span> <span id="s2952">So I --</span></p> <p><span id="s2953">Q: Did you ever build a suspension bridge?</span></p> <p><span id="s2954">A: No, I never -- no --</span></p> <p><span id="s2955">Q: Does that make you unhappy?</span></p> <p><span id="s2956">A: -- I -- I -- I worked -- I worked part time before -- a-as a first year graduate student, and I designed a little -- tiny little county bridge, 20 foot span and that -- I was very proud of that and -- and a few times when we wer -- went back to Illinois, I actually drove out to look and see how it was faring.</span></p> <p><span id="s2957">Q: 20 foot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2958">A: 20 foot span, very --</span></p> <p><span id="s2959">Q: That’s pretty nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s2960">A: Yeah, tha-that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2961">Q: It’s sweet.</span></p> <p><span id="s2962">A: Yeah, but not -- my colleagues were -- two of my good friends were on the -- working on the Messina Strait crossing, you know, I did -- never did anything like that.</span> <span id="s2963">But -- but I dare to say that very few structures built that have not been designed with the tools that I started.</span></p> <p><span id="s2964">Q: And prior to what you were doing, people were doing everything by hand --</span></p> <p><span id="s2965">A: Oh yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2966">Q: -- trying to figure out everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2967">A: I mean, as an undergraduate this was drilled into it, that our chance of -- our livelihood depended on how efficiently we could do this hand cranking procedure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2968">Q: And you just said [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2969">A: Well, I wa -- I was very fortunate, I -- as a young instructor, I -- no, young assistant professor, I had a chance to work one summer at IBM, and I got introduced to some very useful theory and then I had a year’s leave of absence at MIT and I had some good colleagues to work with and I had a chance to -- to do something in very short order.</span> <span id="s2970">My -- my claim to fame was finished in ’63, have been downhill ever since.</span></p> <p><span id="s2971">Q: I doubt it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2972">A: But -- but 38 Ph.D. students --</span></p> <p><span id="s2973">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2974">A: -- first in ’72 we moved to Carnegie-Mellon.</span> <span id="s2975">I went there as department head.</span> <span id="s2976">I thought, you know, no big deal.</span> <span id="s2977">Year and a half later I had a horrible, totally debilitating nervous breakdown.</span> <span id="s2978">I couldn’t handle promotion cases, tenure cases, lab technician firing cases.</span> <span id="s2979">A psych -- psych -- a psychic-cologist -- psychiatrist and -- kept me on pills, which made me function okay, but he didn’t help, he was a pure Freudian.</span> <span id="s2980">He said, “How old were you?”</span> <span id="s2981">I said 13.</span> <span id="s2982">He said, “It’s impossible that something that old -- at that age could have ever affected you.”</span> <span id="s2983">So one day it became so severe that Norma didn’t trust me to go by myself and she came with me to -- to the shrink.</span> <span id="s2984">The way -- the reason I connected with him because I went to th -- asked the rabbi and the rabbi recommended him, the guy’s practice was marital conflict, and s -- i -- many times I would say something, what does Norma think?</span> <span id="s2985">She’s -- the same thing that I do, sh -- sh -- call Norma and -- and were always surprised that she said the same thing I did.</span> <span id="s2986">We walk in, we barely sat down, he turns to her and says, “Norma, what do you think is wrong with Steve?”</span> <span id="s2987">And Norma, clear out, says, “Steve can’t be responsible for the life and death of people.”</span> <span id="s2988">And so by the time he explained to her that these were n -- not really life and death decisions, yeah, I was -- I was done.</span> <span id="s2989">Next -- next day I went to see the dean and resign my position.</span> <span id="s2990">And both -- the dean said, “I’ll let you resign if you promise to stay and to see the vice-president.”</span> <span id="s2991">He said, “What do -- what are you going to do?”</span> <span id="s2992">“Well, I’ll go on back to te -- to what I know how to do, teaching and research.”</span> <span id="s2993">He said, “That’s not good enough.</span> <span id="s2994">We come to depend on you, and on your opinions.</span> <span id="s2995">If you can’t provide that, then there’s no point your staying here.”</span> <span id="s2996">And so from -- from ’74 til -- til ’99, that’s how I functioned at Carnegie Mellon.</span></p> <p><span id="s2997">Q: So you stayed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2998">A: I stayed in my -- my --</span></p> <p><span id="s2999">Q: As a --</span></p> <p><span id="s3000">A: As a professor.</span> <span id="s3001">I just gave up my administrative function.</span></p> <p><span id="s3002">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3003">Did the psychiatrist ever understand the metaphor?</span></p> <p><span id="s3004">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3005">Q: It didn’t make any sense to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s3006">A: Nah.</span> <span id="s3007">No.</span> <span id="s3008">I mean, the gu -- one day I walk in his office, he says, I’m just looking at this new scale of trauma by the [indecipherable] the big dictionary.</span> <span id="s3009">He says, “It scales trauma on a scale of one to 10, and 10 is surviving concentration camp.</span> <span id="s3010">Tell me, was it really that bad?”</span></p> <p><span id="s3011">Q: Did you walk out?</span></p> <p><span id="s3012">A: That [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3013">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3014">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3015">Q: We have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s3016">A: Yeah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3017">End of Tape Eight</span></p> <p><span id="s3018">Beginning Tape Nine</span></p> <p><span id="s3019">Q: So Norma made the correct evaluation of your problem, and we have to stop for a second.</span> <span id="s3020">Okay, so Norma made the correct evaluation and this idiot psychiatrist had no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s3021">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3022">Q: And he didn’t have an idea later, either?</span></p> <p><span id="s3023">A: Right, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s3024">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3025">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3026">Q: So you remained as a professor and your symptoms went away, you did not have a --</span></p> <p><span id="s3027">A: Ah, the de-department has been -- was always very supportive, the symptoms went away.</span> <span id="s3028">At promotion and tenure proceedings, yowe -- you were expected to be a spokesperson for your department’s candidates.</span> <span id="s3029">In very important cases the department head asked me to -- would ask me to represent the department, but the rules of the game were understood.</span> <span id="s3030">If I started feeling queasy, no question asked, I was off and somebody else was in my place.</span> <span id="s3031">And that has worked.</span> <span id="s3032">Occasionally -- sometimes I could go through, sometimes I could not.</span> <span id="s3033">There’s no point in speculating which one -- which was which.</span></p> <p><span id="s3034">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3035">A: But yeah, my symptoms went away.</span></p> <p><span id="s3036">Q: And how many more children did you two have?</span></p> <p><span id="s3037">A: Yeah, we have four children.</span> <span id="s3038">Gregory was born in ’57, Carol in ’59, Peter in ’60 and then [indecipherable] Laura was born in ’66.</span> <span id="s3039">So in their childhood we used to refer to them as the kids and Laura because they’re -- they’re --</span></p> <p><span id="s3040">Q: The kids [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3041">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3042">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3043">A: But I -- I always felt that -- that she was a civilizing influence on the other three.</span> <span id="s3044">That they -- they were quite wild, and -- but then when she came around they were vying for the privilege of babysitting her, etcetera.</span> <span id="s3045">Some -- so the kids, we were proud of them.</span> <span id="s3046">I must say I was not the best prepared parent during their teenage years.</span> <span id="s3047">I couldn’t quite emphasize with their concerns and their worries.</span> <span id="s3048">But certainly after they left home and went through college, we’ve had a marvelous adult interaction with all of them, a relationship with all of them.</span> <span id="s3049">Gregory went into civil engineering.</span> <span id="s3050">He’s department chair at University of California, Berkeley.</span> <span id="s3051">Carol went -- got a Master’s in public administration from Columbia.</span> <span id="s3052">And from her student days on she has worked for the city of New York.</span> <span id="s3053">She now works for the Department of Environmental Resources, and we joke that she’s a more serious civil engineer than either Greg or I, because she manages about a billion dollars worth of construction money a year, for the sewers and s -- and water se -- tre -- tre -- water supply and sewerage for New York City.</span> <span id="s3054">Peter went off to get a degree in -- in physics and math at Wesleyan, came out with a degree in English and classics.</span> <span id="s3055">Went to Hopkins in their Center for the Humanities.</span> <span id="s3056">And now has four appointments at Northwestern.</span> <span id="s3057">German, comparative literature, philosophy and social sciences, I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s3058">Q: Four?</span></p> <p><span id="s3059">A: Four -- is member four departments.</span> <span id="s3060">He has written extensively on Karnt.</span> <span id="s3061">He was a early follower of derridar and he specializes in German and Jewish philosophers and -- and writers.</span> <span id="s3062">Laura has a Master’s in -- Master’s degree in higher education administration.</span> <span id="s3063">She works -- she’s human re -- HR director for a -- for a software firm in Silver Spring.</span> <span id="s3064">They’re all married.</span> <span id="s3065">Four -- four marriages under chuppah, which we are very proud of.</span> <span id="s3066">Greg’s wife Carmel converted when they wer -- got married, and she -- she’s marvelous, she’s the -- the [indecipherable] of the temple in their -- you know, leading -- leader of all the women’s activities at their temple.</span> <span id="s3067">Carol, between her Bachelor’s and Master’s spent a year in -- and they -- they have two -- two daughters, Hannah and Emily.</span> <span id="s3068">Carol, after her Bachelor’s went to Israel for [indecipherable] for a year, and met a Israeli guy and he came -- they married -- and he came and they got married, Ithzak.</span> <span id="s3069">He now works for the same agency as a -- as a instrument tech -- instrument supervisor and they have two daughters, Molly and Ilanna.</span> <span id="s3070">Peter met Susannah at the University of Chicago, she got her Ph.D. in English, she teaches in -- in the English department at Northwestern, which makes it difficult for them to move because it’s a two [indecipherable] which is hard.</span> <span id="s3071">And they have one so -- one son, whose named Daniel Imbo, but only goes by Imbo.</span> <span id="s3072">She’s -- she was born in Korea, she was adopted and converted when she was year and a half.</span> <span id="s3073">And Laura is married to Steve Herberman, who grew up in -- in Potomac.</span> <span id="s3074">He’s a jazz musician, teacher at Townsend University, and probably will be teaching some -- some private courses at -- at the new music center in -- at -- at Strathmore.</span></p> <p><span id="s3075">Q: Strathmore.</span> <span id="s3076">That’s quite a family.</span></p> <p><span id="s3077">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3078">Q: Did it take you a long time to talk about your experiences when you were a kid?</span> <span id="s3079">I mean, your Holocaust experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s3080">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3081">As I was going through -- yeah, I barely talked about it.</span> <span id="s3082">The k-kids barely knew it, outlines normally, a little bit more, but barely outlines.</span> <span id="s3083">In this depression control process in -- in the early -- in early 70’s, I was chair of the adult education committee at our local temple.</span> <span id="s3084">People wanted a course on the Holocaust, and this lady came to give some -- some talks about the Holocaust and then she had to be absent for one of the lectures.</span> <span id="s3085">And I suspected the connection, I knew the connection right away, I couldn’t verbalize it.</span> <span id="s3086">I volunteered to substitute for her.</span> <span id="s3087">I thought that it might be beneficial.</span> <span id="s3088">Norma sat in the audience, cringing and hiding behind the back of a large man, and that’s when she heard the story from beginning to end.</span></p> <p><span id="s3089">Q: Which she hadn’t before?</span></p> <p><span id="s3090">A: Not as a full story.</span> <span id="s3091">A week later the rabbi called, he heard about my talk, would I repeat it to the temple youth group?</span> <span id="s3092">And I said sure, and that’s when Gregory, Carol and Peter heard it the first time.</span> <span id="s3093">Not to them, but to the youth group.</span> <span id="s3094">And then six, seven years later, Carol was taking a Holocaust course at the University of Michigan and her teacher invited me to come and give a guest lecture, and so Laura came along for the drive, just on a weekend outing with her sister, and she sat in the classroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s3095">Q: And heard for the first time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3096">A: And heard it for first time.</span> <span id="s3097">It’s largely that I didn’t want to burden them, and it’s largely that Norma wanted to shield me and shield the children.</span> <span id="s3098">More shielding me than shielding the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s3099">Q: Was that right?</span> <span id="s3100">Do you think that was the right thing to do, that you -- you needed your own time?</span></p> <p><span id="s3101">A: I think yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3102">Q: And the kid’s response?</span> <span id="s3103">Were -- were they unhappy that they didn’t know before, or they --</span></p> <p><span id="s3104">A: No, they were very -- ver -- appreciative that they -- no, they were -- never any unhappiness about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3105">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3106">A: I think they appreciated that they were adults, that they could understand, internalize the story and they all -- they -- they, ever since then been very protective of me, and you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s3107">Q: Did it bring you closer together in some ways?</span></p> <p><span id="s3108">A: Not -- not necessarily.</span> <span id="s3109">But, there’s a closeness.</span> <span id="s3110">And the kids are always available when -- when I need it.</span> <span id="s3111">In ’94, there was this 60th anniversary commemoration in Subotica, very poorly advertised, because they didn’t know whether the government would allow it, this was height of Milosevic.</span> <span id="s3112">My sister and I decided that we had to go.</span> <span id="s3113">The women in the family were against it, it was the fighting in -- in Bosnia.</span> <span id="s3114">What if this is on CNN?</span> <span id="s3115">What image will it project.</span> <span id="s3116">So I decided I had to go.</span> <span id="s3117">It turned out that Peter had a -- had a philosophy conference in Holland the following week, so he came along for that.</span> <span id="s3118">’95 I was asked to give the keynote address at the International Conference on Computing and Civil Engineering in Berlin.</span> <span id="s3119">The family again worried about my going, decided to delegate Greg to come with me, which was very useful.</span> <span id="s3120">I mean, you know, he knew some of the people, they were short of a chair for one the sessions, so he sat -- he was a chair for the session.</span> <span id="s3121">We went two days early and we drove down to Niederorschel and Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s3122">And that -- that was very -- very satisfying.</span> <span id="s3123">The night before Gregory wanted -- treated me to a nice dinner and at the dinner he said, “Dad, what is it that we are going to look for?”</span> <span id="s3124">And I took a napkin and I drew a map of the pla -- of the camp.</span> <span id="s3125">And the next noon we were there, and except that somehow I tried to visualize the orientation with respect to the sun, I was off 180 degrees orientation, but other than that, that -- that was -- that -- the plan.</span> <span id="s3126">So the kids have always been involved that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s3127">Q: And do you talk a lot?</span> <span id="s3128">Since -- since you first opened up, do you -- do yo -- have you talked at various schools, or not so much?</span></p> <p><span id="s3129">A: Oh, I -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3130">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3131">A: Ever s -- yup.</span> <span id="s3132">We started the -- the survivor’s organization in Pittsburgh has a very, very active speaker’s bureau.</span> <span id="s3133">They usually were reserving me for college talks.</span> <span id="s3134">High school talks, other members of the organization would handle, so I had Washington Jefferson College in --in Washington, PA, Allegheny College, north of Pittsburgh.</span> <span id="s3135">State University northeast of Pittsburgh.</span> <span id="s3136">I’ve been repeatedly invited for -- to speak as the speaker for Holocaust week.</span></p> <p><span id="s3137">Q: Is there anything that surprises you when you talk to these students?</span></p> <p><span id="s3138">A: Surprises me?</span></p> <p><span id="s3139">Q: About how -- what they question you about, or what their response is?</span> <span id="s3140">No?</span></p> <p><span id="s3141">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3142">Q: You like doing it, though?</span></p> <p><span id="s3143">A: I did, but then I -- then I got tired be the -- the last couple years before we left Pittsburgh I was doing less and less, I feel slightly burned out.</span> <span id="s3144">But a friend who since then has become chair of the Holocaust Commission, runs a course at -- at Carnegie Mellon and she al -- she invited me regularly.</span> <span id="s3145">There, I get essentially zero reaction from the students.</span></p> <p><span id="s3146">Q: Zero?</span></p> <p><span id="s3147">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3148">The intimate -- I think they’re terribly intimidated by the fact that a professor whose office is -- is three doors down from the classroom is talking about something --</span></p> <p><span id="s3149">Q: Right, so personal.</span></p> <p><span id="s3150">A: That’s so personal and so far from his academic field.</span></p> <p><span id="s3151">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3152">A: I ver -- a-at student talks I usually start out by saying I’m in this odd position with academics, jealous of their scholarship, and with very few exceptions, don’t want to go outside of their field of -- of --</span></p> <p><span id="s3153">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3154">A: -- of expertise, and here I am talking about something I have no expertise whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s3155">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3156">Well, is there anything that you would like to talk about that I haven’t asked you?</span></p> <p><span id="s3157">A: No, I think you were very thorough and I appreciate it very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s3158">Q: Well, I want to thank you very much, cause it’s been really wonderful to spend the day with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3159">A: I appreciate that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3160">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3161">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3162">Q: And I’m very grateful for your being willing to tell us your story.</span></p> <p><span id="s3163">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3164">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s3165">… And who is this, Steve?</span></p> <p><span id="s3166">A: This is my mother.</span> <span id="s3167">I suspect it’s a -- either her high school graduation picture or one taken even earlier than that.</span> <span id="s3168">I don’t know anything more about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3169">Q: And how did you happen to ca -- to have it?</span></p> <p><span id="s3170">A: Friends, acquaintances over the years have even gi -- either given us photographs or allowed us to copy from theirs.</span> <span id="s3171">My sister has a much better collection than I have.</span> <span id="s3172">I’ve just -- most of these are copies from -- from her collection.</span></p> <p><span id="s3173">Q: And this photo?</span> <span id="s3174">A: This is my father during World War І.</span> <span id="s3175">He was in -- a officer in the Austro-Hungarian army, because he had spent several years in Croatia before the war, he speak -- spoke Croatian, so he was assigned to a -- to a Bosnian regiment.</span></p> <p><span id="s3176">Q: And this group?</span></p> <p><span id="s3177">A: These are the employees of the printing plant, Minerva in Subotica, with my father and my uncle sitting in front.</span> <span id="s3178">The -- my uncle was the edit -- was the owner and editor, my father was the manager.</span> <span id="s3179">And behind it is the -- the plant where the -- the printing presses were.</span></p> <p><span id="s3180">Q: And this group?</span></p> <p><span id="s3181">A: This is the editorial staff, again my uncle in the middle in front, and my father next to him.</span> <span id="s3182">Several of these people became quite prominent journalists.</span> <span id="s3183">Some of them on -- under Fascist Hungary, a number of them in post-war Hungary.</span> <span id="s3184">Not shown in this picture are several people who had worked for my father who later came to the States.</span> <span id="s3185">When I came to the States there was still a Hungarian daily paper in New York, Detroit and Toronto, and a Hungarian literary journal in New York, all four of the editors had worked for my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s3186">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3187">A: Something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3188">Q: This picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s3189">A: Well this is my family at the local resort outside Subotica.</span> <span id="s3190">I’m sitting on my mother’s lap and my sister is in front of my father with two of my mother’s friends in -- in the group.</span></p> <p><span id="s3191">Q: What year would this have been?</span></p> <p><span id="s3192">A: ’33.</span></p> <p><span id="s3193">Q: And what’s this group?</span></p> <p><span id="s3194">A: This is my grade school, I think it must be second grade class picture.</span> <span id="s3195">I sit next to the teacher and my best friend sits on the other side of the teacher an -- we were sort of the leaders of the boys and the two girls nex -- sitting next to me were the unquestioned leaders of the girls.</span> <span id="s3196">The second one, in the dark dress, lives in Israel.</span> <span id="s3197">We visit her every time we go to Israel.</span> <span id="s3198">We once coun -- counted heads.</span> <span id="s3199">I -- I believe four people in that -- in that picture survived the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s3200">Q: And this picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s3201">A: This must be s -- well, no question, this is summer of th -- of 1940, one year before the occupation.</span> <span id="s3202">My parents and my sister and I looking at -- I don’t remember any more whether it’s a chicken coop or -- or a rabbit hutch.</span> <span id="s3203">My father bought this fo -- small vineyard, and he tried to -- to grow wine and -- and make schnapps out of the -- the fruit, but it wasn’t very successful.</span></p> <p><span id="s3204">Q: And this shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s3205">A: My -- th -- my sister and I. She’s wearing the uniform of second year of the academic high school, gymnasium, so this must be ’40 - ’41 academic year.</span></p> <p><span id="s3206">Q: In Yugoslavia?</span></p> <p><span id="s3207">A: In Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s3208">I obviously didn’t know how to tie a tie.</span></p> <p><span id="s3209">Q: And who’s this?</span></p> <p><span id="s3210">A: That’s my sister and I in Paris, ’47 - ’48 - ’49, I can’t tell, but that’s after we -- we got out of Yugoslavia and -- and lived in Paris.</span> <span id="s3211">In fact, it must be close to ’47, because I remember that’s the suit in which I traveled.</span></p> <p><span id="s3212">Q: And what does this represent?</span></p> <p><span id="s3213">A: This is the -- a photocopy of the Buchenwald index card.</span> <span id="s3214">On the left I’m listed as a Slovakian Jewish political prisoner, because I was -- I was pushed into a Slovakian transport.</span> <span id="s3215">Why political I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3216">And my birth date I obviously intended to give 16th -- April 16, 1929, somehow it -- two of the numbers got mangled, but clearly I -- I was use -- always using my sister’s birth date when I -- whenever I needed a birth date in Buchenwald and throughout the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s3217">Q: And this?</span></p> <p><span id="s3218">A: This is my provisional identification card, issued by the American army, after the liberation in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s3219">I still use Josef -- Josef for my name, but I think I went back to June six, 1931 as my birth date.</span> <span id="s3220">And I never -- I didn’t make the comparison.</span> <span id="s3221">I see the Buchenwald number is on it, which I -- I -- I didn’t know I had a Buchenwald number until this -- this past fall.</span></p> <p><span id="s3222">Q: And this?</span></p> <p><span id="s3223">A: This is an artist’s rendering of the synagogue in Subotica, the Reform synagogues, completed in 1902, designed by my mother’s uncle, a very well known architect of the Hungarian art noveau movement.</span> <span id="s3224">The temple now is in very bad condition.</span> <span id="s3225">We are trying to find a way to have it restored.</span> <span id="s3226">The -- it’s -- it’s on the -- on the UNESCO register of threatened historical monuments, it’s on the list of Jewish threatened historical monuments, but I -- I don’t know whether we’ll be able to save it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3227">Q: And this to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s3228">A: This is a copy of my father’s newspaper.</span> <span id="s3229">I guess the date is -- is 1933, December 22nd.</span> <span id="s3230">So at that time my uncle was still living, and so my uncle was still the editor.</span> <span id="s3231">36 pages, one dinar.</span> <span id="s3232">And the headlines are, “The King -- King’s Visit to Zargrev.</span> <span id="s3233">A rapprochement Between -- Friendship Treaty Between France and Germany Proposed by the French par -- Perfume King, and A Strike of the Postal Workers in Greece.”</span> <span id="s3234">In case you needed to know what the news were in 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s3235">Q: And this, Steve?</span></p> <p><span id="s3236">A: This is my mother.</span> <span id="s3237">The date is 1918, so she probably was an art student in Budapest.</span> <span id="s3238">I’m told that the sketch was done by one of her classmates, whose signature appears below, Fusti Molnar Katalina.</span> <span id="s3239">But I’ve tried pouring over Hungarian art -- artistic -- artist’s directories and artist’ dictionaries and I have never located that name.</span> <span id="s3240">So I -- I don’t know who the artist was.</span> <span id="s3241">But this -- this has always hung in our house.</span> <span id="s3242">This -- this is one of the -- the things that were in the folder that our -- our cook saved for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s3243">Q: And this?</span></p> <p><span id="s3244">A: My mother traveled extensively, 1924 - ’25 - ’26 in Austria, France and Italy, and this is one of the etchings she made in Florence.</span> <span id="s3245">I don’t -- for li -- for lithographs I -- I know that she did pencil drawings first and did the etchings at -- at home.</span> <span id="s3246">I -- I -- and did the lithographs at home.</span> <span id="s3247">I don’t know whether she did the same thing for the etchings, but I presume she did, that she didn’t have all of her -- her copper, and -- and acid and everything else that goes into etching with her.</span> <span id="s3248">So this is n -- nice view of the -- of Florence that I’ve always liked.</span></p> <p><span id="s3249">Q: And this?</span></p> <p><span id="s3250">A: This is one of her lithographs, it’s also Florence.</span> <span id="s3251">Think a little bit more Impressionistic than the etching.</span> <span id="s3252">The -- my father’s printing plant had a large, flat -- flatbed press with a large stone normally used for making maps, and I’m sure that that’s what my mother used to -- to pull the lithographs.</span></p> <p><span id="s3253">Q: And who is this good looking group?</span></p> <p><span id="s3254">A: This is my family at my granddaughter’s Bat Mitzvah, two years a -- three years ago.</span> <span id="s3255">My wife and I in front and our four children, Gregory, Peter, Carol and Laura and their spouses, and my son-in-law Ithzak’s family in the back row.</span> <span id="s3256">And the grandchildren, six grandchildren, including the one on the side, that -- that’s in bo -- that is in Chicago, and the other boy is here in Silver Spring and we have mo -- much more actively than any of the others, we have been involved in his -- in his growth, which has been very satisfying.</span></p> <p><span id="s3257">End of Tape Nine</span></p> <p><span id="s3258">Conclusion of Interview USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0494 PAGE 2</span></p></body></html>
