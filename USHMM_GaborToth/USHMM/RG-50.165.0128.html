<p><span id="s5">Q: What yeshivas did you study in?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A: In Pupa, Hungary.</span> <span id="s7">I’m a painter and I made a watercolor of my rebbe, Rabbi Greenwald.</span> <span id="s8">In 1952 I went to the Chazon Ish because I wanted to publish a sort of Hungarian Reader’s Digest.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Q: When did you go to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">A: In 1949.</span> <span id="s11">During the war I was in labor camp near Nuremberg and in Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: You went to Israel in 1949 and when did you come here?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: In 1959 and I want to return there because I have two sons there.</span> <span id="s14">They are Bratzlaver Hasidim.</span> <span id="s15">I also have another son and a daughter.</span> <span id="s16">My daughter teaches retarded children in Cleveland.</span> <span id="s17">My son is a book wholesaler in Williamsburg and a very strong Satmarer Hasid.</span> <span id="s18">But I am against the Satmarer.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: Where are you from?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: Erlau, Hungary, the same town as the Ktav Sofer.</span> <span id="s21">I was born in 1922.</span> <span id="s22">I’m 67 now.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: What kind of gallery do you have on the Lower East Side?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: We sell mats,

from this?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: A very nice living.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: The book you wrote about the Holocaust in Hungary, were you able to sell it?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: It’s very hard to sell such a book.</span> <span id="s31">And also I had a conflict with the Satmarer.</span> <span id="s32">They broke my head (He shows me a scar on his head.)</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: You had a real fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: A fight?</span> <span id="s35">Is it a real fight when six teenagers attack you?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: What was it about?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: I had a newspaper in Hungarian, called New Horizon and it spoke favorably about Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Why did you write that?</span> <span id="s39">You knew it would get you into trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Because I believed in it, and I wanted to popularize it.</span> <span id="s41">I discussed Judaism and I said that all the Jews should be in Israel (He himself plans to go in two years when he and his wife will both be eligible for Social Security.)</span> <span id="s42">We can’t go by the laws of the Torah, living together with the Gentiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Do you think people in Israel should all serve in the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: When, after the war, you learned that your family had perished, did you stop believing in God?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: What kind of work did you do when you came?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: First I worked in a sweater factory.</span> <span id="s49">Then I worked as a sign painter.</span> <span id="s50">Then I studied at Pratt Institute and became an artist.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: Tell me a little more about your newspaper, New Horizon.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: About thirty percent of those to whom I sent it, paid up.</span> <span id="s53">I published it for ten years during the 1970s.</span> <span id="s54">The Satmarer attacked me in 1979.</span> <span id="s55">I also found in YIVO an anti-Satmarer newspaper that existed in Hungary.</span> <span id="s56">The Satmarer terrorized the entire community.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: What do you do every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: I get up every morning at 5:00A.M. and go to minyan and after that I study Talmud.</span> <span id="s59">There is now a Satmarer community here in Seagate.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: How do they view you?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Like a leper.</span> <span id="s62">They say the Zionists knew 6,000,000 million Jews would have to die in Europe for a State to be built.</span> <span id="s63">And I say: Who could have even dreamt that such a thing would happen in the 1930s?</span> <span id="s64">It’s ridiculous.</span> <span id="s65">And I wrote this in my paper and it made them very angry.</span> <span id="s66">I also wrote in editorials that they were terrorists.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: How did they attack you?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: They called and said: “We have 200 Russian paintings.</span> <span id="s69">Can you evaluate them?</span> <span id="s70">They’re in Williamsburg” So I went there and it was nothing.</span> <span id="s71">I went into a private house and six men in their twenties began to beat me.</span> <span id="s72">I fell down and was full of blood.</span> <span id="s73">They hit me with an iron.</span> <span id="s74">And they didn’t allow the ambulance to come.</span> <span id="s75">Outside 200 people were standing who knew in advance what would happen.</span> <span id="s76">They prevented the ambulance from coming.</span> <span id="s77">They made a circus out of it.</span> <span id="s78">Finally my wife got me to Coney Island Hospital.</span> <span id="s79">They said they did it in the Rebbe’s honor.</span> <span id="s80">Two weeks later he passed away.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Do you think they did it with his knowledge?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: No.</span> <span id="s83">In his last fifteen years, he was senile.</span> <span id="s84">They terrorized other people too, Vishnitz, Belz.</span> <span id="s85">I had already closed the paper before that, for financial reasons.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Does it bother you to be seen as an outcast by them?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: I can’t tell you it’s great but I’m so busy.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Who read your paper?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: The Satmarer, especially the women.</span> <span id="s90">I reprinted excerpts from novels.</span> <span id="s91">Today I write books about Israel, mythology, all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s92">I’m now working on my fifth book.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Since you’re a hasid and hasidim don’t even read about these things, much less write about them, is there anyone you can communicate with?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: No, there is no one.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Is your wife supportive of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s97">She’s also a writer and an artist.</span> <span id="s98">She studied in Brooklyn College.</span> <span id="s99">I’m actually more of a caricaturist.</span></p> <p><span
