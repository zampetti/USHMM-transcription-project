side A.</span> <span id="s5">What is your full name?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Answer: Marianne Sorter Liebermann.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Q: And your name at birth was?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: Marianne Sorter.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Q: Did you have a middle name?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: And where and when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: I was born in Vienna on October 29, 1929 in the Rudolfina House and it was a Tuesday.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s14">Let’s talk a little bit about your family and the background, how fa -- how far back in Vienna it went, or other countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: As far as I know, both my grandparents, my father’s parents and my mother’s parents were born in Vienna and they all lived there, fairly close to us and I remember them parti -- partially from memory and partially from my dad’s pictures.</span> <span id="s16">And we were, I guess, an average, middle class, Jewish, Viennese family.</span> <span id="s17">And my father was an attorney, my mother was a housewife and my grandfather was a doctor and my other grandfather had a leather business in which my father worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: And what were the names -- your parent’s names were?</span> <span id="s19">A: My father’s name was Eric Alexander Sorter.</span> <span id="s20">My mother’s name was Gisele Sorter.</span> <span id="s21">My mother’s parents were Adele and Emil Koernig and my father’s parents were Emil and Hilda Sorter.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: And did you have a large extended family of cousins and aunts and uncles?</span> <span id="s23">A: Well, not really.</span> <span id="s24">My mother was one of three, and my father had one brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s26">Did you have any brothers or sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: I had no brothers and sisters, I was an only child.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: And what kind of neighborhood did you live in?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: I would say it was a middle class kind of neighborhood.</span> <span id="s30">We lived in an apartment which we owned and it was quite large, and in those days people had lots of servants, and we had someone who came in to do the laundry because it was before washing machines and dryer.</span> <span id="s31">And my mother always took care of me, but when she had to go out, there was always someone there with me.</span> <span id="s32">The last one I remember was Umgayla.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: And was it a Jewish neighborhood or a non-Jewish, or a mixed?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: You know, I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s35">I really don’t know because a-as people probably know, when you lived in Vienna in the thir -- in the 30’s, you considered yourself Viennese before you considered yourself Jewish.</span> <span id="s36">We lived across the street from the Temple, and there was no separation of church and state, and so when I went to school -- excuse me -- we had religion in the school.</span> <span id="s37">And the Catholic kids went on one floor and the Protestant kids went on another and the Jewish kids went upstairs.</span> <span id="s38">And I remember I had a teacher and her name was Mrs. Wolfe and she always told us we shouldn’t be afraid of her because her name was Wolfe.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Was she a Jewish teacher?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: I believe so.</span> <span id="s41">But we had cards, I still have one, with ma -- a picture of Moses on it and we had to get the cards punched when we went to services every Saturday.</span> <span id="s42">That was like, you know, our homework.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: How religious was your family and how affiliated Jewishly were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: Well, we belonged to the Temple.</span> <span id="s45">You know, you -- in Vienna at that time you were taxed according to -- through -- through the Temple, because the Temple had to send in lists of who was a member.</span> <span id="s46">That’s why it was so easy, you know, for the Nazis, and you were taxed according to that affiliation.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: And you said -- so you obviously went to a -- what we call a public school today.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: And wh-what age did you start?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: I -- there was no kindergarten in Vienna at that time and I went to a private kindergarten and my teacher was Miss Sophie and she taught me French be -- and then, when we were going to emigrate, my mother asked her to give me English lessons, but the only English lessons she gave me were nursery rhymes.</span> <span id="s51">I was very good on Humpty Dumpty, that was one of my specialties.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: What language did you speak at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: German.</span> <span id="s54">Viennese German.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Did you know any Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s57">Nobody in my family spoke Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Did you celebrate any Jewish holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Yes, we c-celebrate, especially with my mother’s father.</span> <span id="s60">We usually had Seder at my grandparents, I remember that, and I have a German Hebrew Haggadah, which I still have.</span> <span id="s61">And that was about all I remember.</span> <span id="s62">Now, in Vienna at that time, I had a Christmas tree.</span> <span id="s63">My parents, at a -- there was no, you know, there was no discussion about it.</span> <span id="s64">Every kid I knew who was Jewish had a Christmas tree, the Christmas tree was for me and the maid.</span> <span id="s65">It was like, that’s what you did at that time and I got th -- we didn’t have stockings or anything like that, but I got my presents under the tree.</span> <span id="s66">That was a Viennese tradition.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: So there was no discussion of what the holiday really meant?</span> <span id="s68">A: You mean Christmas?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: Chri-Chris -- Christian-wise.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s71">It was just, you know, I mean, i-it’s contrary to here where, you know, you make a big deal out of Hanukkah because you don’t want the kids to feel inferior.</span> <span id="s72">Everybody I knew got their presents at Christmas.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s74">And what about friends?</span> <span id="s75">Did you have non-Jewish friends also?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Most of my friends were -- I think all my friends were Jewish, I think.</span> <span id="s77">I-I -- I still have a very good friend who lives in New Jersey and she and I went to kindergarten together and we’ve kept up all these years.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Did you observe Shabbat?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: And wh-what -- Kashrut?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: No.</span> <span id="s83">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s84">Did you feel Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Not particularly.</span> <span id="s86">Not particularly.</span> <span id="s87">I mean, I -- there was no problem about, you know, kids going to different places for their religion.</span> <span id="s88">I mean, I never felt that I was better, worse, inferior or anything like that.</span> <span id="s89">It was just a fact, you know?</span> <span id="s90">I wa -- I knew I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s91">You have to remember, I was eight years old when I left, so from the time I was six to the time I was eight, that -- those were the only years that I wa -- I was in -- i-in school.</span> <span id="s92">By the way, I-I was a very protected child, I never went to school by myself.</span> <span id="s93">There were no school buses, my mother walked me to school every day.</span> <span id="s94">She walked me home t -- for lunch, she walked me back from lunch, she picked me up again, a-and so on.</span> <span id="s95">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: So even though you were -- obviously you were quite young when you left, you -- you were not that independent as a very young child.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Not at all, not at all.</span> <span id="s98">As a matter of fact there was a grocery store I remember, very close to my house and I was never allowed to go there by myself.</span> <span id="s99">I -- it was just -- you know, it never came up.</span> <span id="s100">And then when Hitler marched into Austria in -- I think it was March third, ’38, my mother took me out of school.</span> <span id="s101">Now, I don’t know whether she had to take me out of school, whether she wanted to protect me to -- you know, and so on.</span> <span id="s102">And that’s when I started those English lessons with Humpty Dumpty.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s104">So up -- up to the time of the anschluss you were leading a normal life --</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: -- and a child’s life.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: We’ll get to that point in a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Did you have -- and again, you were very young, of course --</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: -- did you have any other interests of hobbies or playing, or did you have any favorite toys?</span> <span id="s113">Anything like that that you can describe, as a young child?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: I had a beautiful doll carriage.</span> <span id="s115">It was gray and it had windows and it had a roof that rolled -- you could roll up and it had blue curtains on the windows and when we were here for a few years, my dad and I always used to take walks, and one day we passed the -- we lived in an apartment on Riverside Drive, and I passed the garbage bin and there was my carriage.</span> <span id="s116">My mother did not ask me if she could throw it out, she just did it.</span> <span id="s117">And it -- I’ll never forget it.</span> <span id="s118">It was like the worst shock of my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: What was her rationale for throwing it out?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Well, at -- at that time my grandmother and my aunt and my cousin, we were all living in one apartment.</span> <span id="s121">And I guess she figured, you know, I was old enough not to need the doll carriage.</span> <span id="s122">But again, I had -- my granddaughter Lauren had interviewed me and I explained to her how -- you know, she asked me if I was scared when I had to come to America, and I tried to explain to her -- she’s 15 now -- how in those days, in 1938, if you were a child in Vienna, or at least in my family, if your parents said, we’re going to America, which my mother did, I never questioned it.</span> <span id="s123">It was just, you know, that’s what you did.</span> <span id="s124">You didn’t say, oh I’m sorry I’m not going, or I’m sorry, I’m staying with a friend or -- or anything like that.</span> <span id="s125">It was just a very different time.</span> <span id="s126">And my mother always did say, cause sh -- I think she wanted to paint it as black as possible, that we were going to live in a basement.</span> <span id="s127">And I was such a naïve kid that when we got here and we didn’t live in a basement, I said, how come we’re not living in a basement?</span> <span id="s128">But you have to remember, I was eight years old, it was 1938, that’s the way it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: My parents were actually really wonderful in retrospect, because I -- I really never was scared.</span> <span id="s131">I know we didn’t have a lot of money, in retrospect, but I never had the feeling that A, I was going to starve, B, I was poor, C, I wouldn’t have enough clothes.</span> <span id="s132">I never had that feeling, so they -- they must have just been very positive people to convey that message to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: How old were -- were you when you first heard of man named Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Well, I remember very clearly.</span> <span id="s135">It was the President Schuschnigg, was his name, in Vienna, when he abdicated, and I remember everybody sitting in our living room and my mother crying.</span> <span id="s136">So it must have been very shortly, you know, before the anschluss.</span> <span id="s137">So I was -- I was eight.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s139">And what are your memories of the anschluss?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: Well, my mother took me out of school.</span> <span id="s141">She didn’t really explain it too much, but I think all my -- my three best friends also, you know, couldn’t go to school any more.</span> <span id="s142">But, I mean, they didn't tell us that anything horrible was going to happen to us if we continued to go to school or anything like that.</span> <span id="s143">Again, it was this naiveté, you know, of your mother says you’re not going to school, you’re going to have English lessons cause you’re going to America.</span> <span id="s144">You know, that’s how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: So you and your friends, did you talk about that --</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: -- at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: No.</span> <span id="s149">I think we must have talked about, you know, who was leaving first and -- and -- and those kind of things, but I -- I really don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s151">And so then your -- your mother started to prepare and your father started to prepare to leave?</span> <span id="s152">A: Right, well --</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: What -- do you know what they did?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: -- a very dramatic thing happened with my dad, tha -- ma -- as I said, my dad was an attorney, but he worked for my grandfather and he was like -- I don’t know how you called it in -- in German, but he was the attorney at the -- at the office, because my grandfather’s office was in Vienna, and the factory, the leather factory was in Poland.</span> <span id="s155">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: What -- what -- where in Poland, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: In Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: And not many people know this, but before the Nazis started to wear swastikas, they wore blue carnations.</span> <span id="s160">And the accountant in my dad’s office wore a blue carnation.</span> <span id="s161">And after the anschluss he had a gun and went into my grandfather’s office and said, this office is mine now.</span> <span id="s162">He didn’t shoot my grandfather.</span> <span id="s163">But my father, who was, you know, young, saw the writing on the wall.</span> <span id="s164">And the people who gave us our affidavit were customers of his in America, who are not Jewish and saved our lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: O-Okay, let’s talk about that, the -- the pe --</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Yeah, if you could go in more detail.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s169">Well, their name was Simon, Helen and Leroy Simon, they lived in Abington, Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s170">And they gave my parents and me our affidavit so we could come to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: And how did they get contacted?</span> <span id="s172">A: I guess my father cabled them or called them or -- you know, somehow.</span> <span id="s173">Mr. Simon used to come to purchase leather, you know, from my grandfather.</span> <span id="s174">So that’s how my father knew him, but only very slightly.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: What was the name of your grandfather’s company -- business.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Emil Koernig and son.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Emil Koernig and s --</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Koernig and sohn really, and i-it means Emil Koernig and son.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: -- and son.</span> <span id="s180">So then your father was able to -- this is after the anschluss, he --</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: -- ca-cables the Simons --</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: -- in the United States, and then they send the affidavits.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: Well, we didn’t -- we left Vienna in September of that year.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s189">What was -- again we’ll -- we’ll -- we’ll talk about that soon.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Did you see German soldiers?</span> <span id="s192">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s193">I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Did you see any swastikas?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: I must have, but again, you know, I -- I don’t remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Or banners, or any outward symbols?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: I mean, I’ve seen -- I’ve seen a lot of movies, you know, about that time, but I -- I -- I don’t remember, I -- I really don’t.</span> <span id="s198">I mean, I -- I never remember being afraid, I-I know that.</span> <span id="s199">And there must have been situations, you know, that came up, but I don’t rem -- know.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: So except for school --</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: -- not going to school --</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: -- your life -- I mean, that was a big change, of course, but in other aspects your life did not change in da --</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: My life just continued.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: -- continued.</span> <span id="s207">Tell me about your private lessons then, when you didn’t go to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Oh, well I think either Miss Sophie came to our house or I went to her house.</span> <span id="s209">And, you know, she had like picture books in -- in English and so on.</span> <span id="s210">I was an English as a second language teacher, and you know, what comes around goes around, and she tried to teach me English.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Was that some --</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: She helped my French too, at the same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Was that something you enjoyed doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: No, I didn't particularly like it because I really preferred going to school.</span> <span id="s215">I didn’t really like, you know, one to one so much because y-you always had to show your homework and, you know, things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Were you upset that you weren’t seeing your friends, or did --</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: I saw my fr --</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: -- you see your non-Jewish friends after school?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: I don’t think I had any non-Jewish friends, so, you know, we just kept up, you know, in th -- in those days it was before television, before a lot of movies, you know.</span> <span id="s220">Seeing your friends meant you went to your friend’s house or they came to your house, and that -- that kept up.</span> <span id="s221">And I’m sure in my house and their house there was a lot of talk about emigration and where were you going and what were you doing, but I wasn’t part of that, I was a child, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s223">So when you played with your friends, you didn’t talk about th -- being fearful or being frightened about what would happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: No, no, I -- it-it’s like that’s all gone.</span> <span id="s225">So I -- I guess it didn’t make a big impression on me, or I was too stupid, or something, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: I think you were young.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: So to get back now to what was happening.</span> <span id="s229">So your father cabled these people, they got the affidavits --</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: -- and then?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: Well, we left in September and we went to Cherbourg, which is in France --</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: Wh-When you left, you said you -- you -- you didn’t question, your parents told you that’s what you do.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: What did you take with you?</span> <span id="s236">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s237">Well, my clothes and my doll, which I still have.</span> <span id="s238">And my doll carriage, which my mother threw out, and books.</span> <span id="s239">I ha -- I have some German books that I -- I took at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Is that because you liked to read?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: Yeah, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s242">Maybe my mother said, you know, you’ll need some books to read on the ship, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s243">But my mother --</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: What -- wh-what was it like to say goodbye to your friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: I don’t think it was very traumatic because I presumed I would see them again.</span> <span id="s246">As far as I know everybody, you know, escaped.</span> <span id="s247">Not necessarily to America, but they all escaped.</span> <span id="s248">And -- so anyway, getting back to the ship.</span> <span id="s249">So we went to Cherbourg.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: How -- how did you get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: I think by train, because I remember my grandparents being at the station and that was very sad and I -- I still had two great-grandmothers at that time, who were killed in the camps, so a -- we never really heard through the Red Cross or anything, what ever happened to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Do you remember what your grandparents said -- said to you as you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Well, everybody was crying, that I d -- I do remember, and lots of hugs and kisses, and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s254">My grandfather died shortly after Hitler came, my father’s father.</span> <span id="s255">And my grandmother moved into a pensionne, like a -- like a -- kind of a hotel.</span> <span id="s256">And she and my uncle ev-eventually, you know, came to America and she lived with us all of the rest of her days.</span> <span id="s257">And my mother’s parents -- my uncle had been sent to school before Hitler came to England and he was in England and he managed to get them to England after Hitler.</span> <span id="s258">And they were there the whole time during the bombing, which was very bad for them.</span> <span id="s259">My grandmother had a stroke and so on.</span> <span id="s260">But eventually they did come to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: While you were still in Vienna, what did Hitler mean to you?</span> <span id="s262">Did it have photographs, or was it a symbol of anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: I -- I don’t have any recollection of that, I-I just don’t.</span> <span id="s264">I guess at eight I didn’t read the newspapers, you know.</span> <span id="s265">There was no television.</span> <span id="s266">My parents probably turned off the news, you know, so I -- I really --</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: I was going to ask if you heard his voice on the radio.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: No, I -- I don’t believe so.</span> <span id="s269">I-I mean, as I said, I remember shu -- Schuschnigg, you know, I remember that, but I don’t remember anything about Hitler.</span> <span id="s270">I know that -- I don’t know who taught me that, but to this day, if I see a movie or anything that has Hitler on it, we -- we all go ssssss, like that.</span> <span id="s271">And I still do that, even on -- at home, in a -- in a -- you know, on my television.</span> <span id="s272">That was sort of ingrained in me.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s274">So you take the train.</span> <span id="s275">Did you -- did you feel bad about leaving Vienna?</span> <span id="s276">I mean, this is your home.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: No, I was with my parents.</span> <span id="s278">We were going on a trip, I -- you know, it -- it was -- it was okay.</span> <span id="s279">Cherbourg, you know, was in France, I could speak French so I didn’t -- I didn’t really worry about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Ha-Had you gone away in the summers?</span> <span id="s281">Had you ta-taken coun --</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: -- country trips when you -- before you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: Yes, I have pictures of my cousin and I going with my grandparents, you know, to a place where there were a lot of deer.</span> <span id="s285">And I learned to swim when I was very young and I know that we went to Baden.</span> <span id="s286">And I was three when I learned how to swim and I still like to swim.</span> <span id="s287">So -- I forgot, where were we?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: Well, it we -- we were talking about your leaving, going to France --</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Oh</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: -- and I was asking if you had experience --</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: -- traveling outside of Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s294">And my grandfather had a car with a chauffeur, so I was used to, you know, being in a car, so I -- I don’t know if we took the car to the train or, you know, whatever.</span> <span id="s295">But anyway, when we got to Cherbourg, we got on the ship, the Europa and --</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Now we’re talking about th -- September 1938?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s298">And it all seemed very glamorous to me and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s299">And a few days out to sea, it was the time of Chamberlain, when Chamberlain went to Hitler to try to appease him, they recalled the ship.</span> <span id="s300">And of course --</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: This was the Munich conference in mu --</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: -- in Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: Right.</span> <span id="s305">So, I mean, I didn’t know anything about what was going on and I’m sure my parents were really scared, but they didn’t convey that to me and my father just told me that we were going back to Paris.</span> <span id="s306">And I was thrilled because I could speak French, and -- you know.</span> <span id="s307">So we were in Paris for a week and I’m sure that must have been very difficult for my parents cause they didn’t know, you know, whether they’d ever be able to leave again, but we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Tell me about the ship, the name of the ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Europa.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: And what line?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: German.</span> <span id="s312">And we were able to go first class because you couldn’t take out a lot of money, but you could buy first class tickets.</span> <span id="s313">So we had a very nice stateroom, and you know, all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: What did your parents take with them, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Well, my parents packed their furniture and the piano and all that in what was called a lift.</span> <span id="s316">It was like a cargo container.</span> <span id="s317">And that came --</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: On the boat with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: I’m not sure, but it was there when we settled, finally.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: And so anyway, after a week in Paris, the ship continued --</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: Wa -- do you remember that week and what you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s324">I guess we walked around.</span> <span id="s325">You know, we didn’t have a lot of money, so I remember being like in a café, you know, my parents drinking coffee, that kind of stuff, but I do -- I don’t really remember where we stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Di-Did you sense any tension among the people in France at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s328">Pa -- I think it rained a lot.</span> <span id="s329">I sort of reme -- I sort of remember that.</span> <span id="s330">And anyway, getting back on the ship and it was in the middle of the night, I remember that, and we had to climb up ropes to get on the ship, there was no gangplank.</span> <span id="s331">And when the ship started to sail the next day, I got very sick.</span> <span id="s332">I probably had like a strep throat.</span> <span id="s333">It was before penicillin and my mother kept saying to me, you have to get well, or we have to go to Ellis Island and we can’t get to America.</span> <span id="s334">Then, I think she was really, you know, like petrified.</span> <span id="s335">And I remember there was a woman on the ship, she was probably a nurse, and she -- you know, in retrospect she was like Brunhilda.</span> <span id="s336">She was very big and very blonde and had a very loud voice.</span> <span id="s337">And the way they treated, you know, fevers at that time was to wrap you up in lots of towels and make you sweat.</span> <span id="s338">So that’s what I did, and thank God I got well, and we didn’t have to go to l -- Ellis Island, and we landed, I think in -- probably lower New York.</span> <span id="s339">And my dad’s very good friend and later his business partner met us.</span> <span id="s340">And I remember he brought me some Coca-Cola and I didn’t know what it was and I didn’t want to drink it.</span> <span id="s341">It was a big deal.</span> <span id="s342">Anyway, we lived in New Jersey.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: Okay, let’s talk a little bit about ma -- the voyage, what you remember about the voyage.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: Well, just I was sick and I had to sweat and I had to get well.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: So were -- di -- were there other people in your position leaving, Jews leaving on that same voyage?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: I imagine there were, because my husband, whom I didn’t meet til ni -- til 1947, came on the next voyage on the same ship.</span> <span id="s347">And he and his mother were waiting for the ship and it was so late because they didn’t tell them that it had returned.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: So you’re assuming that there were people on --</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: -- in your -- in your journey.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: I mean, I was in bed.</span> <span id="s352">I was in bed sweating so I -- you know, I didn’t know what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: What condition were you in when you landed, were you cured, were you better?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: I was probably a little shvakh and pale, you know?</span> <span id="s355">And my granddaughter, who did this interview for school for me made up a story that my mother probably took her lipstick and rouged my cheeks so that I would -- you know, look -- look all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: What did America mean to an eight year old from Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Well, my mother said we were going to live in a basement.</span> <span id="s358">I knew I was going to have a birthday soon.</span> <span id="s359">I was looking forward to my birthday.</span> <span id="s360">My mother was a wonderful Viennese baker and as it turned out, my first birthday -- we landed here on October third, my ninth birthday was October 29th, and we lived in this rooming house in Union City, New Jersey and my birthday present was two blue plastic barrettes.</span> <span id="s361">And I thought that was the cat’s meow, I was thrilled.</span> <span id="s362">My mother, I don’t know where she got all the ingredients, but she made me a beautiful cake with candles and everything.</span> <span id="s363">And my dad’s friend and his wife lived in this same boarding house.</span> <span id="s364">So they all sang “Happy Birthday”, I don’t know whether it was in English or German, but that was my first birthday.</span> <span id="s365">And I went to the Franklin Delano Roosevelt elementary school.</span> <span id="s366">And there the kids made fun of me because I really had the wrong clothes.</span> <span id="s367">In those days I -- I h -- I had, you know, German high shoes.</span> <span id="s368">Now, you know, they’re in style, but in those days -- so after a few weeks, I don’t know, my mother managed to scrape up some money and bought me American clothes, cause that was really important to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: What were your parents reactions?</span> <span id="s370">Do you have any memory of that when they landed, and the dock?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: No, I just remember the Coca-Cola.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: So have you studied about America before?</span> <span id="s373">Did it have any symbolic meaning to you as a very young child?</span> <span id="s374">A: No, I think I must have realized it was a safe place, you know?</span> <span id="s375">But other than that I really didn’t know anything.</span> <span id="s376">But it didn’t take me very long to learn English, and I always did very well in school, and I o -- never had any trouble making friends, so -- you know, I had friends.</span> <span id="s377">I had the language.</span> <span id="s378">And when we moved to New York wa -- a short time later, a few months later, there were many other refugee kids, because we lived in Washington Heights, which -- in New York, which was sort of refugee land.</span> <span id="s379">And then my grandmother came, my uncle came.</span> <span id="s380">And it was very hard for my dad to start bi -- his business because you know, you weren’t allowed to take out a lot of money.</span> <span id="s381">Fortunately my grandfather had some connecti -- he was a doctor and he had some connection with the Phoenix Insurance Company.</span> <span id="s382">And somehow my dad was able to obtain the monetary death benefits after my grandfather died in America.</span> <span id="s383">And that’s how he was able to start his business.</span> <span id="s384">It was Sopter Fabrics, it was an -- originally an import - export business and then after the war it became a textile business.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: So you stayed in New Jersey just for a few months --</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: Few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: -- you said, and then you moved to Washington Heights.</span> <span id="s388">Why did you move to washingt -- or how -- why was that chosen as a place to live?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Well, I guess that’s where a lot of refugees lived, and maybe my parent’s friends knew other people, you know, who lived there.</span> <span id="s390">And I remember we lived at 40 Thayer Street and we had an apartment.</span> <span id="s391">And then when my grandmother came, she and I shared a room.</span> <span id="s392">And a few years later we moved to Riverside Drive and we lived there a number of years because eventually my aunt came from England with my cousin and she lived with us also.</span> <span id="s393">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Wh-When you first came to the United States, did you miss Vienna?</span> <span id="s395">Did you think about it?</span> <span id="s396">Did you think you’d want to go back there?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: I do -- I -- I don’t remember missing anything.</span> <span id="s398">I had my parents, you know, and I had my school work and I had friends, and I was eight years old, you know, and as I sa -- as I tell my granddaughter now, being eight years old then and being eight years old now is an entirely different story.</span> <span id="s399">I mean, you were -- I mean, at least in my circle of -- of friends, I mean, we weren’t independent.</span> <span id="s400">We did as our parents told us, you know.</span> <span id="s401">If they’d say jump, we’d jump.</span> <span id="s402">If they said red, we’d say red.</span> <span id="s403">You know, that’s how we lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: All right, now you’re in Washington Heights --</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: -- and you attend a new school.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: So you had to adjust, as the child --</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: Yes, you’re right.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: -- to a new school and new friends.</span> <span id="s411">What was that like in the beginning?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: Well, there’s a funny story connected at it -- it was P.S. 152 in upper Manhattan.</span> <span id="s413">And I never did have a sense of direction, and I met this girl Agnes and she showed me how to get from the front door to our classroom.</span> <span id="s414">And I was in that school -- I started school in New Jersey in 3B.</span> <span id="s415">At that time the grades were divided into A and B. And for the -- from the time, I-I guess until sixth grade, I went the way Agnes showed me, even though I knew there was a shorter way.</span> <span id="s416">But I was just one of those kids, I mean, you know, somebody tells me what to do, so I -- I -- I just did it.</span> <span id="s417">But I had to relearn the way we did math, the way they set up division problems and multiplication problems in Europe and America, that was different, so I had to learn that.</span> <span id="s418">But the kids were very nice to me at that point, because I had the amer -- quote unquote, the American clothes, you know.</span> <span id="s419">And I could speak some English and they -- they were just nice kids, you know.</span> <span id="s420">Like one showed me math and one showed me about the lunchroom.</span> <span id="s421">And so I don’t remember, you know, having any traumatic times.</span> <span id="s422">I had my best friend Toby who was a bridesmaid at my wedding and i-it was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Marianne Liebermann.</span> <span id="s425">This is tape number one, side B, and you were talking about now that you’re living in Washington Heights and you were at school and getting around the school building and your friends.</span> <span id="s426">So you did feel accepted there?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: And were there other children in your situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: I believe -- I believe there were.</span> <span id="s430">I know that my friend Gerda lived right close to me and we went to school together.</span> <span id="s431">And I heard about some other people who had come from Vienna.</span> <span id="s432">They didn’t, you know, necessarily go to my school.</span> <span id="s433">I do remember then when the war started and we all had to wear I.D. tags.</span> <span id="s434">And we moved to Riverside Drive from Thayer Street, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Now, we’re talking about September ’39, is that when the war --</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s437">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: -- started in -- yeah.</span> <span id="s439">Wha-What did your I.D. tag say?</span> <span id="s440">A: It had my name, my date of birth and maybe my phone number, I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Was this - all children had to wear them?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: All children, all children, because in case there were air raids.</span> <span id="s443">And my parents -- now, we moved before I finished sixth grade and my parents wanted me to finish P.S. 152, so I had a very long walk home to Riverside Drive from P.S. 152.</span> <span id="s444">And in later years it -- it occurred to me that here we wore these tags for I.D. in case there was an air raid and there was a problem, but they sent us home.</span> <span id="s445">And here I was, you know, by this time nine years old, walking home in this so-called air raid which, thank God was a test, but I -- I definitely remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: So did you talk about your experiences, did you tell the American children about your life in Vienna?</span> <span id="s447">Did they ask you about that, or did the teachers talk to you about that?</span> <span id="s448">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s449">Not r -- not r -- not really.</span> <span id="s450">It was just -- I was never very good in math, and so after my -- some of the kids showed me, you know, how to do the math, sometimes I would say, well you know, in my old school or in Vienna we did it like this.</span> <span id="s451">And the teacher would say well, now you’re going to do it, you know, like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: It -- did you feel very Viennese still, or were you starting to feel American?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Oh, I think I got Americanized very quickly.</span> <span id="s454">My father had been to school at the University of London, so he spoke a beautiful English with a very British accent, which he lost after several years.</span> <span id="s455">So maybe that’s why I, you know, was able to learn English quickly.</span> <span id="s456">But I -- I sort of lived -- I know I did l -- a -- a bilingual life, because when my grandmother came -- she didn’t learn too much English when she came, and so when she -- she’d come into the room I’d switch to German, and I didn’t even really realize which language I was speaking, but I was, you know, living in t -- in -- in two languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: So you -- you felt very accepted, you didn’t feel like a foreigner, in a sense?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: No, no I didn’t, because there were other children.</span> <span id="s459">I didn’t necessarily know them all in my school, but there were other children who had come from Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s461">And what about the teachers?</span> <span id="s462">Did any of them make any remarks to you --</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Not to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: -- or any -- did you experience any anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: No, no, I really didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: What was your parent’s reaction, if you remember, in September ’39?</span> <span id="s467">Again, I know you were young, you were only 10.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: When the war broke out?</span> <span id="s469">They were very worried about my mother’s parents.</span> <span id="s470">And I guess by that time they were in England.</span> <span id="s471">And you know, the bombing and all that.</span> <span id="s472">And I’m sure my father had a lot of business difficulties, because as I said, he didn’t have that much money and even though he had the money from my grandfather, it was still, you know, difficult to establish a business at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Were you able to do any other activities outside of school?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: I was a girl scout and we used to have meetings with boy scout troops and I learned how to make model airplanes.</span> <span id="s475">And my mother was always a very good cook and no matter, you know, whether we had a lot or a little, that we always had company at the house.</span> <span id="s476">So, you know, there were always people around, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Were these people American born or European?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: No, they were -- they were also refugees like we were.</span> <span id="s479">And in the beginning, in order to help my father, my mother did piecework with her -- her friend.</span> <span id="s480">And also she made apple strudels, which she sold and I -- I vividly remember her pulling the dough in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s481">And I don’t know how she sold it, where she sold it or whatever, but whatever you know, she did, she did that for awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s483">Did you become athlet -- were you athletic in any ta -- any time and d -- and do any sports?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: No, no, no, I was not an athlete.</span> <span id="s485">My parents had played tennis in Europe and also they skied, cause I have pictures of them when they were young and that -- but I guess at that time they were -- my father was busy making a living and my mother was busy, you know, helping and then also once my grandmother came, my mother had to help her.</span> <span id="s486">And then when my grandparents came, my -- my -- my father’s mother lived with us Oma Hilda, and my mother’s parents lived on the same floor as we did, in an -- in another apartment.</span> <span id="s487">But unfortunately my grandfather became very ill, he had Parkinson’s, and so my mother really had to spend a lot of time, you know, taking care of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: How old were your parents at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: My mother was born in 1907 and my father was born in 1904.</span> <span id="s490">And my father always said -- that much I do remember, that had he been older or richer, we would have never come to the United States.</span> <span id="s491">H-He -- you know, it was -- a lot of his friends didn’t survive because they A, didn’t know anybody to get an affidavit from, or have the guts to go.</span> <span id="s492">I mean, now we know all the horrors of Hitler, but then they didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: What do you attribute your parent’s wise decision to?</span> <span id="s494">When you say other people did not realize the danger.</span> <span id="s495">Wha -- how do you know -- wh-what would you think were the reasons that your parents did know?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Well, one thing -- for one thing my father had been, you know, to school at the University of London, so he had -- he had traveled.</span> <span id="s497">And I guess it was a question of luck, that -- that somehow that -- my dad saw the writing on the wall.</span> <span id="s498">And -- cause I know with my husband’s parents, my father-in-law was a surgeon and his hospital privileges were taken away, so he had no means of support.</span> <span id="s499">And that’s, you know, why he left.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: Was there any sense that you have that your mother was not in agreement with him about leaving, or was in agreement?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Well, my mother also was one of these European ladies, you know, whatever my father said, went.</span> <span id="s502">It was a different time, it was before, you know, women’s independence an-an-and all that.</span> <span id="s503">Th-Th-They -- I -- I never had the feeling that they ha -- or heard any arguments that they had about -- about leaving.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: So then comes December seventh and the bombing of Pearl Harbor.</span> <span id="s505">Do you have any memories of that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Well, I remember where we were.</span> <span id="s507">We were going out to -- by that time my aunt had remarried and we were i-in the car goi -- they lived in Far Rockaway.</span> <span id="s508">My uncle was an ear, nose and throat surgeon and he -- he practiced in Far Rockaway, and we were on the way to their house, or coming back from their house, I don’t remember which, when Pearl Harbor happened, and everybody was very upset.</span> <span id="s509">And then we heard President Roosevelt, you know, say that we’re at war.</span> <span id="s510">And I remember in school my principal crying.</span> <span id="s511">We -- we had assemblies in those days with middy blouses and ties and I remember we had this assembly and she was crying.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: And here you are, young, y-young student and had lived, you know, had escaped --</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: -- and did you -- were you particularly fearful when that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: No, no, because I -- I felt very American.</span> <span id="s516">I mean, this is my country and you know, this was ha -- this was happening to us.</span> <span id="s517">And my uncle was drafted into the army, and he also lived with us for a short time, so we were very close to him and we were worried, you know, about him.</span> <span id="s518">And I remember rationing books and that a-after awhile my parents -- my father and his friend, I think together, I don’t know if you could do that today, but they owned the car together, cause they -- each one couldn’t afford a car.</span> <span id="s519">And I remember, you know, the -- the gas rationing coupons, you know, for the cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: And what was the communication between your parents and family or friends back in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: Well, I think -- I think that -- well, I know that my parents wrote to my grandparents.</span> <span id="s522">You know, it was before the days of you know, you pick up the phone and call England.</span> <span id="s523">And they ca -- my grandparents came, I -- I don’t know the exact date, but I know that they came on a warship somehow, from London.</span> <span id="s524">And my grandmother had had a stroke and it wasn’t diagnosed and sh-she really wasn’t right any more.</span> <span id="s525">And as I said, my grandfather had Parkinson’s, so it was a difficult time for everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: What year did they come?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: Good question.</span> <span id="s528">I think it was after the war broke out.</span> <span id="s529">It was ba -- either 1940 or ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: So your life continued on as a young -- youngster --</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: -- and you were in the girl scouts.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: And any other interests and hobbies and so forth?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: No, we -- we -- my father and I used to take a lot of walks.</span> <span id="s536">We -- we all walked a lot.</span> <span id="s537">And I remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: Did you -- did you speak in English to him or German?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s540">Probably English, probably English, because I remember this business of my grandmother would walk in and it was like subconscious, I’d switch to German, but I think to Daddy -- and in those days all the refugees I knew and my family also, we were very careful not to speak German in the street.</span> <span id="s541">I mean, that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Because you didn’t want to be identified as a German, you didn’t want to be like an alien, you know.</span> <span id="s544">So on and so forth.</span> <span id="s545">And so i -- I-I’m sure I talked to my father in English.</span> <span id="s546">And eventually I went to high school, I went to high school on -- on the trolley car.</span> <span id="s547">I went to George Washington High School.</span> <span id="s548">And I graduated and I went to Hunter College first for a semester and then I went to Syracuse University and then I went to Barnard and graduated, got marr -- no, got married, graduated and had my daughter, all in one year.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: As the war was going on in the 40’s, in the early 40’s, how aware of yo -- o-of it were you as you were getting older now?</span> <span id="s550">You were 12 - 13 - 14 and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: Well, I re -- I remember seeing i-in the windows of people who had servicemen in the armed forces, they had stars in the windows, you know, that.</span> <span id="s552">And -- oh, I -- I liked to hear the radio.</span> <span id="s553">My dad and I used to wat -- listen to “The Shadow” and -- and programs like that, you know.</span> <span id="s554">And I -- I know that’s what we liked to do.</span> <span id="s555">And my grandmother taught me how to play gin rummy, so I played gin rummy with my friends.</span> <span id="s556">And I joined a B’nai Brith youth group.</span> <span id="s557">And I was the editor of the paper and made a lot of friends.</span> <span id="s558">And that was in the city, in Manhattan.</span> <span id="s559">So I learned, you know, how to travel in the subway and -- and so on.</span> <span id="s560">And at one point I was a copy girl for the “Daily News”.</span> <span id="s561">How that ever happened I -- I don’t know, because as I was growing up, my mother still, you know, was very protective of me.</span> <span id="s562">I always had to be in early at night and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s563">And the thought of me as a teenager being a copy girl for the “Daily News” on Times Square, during the war, in the dark, is beyond me, but I did it.</span> <span id="s564">You know, I think it was through the girl scouts that we -- tha -- that we did that, cause they were -- you know, a lot of the boys were in the army and somehow we were helping the war effort.</span> <span id="s565">And I remember saving tin foil.</span> <span id="s566">We used to make balls out of tin foil.</span> <span id="s567">I remember saving string, rubber bands, tin cans.</span> <span id="s568">You know, we -- we tried to do what we could.</span> <span id="s569">I remember my grandmother knitted sweaters for the Red Cross, for the soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: Did your parents talk about the plight of the Jews during the war?</span> <span id="s571">Were they aware of some --</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: No --</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: -- what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: -- no, my parents were still -- as old as I was, you know, as the years went by, very protective of me and didn’t -- didn’t talk very much about it.</span> <span id="s575">I mean, I -- I knew, I heard on the radio, I read the papers by then, you know, what was -- I knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s576">But we didn’t have any very close relatives who were in the camps, so you know, as I said, my father was busy, you know, making a living.</span> <span id="s577">At that point he was supporting us, my grandparents, my grandmother, my au -- he gave my uncle a job in his office.</span> <span id="s578">So, it was hard times.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: When you would see Hitler’s picture in newsreels or on -- in the paper, wha -- how did -- how did you react?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: Well, we did this sssssss business, you know.</span> <span id="s581">We ju -- we just knew that he was evil and I don’t think we knew right away how horrible it was.</span> <span id="s582">It wasn’t until after the camps were liberated that -- that we learned, you know, how horrible it was.</span> <span id="s583">Whereas my husband knew a lot more than I did, maybe because he was a boy, maybe because his -- you know, most of his family was killed.</span> <span id="s584">But I really didn’t know too much in the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: So tho-those years until ’45 --</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: -- for you were not fearful times.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: No, not ne -- I mean, I -- you know, when -- when -- whenever, you know, I remember, you know, Guam and -- and all those, you know, battles, I mean, you know, we -- we cheered when we won, we were sad when -- when we lost.</span> <span id="s589">And I was always fascinated by Winston Churchill, even as a -- as a teenager and I still am.</span> <span id="s590">I -- I just think he was one of the greatest people that ever lived.</span> <span id="s591">And I foll -- I followed the news, you know, when Roosevelt and Stalin and -- and Churchill had the meetings and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s592">And I eventually majored in diplomatic relations.</span> <span id="s593">I was going to be an interpreter at the United Nations.</span> <span id="s594">Then I met my husband and that was the end of that.</span> <span id="s595">And I became a teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: What was the end of the war like for you and your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Oh, everybody was so happy, you know.</span> <span id="s598">My father worked -- his office then was on 40th Street, right near Times Square and you know, we heard all those stories and again, it was before TV.</span> <span id="s599">You know, it’s hard for kids today to realize that.</span> <span id="s600">But we -- you know, of course we were all very happy, and life went on.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: And so by the time the war was over you were what, 16?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: So you were still in high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: Right.</span> <span id="s605">I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: A-And then you continued on to college, you said?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: And -- and -- and you studied interna -- did you say international relations?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Right, right, right.</span> <span id="s610">I went to the Maxwell House of -- School of Citizenship and I also met my husband when I was 17.</span> <span id="s611">I didn’t know he was going to be my husband when I was 17.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: How -- how did you meet him?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: We were on vacation, my parents and my grandmother and I in Lake Placid and we stayed in the same hotel and we were the only two people under 40 at that hotel.</span> <span id="s614">And we spent -- we wasted several days of I looking at his table, he looking at my table and nobody said anything.</span> <span id="s615">And finally our two fathers got together and decided, you know, to end this torture.</span> <span id="s616">And well, we spent, you know, a few days together.</span> <span id="s617">And my father and I would go horseback riding every morning and the morning that Frank left my dad was thrown from the horse.</span> <span id="s618">And Frank and I had decided that we were going to write to each other and I wrote him that my dad was okay, but he had a concussion and I had to go back to school with my grandmother and they stayed at the hospital, you know.</span> <span id="s619">But he -- he was okay.</span> <span id="s620">But I was pretty scared and I wrote to Frank and he wrote back and he signed the letter love, and that was the beginning of the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: And wher -- and where was he at school?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: He was going to Western Reserve and I was going to Syracuse and he used to toodle back and forth a lot.</span> <span id="s623">But those were the days of curfews and house mothers and fraternities and -- it was a different world.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s625">And -- and then when did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: We got married November 23rd, 1950, and we lived in Kew Gardens, New York, and then we moved to Great Neck and then we moved here.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s628">And your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: Well, we have three children.</span> <span id="s630">My daughter Joan, Joanie and my daughter Nancy and my son Jerry.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: And we have five grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s634">And when you met Frank Liebermann, you had similar backgrounds in a sense, both coming from Europe, and you said traveling on the same boat, another voyage later.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: Right, but we --</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: Di-Did you talk about with him th-the feelings of being a refugee and so forth?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: No, no, but I know that Frank’s tol -- Frank told me then that I was the first girl from Europe that he had ever dated, because I guess in Dayton, Ohio there weren’t that many refugee kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Did you feel a connection because of that refugee status that you both had?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: I don’t know, but our parents did because our parents were lifelong friends, even though my in-laws lived in Ohio, my parents lived in Kew Gardens.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: But they met at that Lake Placid?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: At that hotel, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s642">The chalet.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Did you speak in English with Frank in the beginning or German?</span> <span id="s644">A: English.</span> <span id="s645">We always spoke English until our kids were born and then one day we decided maybe they should learn a little German.</span> <span id="s646">And Frank and I discovered that we spoke an entirely different language.</span> <span id="s647">That the German they speak in Vienna is not the German that he spoke.</span> <span id="s648">And then, of course, the kids learned all those phrases about going to bed and, you know, all the things that kids at that time shouldn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: So then you -- you started raising your children.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: And then eventually you moved down here.</span> <span id="s652">Let’s now talk a little bit about your feelings of what you had gone through.</span> <span id="s653">Do you think today that you would be a different person if you hadn’t had the childhood -- the early childhood that you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: Well, my husband always said that it hadn't been for Hitler, A, we wouldn’t have met and B, that our lives are much richer living here.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Da -- do you feel that way, and if so how do -- what do you mean by that?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Well, I don’t know what our lives would have been like.</span> <span id="s657">I mean, we -- the chances of Frank and I meeting were nil.</span> <span id="s658">You know, he lived in Upper Silesia, I lived in Vienna.</span> <span id="s659">Unless his family took a trip, I mean th -- I -- th-there was -- there -- probably we -- we just wouldn’t have met and we probably, you know, would have married different people and had different interests and children and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: When your children were the age that you were, eight, nine years old when you had to leave Vienna, did that bring back memories of your childhood and leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: No, but I remember telling Joanie, my oldest daughter, when she was eight that when I was that age, you know, that -- what -- but it didn’t make a big impression on her.</span> <span id="s662">I mean, she just knew -- it was just something that happened, you know, it -- it didn’t -- it didn’t affect me, it didn’t affect her, it was just a fact.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: How did you present your family history an-and -- and what happened to the Jews in Europe to your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: Well, they knew that their father and I had been born in Europe.</span> <span id="s665">I mean they stu -- they studied.</span> <span id="s666">We were very active at Temple Beth-El in Great Neck and they -- they studied what happened.</span> <span id="s667">And you know, they’d ask us questions an-and -- and we’d answer it.</span> <span id="s668">And -- oh, I don’t know what year it was, but when I was teaching in Great Neck at the John F. Kennedy school, there had been the program on the Holocaust on television.</span> <span id="s669">And my principal and I were talking about it and she asked me if I wanted to, you know, give a talk to the fifth graders.</span> <span id="s670">At that time fifth grade was the highest grade in our school, and I did.</span> <span id="s671">And I told them my story, and kids, you know, would ask me questions about it and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: So you were very open with them and I know you said your husband lost relatives.</span> <span id="s673">Were you -- was he -- or -- were y-you or he open with your children about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s675">Oh yes, because it was very traumatic.</span> <span id="s676">I mean, he lost his grandparents and three uncles and one of the uncles was married and they had a little girl, Vera, and my first daughter’s middle name is Vera.</span> <span id="s677">And th-they always -- they always knew the story and Frank told me how hard it was for his parents because they would send money to various consulates all over the world and they would take the money and never give them visas.</span> <span id="s678">And his grandparents were on the way to Shanghai when Italy joined Germany in the war and so their ship was turned back and they were all sent to the camps and killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s680">So your children, at a young age -- relatively young age were aware of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Right.</span> <span id="s682">It’s like -- you know, y-you -- I-I don’t know some -- we -- we’re a very open kind of family and you know, it -- it was always part of their past.</span> <span id="s683">I mean, they -- they always knew about it.</span> <span id="s684">They -- you know.</span> <span id="s685">I mean, both my husband and my parents and my in-laws had accents, so I think this sort of, you know, brou -- brought about questions.</span> <span id="s686">And my son, unfortunately, when he was in med school, got leukemia and my s -- husband was the bone marrow donor, twice.</span> <span id="s687">And the big joke always was, was Jerry going to get an accent, or my curly hair.</span> <span id="s688">He didn’t get the accent.</span> <span id="s689">He got my car -- curly hair the first time, he didn’t get it the second time.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: Do you feel Viennese, Austrian in any sense now?</span> <span id="s691">And what are your thoughts about Vienna today?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: I don’t feel a -- I know that I’m probably a little different, because people have said to me -- it -- it’s not so much that I -- I feel different, but w-we’ve traveled a lot and when I go to Europe, I really feel that people in Europe look more like me than people here.</span> <span id="s693">I don’t know why that is, but it -- it is.</span> <span id="s694">I -- I -- I have that feeling.</span> <span id="s695">And -- but otherwise -- once in awhile I’ll joke around with -- with old friends of mine and they’ll use a -- a word that I’m not familiar with and I’ll say, hey, you know, English is my second language and they -- everybody laughs, you know, cause I’ve been here for such a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: Have you been back to Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: Yes, we went back eight years ago because my husband wanted to see where I lived and so on.</span> <span id="s698">And he got food poisoning and I really didn’t want to go in the first place.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: Why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: Because I live in the present and the future and to me the past is the past, it’s -- it’s gone.</span> <span id="s701">It’s -- that’s the way it is.</span> <span id="s702">I mean, I -- I know people who live here in Maryland who dwell on their past.</span> <span id="s703">They’re sometimes -- they are older than I am and maybe they had some horrible experiences, because I have a -- a step-cousin who was in the camps and she and I are pretty close, she lives in New York.</span> <span id="s704">And we’ve talked about it, that some people who had very bad experiences, as she did, that she was in the camps, either talk about it all the time, or never talk about it.</span> <span id="s705">And she’s one of those people that never talks about it.</span> <span id="s706">So, people are different.</span> <span id="s707">I mean, you can’t say that all Viennese kids who at the age of eight came to America, you know, think one way or -- or -- or another.</span> <span id="s708">But I -- I mean, I could pass for Yankee Doodle Dandy any time.</span> <span id="s709">I am proud to be here.</span> <span id="s710">I am thrilled every time we come back to the United States, you know, from -- from a trip.</span> <span id="s711">Cause I am thoroughly American, except for those eight years when -- when I -- when I lived in Europe.</span> <span id="s712">But the interesting thing is, since my husband and I were recently in Poland and the kids saw where he was born and where he grew up, my daughter Nancy suggested, and we took her up on it, and two of our granddaughters are going to be Bat Mitzvahed this year, we’re going to take them and their older sister to Vienna and show them where I grew up.</span> <span id="s713">This was not my idea, this was my daughter’s idea, but wa -- I’m going to do it, I want to show them, you know, th -- where I went to school, and the Temple and -- and so on.</span> <span id="s714">We’re going to take them to Vienna and to Prague to see, you know, the Jewish district that they have studied about.</span> <span id="s715">And -- but I have no -- no real, you know, connection to Vienna except that I was born there.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: When you went back to Vienna -- what was it, seven, eight years ago you said --</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: -- did you go back to your home and --</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: -- and if so, what were your responses?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Well, we -- we -- we saw where I lived and the only thing that had changed was the front door.</span> <span id="s722">And as I said there, my husband got terrible, terrible food poisoning and I couldn’t wait to get out of there.</span> <span id="s723">He was really sick.</span> <span id="s724">And I -- I think [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: Y-You couldn’t -- you couldn’t wait to get out of there because he was sick or because it was Vienna and you -- and your [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: It was a combination -- it was a combination, I think.</span> <span id="s727">And I remember feeling at a time when -- I don’t know how many years I was here or how many years I had spoken English, that I really didn't want to speak German and I didn't want to read any German books because I was -- inside myself I was afraid that I would forget my English.</span> <span id="s728">It was -- I -- I don’t remember how old I was, but I remember that feeling.</span> <span id="s729">And I -- and I didn’t want to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: So English was comforting to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: Oh yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s732">It -- I mean it -- this -- I-I -- you know, I’m 74 years old.</span> <span id="s733">This happened a long time ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Are there any sights today or sounds today that trigger your childhood in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s736">My father was a very good dancer, and he loved to waltz and he t-taught me how to waltz at a very young age.</span> <span id="s737">I taught my husband how to waltz, and very often, you know, when we hear a waltz, you know, I get all mushy about my dad.</span> <span id="s738">I was very close to my father.</span> <span id="s739">But other than that, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: N-No other sights or --</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: -- smells or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: Well, as I said, my mother was a very good cook and even though she went to junior college, she also went to cooking school in Vienna.</span> <span id="s744">And she -- you know, an -- name it.</span> <span id="s745">Zacher torte, the Linzer torte, the -- whatever, you know she could make it.</span> <span id="s746">But I never learned how to bake any of those things because my family was very equally divided.</span> <span id="s747">My father ha -- you know, had the business.</span> <span id="s748">I was the scholar and my mother took care of the house.</span> <span id="s749">And -- so my kids are better cooks than I am because I never went into cooking.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Marianne Liebermann.</span> <span id="s752">This is tape number two, side A. And let’s talk now a little bit about your teaching experience, when you started and what you taught and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: Well, I taught in Great Neck, New York for 27 years.</span> <span id="s754">I was at first a part-time teacher and I taught in several schools, and eventually taught at the John F. Kennedy school.</span> <span id="s755">It was an elementary school, and I taught middle and high school ESL in the summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: Which is English to speakers of other languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s758">Well, actually in New York it’s called teachers of English as -- to speakers of other languages, so it’s called TESL rather than ESOL as it is called here.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: And you obviously had children from other countries who came here and you having that experience yourself as a young child, did you feel a connection to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: And could you understand what they were going through?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: Well, I did, except their problems are very different.</span> <span id="s763">A lot of my students were from Iran, who came after the Shah, and they had -- they were totally different socio-economic background than the refugee children who came in 1938 from Germany and Austria.</span> <span id="s764">And their problems were -- were different.</span> <span id="s765">It was not only the language, but a lot of their mothers had really not been their caretakers.</span> <span id="s766">There were a lot of servants who really brought up these children.</span> <span id="s767">And when the mothers were faced with bringing up the children, there were a lot of problems.</span> <span id="s768">Some of the children didn’t change their clothes day after day after day, they slept in their clothes.</span> <span id="s769">They had a lot of trouble getting used to the food here that -- that -- it was very different.</span> <span id="s770">Like school lunches, you know, were a big problem for them.</span> <span id="s771">But all in all, children are children and the younger you are when you learn a second language, the easier it is.</span> <span id="s772">And my job was to take the children from their classroom in small groups and teach them, rather than have a whole class of children.</span> <span id="s773">And as I said, I had children from Iran, from Japan, from South American, from Central America, from Europe.</span> <span id="s774">My first two ESL students when I started teaching, were the sons of the CEO of Lufthansa.</span> <span id="s775">And I had to swallow just a couple of times, but they were two of my best students and they did very well in their lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: Did you speak in German to them and --</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: No, we were not really -- oh, I wouldn’t say -- allowed is -- is too strong a word, but we were encouraged not to speak anyone’s native language because our groups were mixed, and so it wouldn’t be fair that, you know, if I speak Spanish, I spoke to the Hispanic kids, and you know, the Iranian, I don’t speak Iranian or Japanese.</span> <span id="s778">So the goal of an ESL teacher is to have the children think in English.</span> <span id="s779">And that’s what we tried to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: So you said you did not tell them about your background and having to -- to learn a new language yourself at a young age?</span> <span id="s781">A: Sometimes I did, as I got more into the program and as I had the older children.</span> <span id="s782">You know, the fifth graders were the oldest ones, but the young ones, I certainly didn’t tell them, too.</span> <span id="s783">And it was very helpful when computers came into the schools because some children really had difficulty learning.</span> <span id="s784">They had difficulty learning anything.</span> <span id="s785">And some children came from countries where there was very little education for them, and we had to teach them, you know, how to tell time and tie their shoes and -- and -- you know, very -- very basic things.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: Di-Did you feel any kind of connection to these children, having to have left their country of birth and coming to the United States?</span> <span id="s787">Kind of a deep seated connection, in that sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: I did, but we had a very, shall we say strict supervisor who advised us in no uncertain terms that our job was not to be social workers, but to teach them English.</span> <span id="s789">And so ex -- we had a lot of after school things.</span> <span id="s790">We had parties for the children and their parents and we had different kinds of foods, and -- and you know, we’d have like an Iranian lunch, where their parents could participate, or a Japanese sushi lunch, or you know, things like that.</span> <span id="s791">But there were social workers attached to the program, and that was really more their job than mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: Let’s now talk a little bit about the religious aspect of your experience.</span> <span id="s793">Did having to leave because you were Jewish, when you were a young child, did that enter into your thoughts and were you angry that these things -- you were having to leave because you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: No, because in 1938 in Vienna, if you were Jewish, if you were part of a Jewish family, you really felt that you were Austrian before you were Jewish.</span> <span id="s795">And my parents were not particularly religious.</span> <span id="s796">And it wasn’t until many years later that I realized, if I hadn’t been Jewish, would my life be very different?</span> <span id="s797">Would I have not left, a-and so on and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: So as you matured and you raised children, did you become more religiously affiliated than you were as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s800">I did.</span> <span id="s801">My husband and I joined Temple shortly after we were married, and I was vice-president of my sisterhood and very active in the Temple and saw to it that the kids went to religious school, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: So why is it that you did that, as opposed to your feelings as a young child?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: I think being an only child, you need affiliation and so that was very important to me and always has been, and probably always will be.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: What about -- your thoughts about the -- when the Eichmann trial came up, and -- in Israel?</span> <span id="s805">Did you have any special feelings about that because of your background?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: Well, I mean, I was -- I was as horrified as anyone else, and hoped that they, you know, A, would be able to find him, and then would be able to pro-pros -- prosecute him.</span> <span id="s807">But I’m not really a hateful person and I -- I mean, I didn’t personally really, you know, connect, I mean -- a-as everyone I knew, you know, was happy that they found him and that they prosecuted him and that they were able to do it and th-they had the trial.</span> <span id="s808">But other than that, I don’t remember having any other thoughts about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s810">During the Civil Rights struggles -- struggle in the 60’s and 70’s and so forth, and knowing what you did about Hitler’s taking away the civil rights of countries, again, was there any special meaning to you about that struggle here?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: Well, I was getting my Master’s at Adelphi University at th -- and I was driving home when Martin Luther King was killed, and I -- I was just horrified and shocked, because I have black friends and I -- you know, I -- I-I was speechless, I was horrified.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: More so because of your childhood experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: No, it had nothing to do with it.</span> <span id="s814">I -- I just felt, how could this happen in America?</span> <span id="s815">I mean, land of the free, etcetera and so forth.</span> <span id="s816">You know, when you grow up in New York, yes there’s prejudice, there’s always prejudice of -- of -- of -- of all kinds, but I don’t think I fully realized how much hatred there was between blacks and whites until that happened to Martin Luther King.</span> <span id="s817">I didn’t really know about segregated schools, I didn’t know about segregated bathrooms and drinking fountains and things like that.</span> <span id="s818">I had read about it, but I never, you know, was really aware of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: Did you ever connect in your mind the si-similarity between those kind of restrictions and the Nazi restrictions?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: No, never, never.</span> <span id="s821">Maybe I was dumb, but I didn’t.</span> <span id="s822">I didn’t.</span> <span id="s823">I mean, that was then and this is now.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: So politically today, you feel the way you did whether or not you were born in Europe or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: I’m not sure what you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: Your political views today a-are n -- are they influenced --</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: -- by what your family experienced and your relatives experienced?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: No, not at all, not at all.</span> <span id="s830">I -- I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s831">I don’t think my parents were particularly political as -- as such.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: Were they Zionists?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: No, no, uh-huh, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: Did they talk about Palestine when you were very young?</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: And when the State of Israel was formed, was that a --</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: Oh, they were very -- they were very happy, a-as was I, of course, and anyone who’s read Exodus, seen Exodus, how could you not -- how could you not be?</span> <span id="s838">And, you know, as you said, a-as I got older and matured, I -- I realized all the horror that had gone on and how lucky I was.</span> <span id="s839">And there was a long time, when I took a shower, I thought about the people in the camps, I did.</span> <span id="s840">That was a long time, and even now, once in awhile, I think about that.</span> <span id="s841">And I’ve always tried to do a lot of volunteer work and th -- in connection with helping people, even when I was working and certainly now, because I feel that somewhere or somehow, there is a reason that my family and I were spared.</span> <span id="s842">Because we could have just as well, you know, gone to the camps and been killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: Do you have any sense of guilt that your family did get out, thank -- fortunately.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: No, I have no -- I -- I-I have no sense of guilt.</span> <span id="s845">I wonder why it happened.</span> <span id="s846">I’ll never know why -- I mean, I -- my dad had the courage and the guts, but sometimes I -- I think about it, you know, like why?</span> <span id="s847">And there’s no answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: Again, what was it about him and his courage and his guts to make that decision and oth -- that others did not?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: Well, as I -- as I told you, my dad said, had -- had he been older or richer.</span> <span id="s850">Not that we were poor, but I guess, you know, I don’t know what he meant by that.</span> <span id="s851">H-he wouldn’t have just pulled up stakes, or maybe, you know, if he had a bigger family, many more children, or -- you know, it would have been harder.</span> <span id="s852">Or -- I -- I guess a lot of it was luck, that he thought of the Simons, you know, to -- to give him the affidavit and that they, as non-Jews did it.</span> <span id="s853">Because, let’s face it, who -- who -- it’s not so easy to be responsible for three people.</span> <span id="s854">I mean, they never had to help us monetarily, but still.</span> <span id="s855">I remember we were at their house when the war broke out in Europe.</span> <span id="s856">That was a very horrible weekend.</span> <span id="s857">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: Can -- can you describe that weekend?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: Well, they -- they lived outside of Philadelphia in a beautiful gray stone mansion.</span> <span id="s860">And I guess their kids were teenagers at that time, I know they were about 10 years older than I am, and -- well, everybody was really crying.</span> <span id="s861">I mean, you know, everybody was just so sad, and sa -- an-and so upset.</span> <span id="s862">And my mother and my dad, too, but more my mother, remained friends with the Simons all the years until they died, the Simons died.</span> <span id="s863">And as I said, she was able to bring over a lot of her possessions, you know, crystals and figurines and so on, and I think -- you know, like for Christmas she would send them something like that, or she would bake them a cake, or you know, I mean they -- they really kept in touch.</span> <span id="s864">And this Mrs. Simon, Helen Simon was such a wonderful person that when my daughter Joan was born, she sent her a silver spoon for her birthday and for Christmas every year until she had a dozen.</span> <span id="s865">And each spoon is engraved with her na -- with her initials, J.V.L. and the date.</span> <span id="s866">And it’s become a tradition, because when Alyssa was Bat Mitzvahed, she did the sh -- Jo -- you know, Joanie is gung-ho, she bought the whole set at once for Alyssa.</span> <span id="s867">So that’s the story that’s gone on in our family.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: Did the Simons sponsor other people, did they write out affidavits for others?</span> <span id="s869">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s870">I don’t know that.</span> <span id="s871">But I know when Joanie went to the University of Wisconsin, Helen Simon was very upset.</span> <span id="s872">She felt that there were a lot of radical people out there and she wouldn’t be happy, and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s873">And Joanie went to Wisconsin and unfortunately was there when they had all the trouble with the bombings, but she got a good education.</span> <span id="s874">That’s how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: Do you think that the world has learned any lessons from the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: I hope so.</span> <span id="s877">I just hope so, and certainly the museum here and all the museums that talk about the Holocaust all over th-this country, you know, are doing their best to let people never forget, and that it did happen.</span> <span id="s878">And my husband was at the opening of the Holocaust Museum and he described to me how there were people there with signs that said that the Holocaust never happened.</span> <span id="s879">That’s a little hard for me to believe, but I know that there are groups like that in the United States.</span> <span id="s880">I don’t know why they feel that way, but that’s how it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: Is there anything you wanted to add to your thoughts about your experience, or your childhood?</span> <span id="s882">Do -- d-do you plan to go back?</span> <span id="s883">I know you said you were going to take your children back --</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: -- to Vienna.</span> <span id="s886">And can you maybe talk a little bit about the previous trip that you just took this fall, this past fall with your family?</span> <span id="s887">A: Well, we went back to my husband’s hometown, which originally was in Germany, but after the second World War was given to Poland, and the name, in German it’s Gleiwitz and it was changed to Gliwice in Poland, and it was under the Russian influence.</span> <span id="s888">And through the Holocaust Museum, this forum found out about the fact that Frank was born in this town and contacted us, and they erected a memorial to the Jews that had lived in this town.</span> <span id="s889">And it was a very, very moving experience for us.</span> <span id="s890">We also went to Berlin and I really wanted to be very unhappy in Berlin and I really wasn’t, because I could understand everything, and we stayed at the Hilton, which is like staying in America i-in -- in a -- another country.</span> <span id="s891">And two of my children had been to Germany 20 years ago when the wall was up, and they could not believe the change in East Germany.</span> <span id="s892">It -- it was just mind boggling to them.</span> <span id="s893">And Berlin is such a modern city and so many new buildings and a lot of hustle and bustle.</span> <span id="s894">And in Frank’s hometown also, there’d been a big change over the eight years.</span> <span id="s895">As I said, it had been under Russian influence, and now it seems to be, you know, a -- a -- a great place to live now.</span> <span id="s896">The people that live there were all forced to leave where they lived in the Ukraine and settle in this town.</span> <span id="s897">And they’ve made the best of it, and unfortunately there’s a lot of pollution there.</span> <span id="s898">There had been a coal mine there, which it was closed, but there’d also been industry and all the waste had been dumped into the river.</span> <span id="s899">And so there is a great deal of pollution, and also they still use coal to heat their homes.</span> <span id="s900">So at night there’s like a smog, it makes your eyes itch.</span> <span id="s901">And my son, being a doctor, wanted to find out the statistics about lung cancer there, but we -- you know, we -- we weren’t able to -- to find that out.</span> <span id="s902">And also, Frank wanted to s-show our children the apartment where we lived because the house is still standing.</span> <span id="s903">They changed the name of the street and the house number, but the people at the forum, Andre, said that the people were afraid to show Frank the apartment because a lot of the Germans who had lived there are now trying to reclaim those apartments.</span> <span id="s904">And so the people somehow connected that with us.</span> <span id="s905">So we couldn’t see the apartment, but we saw the outside of the building and Frank showed us where he learned how to ride his bicycle and where he went to school, and so on.</span> <span id="s906">And the memorial that they erected was a beautiful -- they had commissioned a Polish sculptor to make this memorial.</span> <span id="s907">It’s a broken Torah wi -- and with an eternal flame in it, and they weren't able -- the synagogue had been destroyed on Kristallnacht and so the land where the synagogue was was transferred to a Jewish group, but the group is about a hundred miles away from there, and they’re in dire straights and they were in the process of selling the land.</span> <span id="s908">So they had to get the permission from the building next door and that’s a cooperative building and they did get the permission of all the people who lived in that building and so the memorial is attached to that -- the wall of that building.</span> <span id="s909">And my son-in-law -- one of my son-in-laws passed by there after they had the ceremony, and there was a mother and a little girl.</span> <span id="s910">And I don’t know whether they’re speaking German or -- somehow he understood what they said.</span> <span id="s911">And I don’t know what the mother said to the little girl, but the little girl said, what’s a synagogue?</span> <span id="s912">Which sort of gave us the chills, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: And we just hope that nobody will destroy this memorial, or you know, put graffiti on it or -- or so on.</span> <span id="s915">But it was a very moving trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: Do you or Frank have any desire to go back to Gleiwitz again?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s918">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s919">We -- my husband has a distant cousin, a painter named Max Liebermann.</span> <span id="s920">And they ha -- are in the -- that -- that painter’s summer house is just outside of Berlin, in Wannsee.</span> <span id="s921">And they’re in the process of transferring his pictures, which are now in one of the museums in Berlin to this building, and they’re in the midst of fundraising because it’s very expensive to make a building safe and climately controlled for, you know, works -- works of art.</span> <span id="s922">And possibly some of my kids -- they’re supposed to open it in 2005, s -- possibly some of my kids might go back to there.</span> <span id="s923">But there’s no reason, you know, for us to go back to Gleiwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: When did your parents pass away?</span> <span id="s925">A: My mother died in 1990 and my dad died in 1979.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: And your mother was able to manage once your father died?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s928">I mean, she didn’t have to worry about money and things like that, and my husband helped her with, you know, writing checks and things like that.</span> <span id="s929">And eventually she became too ill to manage on her own and she was in a nursing home right near my house in Great Neck for three and a half years before she died.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: You have two children who are physicians --</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: -- and one who is a lawyer?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: Uh-huh, and -- and d-do they talk to you about your childhood frequently, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: Well more so now than before, but it -- it’s not a big deal in our family, because it’s something they grew up with.</span> <span id="s936">I mean, we never made a big deal about it.</span> <span id="s937">Our kids are all married to Jewish spouses, spices, however you say that.</span> <span id="s938">And people in today’s world say to us, you know, how did you do that, and so on.</span> <span id="s939">And I don’t think we ever overdid it with that, and we never overdid it with our backgrounds.</span> <span id="s940">It’s just part of who we are.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: When you hear the German language, does that trigger anything for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: Yes, I -- and I understand it, even though my German is probably like an eight year old.</span> <span id="s943">I don’t -- you know, I haven’t -- I -- I did take some courses at NYU in his -- in German history, but I’m sure I don’t speak like an adult German.</span> <span id="s944">But when I hear it on the radio or on the TV, I like it, because I understand it.</span> <span id="s945">And it is -- th-that was one of the reasons why -- I -- you know, in Berlin I turned on the TV, it was all in German, fine with me, you know?</span> <span id="s946">The kids were very -- my children were very impressed, you know.</span> <span id="s947">And I had been to Frankfurt with Frank on business at the Frankfurter messe when he was in the textile business.</span> <span id="s948">And I remember at the hotel, somebody said to me, oh your German is so good.</span> <span id="s949">And I said, crossing my fingers, oh you know, our American schools are excellent, because I really didn’t want to go into the fact, you know, that I was born in Vienna.</span> <span id="s950">I mean, it wasn’t anybody’s business.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: Why -- why didn’t you want to say you were born in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s953">It was just one of those things, you know.</span> <span id="s954">I just -- who knows?</span> <span id="s955">It was oh, at least 20 - 25 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: Were you afraid something was going to happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s958">I mean, everyone I know knows that Frank and I were born in Europe, and as I said, you know, I -- we joke about it sometimes.</span> <span id="s959">But I don’t know, it was one of those things, you know?</span> <span id="s960">You wake up in the morning, you do something silly, and that was the -- what I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s962">Any message you want to give your grandchildren?</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: Be good to each other, love each other and be happy and healthy.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: Anything else you wanted to add to the tape?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s966">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s967">This was a great experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: Before we close, do you consider yourself a survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: No, I really don’t, because I feel guilty using that term, because I know that so many people who eventually escaped the Nazis went through so much in the camps, and being hidden and so forth, and thank God I didn’t have any of those experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: Even though your family and your -- your life w-was in danger and that’s why your father deci -- and mother decided to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: Even so.</span> <span id="s972">A-As a young child, as a -- a very protected young child, I -- at that time, of course, I didn’t realize the danger.</span> <span id="s973">And since my life continued, just in another language, in another school, in another place, I-I don’t feel that I was that affected.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: Do you feel in any way jealous of those Jews who were bor -- your age, who were born in this country and did not have to go through what you did, and your parents -- and also that -- what your parents went through?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: No, I’m not a jealous person, and you know, it’s wherever the stork drops you, it’s -- that’s how it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: Have you been to the Holocaust Museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: Yes, I have.</span> <span id="s978">I was there twice.</span> <span id="s979">Once with my husband and once with my cousin who lives in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: And your reaction?</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: I didn’t read everything and I didn’t stop at every single exhibit.</span> <span id="s982">It was really hard for me to go, and I had a lot of nightmares about it after I -- I ca -- I dreamt about it a lot.</span> <span id="s983">And I never watch any Nazi movies or anything like that before I go to sleep because I know I would dream about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: Because of what you went through?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s986">I don’t know, maybe just the -- the plain horror of it.</span> <span id="s987">I don’t think necessarily about what I went through.</span> <span id="s988">It’s just the fact that it happened.</span> <span id="s989">Man’s inhumanity to man.</span> <span id="s990">My husband and I have always talked about, it was bad enough that people couldn’t help themselves, or so they said, but that intellectual people, like professors and doctors were involved in the annihilation of so many people.</span> <span id="s991">We just can’t understand that, we -- we really can’t, and I don’t think to my dying day I’ll ever understand that.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: Is it to your benef -- or was it to your benefit that you were so young at the time when your parents decided to leave and -- and if you had been older and more aware of the dangers, it would have affected you more?</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: Probably.</span> <span id="s994">I mean, I-I -- I’ll never know, but probably.</span> <span id="s995">As I said, you know, as I told you, and I told my granddaughter, it was a different time.</span> <span id="s996">Your parents said, we’re going to America, so we went to America.</span> <span id="s997">That was as simple as that.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: Okay, anything else that you wanted to say?</span> <span id="s999">Well, fortunately you did come to America --</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: -- and we’re grateful for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A:
