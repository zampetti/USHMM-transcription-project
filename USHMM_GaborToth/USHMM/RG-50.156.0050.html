Jewish Community Relations Council, Anti-defamation League of Minnesota and the Dakotas for the Holocaust Oral History Project with Libby Rosenzweig.</span> <span id="s5">Please tell me your complete name, including your Jewish name if it is different.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A: My Jewish name, Leibe -- it means “love’ -- and when I came here to arrive this country, it was changed from Luba, which in Polish means “love”, too, to Libby.</span> <span id="s7">Storozum is my maiden name.</span> <span id="s8">Rosenzweig is my married name.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Q: And when and where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">A: I was born June the 5th, 1926, in Breslau, Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: Was that town known by any other name?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: What were your parents’, grandparents’ and great-grandparents’ names?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: The only one I knew was my grandmother from my mother’s side -- grandmother Chayah.</span> <span id="s15">My grandparents from my father’s side -- his parents -- he was 21 years older than my mother, so they were dead.</span> <span id="s16">My grandfather from my mother’s side died, too, very early, and left four young children.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: How about your parents?</span> <span id="s18">What were their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: My father’s name was Rachmiel and Berish.</span> <span id="s20">Berish was another name for strength -- for bear.</span> <span id="s21">And my mother’s name was Rachel -- Ruchel.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: And what kind of work did they do?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: My father, after the First World War, he didn’t speak any Polish, when Poland came to existence.</span> <span id="s24">So he went to Germany -- with the Germans -- because he spoke German and Russian and Yiddish.</span> <span id="s25">And so this is how I was born in Germany.</span> <span id="s26">He had a fruit store in Breslau.</span> <span id="s27">But when the Germans came to power, he realized that something is wrong, and he moved us in the beginning of the ‘30s back to the border -- Poland.</span> <span id="s28">This was the borderlines of the First World War, where it was Russia, Germany and Austria.</span> <span id="s29">And at the time it was Poland already.</span> <span id="s30">And there he still went back and forth until ’35.</span> <span id="s31">1935 the Germans took the passport from the Jews, from him, anyway, and he couldn’t go anymore.</span> <span id="s32">He tried a lot of things.</span> <span id="s33">He was a Gerehasid, and the Gerehasidim were a very close-knit group.</span> <span id="s34">So they helped him in different ways.</span> <span id="s35">But it was hard, because he was older, to get involved.</span> <span id="s36">The last things he did is dealing with fish.</span> <span id="s37">There was markets on Thursdays and Fridays for the Christians and the Jews -- for the Shabbat.</span> <span id="s38">And there we had a stand, with live fish.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Did you observe holidays and religious events in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Very much.</span> <span id="s41">Very orthodox!</span> <span id="s42">Hasidic.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Did you receive any formal Jewish education?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s45">There was an organization -- for the girls, it was called Bais Yaacov.</span> <span id="s46">It was a Hebrew, a Talmud Torah type school, for the girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: And what was the name of that town in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Modrzejow, pronounced Mo-dray-yoov.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: You mentioned that the Germans took your father’s passport away in ’35.</span> <span id="s50">Were you aware of any events that were going on, politically, in Germany and in Europe, at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: In Germany, politically, I knew.</span> <span id="s52">We always lived in fear.</span> <span id="s53">And especially the part of town I come from, because this was always the part of town where it was once German and once Polish.</span> <span id="s54">It went back and forth.</span> <span id="s55">And it was called mostly Volkdeutsch.</span> <span id="s56">And those are the ones who were worst to deal with, the anti-Semitic.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Tell me about the incidents of anti-Semitism that you can remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: As a child, being in school, even, we all feared.</span> <span id="s59">I know as a child, my father used to, when he even traveled back and forth to Germany, he used to come home very disturbed.</span> <span id="s60">And this was on the Polish side, not in the German as much.</span> <span id="s61">They used to take the religious Jews with the beards and stop them, and antagonize them.</span> <span id="s62">And they used to take always my father as an example, because his beard was always neatly trimmed and combed, and it was pure white.</span> <span id="s63">And as children, too, we always had this.</span> <span id="s64">We were not free.</span> <span id="s65">I didn’t feel that I have the complete freedom of the Christians in my hometown.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Did you have any contact with gentiles, and if so, where?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Our next door neighbors.</span> <span id="s68">That’s as far as it went.</span> <span id="s69">We had right next door to us, a Christian, Catholic neighbor.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Did you ever have these people in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s72">They didn’t come to our home.</span> <span id="s73">We were raised completely fearful of the Christians.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Did you personally have any contact with anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: I was 13 years old when the war broke out.</span> <span id="s76">We always had to be better than anybody else.</span> <span id="s77">Maybe me, too, because my maiden name, Storozum, is in Polish, “100 brains.”</span> <span id="s78">And so I had to go through with this, through school.</span> <span id="s79">So maybe I had to go through more than any other child!</span> <span id="s80">(Laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Did you have relatives that lived outside your community?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s83">We had relatives, Sosnowiec, Bedzin, Dabrowa Gornicza.</span> <span id="s84">We had quite a few.</span> <span id="s85">I have a very interesting story for this, but it’s too long to put it on tape.</span> <span id="s86">But it’s going to be my story.</span> <span id="s87">This was my father’s second marriage -- my mother.</span> <span id="s88">We are from the second marriage.</span> <span id="s89">And his first marriage, they didn’t have any children; he married into a very big family, and they kept him as “uncle” all their lives until he died -- he was taken -- to crematorium or wherever.</span> <span id="s90">So we had close ties with his first marriage, and so we had a big family.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Do you know what happened to your relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: No one, nobody is alive.</span> <span id="s93">None, except my cousin, Henry Storozum, is in Canada.</span> <span id="s94">I have one cousin in Jerusalem, on my mother’s side.</span> <span id="s95">My cousin was at the same concentration camp as I, at the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: How old were you at the outbreak of the war then?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Thirteen.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: And how did you receive news of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A; We lived next to the borderline.</span> <span id="s100">On the other side was a gorgeous temple.</span> <span id="s101">It must have been a reform temple, because they were different that I was brought up.</span> <span id="s102">It was on the German part.</span> <span id="s103">A black river divided it.</span> <span id="s104">And when the Polish military started to move back, and in the situation they were in, we realized that it’s bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: You saw the military troops moving?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: Moving back.</span> <span id="s107">They moved through our hometown, back into deeper Poland.</span> <span id="s108">And they were in a terrible situation.</span> <span id="s109">So there we realized what is going on.</span> <span id="s110">Otherwise it hit us so fast, because Poland was anyway betrayed through their generals.</span> <span id="s111">It came so fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: What was the reaction of the Jewish community where you lived?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A; Everybody fled.</span> <span id="s114">A lot of people started to move with the soldiers.</span> <span id="s115">Our grandmother got sick and we couldn’t move.</span> <span id="s116">The first things what we realize, that the Germans are here, or the Germans are coming close, is because this gorgeous temple was on fire.</span> <span id="s117">And when we saw that this temple is on fire, I had tears in my eyes.</span> <span id="s118">When this temple is on fire, then we knew that it is the Jews, not just Poland.</span> <span id="s119">And our grandmother started to bid us to go, because of us children.</span> <span id="s120">So we went just five kilometers away.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: What did you do when you got to this place?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Well, we went to this family my father had.</span> <span id="s123">And when we came there -- they lived on the third floor -- and we started to go on the steps, somebody in the lowest, bottom floor, opened the door and he says, “ Nobody is there.</span> <span id="s124">But I am alone.</span> <span id="s125">And if you want to come in to stay with us, with me, you’re welcome.”</span> <span id="s126">A Jewish boy who his family left them to take care of the house, because this part of the country, the Polack people were as same as the Germans.</span> <span id="s127">They robbed and everything else.</span> <span id="s128">We came to open doors.</span> <span id="s129">Everything was open.</span> <span id="s130">Whatever they wanted was taken.</span> <span id="s131">The Germans didn’t take this.</span> <span id="s132">It’s the Polish people -- our neighbors in Poland did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: So your family did actually flee.</span> <span id="s134">You didn’t go very far.</span> <span id="s135">And so when did the Nazi occupation occur?</span> <span id="s136">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: First of October.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: And what actions did the German forces take in the early months or years of the occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: This is where my first horror really started.</span> <span id="s140">Because you see we went in this boy’s family’s apartment, and after three days we heard steps -- somebody going on the steps -- and we went out, and it was our family.</span> <span id="s141">They didn’t go too far either.</span> <span id="s142">They brought the news that there is a bakery opened, and they are asking all the Jews with beards to gather in a certain gathering place.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Who was “they?”</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: The Germans.</span> <span id="s145">The Germans were already there.</span> <span id="s146">And the S.S. First it was the S.S. who conquered our part of Poland, the S.S. troops with the black uniforms and the red armbands.</span> <span id="s147">They asked, the S.S. that all the Jews with the beards should gather in a place.</span> <span id="s148">So we didn’t let our father go, we decided not to let him go.</span> <span id="s149">And not to even let him know that it’s a gathering.</span> <span id="s150">My sister went for a barber, and I went to stand in the line to get some bread, because we didn’t have any more to eat.</span> <span id="s151">So going out where I was directed to go, that was where my first horror started, because the streets were paved with bodies, with the opened skulls and bellies and stomachs.</span> <span id="s152">I had to go through in order to get to the bakery.</span> <span id="s153">There were my first horror of the war, started right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: So did you talk to other people in the community about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: There wasn’t any way of talking to anybody in the community at that time.</span> <span id="s156">Everybody was on their own.</span> <span id="s157">Whatever the Germans did, this is what it was, or where.</span> <span id="s158">And this is why sometime it really bothers me when I hear people say that the Jews went like sheep, or didn’t put up a resistance.</span> <span id="s159">It really bothers me.</span> <span id="s160">There was no chance.</span> <span id="s161">There was no awareness of anything like it.</span> <span id="s162">Nobody knew that something like this could ever happen, especially my father.</span> <span id="s163">My father’s best friends, which they helped us out with permits, the Jews in Germany never knew that they were Jews to begin with.</span> <span id="s164">It was the best country in the world for the Jews at that time.</span> <span id="s165">Who could even dream that something like this will ever happen!</span> <span id="s166">Except in Poland, maybe.</span> <span id="s167">We were more afraid of the Polish people than of the Germans!</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Can you recall any specific anti-Jewish measures or legislation by the occupation?</span> <span id="s169">By the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Whatever it was, it was anti-Jewish.</span> <span id="s171">It wasn’t any more war against any other country except against the Jews.</span> <span id="s172">Once they conquered the country, there were the Jews -- nothing else.</span> <span id="s173">So whatever measures were taken, it was first taken against the Jew.</span> <span id="s174">Hitler’s politics -- and the Germans, the Nazi politics -- were to take everything from the Jews away, and give it to the Germans.</span> <span id="s175">And that’s what they did.</span> <span id="s176">They took everything from us away and gave it, and this is why Germany never asked where it came from.</span> <span id="s177">And they had the best time in their life -- is by Hitler.</span> <span id="s178">Right away the legislation was against the Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: How were your freedoms restricted?</span> <span id="s180">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Yes, right away from the beginning I wore a white armband with a blue Star of David.</span> <span id="s182">And then I had the yellow band on both sides.</span> <span id="s183">A yellow Star of David.</span> <span id="s184">Seven o’clock we had to be home.</span> <span id="s185">A Jew could not be later than 7 o’clock in the evening out.</span> <span id="s186">And we had different ration cards than the Christians.</span> <span id="s187">We had less.</span> <span id="s188">We were enslaved right away.</span> <span id="s189">Once they came into Poland, we were enslaved.</span> <span id="s190">We had to work for them, dig ditches, clean the quarters.</span> <span id="s191">After the S.S. went on, they were replaced by the Wehrmacht.</span> <span id="s192">And the Wehrmacht took away villas and big buildings for themselves.</span> <span id="s193">And we, the Jewish girls had to clean the quarters.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: How many hours a day?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: What the Wehrmacht did, made a Jewish Gemeinde -- a Yiddishe Gemeinde.</span> <span id="s196">This is a Jewish Committee.</span> <span id="s197">And they worked, the Committee, to get whatever they needed.</span> <span id="s198">If they needed people, to labor camps, they went to the Committee.</span> <span id="s199">Somebody from the Committee had to give them the amount of cattle they needed.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: Did you have radios or newspapers?</span> <span id="s201">Did you know what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: No.</span> <span id="s203">But you know, word of mouth.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: And what did you learn from other people?</span> <span id="s205">Anything about other ghettos or concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: I went to a labor camp in 1942.</span> <span id="s207">A lot of people, in the beginning, they fled.</span> <span id="s208">It’s very hard to believe, but the Russian and China were the only countries opened the doors for the Jews.</span> <span id="s209">And a lot of them fled to Russia and didn’t come back .</span> <span id="s210">The ones who had the means, the ones who had the money, fled a little further -- deeper to Poland.</span> <span id="s211">They didn’t return.</span> <span id="s212">And they are not alive.</span> <span id="s213">The ones who couldn’t afford to pay for their lives were sent to camps.</span> <span id="s214">And the ones who were sent to camps are here today to tell the story.</span> <span id="s215">Because at the end of ’44, there were gas chambers already, it was more freely then burned and killed.</span> <span id="s216">The Jewish Committee and other committees, could save people.</span> <span id="s217">Everybody had somebody to work for them</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Tell me about the events leading up to you going to the labor camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: I had a cousin in Sosnowiec, and she had a candy store, and they took her husband to labor camp.</span> <span id="s220">She begged my father I should help her.</span> <span id="s221">So one day we had a gathering and they gathered us together there.</span> <span id="s222">And it’s good that she had, again the connections, and we were out.</span> <span id="s223">I had such a fear that I am going to never see my parents again, that I quit and I went home to be with them.</span> <span id="s224">Whatever it will be, will be with my parents, because this was my first incident.</span> <span id="s225">So two weeks later they came early in the morning.</span> <span id="s226">They gathered us out.</span> <span id="s227">We knew that something is going to be.</span> <span id="s228">But we didn’t know that it’s going to be gas chambers.</span> <span id="s229">It was mentioned already about the ghettos and things, that they are moving the Jews closer together.</span> <span id="s230">So we had things packed.</span> <span id="s231">We took whatever was necessary, a suitcase and a knapsack.</span> <span id="s232">And they gathered us together.</span> <span id="s233">But being there, it was a horse of changed field.</span> <span id="s234">And being there, and being born in Germany, I was thirteen, and an interpreter.</span> <span id="s235">I don’t know how I understood German, how I spoke German, because I went just to Polish school, but I was the interpreter for our little horseshoe committee.</span> <span id="s236">I don’t know how to express myself, because there were three buildings, closing in.</span> <span id="s237">and there was a caretaker.</span> <span id="s238">And for this caretaker, when the Germans came, he took me as an interpreter.</span> <span id="s239">So when I came to the S.S. in the front, I stood in the front of my parents.</span> <span id="s240">I overheard one S.S. said to the other, “ If half of the family is in concentration camp, the other half can go free.”</span> <span id="s241">So I didn’t tell this to my parents, and I volunteered.</span> <span id="s242">So we were selected.</span> <span id="s243">Volunteered to work in camp, because my sister was already in a working camp You see, we had to have “zonders,” it was called -- working permits.</span> <span id="s244">And my sister, through my cousin in Canada, had a German zonder, working for a German seamstress.</span> <span id="s245">And this was the best.</span> <span id="s246">And because he was a furrier and had an open store, to repair, at the time, he gave me the Jewish zonder, but they looked for me, and I was with my cousin in Sosnowiec, so they took my sister in my place.</span> <span id="s247">So my sister was already in working camp.</span> <span id="s248">So when I heard if half is in working camp, I volunteered.</span> <span id="s249">And they took me to working camp, and my parents they sent back home for two weeks.</span> <span id="s250">And then they did the same thing again, and they were gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Do you know where your parents were?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s253">The only place was the gas -- Auschwitz we were not too far from.</span> <span id="s254">We were maybe 35 kilometers from Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: So how did you go to this labor camp and where was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Czechoslovakia -- Arnau.</span> <span id="s257">It was a spinning factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: How did you get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: First what they did is they gathered us again in Sosnowiec, it was called Dulak.</span> <span id="s260">Was a gathering place where 5,000 -- this is why I’m saying that I was a lucky survivor -- from 5,000 they got us all down on the fields in rows, and then selected.</span> <span id="s261">And I was selected, between 60 girls, from 5,000, to go to this working camp in Arnau -- a spinning factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: And how did they transport you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: At the time in ’42 it was still by trains.</span> <span id="s264">A regular passenger train.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: And how long did it take to get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: I took five days to travel, because I remember, on the train I was fifteen.</span> <span id="s267">My birthday is June 5th, so it was the end of May, 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: Describe the labor camp.</span> <span id="s269">What the living conditions were like, and what kind of work you did, what your day was like.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: Being that we were chosen 60 girls, and being that it was in 1942, the 60 girls, at the time, we were not treated bad.</span> <span id="s271">It’s barbed wire, and we didn’t have any freedom, but we were not treated bad.</span> <span id="s272">We were treated as prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s273">The same as the Russian prisoners of war and the others.</span> <span id="s274">We had a German Lagerfuhrer.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: What was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: She was the camp leader.</span> <span id="s277">And then we had a Jewish camp leader, a German Jewish nurse.</span> <span id="s278">And we worked.</span> <span id="s279">We learned how to spin, and we were all in the age between 14, 15, and 16.</span> <span id="s280">There were maybe five older girls.</span> <span id="s281">We didn’t know of anything else.</span> <span id="s282">I went to concentration camp with the feeling in mind that I’m going to come home!</span> <span id="s283">That I’m going to still have my parents when I come home.</span> <span id="s284">The idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: So you were making material?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: What we were spinning, it came from the raw, called flax.</span> <span id="s287">The raw material.</span> <span id="s288">But I worked in fine spinning.</span> <span id="s289">It came already in big spools.</span> <span id="s290">I had to bring it through water and gears onto little spools.</span> <span id="s291">And this is how I learned to spin.</span> <span id="s292">We were really good.</span> <span id="s293">And lucky to be good, because in 1944, it had to be concentration camp, and our camp had to be removed.</span> <span id="s294">So because we were so good, and our directors were so nice, he moved us to another camp of his.</span> <span id="s295">It was a paper spinning factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Do you remember the name of the director of the camp that you were at?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Dietrich was the factory called, but I overheard once called him, the director.</span> <span id="s298">Mr. Dietrich.</span> <span id="s299">And he was an older grey-haired gentleman.</span> <span id="s300">He was so nice.</span> <span id="s301">The good Germans were afraid.</span> <span id="s302">They couldn’t do anything, openly, to help, because their lives were at stake.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Do you have any idea what use was being made of the stuff you were making?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: At that time, no.</span> <span id="s305">We were just making cloth.</span> <span id="s306">Afterwards it was made into uniforms for the soldiers.</span> <span id="s307">Masks -- gas masks -- for the soldiers, and plastic gloves.</span> <span id="s308">I used to sew.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Where did you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: And what were those like?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: From ’42 to ’44 we had nice barracks, because they were new, but when we moved to Bernsdorf there was where the concentration camp really started.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Before we talk about Bernsdorf, let’s talk a bit more about the labor camp.</span> <span id="s314">What was your typical day like?</span> <span id="s315">How many hours did you work?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: A typical day was a day the same as the Christian day.</span> <span id="s317">But what we had to do more is, when it came like Saturday and Sunday when it was off, we had to clean.</span> <span id="s318">We had to clean our part of the factory up for the Monday day to start again.</span> <span id="s319">And they were going morning and night shift.</span> <span id="s320">The morning shift was from 6, I think to 2 or 3 o’clock, and then it went from 2 to 11.</span> <span id="s321">By the time we came, it was 12 and the night shift.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: And this labor camp was in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: How about food?</span> <span id="s325">Did they provide food and fire wood?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: We had a ration.</span> <span id="s327">We had in the morning, they gave us before we went to work, two sandwiches.</span> <span id="s328">One for breakfast and one for later on, it had to be lunch or supper.</span> <span id="s329">We could live on it.</span> <span id="s330">It wasn’t so bad.</span> <span id="s331">Me, being from a Hasidic home, a lot of things I didn’t eat because they were made out of blood, thickened blood, or other things.</span> <span id="s332">And then the meat -- if we had meat, it was horsemeat.</span> <span id="s333">But Jewish girls were cooking in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s334">So whatever the things, it had a little bit of Jewish taste in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: So you were in the labor camp for two years?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Yes, almost two years.</span> <span id="s337">Because in March I came to concentration camp. ’</span> <span id="s338">44.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: How did that come about?</span> <span id="s340">How did you hear about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Our director came and told us, when we gathered for whatever meal was at the time when we came from our shift.</span> <span id="s342">The director came and he told us that in order for us to stay alive, he is going to transfer us to Bernsdorf.</span> <span id="s343">But we did not know.</span> <span id="s344">I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s345">Maybe others knew through being with Czechs.</span> <span id="s346">But I was so naïve always, I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s347">I was a kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: You mean you were naïve about what was going to happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s350">I didn’t hear anything.</span> <span id="s351">Maybe it’s my nature.</span> <span id="s352">I make the best of each situation.</span> <span id="s353">My nature is, all my life, that I do mostly the best to my ability, and I have to challenge myself in my life, whatever I do.</span> <span id="s354">(Laughs0</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: So he said that in order for you to stay alive that he was going to have to take you.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: In order that we should remain, we had to be 300 or over, we cannot be any more 60 girls.</span> <span id="s357">We had to be a group of 300 or more.</span> <span id="s358">And he is going to transfer us to Bernsdorf.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: In order to work in the plant there would have to have been at least 300 girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: The small camps were already closed.</span> <span id="s361">There was no work to get there.</span> <span id="s362">The small factories -- I don’t know if they closed, but we couldn’t’ve been there any more 60 girls.</span> <span id="s363">The Jews had to be 300 and over -- concentrated!</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Were you the only people -- just the 60 of you that were working in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s366">We were the only 60 Jewish girls at this camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: So did he actually take you to Bernsdorf then?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: How did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: The S.S. came.</span> <span id="s371">Bernsdorf had already S.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: What time of day did that happen?</span> <span id="s373">How did the S.S. come?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: We were prepared, packed, whatever we had, and they transferred us to Bernsdorf.</span> <span id="s375">We came at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: That was in Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Czechoslovakia, too.</span> <span id="s378">It wasn’t so far.</span> <span id="s379">It must have been maybe 30, 40 kilometers.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: How’d you get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: By train, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: What kind of train?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: This I don’t even remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: And how long did it take to get to Bernsdorf?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: The whole day.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: And then what time of day did you arrive there?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: We arrived at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: And what happened next?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: I remember arriving at night, because there was a barracks already, a two room barracks for us, waiting.</span> <span id="s390">With one almost on top of the other, very close together.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Were there just the 60 of you to arrive?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: How were you processed or registered at the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: In the morning, we had to go into the factory.</span> <span id="s395">And when we went in in the factory, we had to be in the lines and counted, and we all had the numbers.</span> <span id="s396">I think its in Bernsdorf we got this political number.</span> <span id="s397">It was the Star, too, with this number.</span> <span id="s398">Everybody got a number and then this red triangle thing, and a yellow number over our triangle thing.</span> <span id="s399">And that’s all we were -- by numbers.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: So then what were the living conditions like in Bernsdorf?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: There it was horrible.</span> <span id="s402">I mean we all got half a loaf of bread for the whole week.</span> <span id="s403">And at night we got soup out of kohlrabi and potatoes.</span> <span id="s404">But this wasn’t it.</span> <span id="s405">There we realized what’s going on.</span> <span id="s406">Because to have 300 and we were at this camp with all the camps together.</span> <span id="s407">I think there were maybe 400 girls.</span> <span id="s408">And they brought girls from Auschwitz, with the striped clothes, with the shaved heads, skinny.</span> <span id="s409">When I talk about it, I get the goose pimples.</span> <span id="s410">And they told us the horrors.</span> <span id="s411">They told us that we can’t expect anything anymore.</span> <span id="s412">(Cries.</span> <span id="s413">Tape off0</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: What kind of building did you live in then in Bernsdorf?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: It was barracks.</span> <span id="s416">There were two rooms.</span> <span id="s417">One like a dining room, intimate, and everybody had those -- lockers -- type.</span> <span id="s418">And one room where the 60 girls were.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: These were all the same people that you --</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s421">I stayed with the same people until the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: You already mentioned something about other people in the camp were from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s423">And how about some of the others?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Hungarian girls, mostly -- the ones from Auschwitz came from Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Were there any other people in the camp that weren’t Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Not with us.</span> <span id="s427">We were fenced in.</span> <span id="s428">The Jews were always separated from the others, except in the factory, and in the factory, too, we were not allowed to talk to anybody -- in both camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: What acts were you witnessed to or aware of about systematic killings and fatalities from other causes in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Killings, I did not.</span> <span id="s431">We didn’t have any killings.</span> <span id="s432">Brutality, yes.</span> <span id="s433">But killings, no.</span> <span id="s434">The S.S. were brutal to us.</span> <span id="s435">We had to be very careful with everything.</span> <span id="s436">They had a slogan, if they caught somebody with something what they didn’t like, is that they’re not hurting them because they did something they didn’t like, they are hurting them because they got themselves caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Did you have any contact with relatives or friends during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s439">We didn’t know nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: Was there a means of communicating throughout the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: We did.</span> <span id="s442">We could talk to each other.</span> <span id="s443">We started to know approximately what’s going on and what is to be expected.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Were you aware of the on-going war effort at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: We were aware, because whenever the American military succeeded, we felt it.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: How was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Because they blamed us!</span> <span id="s448">(chuckles) Because the Americans were the Jews!</span> <span id="s449">And the Jews were succeeding!</span> <span id="s450">If they were succeeding, we were to blame.</span> <span id="s451">We felt it.</span> <span id="s452">We were antagonized, and we were hurt, because of the success of the allies.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: How often did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: In ’44 until liberation, very often.</span> <span id="s455">There wasn’t any rest, any tranquility, any nothing -- I didn’t know even how to express myself.</span> <span id="s456">We lived in fear.</span> <span id="s457">And nowhere where to go, because when the girls came from Auschwitz, they told us there’s nowhere where to go.</span> <span id="s458">There’s no escape.</span> <span id="s459">So it hurts me when it’s mentioned.</span> <span id="s460">There was nowhere, anywhere to do anything about it in this war.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Do you remember the names of the major German personnel at the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: No.</span> <span id="s463">I tell you what, I don’t even remember my liberation date.</span> <span id="s464">I don’t know if it’s psychologically I erased it, but I know that when the time came close, the S.S. slowly disappeared.</span> <span id="s465">And we were left alone.</span> <span id="s466">And all of a sudden, after a couple of days, the Czechs came -- a lot of Czech people came --to take some Jewish girls from Arnau, from our first camp.</span> <span id="s467">Came for a lot of Jewish girls, and I went with, because I had somebody in Arnau -- a family -- which is a story too big maybe to put on tape, where they helped me during the two years too.</span> <span id="s468">This is why I didn’t suffer any hunger.</span> <span id="s469">Maybe others were hungry, I was not.</span> <span id="s470">Because I was again lucky that I was placed to a machine with the manager’s wife, and she was the finest woman I could ever meet.</span> <span id="s471">They were childless.</span> <span id="s472">And she had such pity, she felt so sorry for me, that when we had morning shift, in the morning when she came, she put a sandwich with butter and things on top of the oiling board, and at night, before she left, she placed one.</span> <span id="s473">And when she went away, I picked it up and ate it.</span> <span id="s474">So when it was over, and we heard that it’s coming, the Russians are close -- we were liberated through the Russians – and when the Czechs came, I went to her -- to protect her in case the Russians would hurt her or something.</span> <span id="s475">And I stayed with them.</span> <span id="s476">So I don’t even remember any liberation day whatsoever.</span> <span id="s477">But I know one thing, when I came back, the Russians were as brutal as the Germans, because they raped.</span> <span id="s478">And a lot of the girls were raped until the high ranking officers in the Russian army realized what’s going on and put a stop to it.</span> <span id="s479">But in between, the few hours, lot of girls were raped.</span> <span id="s480">So when I came back to the camp, to Bernsdorf, from seeing that the Russians were not harming the German couple -- I had to pick up my pieces and went back o the camp and see what’s going on -- a lot of girls were heart-broken, crying, raped.</span> <span id="s481">A lot of them took advantage, found a lot of S.S. women --– and shaved their heads and made them clean their barracks.</span> <span id="s482">It was a mess!</span> <span id="s483">A different type of mess.</span> <span id="s484">But there, too, I didn’t stay long, because a truck came from Waldenburg, a truck with men and women.</span> <span id="s485">They were liberated a few days before us.</span> <span id="s486">And they knew that they had relatives in our camp.</span> <span id="s487">So when they came to our camp, I found out that my sister is alive.</span> <span id="s488">So I took whatever I had and I went with them to Waldenburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Who were these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Holocaust survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: And they had a truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: They had a truck from Germany to pick up their families.</span> <span id="s493">And this is how I found out that my sister is alive.</span> <span id="s494">And I went.</span> <span id="s495">Too much of my liberation day is erased completely from my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Just one more question about the camp.</span> <span id="s497">Do you remember any other specific units, either police or military that you came in contact with or heard about when you were at the camp.</span> <span id="s498">You talked about the S.S., but were there any others?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: The only thing was the S.S.</span> <span id="s500">We never had anything to do with the military, didn’t know anything about the military, except that we did sewing for them.</span> <span id="s501">We made the masks and gloves.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: That was at the labor camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: No, at Bernsdorf.</span> <span id="s504">When I came to Bernsdorf we went in in the line, and they asked occupations.</span> <span id="s505">And because we had at home a sewing machine, and my mother used to, as a child, let me fix sheets, I learned how to sew on the machine a straight stitch.</span> <span id="s506">So when I came to the line, and they asked my occupation, I told them that I am a seamstress, I know sewing.</span> <span id="s507">But being that I was a good spinner, they didn’t want to let me go to the sewing.</span> <span id="s508">So they put me to spinning paper.</span> <span id="s509">And it was horrible.</span> <span id="s510">And seeing the girls from Auschwitz, and knowing what’s going on, I didn’t care any more, and I didn’t want to do nothing any more.</span> <span id="s511">I let the machine go, and I didn’t work any more for them.</span> <span id="s512">So they were threatening me, to send me away and everything else.</span> <span id="s513">The spinmeister -- this is the foreman there – that I’m going to be sent away to Auschwitz, killed.</span> <span id="s514">But I didn’t care.</span> <span id="s515">So they put me in the sewing room.</span> <span id="s516">And there where I started to sew, there were a lot of girls, and it was clean and things.</span> <span id="s517">I had a beautiful voice, and it saved me too.</span> <span id="s518">The girls were singing, I’d sing with them.</span> <span id="s519">And finally, I didn’t give out the production, because I wasn’t a seamstress, and I didn’t know how to do it right, and in order to do it right, it took time.</span> <span id="s520">So the girls used to give me half-done and half undone, that I should be able to make production, that they shouldn’t send me out, and this is how I was saved.</span> <span id="s521">(Laughs) Just be singing my way through.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: So your sister survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s524">You see my father had a lot of German friends.</span> <span id="s525">And when they brought me to this big gulag, gathering, before I went to Arnau, before they picked the 60 girls, it was horrible there.</span> <span id="s526">The insects, the lice, one on top the other.</span> <span id="s527">The building maybe could hold, normally, 1,000 people.</span> <span id="s528">And there were 5,000 women.</span> <span id="s529">So we were walking, me and my girlfriends, and I heard over the loudspeaker that they are calling for somebody to clean the quarters.</span> <span id="s530">And I said to my girlfriend, let’s go, just to get out of this.</span> <span id="s531">So I go down -- God was with me, that’s all, I believe very strongly -- so I go down in the quarters, and we were cleaning.</span> <span id="s532">And in came three S.S. men, one guy close to seven feet.</span> <span id="s533">Big.</span> <span id="s534">And they started to ask me questions.</span> <span id="s535">So the big guy comes over to me and asks my name.</span> <span id="s536">And I told them.</span> <span id="s537">And he gave a scream.</span> <span id="s538">“Are you the Berish’s daughter?’</span> <span id="s539">I said, “Yes!”</span> <span id="s540">And he tells me a story that, “I used to come with my father to his house when he was older.”</span> <span id="s541">When finally he said to me what he can do for me.</span> <span id="s542">And at the time we were on the third story on the church floor.</span> <span id="s543">So my mother came to visit me.</span> <span id="s544">I used to yell.</span> <span id="s545">She didn’t hear me.</span> <span id="s546">She cried her heart.</span> <span id="s547">We couldn’t talk to each other.</span> <span id="s548">I said I would like to see my mother, because my father, at that time, he cried his heart out when they took my sister, but when they took me, he stopped work.</span> <span id="s549">He gave up and he stopped working.</span> <span id="s550">So my mother came to visit me.</span> <span id="s551">So I said I wanted to go home.</span> <span id="s552">He couldn’t let me go.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: This was at what time?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: I’m talking ’42.</span> <span id="s555">So this guy said, “What else can I do for you?”</span> <span id="s556">I says, “ You know, I have a sister in the camp.</span> <span id="s557">I would like to be with her.”</span> <span id="s558">He said, “Fine.”</span> <span id="s559">So, when the time came to go to her, four more S.S. went with.</span> <span id="s560">And I was afraid to go.</span> <span id="s561">I was afraid that he wouldn’t be able to save me.</span> <span id="s562">So I remained.</span> <span id="s563">And I didn’t go.</span> <span id="s564">What I’m saying is, my sister went through the horrors of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s565">She went through worse camps, not exactly death camps, but almost like it.</span> <span id="s566">They were beaten there, to death, in her camps.</span> <span id="s567">And because of the five S.S., I decided not to go.</span> <span id="s568">And I remained.</span> <span id="s569">This is a long answer to your question.</span> <span id="s570">(Laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: No, I’m glad I asked, because that was another element that we hadn’t talked about.</span> <span id="s572">I think it’s important.</span> <span id="s573">So after your camp was liberated by the Russians?</span> <span id="s574">Then you went back to Arnau?</span> <span id="s575">And then you came back to the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: Yeah, Bernsdorf.</span> <span id="s577">Then I went to Waldenburg, in the truck.</span> <span id="s578">And this was 120 kilometers away from the place my sister was, Pedesfaldo.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Was that the reason why you went there?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: Yes, to be closer to my sister.</span> <span id="s581">And then 3 more girls with me, walked the 120 kilometers.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: Which would be about how many miles?</span> <span id="s583">Tell me how long it took.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: What happened is, we started out early in the morning.</span> <span id="s585">And toward the evening, we did see Russians go through, but with the experience we had, we didn’t want to stop any Russians, so we pretended we don’t see them, and we walked.</span> <span id="s586">But toward the end, we saw a caravan with Russian soldiers, with horse and buggy, and we were so tired, so we decided the last horse and buggy, was older Russians, and we decided to stop them.</span> <span id="s587">They took us, and after a few kilometers, they stopped the caravan, and one, the leader of this caravan, a Russian, came over to me, to our things.</span> <span id="s588">I was always a big kid, a fat kid, but with as much weight as I lost, I was still heavier than the rest of the other people, because I had something --to lose – so he came over, I was always good looking, so he came over to me.</span> <span id="s589">He put a hand on me, and I threw it off.</span> <span id="s590">Finally he got really mad.</span> <span id="s591">And he was scarred and mean.</span> <span id="s592">He said, “ If she is not going to go with me, I’m going to kill her!”</span> <span id="s593">in Russian.</span> <span id="s594">And because he must have been a Ukrainian, I understood what he said.</span> <span id="s595">And we decided to jump the wagon when it started out.</span> <span id="s596">So we slept over the night, and then we started.</span> <span id="s597">It took us two days, almost to get to my sister’s.</span> <span id="s598">Almost two days.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: Did you know if she was alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s601">This is why.</span> <span id="s602">I knew that she’s alive, because the people who came with the truck told me that she’s alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: Were these people from your hometown?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: No, but they were together in the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: So then how did you find your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: I knew where she is, in Bedeslavda, so once we came to Bedeslavda -- as soon you went in in town -- I resembled my sister -- and people were wild, asking questions, “Where are you from?</span> <span id="s607">Do you know my sister?</span> <span id="s608">Do you know my relatives?</span> <span id="s609">Did you hear anything?”</span> <span id="s610">This is how we found each other, as much as we could.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: So what happened after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: After that, I came closer where she lived.</span> <span id="s613">They brought me there, and when people came to tell her that I am coming, and she walked down the stairs, I didn’t recognize her.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: So did you return to your pre-war home?</span> <span id="s615">What had happened to your home in that small Polish town?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: It was the southern part of Germany, and we were in the northern part.</span> <span id="s617">So this was now Poland, occupied by the Russians.</span> <span id="s618">So when we went to my hometown, our Christian next door neighbor took over our home, and didn’t even let me in -- even to take a look.</span> <span id="s619">And the killings there were terrible, because they were afraid that the ones who survived are going to take back the things what the Polish people have.</span> <span id="s620">So they killed a lot of Jews off there, too, after the war.</span> <span id="s621">I stayed in Sosnowiec with my cousin for a while and we went back to Bedeslavda and from there we went to Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: How’d you happen to decide to go to Munch?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: Because we heard that my mother’s sister’s husband is alive, and that he’s in Feldafing, by Munich.</span> <span id="s624">So we smuggled through -- with bottles of Vodka -- through the Russian borders.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: On a wagon or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: No, there were trains going.</span> <span id="s627">Cattle trains and other trains going back and forth.</span> <span id="s628">And it took days and days to smuggle, and to go through the borders, until we came to Munich -- to the American zone.</span> <span id="s629">And there was a different life -- completely different.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: How so?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: The freedom!</span> <span id="s632">And I’ll never forget, when I met a Negro soldier and I got so scared.</span> <span id="s633">For the first time in my life I saw a Negro soldier.</span> <span id="s634">(Laughs) But it was the freedom there.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: So you stayed with your uncle then, near Munich?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: Yes, Feldafing, for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: Did you look for your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: We did look, but there was…the news traveled fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: Did you work there then?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: No.</span> <span id="s641">There were the D.P. camps.</span> <span id="s642">Munich was a D.P. camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: And how long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: There we were until March, ’46.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: Was there any question of choosing Palestine or the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: Yes, I always wanted to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s647">But each time I started out, we were sent back.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: You were sent back?</span> <span id="s649">By who?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Caught.</span> <span id="s651">They didn’t let us in.</span> <span id="s652">We tried in the beginning, smuggling, to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: How far did you get?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: We went through the Austrian mountains to Italy.</span> <span id="s655">(Laughs) and there we were caught and sent back.</span> <span id="s656">I never wanted to come to this blessed country of ours (Laughs) because everybody thought that everybody’s rich here, and after a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s657">I didn’t want to look up to anybody any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: Did any organizations help you during this time that you were in Munich?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: The UNRRA.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: And how’d you come to the United States and to Minnesota then?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: We moved to Frankfort.</span> <span id="s662">And by me marrying two brothers -- this is my second marriage – my first marriage, one brother wanted to go to America so bad, was money-hungry, and I couldn’t say or do anything, so we came.</span> <span id="s663">This is a very long story, which I’m writing about it, too.</span> <span id="s664">This is how I came to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Do you maintain contact with the Jewish community here?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: Very much so.</span> <span id="s667">I am 100% American.</span> <span id="s668">I gave three gallons blood.</span> <span id="s669">I counseled for the Youth Emergency Service.</span> <span id="s670">I was president in Sisterhood.</span> <span id="s671">I am a three-generation life member in Hadassah, a life member in Mizrachi, a life member in Pioneer Women.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: Do you maintain contact with other survivors, or any other survivor organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: I am very disturbed with survivor organizations, and with the survivors too, because I don’t know where they are really going, and what makes them do the things I feel that’s so unjust.</span> <span id="s674">They are not connecting the Holocaust with Israel, that because of the Holocaust of the 6,000,000 Jews and because of our homelessness, we have Israel.</span> <span id="s675">They refuse to recognize it.</span> <span id="s676">And this is why I lost the desire to be in contact with anybody.</span> <span id="s677">I don’t know who’s doing it is in this community, but I walked out once of a Holocaust Commemoration meeting because Dora Zaidenweber said to me, “ Maybe in 1985, we’ll connect.’</span> <span id="s678">First she said it’s political, and I don’t know where the political is, and what she has in mind, and how.</span> <span id="s679">But for some reason she took it over and made it hers.</span> <span id="s680">I’m glad that I have the opportunity to mention it.</span> <span id="s681">I got from Michael Greenberg, a letter with that professor from the University -- whatever his name is -- he’s in charge of the Holocaust thing what we are doing now.</span> <span id="s682">The oral history project.</span> <span id="s683">And he once said to me that it isn’t so, because the Zionist organization would have got Israel.</span> <span id="s684">And this is such a bunch of baloney.</span> <span id="s685">And he should know it, because he’s a professor.</span> <span id="s686">(Laughs) And it’s the truth.</span> <span id="s687">It’s a fact!</span> <span id="s688">It’s a fact that because of the Holocaust and our homelessness that we got Israel returned to us.</span> <span id="s689">So why shouldn’t our parents and 6,000,000 Jews get credit for it?</span> <span id="s690">They deserve it.</span> <span id="s691">I’m so disturbed!</span> <span id="s692">The film which was shown on Channel 2.</span> <span id="s693">Breaking the Silence: Second Generation -- they had children of Holocaust survivors -- Holocaust survivors who were once married, and they lost their first families, and got remarried and had children -- young children, children with a generation gap, worse than anybody else’s.</span> <span id="s694">And they blame their parents because of their failures in their life -- because they went with the generation gap trend, and with their lifestyle, and who knows what, drugs or whatever else, in the 60s and 70s, and blaming the silence of their parents, that they silenced the Holocaust!</span> <span id="s695">My children have asked me about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s696">If they wanted to know, they knew!</span> <span id="s697">It’s ugly!</span> <span id="s698">And this they bring on television to make me feel bad!</span> <span id="s699">There is more survivors like me than the older survivors who had already families and lost their families.</span> <span id="s700">So I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s701">This is why I try to stay away!</span> <span id="s702">And I’m so anxious to pursue it with my life story, with my findings.</span> <span id="s703">And I am very active in the community.</span> <span id="s704">I was always active and I’m still active.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: You mentioned that one TV program.</span> <span id="s706">How about other films or books that you’ve seen about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s707">Would you recommend any of those?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: Yes, they are true.</span> <span id="s709">They are true.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: Any particular ones that stand out in your mind -- books or films or TV programs?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: I tell you the truth: that I myself don’t watch them and don’t read them because I feel that those are the books and those are the movies for the ones who didn’t live through it.</span> <span id="s712">I lived it through.</span> <span id="s713">All my life I was very emotional -- and nightmares.</span> <span id="s714">And my kids lived with me through, because they had to wake me up from screams, during the night, thinking that I might get a heart attack, screaming from a nightmare and the fear.</span> <span id="s715">Those are for people who didn’t live through it.</span> <span id="s716">And it should be shown.</span> <span id="s717">And it should be taught.</span> <span id="s718">And it should never be forgotten.</span> <span id="s719">Not just for the Jews, but for mankind.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: So you haven’t read or seen any films except for that one?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: I don’t watch.</span> <span id="s722">My husband watched.</span> <span id="s723">I learned how to turn myself off so beautifully.</span> <span id="s724">My mind and body is under my control.</span> <span id="s725">And I know how to adjust myself to those things.</span> <span id="s726">(Laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: Has your belief or practice in Judaism or a Supreme Being changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: Yes, very much so.</span> <span id="s729">Because I feel -- and this is what I’m going to write about -- my learnings from the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s730">I feel that Judaism was meant with righteousness, not religion.</span> <span id="s731">It was turned into a religion and left the righteous part out.</span> <span id="s732">We are becoming very selfish and not suffering.</span> <span id="s733">I believe it’s God’s will.</span> <span id="s734">And I believe that because we did not see to it, to prevent things, things happened to us.</span> <span id="s735">And we are still not doing it.</span> <span id="s736">Because a Jew was never a Jew first.</span> <span id="s737">They were all nationalities, but not Jewish -- until the Christians made them Jews.</span> <span id="s738">And if we are going to realize that we have to be Jews first and realize that in 1947 Israel made us honorable Jews and give them the credit, and see that we have Israel -- strong -- that in case something ever should happen, it won’t happen, because there will be a place where to go and be safe.</span> <span id="s739">There, where God will help us.</span> <span id="s740">But if we are going to overlook our second comings, then we are not worth it, nothing</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: That leads me to this next question.</span> <span id="s742">Can you tell me what it has meant to you to be a survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: To me, it’s meant a survivor is; that I was saved with a purpose in my life.</span> <span id="s744">But I have never been given here, in this community, the chance of expressing it and pursuing it.</span> <span id="s745">Whatever I am doing, I am doing with my strong will and determination.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: If you can, after your experience during the Holocaust, could you please explain or describe to me you’re general feeling about human nature, non-Jews and Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: I feel we are all born with an Eichmann in us.</span> <span id="s748">We are not born all good.</span> <span id="s749">The goodness has to come.</span> <span id="s750">And we have to work with it.</span> <span id="s751">And if we let the bad take the goodness over, then we are not human.</span> <span id="s752">I feel that’s it our determination.</span> <span id="s753">It’s us.</span> <span id="s754">We let it go thousands of years ago, and it became a disease.</span> <span id="s755">We brought the disease unto/upon ourselves.</span> <span id="s756">And it started with the destruction of the Temple.</span> <span id="s757">And it started with making Jesus a god, with us letting this happen, because of fear.</span> <span id="s758">We always had the fear.</span> <span id="s759">And if, confronting Jesus and seeing what he had to say, and what he had to do, believe us as Canaanites, or whatever it was at that time, disregarding the whole situation.</span> <span id="s760">So, who made Jesus god?</span> <span id="s761">Because we didn’t look into him, he was made into god.</span> <span id="s762">But if he was right in his way, or in some of the things, if he could heal, if he could do something for the poor people, and for the people who needed him, it should have been confronted right away and looked into.</span> <span id="s763">And now we have to work with the truth.</span> <span id="s764">We have to seek.</span> <span id="s765">Israel is our self.</span> <span id="s766">And I believe from there, from Jerusalem, will come the peace.</span> <span id="s767">From there will peace come.</span> <span id="s768">And not just by God.</span> <span id="s769">Because God says, in my opinion, the way I was raised, that you do, and I shall help you.</span> <span id="s770">He didn’t give us nothing on a silver platter!</span> <span id="s771">He gave us this world that we should do it.</span> <span id="s772">And we should make it into what we want to.</span> <span id="s773">When we want it good, it will be good.</span> <span id="s774">And if not, it will be destroyed.</span> <span id="s775">But it’s up to us, not to God.</span> <span id="s776">And He is here to help us.</span> <span id="s777">And there is the truth.</span> <span id="s778">There is the archeological things if we are going to support it.</span> <span id="s779">And if we are going to see that the places where we can be digged and can be, there is being so much done, that the truth will come out!</span></p> <p><span id="s780">I do have tapes which I spoke for the International embassy for Jerusalem, and I told them the same things.</span> <span id="s781">I feel, deep in my heart Jesus did not want to change the religion.</span> <span id="s782">The followers did, and made us Jews and Christians.</span> <span id="s783">We were Israelites at the time.</span> <span id="s784">And something has to be done.</span> <span id="s785">I know it can’t come overnight, but if we are going to work to it, Israel is going to be strong.</span> <span id="s786">And if Israel is going to be under Israeli occupation -- the truth will have to come from them -- the religious truth.</span> <span id="s787">History!</span> <span id="s788">Not the religion.</span> <span id="s789">History will have to come out from there.</span> <span id="s790">And we will have to unite, and work to a common goal, before the non-believers will destroy us.</span> <span id="s791">This is my feeling.</span> <span id="s792">And this is my main concern and my teachings from the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: Well, I think we’ve covered all the questions that I had on my list, unless there was anything that you needed to ask.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: Once I get excited my mind drifts off.</span> <span id="s795">But my main concern is Israel.</span> <span id="s796">My main concern is religion.</span> <span id="s797">And my main concern is to try to unite ourselves.</span> <span id="s798">And peace and love and understanding.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: You stated it all very well.</span> <span id="s800">This concludes the interview with Libby Rosenzweig on June 14, 1984 for the JCRC-ADL Holocaust Oral History Project.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s802">PAGE 20</span></p> <p><span id="s803">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s804">PAGE 20</span></p></body></html>
