tape number one, side A.</span> <span id="s13">If you would just begin by telling me your name, and when and where you were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Answer: I am Gisela Zamora.</span> <span id="s15">I was born -- my maiden name was Eckstain, in Battenberg unda Aida in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: And tell me a little bit about Battenberg, and your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: My mother’s family had lived in Battenberg at least for two or three generations.</span> <span id="s18">They were known as the Lanksdorfs.</span> <span id="s19">My mother was a born Neuberger, and sh -- I’m sorry, she was an -- a born Marx, and the Neubergers married a Lanksdorf, and the children all came, more or less from that family.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: And what was -- what is -- can you describe Battenberg for somebody who’s never --</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: Battenberg is a beautiful little i -- town, it’s actually a village located at 800 meters elevation, and was considered in Germany sort of a spa, what they called Luftcore art.</span> <span id="s22">And it had approximately, I would say, seven or eight Jewish families.</span> <span id="s23">My grandfather Marx, Moses Marx, came from the Rhineland, Achen, and established himself there, married my grandmother, and had a -- a shoe business.</span> <span id="s24">He sold sh -- shoes all over the area.</span> <span id="s25">He went by bicycle many times, and we had the -- a regular store at the bottom of our building, which was quite big.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: So this sounds like a very small Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Very small Jewish community, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: And did you know everyone, all the families?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: We knew everyone, and some were even interrelated.</span> <span id="s30">I’m in touch with the second cousin, that lives across the river, in nua -- Nyack, and we see each other occasionally.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: So tell me a little bit about -- I -- I remember you mentioned your father’s work.</span> <span id="s32">What -- what was your father’s work?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Yeah, my fa -- my mother was introduced to my father, she was a youngest daughter of some Marx’s, they had six children, three boys, and three girls, and she was the youngest, and felt after my grandfather passed away, she had to take care of her mother, Beena Marx.</span> <span id="s34">And Sevra stayed in Battenberg.</span> <span id="s35">My father was born in Fleet bachin Hesse, sort of a s -- bigger town, which was what you call a Christstadt in German.</span> <span id="s36">And he went to a technical school to learn agronomy.</span> <span id="s37">And he was employed by a man named Louie Marx, who was my mother’s brother.</span> <span id="s38">Ne -- not Louie Marx himself, but his -- his firma, which was at that time called Deutsch and Marx or something like that, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s39">And Louie Marx took my father once up to Battenberg, and this way my mother met him, and they became engaged, and married in 1926.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: So tell me about you.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: So my father, who was an academic man, had during the early years a very good job with the Whymara government, inst -- instructing the farmers how to slaughter, when to slaughter, the right time to sow, or to reap, because Germany was very much interested in having a good agricultural f -- f -- what you would call a method, to feed it’s people without too much imports at that time.</span> <span id="s42">But in 1933, when Hitler came to power, my father lost his job, because he was government employed.</span> <span id="s43">And he took over my fath -- my grandfather’s shoe business, but at that time already, it was going downhill, and he couldn’t really make a very good living from that.</span> <span id="s44">So this went through a couple of months, even I would say a year or two, and the anti-Semitism came to Battenberg very early.</span> <span id="s45">It was really a nest -- I call it a real nest of Nazis, and trying to get rid of all the Jews, and specially confiscate their business.</span> <span id="s46">So my mo -- my father decided it was better for him, and for us, for the family, to move to Friedberg where his parents had a home.</span> <span id="s47">At that time in the Judengasser, which was at -- at very early times in the 16th century, ghetto.</span> <span id="s48">But it was quite a nice little street, the houses were one on the -- one on the other, and we had the three floor house, my father put in plumbing, which by that time they didn’t have there.</span> <span id="s49">And we children, I had a brother by the way, his name was Norbert, who was born two years after me, in 1930, went to school in Bard Nowheim, which was a spa approximately three kilometers from Friedberg and had a Jewish cabearks -- ca -- gaminda shula, excuse me.</span> <span id="s50">A -- a s -- a school that took in all the children from the surrounding area.</span> <span id="s51">It was located in a beautiful area, and had very good reputation as a -- a school of first class.</span> <span id="s52">And we went to this school till 1938, I would say -- ’39, I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Do you mind if I back up for a moment?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: I wanted to ask you, just in brief, to describe the personalities of your family.</span> <span id="s56">Your parents, and you had one sibling, your brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s58">Well, unfortunately we were children, didn’t realize the difficult times my parents went through, especially raising us, bringing in the money to send us to school, and to feed us and so on.</span> <span id="s59">My mother was very fragile, but my father was a very strong man.</span> <span id="s60">He was an officer in the first World War, so he was wounded, and had a paralysis on the right hand, and the right arm was completely stiff.</span> <span id="s61">He was wonderful, he was able to do everything with his left.</span> <span id="s62">And made sure that we children go to school, was -- got very disciplined, and my mother sort of was weak in this.</span> <span id="s63">And we -- when we wanted something, we always went to our father, especially me.</span> <span id="s64">I cannot talk to -- about my -- my brother, we sort of at that time were very young, and had many little fights, or spats, I would call them.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: And you remember Battenberg even though you were young, you remember living there?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: I remember very much living there, and I loved the area, because it’s in a what’s called Throwtargabeerga in German, and on the Aida, which was the biggest -- had the biggest dam, about 10 kilometers away in Germany.</span> <span id="s67">As a matter of fact, it was just finished when Hitler was in power, and he made a lot of propaganda for it.</span> <span id="s68">He wanted to imitate the Hoover dam at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: Did you have also, non-Jewish friends there?</span> <span id="s70">It --</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Definitely.</span> <span id="s72">I have a non-Jewish friend who is writing me regularly, we are in contact.</span> <span id="s73">But we only got in contact three years ago when I went back to Battenberg just to see the town, and I didn’t recognize it, it had changed so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: But you also -- you also remember anti-Semitic incidents?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Very -- yes.</span> <span id="s76">The one thing we had there, we had a neighbor who was -- his name was George, I don’t remember his last name, he threw stones into our windows all the time, and we had constantly to repair windows.</span> <span id="s77">They were -- and we children were persecuted.</span> <span id="s78">We had to walk approximately one and a half miles to school, I would say, since we lived on the upper part of the town, and the ch -- the school was in the lower part.</span> <span id="s79">So children were already throwing stones at us, and we were ostracized.</span> <span id="s80">As a matter of fact, at the end they put us in the back row in school, next to the Gypsies.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: And did you feel -- you were very young, I mean, maybe you can remind me how old you were by the time you left Battenberg, but you -- you felt this impending persecution.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: I felt this very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: I -- I -- I felt this per -- persecution, and an incident happened, I should really not tell this here, but it’s -- since these Gypsies sat next to us, there were two boys, they all the time exposed themselves towards us, and played around with their sex organ, and that left a terrible impression on me all my life.</span> <span id="s85">And there was one Jewish -- one non-Jewish boy, who was the son of the physician in the town, who went up to the teacher and told her, and she actually did nothing about it, because she was part of the Nazi party.</span> <span id="s86">But my father realized it’s time that we have to go.</span> <span id="s87">And since our immigration was pulled here, and pulled there, because of my father’s injury during the first World War, it was s -- rejected by the US at that time, and we tried other countries, and you needed an awful lot of money, and since my father was not employed since 1933, it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s88">We lived really, on a very wealthy aunt, who send us money and -- and bought us clothing, and helped us all along, as long as she could.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: How old were you when you left Battenberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: 10 years.</span> <span id="s91">Wait a minute, yes, I was born twen -- 10 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: So at that time your family was aware enough of what was happening, or what seemed to be happening, to try to emigrate, to try to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: And -- and couldn’t, and then the next step was to go --</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: To Friedberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: To Friedberg.</span> <span id="s97">So what are your memories of living there?</span> <span id="s98">How different was it from Battenberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: It was much more -- less tense, and much more liberal in a way.</span> <span id="s100">And there were a couple of half Jewish people, families, that helped us during the night.</span> <span id="s101">We had -- my father was a -- a -- a -- a special person to an old woman, who was in her 70’s at that time.</span> <span id="s102">She came in the middle of the night to bring us some food.</span> <span id="s103">She was very di -- attached to my father.</span> <span id="s104">And the town itself is larger, it’s like White Plains, New York.</span> <span id="s105">As a matter of -- see, it was a -- it’s county seats -- the county seat of Hesse, Nassaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Tell --</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Actually Hesse, not Nassaw, Hesse.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Tell me a little bit about your family’s connection to holidays, religious holidays.</span> <span id="s109">How -- how was that in your home, was that --</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: My mother was very observant of the Jewish laws, and she cooked kosher, and ub -- I would not say that it was overly kosher, but my father was very much on the other side, since he used to go to farmers, and they used to give him pork and sausages when he was an agronomist and worked for the government.</span> <span id="s111">So he didn’t believe in any of these dietary laws.</span> <span id="s112">And sometimes he took us children along, and we tasted pork, and he said, “Don’t tell your mom.”</span> <span id="s113">The first thing when we came into the house, naturally children say, “Do you know where we went?</span> <span id="s114">Daddy took us to this and this farmer, and we had a wonderful bratwurst.”</span> <span id="s115">And my mother almost exploded.</span> <span id="s116">But those were incidents that were still pretty good.</span> <span id="s117">And i -- when we were then in Friedberg, my father had a lot of friends.</span> <span id="s118">School friends, and he was a good athlete.</span> <span id="s119">He used to play very good football, and he used to belong to a league, and some of the Germans that tried to contact us -- or contact him, did so.</span> <span id="s120">But it got less and less as time goes on.</span> <span id="s121">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: And tell me -- and tell me a little bit also about -- about religious holidays for your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: And your favorite ones, what -- what you remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: I don’t know if they didn’t leave any spa -- the favorite one was probably Passover.</span> <span id="s126">Well, naturally Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s127">At that time I was too immature to know what it is.</span> <span id="s128">Now, in my old age, I’m searching for my background, and for different, and look into different religions, and I’m comparing it to, specially Yoga, Redunta and Buddhism.</span> <span id="s129">I’m very much into that right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: So -- so now your family -- and tell me the year when you moved to -- to Friedberg, tell me also about you going to school in -- in Friedberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: We -- we -- well, we went to school in Bad Nauheim, we took the train every morning, which was only 10 minutes.</span> <span id="s132">And the schools there was also a children’s home, where children who -- who pa -- whose parents were already separated, or immigrated someplace.</span> <span id="s133">It had a children’s home, but at the same time it took all the children by -- how would you call it, coming there from the surrounding area.</span> <span id="s134">You didn’t have to live in this children’s home to go to that school.</span> <span id="s135">It was called the besere -- Bitseerik shula.</span> <span id="s136">That means of the whole county, Jewish children could come by train, by bus, whatever.</span> <span id="s137">And I remember I have a very good friend, Eva Forest, whose -- whose maiden name was Warburg.</span> <span id="s138">She was brought by limousine still, since she was a relative of the Warburgs, a wealthy Jewish family.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: And when was this?</span> <span id="s140">What year now?</span> <span id="s141">A: I would say it was ’38, ’39 and maybe beginning of ’40, but then they closed that school, the Nazis closed the school, and if you wanted to further our e-education, we had to get to Frankfurt amine.</span> <span id="s142">So through the joint Jewish community of the German gu -- [indecipherable] German Reich, at that time, made sure that children that didn’t have the means to lodge there, to place them in homes, and also children’s homes.</span> <span id="s143">And I would say we went there in beginning of ’40 for about a year and a half, which was a wonderful experience.</span> <span id="s144">Frankfurt is a big city, very liberal for German standards.</span> <span id="s145">It was always against the -- the Kaiser, and had some prominent non-Nazis.</span> <span id="s146">So some of the Jewish institutions were still working, and one of them is the philanthrop -- was the philanthropine, the school that was boser [indecipherable] and a -- a part of the school taught even in English, you could get your diploma in English, and regular German folkshula.</span> <span id="s147">Ma -- my husband, by the way, has a diploma, or let’s say high school f -- liseum diploma from philanthropine in Frankfurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: Oh he --</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: He was several years older than I was, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: So you never met there?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: No, never.</span> <span id="s152">He was seven years older than I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: So we’re already up to 1940, it sounds like.</span> <span id="s154">Can we go back for a moment, and can you tell me did you -- do you have recollections in 1938 of Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Oh definitely, I remember that, and so well.</span> <span id="s156">In the morning they came for my father, and he was rounded up with a lot of men to Buchenwald, which we later found out that, we didn’t know at that time.</span> <span id="s157">And my mother, since we had that three story building, had a big attic, my mother put us all the way up into the attic, and said, “You be very quiet when they come here.”</span> <span id="s158">And they did come, but they never went the s -- above the second floor, but they threw out all our -- my mother had a lot of miesen, and porc -- other porcelain, crystal, threw it out of the windows.</span> <span id="s159">Demolished the dining room, and living room, sort of furniture threw out of the window.</span> <span id="s160">But physically we were not apprehended, because first of all they never knew where we children were, and weren’t interested.</span> <span id="s161">And my mother, I have no recollection where she stayed.</span> <span id="s162">She must have stayed on the third floor also, and just watched.</span> <span id="s163">But my father was gone for about four and a half weeks, till he came back from Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s164">And I remember my mother preparing a bath for him.</span> <span id="s165">At that time we didn’t have bathrooms like here, except we had a flush toilet.</span> <span id="s166">And she made hot water in a sink ba -- basin, and washed my father from top to head, because he was smelling so much.</span> <span id="s167">And the -- we continued to live in Friedberg during all this time, going to school in Frankfurt, and my parents living in Friedberg, coming occasionally to Frankfurt to visit us, to see how we are doing.</span> <span id="s168">And also on vacation time we went home.</span> <span id="s169">And in 1940, or ’41 -- I have a friend who could -- who knows the exact date, but I don’t -- I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: That’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: The schools were closed, all Jewish schools, all education to all J-Jewish people was -- was eliminated.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: How did you -- how did you feel not only then, but also after Kristallnacht, after what your father went through, how do you remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: -- personally feeling?</span> <span id="s175">Did you feel that things were getting worse?</span> <span id="s176">How did you feel about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: I did not realize this, and we were too young to realize it.</span> <span id="s178">I was barely 14, my brother was 12.</span> <span id="s179">So we felt it in a way, but not really that it -- it harmed us in a way.</span> <span id="s180">We still had Jewish children to play with, till later on everybody immigrated and very few children were left.</span> <span id="s181">That was the greatest thing that I feel now is that was very sad, that I had nobody to play with, to talk to.</span> <span id="s182">Only my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: When did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: During the year ’40, ’41, that was sad time, and people still could immigrate.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: So do you remember your father telling you about what happened at Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: Never, never, he -- they were absolutely don’t tell the children.</span> <span id="s187">My mother and my father kept this from us.</span> <span id="s188">They were very protective.</span> <span id="s189">I would never have known.</span> <span id="s190">I didn’t know till I myself ended up in Auschwitz, how these things might have been.</span> <span id="s191">The one thing that happened during that time, my father was one of 12 children, and he had a brother, the oldest brother really, who was married to a non-Jew, because he learned watch making in Switzerland, and he met this woman, and got her pregnant, and my grandfather insi -- my grandmother insisted on him marrying this girl.</span> <span id="s192">And she came to us in 19 -- goes back to 1920 -- ’28, I guess.</span> <span id="s193">I wasn’t even born yet.</span> <span id="s194">So she was part of the family, and he was with my f -- my uncle was with my father in Buchenwald, and he was the first one to be killed there.</span> <span id="s195">They send his ashes to his wife, who was Swiss born, and all her children, the children that they had, had half Swiss citizenship, so they couldn’t do anything to them, they survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: And did you hear at the time how he was killed, or what happened?</span> <span id="s197">A: Yes, somehow or other we heard about it, as -- as children, but it didn’t make much impression.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: I mean, it seems like you were still young enough that you didn’t really know how to understand all these things happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: That’s right, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: And school was generally -- when you were still in school, was it a good and positive --</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: A very positive experience, because I was with only Jewish children.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: And did you still have non-Jewish friends otherwise, at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: No, not -- not at that time any more.</span> <span id="s204">A-Also, there was a half-Jewish couple, he was non-Jewish, and she was Jewish, but they were -- were Communists, very Leftist, and he was, at one time in the Wymar Republic, like a delegate to the Congress in Berlin.</span> <span id="s205">And they came to see us, and he was not afraid.</span> <span id="s206">He was a non-Jew, his wife was a Jewish woman.</span> <span id="s207">He was not afraid of them, and he had many bouts with them -- the Nazis and at the end he was also brought to Dachau, but he survived.</span> <span id="s208">And I lived with them till I came to this country.</span> <span id="s209">To -- with him, his wife was killed.</span> <span id="s210">But that’s after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Okay, so you were going to school in Frankfurt, your family was still living in Freidburg at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: And you were not separated from them, or you were, you were living with another family?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: I wa -- at first I was in the children’s home, and then they placed us in families, because they -- they had such an overflow in the kinderheim, that they had to take -- they had to get Jewish family that had enough room, were wealthy, to take in some of these children.</span> <span id="s215">So I came to one wealthy family in the west end of Frankfurt who owned a -- a palatial home, which was naturally confiscated while I was there, by the Nazis, and they had -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Gisela Zamora.</span> <span id="s217">This is tape one, side B. Okay, continue to tell me about the family you were living with.</span> <span id="s218">Also, will you tell me --</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Say --</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: -- when this was, and how long you were separated from your own family, not living with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Well, I was never separated really, only by small distances at that time.</span> <span id="s222">I still could go home.</span> <span id="s223">It meant you had to take a train from Frankfurt to Friedberg, which was possible.</span> <span id="s224">Even so, we were -- we wore the star, the yellow star already, and we had to be s-sitting in a certain compartment.</span> <span id="s225">And it was very shameful for us kids, somehow.</span> <span id="s226">I mean, we were a little bit intimidated, sitting where we were sitting.</span> <span id="s227">And -- but what I remember about this family is they had a housekeeper who came from Battenberg, and she had a terrible nervous condition, and shook with her hands, and her head, and this is now coming into my mind when I think about myself getting old, and sometimes I have these anxiety attacks, and I start to shake a little bit, and that brings me back to that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Selma Lermenstein.</span> <span id="s230">I don’t think she survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: So this family, their home was confiscated, what did you think at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: They went to Theresienstadt where we were transported at that time too, in 1942.</span> <span id="s233">But before that, they already -- since the schools were closed, they already were placed in a -- an -- an old age home, more or less, and I don’t know what happened to Selma Lermenst-stein.</span> <span id="s234">We children came back home, and waited for deportation.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: And what do you remember, when did you start -- when did you need -- when were you forced to wear the -- the Star of David, the -- and it was a yellow?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: It was yellow star, with black rim.</span> <span id="s237">Well we -- we had to, as soon as we went to school in Bad Nauheim, already we had that ta -- I think in 1939, right away when this -- before the war yet.</span> <span id="s238">I would say ’39, after the war with Poland had started.</span> <span id="s239">It came slowly, everything came slowly.</span> <span id="s240">My mother had to part with her fur coat, with her silver, and her jewelry.</span> <span id="s241">Every year there was, or every couple of months there was a raid that you had to bring certain things for the possible war that they are going to fight against the allies.</span> <span id="s242">And this was a very hard thing for my mother, to -- dawa -- to part with material possessions.</span> <span id="s243">I think I learned from that.</span> <span id="s244">I am giving away already now many of my possessions, and I am very grateful that I had a husband who made good money during his career, and I had a nice home, but I know that I will have to leave it, and I’m trying to learn non-attachment to material things.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Did your -- did you -- did you learn very much about the beginning of the war in Poland?</span> <span id="s246">What did you learn, and -- and when?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: We -- we weren’t allowed to listen to any foreign stations, but this Communist, this -- who was married to a Jewish wife, used to come and tell my father what was said, because he was listening clandestinely, apparently, in -- in a group of people, and used to tell him what happened.</span> <span id="s248">But at that time the Germans made big progress into Poland, then into France, and by that time a lot of Jews were already deported to the east, and we were lucky to be there yet till ’40 -- lucky?</span> <span id="s249">I wouldn’t say lucky -- till September ’42, when we were rounded up.</span> <span id="s250">And as I said, our luck was that my father was an officer in the first World War, and he had the Purple Cross, the German ahtler, and whe -- we were privileged to go to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s251">And needless to say, for my parents it was a very terrible thing, but we children didn’t realize what it meant for them.</span> <span id="s252">We came to Theresienstadt, and we saw a lot of children, and we were able to play, and congregate with them, and that was very important for my psyche, because I was so excommunicated from -- from children in Germany, let’s say, or separated.</span> <span id="s253">I don’t find the right word I want to express.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: So you -- you actually felt initially, when you were at Theresienstadt that things felt a little bit better for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: Mu -- yes, better for me, and at -- the good thing was that my father, since he was also an academic, and he had a background in the Whymara government that he got a job in the Judenrat in Theresienstadt, which was a big privilege.</span> <span id="s256">Also, he was a very minor, minor official.</span> <span id="s257">My mother used to say he probably has to sweep the floors of the -- of the Judenrat, of the bigshots there.</span> <span id="s258">That’s about all that -- but that enabled him for us, between my brother and myself, to get us into kinderheim.</span> <span id="s259">At first we thought we both were going to go to the kinderheim, but somehow or other there was such an overflow of children they didn’t have enough room, so we had to choose between -- my parents had to choose between my brother and myself, and they decided that I should go to the kinderheim.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Do you know why they decided that?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: I have no idea, my -- I -- I couldn’t get along with my mother so well, like girls do with -- sometimes, with mothers.</span> <span id="s262">My father thought that I was the older one, that I should go.</span> <span id="s263">That was actually for me a wonderful experience, since food was naturally the first thing on our mind, but being with the same group of people, being able to communicate it, to learn.</span> <span id="s264">Because in the kinderheim, every room had a sort of a teacher that had to keep us busy.</span> <span id="s265">And I remembered we had a girl named Hoyman -- Eta Hoyman, she was very well known in Germany in the Zionist movement.</span> <span id="s266">And she read books with us, we learned history of Palestine, and it was a very good, wonderful experience.</span> <span id="s267">However, it didn’t last, like nothing lasts.</span> <span id="s268">Unfortunately, my brother during that time became sick with typhus and was quarantined.</span> <span id="s269">My mother was terribly upset about it, and I had to try to cheer her up a little bit here and there, and I have made acquaintance with a pianist in Theresienstadt, and she was in the entertainment part, and she got us tickets to various performances.</span> <span id="s270">And my mother liked it very much, and I used to go with her in the afternoons or evenings.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: So there were certain cultural activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Yes, only in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s273">It was the -- as everybody knows, the camp that they -- the ghettos that was open to show how well the Jews were treated.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: What are your first recollections of seeing, or meeting Nazis, even before, perhaps, before going to Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: I -- my mother always said, “As soon as you see these black shirts, or the brown shirts marching down the main street,” in Battenberg when we were small, because that was a nest of Nazis, “you come straight into the house.”</span> <span id="s276">They -- they put a -- a fear into us children.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: And did you have any personal interactions you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Only as I said, when we walked to the school in the morning, many times children of -- of Nazis were trying to persecute us, and hit us, and -- but somehow or other, I had sort of a lucky star, and I don’t remember the real bad, bad, bad episodes, except that at night we always were afraid to go to sleep, because of the stones that came into the window.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: And that was still in Battenberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: That was still in Battenberg, in Friedberg that never happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: And also later di -- in your -- in the schools you were attending, I read something once that said the Gestapo was already monitoring these schools, like in Frankfurt the school you attended.</span> <span id="s282">Did you -- did you see any officials -- Nazi officials around your schools?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: I don’t remember, I really don’t remember, but it could well be.</span> <span id="s284">I have a book here from the phila -- about the philanthropine, and maybe we can look it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: I was just curious if any of that -- you know, if you remembered.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: No, I don’t remember that, I only remember that in the last few months I did not go to school any more, I stayed home with my parents, and I helped out in a old age home, washing floors, I was 14, and they made me scrub the floors.</span> <span id="s287">Had to kneel down -- was backbreaking work for a 14 year old.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: And that was after you were no longer allowed to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Na -- just -- it’s a school.</span> <span id="s290">Between ’41 and ’42, till our deportation.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: So when you were deported, what did you know about what was about to happen at that time?</span> <span id="s292">What were you aware of at the moment that they -- you know, describe to me sort of that -- that particular part of your experience of being deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: The de -- de -- deportation was a horrible experience because we were all taken to a point in Darmstardt, which is south of Frankfurt, a major city, and apparently they had Quonset huts there, and they rounded up all the Jews from the arou -- surrounding areas, all the people from Hesse, Frankfurt, and the bigger cities nearby.</span> <span id="s294">And we were sort of divided in groups, and it depended on your status in Germany, and as I said, my father had that luck, that we -- wasn’t the luck for him, unfortunately, he lost his life, but that we were on the -- so that we are put on the side to go to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s295">His brother -- and we were very close to them, this -- this is not the same brother as the one that was killed in Buchenwald -- well, that was really later -- a younger brother, who lived in Bad Nauheim with his family, they had two boys, and they were put on the side to go to the east.</span> <span id="s296">And my father tried everything to -- for them to be with us, but it didn’t -- he couldn’t do anything about it.</span> <span id="s297">So then the actual, when we find -- I don’t know what we ate there, I’ve no idea what -- what the rations were.</span> <span id="s298">The rations in Germany already were very poor.</span> <span id="s299">For us poorer than for the general public, but we -- we depended on potatoes, cabbage, and what do you call these?</span> <span id="s300">Halloween --</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: Oh, pumpkins?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: Pumpkins.</span> <span id="s303">I mean, they were not like -- they were not quite as big as pumpkins, but some kind of --</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Like a turnip?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Like a turnip, that’s right, it was a turnip, a sort of a winter vegetable that you could still s -- keep over the window, and the Germans had warehouses of these things, apparently.</span> <span id="s306">Potatoes by the -- they had to, because they had nothing else.</span> <span id="s307">And finally, two or three days later, we were put into a -- a -- into a railroad.</span> <span id="s308">Naturally the -- what do you call them, the wagons that had no windows, and they are used for transport of good and animals.</span> <span id="s309">And we got taken to Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: What did you bring with you?</span> <span id="s311">What were you able to bring?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: We had each a -- a -- I would say s -- we were allowed certain amount of pounds, I don’t remember, maybe 50 pounds in the suitcases.</span> <span id="s313">Food, my mother packed up some food, clothing, and everybody, we had to carry our own.</span> <span id="s314">My parents -- my father ke -- tried to carry my brother’s package, whatever, and we came to Theresienstadt with our own clothes yet.</span> <span id="s315">Whatever we could take along.</span> <span id="s316">We left many things behind.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: And when was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: In 1940 -- September 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: And how long did you stay -- you were first taken to -- it was sort of a transit center?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: [indecipherable] centers -- transit center, that’s exa -- darmshtart.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: And how long you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: I wouldn’t s -- I don’t remember, maybe a week or two.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: And from there?</span> <span id="s324">And people were taken from there to different places --</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: -- and from there you were taken to Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: Theresienstadt, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: And the trip itself you remember pretty vividly, or is it hard to remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: Yes, I remember it was a beautiful fall day, and somehow or other, I -- I looked out -- I don’t know if it had windows, or just holes, and I saw the landscape, I was very much impressed, because he went along the Elba, down to S-Sudatenland, which is today Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s330">It was a beautiful, scenic area, always was impressed by nature, because Battenberg was such a beautiful, beautiful situated town.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: So -- and you didn’t know where you were headed at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: No, I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s333">When we arrived -- I don’t know, maybe my parents knew, but I doubt it.</span> <span id="s334">When we got to Theresienstadt, we were all put into a -- a compound, and my father, as usual, was able to get to a compound where there were prominent Jews, like lawyers, and professionals.</span> <span id="s335">They sort of had this all divided there.</span> <span id="s336">And we stayed on the floor, and we had straw sacks to sleep on, maybe -- it depended on the room how many people, 20 - 25, and that is not very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: And how long were you staying in that situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: As -- when -- when my father finally -- I would say about less than a half a year.</span> <span id="s339">Then I was able to get to the kinderheim.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: So for the first six months at Theresienstadt, you were in these cramped, crowded living conditions?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Yes, definitely, and there were a lot of Slovakian Jews, Czechs Jews, and Jews from all parts of Germany, some Austrians, and later on we also had Dutch Jews.</span> <span id="s342">And somehow or other there was ill-feelings sometimes between this Jews, where they came from, what they did, and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s343">I have to think of this today, cause humankind does not learn from -- from these things, apparently.</span> <span id="s344">It continues, and continues in this world.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: So you were able to stay with your family, together?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Yeah, together till I was put into the na -- kinderheim, which was just a couple of blocks away, but that was a revelation for me, and I loved the learning there.</span> <span id="s347">It -- it was something that -- and spiritually it helped me to be with other Jewish children, en masse.</span> <span id="s348">There was competition in school, in writing, in reading, and knowing certain answers and so on.</span> <span id="s349">And I always had a drive to be -- I had a big ego to be on top, whatever, which naturally I had competitions there very much, but it kept me alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: The first half year, was it depressing to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: Yes, because a lot of the old people around us passed away.</span> <span id="s352">They just couldn’t take it.</span> <span id="s353">And we saw that, even in our room, and every morning somebody was sick, had even -- had diarrhea, and it smelled, or vomiting, and awful -- awful things.</span> <span id="s354">This was very, very bad for us children, but since I later on decided in this country to be working in the medical profession, when I think about this now, it really is part of human suffering.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: So you were -- you were in the kinderheim, you were feeling -- I think you wrote that it was an intellectually prosperous, or fruitful --</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: [indecipherable] time.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: -- time for you.</span> <span id="s358">And it sounds like what you were able to learn there was not censored, or restricted, it sounds like --</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: No, it was between ourselves, since we had Eta Hoyman, we learned a lot of -- about Palestine, the history of the Zionist movement, and she wanted to inflame in all of us a desire to go to the homeland of the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: Did you feel that interest, and -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Unfortunately, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s362">I -- I did and I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: But you still enjoyed learning everything?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: I enjo-joyed learning and reading classical novels.</span> <span id="s365">She read to us every night for at least an hour.</span> <span id="s366">And some of the children, naturally didn’t pay attention, but I was there, I -- I couldn’t pull myself away from that.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: And did you get involved in any cultural performances or activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: I don’t think so, I had a -- a flair for gardening, so they selected me to work in what they called the [indecipherable] garden.</span> <span id="s369">And I had a girlfriend, passed away not so long ago, we both were working there, we raised, for the Nazis naturally, tomatoes and spinach, and -- but we were able to eat here and there a tomato, when nobody looked.</span> <span id="s370">And they noticed that I made very nice beds, you know, the flower, not -- the beds for the vegetables, so they selected me to rake -- to rake the beds nice and straight, and make them four or five inches high from the ground, and so on.</span> <span id="s371">And that I enjoyed very much.</span> <span id="s372">And every night I went home, putting a tomato, or a potato under my armpits.</span> <span id="s373">If we had been caught, we would have been sent right away to some prison.</span> <span id="s374">There was a prison nearby, but I brought this to my mother, and she was forever grateful when she had something like this, to feed my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: So tell me your -- your --</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: But it was a short time, it was maybe one summer, and one fall.</span> <span id="s377">Is it finished?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: You want to take a break?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: Yes, please.</span> <span id="s380">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: I just want to make sure before we continue talking about your experiences, would you just make sure to tell me the full names of your family members, your parents and your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s383">My father’s name was Bertholdt Eckstain.</span> <span id="s384">My mother’s name was Bertha Eckstain, born Marx, M-a-r-x.</span> <span id="s385">My brother’s name was Norbert, N-o-r-b-e-r-t Eckstain.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: And you originally had a middle name, it sounds like that was also from your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: My middle name was Bina, B-i-n-a, which was my grandmother’s name, on mother’s side.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: And how did you -- and how about your first name, did you get that from someone in your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Yes, I had an aunt, she was more German than the Germans, very wealthy woman, married to a very wealthy horse dealer, in -- Jewish horse dealer in Germany, and she was thinking it should be a German name.</span> <span id="s390">She had a preference for me.</span> <span id="s391">She as herself couldn’t get children, so she named me Gisela.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: And would you say that your family in general was very assimilated into German society?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: I would say so.</span> <span id="s394">They were very assimilated, especially my mother’s family.</span> <span id="s395">You had to be if you lived in a small town.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: Okay, so now to return to I think where we left off, we were talking about sort of the early time period when you were in Theresienstadt, and I actually have a map, and I would -- I’m wondering if you recognize sort of where you were.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: I know that I was in L four -- 414 in the kinderheim, but before that --</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: This looks like the main square.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: Yeah, I understand.</span> <span id="s400">And near there was a kine -- it doesn’t say there.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: This may not be detailed enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Yes, it was on the right side of the kinderheim.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: This apparently --</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: [indecipherable] children’s home.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: So when you first arrived, where were you in terms of this main square?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: We were -- we were in the Hanover barracks when we arrived, till I got to the kinderheim, which was L fear hundred -- 414, the German kinderheim.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: And at that time you were then separated from your parents, or did you see your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Oh, I could see them any time.</span> <span id="s409">It was a little walk to get to them, but most of my time was spent with the other children.</span> <span id="s410">We were always busy.</span> <span id="s411">We were kept busy from morning till night.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: And then -- and then you stayed in the kinderheim for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Till we were deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: So you were there for the rest of the time?</span> <span id="s415">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: So, in looking at this example of the map, just so I have a better understanding, were you usually -- did you usually stay in a very small portion of the overall area, or did you wind up in many different, you know, parts.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: Oh, it -- when we were allowed to go out without -- we could go anywheres without guardians, Jewish guardians.</span> <span id="s418">So we once in awhile went just through to the main square, or went to a concert, or something that was offered at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: And the garden, you worked in a garden, is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Yes, I worked -- we worked in the Veshalie garden, which is outside the ghetto, we were marched there, and we were marched back.</span> <span id="s421">And I --</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: And occasionally we’re examined if we took anything into the camp, so everybody was very afraid if you took a potato or two, or a tomato or two, or some spinach underneath our clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: That we brought -- I brought to my mother, she was very grateful for this.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: So would you tell me -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Gisela Zamora, conducted by Amy Rubin, on June first, 2003, in Scarsdale, New York.</span> <span id="s428">This is tape number two, side A.</span> <span id="s429">So I was just about to ask you if you could describe to me the daily routine or what a -- a day was like for you there.</span> <span id="s430">I guess we’re talking about the time that you entered, you know, the kinderheim, and -- and you were working in the garden.</span> <span id="s431">What was a typical day like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Well, we had to get up early in the morning, get our ration of food, whatever it was, and we had a very string -- string -- strict -- I’m sorry, strict teacher, that led us to -- in -- in to a sort of a circle, we sat down on the floor, and she told us -- she read to us, and we had naturally, intervals where we could go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s433">Many of us had diarrhea from the food, from unsanitary conditions.</span> <span id="s434">We slept too many people in -- on one bunk, and usually on the -- on Saturdays we were free.</span> <span id="s435">And I had my first experience of relationship with the opposite text -- sex.</span> <span id="s436">That means only platonically.</span> <span id="s437">He was a singer from the Czech opera, and I happened to be, on a nice sunny day, in a new outfit that my mother made for me from some rags.</span> <span id="s438">And I sat myself down on some stones, and there comes this man, sat next to me, and I recognized him right away, and told him that he was at the opera.</span> <span id="s439">So he gave me a kiss, and hugged me.</span> <span id="s440">And he promised to be there the next week, and unfortunately I arrived, waited there for an hour with tears in my eyes, and I never saw him again.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Do you know his name?</span> <span id="s442">A: I am sorry, I forgot.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: But you had a little crush on him?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: I had a crush on him.</span> <span id="s445">That was my first crush.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: And how old were you at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: I’m going on 15 --</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: So the f --</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: -- or f -- almost 16.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: So -- so you were enjoying yourself in school, but the food situation was not very good, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: No, we always were hungry, and if we could somehow or other catch anywheres a little bit extra, that was special.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: And otherwise you saw your family in the evenings?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Yes, and sometimes in the afternoons, and then when my f -- my brother got sick with typhus, I was not allowed to go there for awhile, because it was disinfected, and my mother didn’t want me to come there.</span> <span id="s454">So I met them on the outside once in awhile.</span> <span id="s455">But generally I was so happy and -- to be in the kinderheim, that I had not this desire that I would have today to see my parents.</span> <span id="s456">We were young, and so wrapped up with being young, trying to learn and enjoy ourselves.</span> <span id="s457">So, these horrible things were left sort of not to dwell on.</span> <span id="s458">We saw every day wagons with corpses going by, because we were right on the main street, and they were being taken out of the ghetto to a mass grave.</span> <span id="s459">But your -- every day you saw at least two or three wagons with several people in there.</span> <span id="s460">Mostly elderly people.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: And did you give much thought to it at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: None at all.</span> <span id="s463">We were so -- we were so childlike.</span> <span id="s464">I think today’s teenagers would think different, but we were so ignorant.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: And what did you hear -- I -- I get the impression that Theresienstadt was unusual, that sometimes people could write letters, and send information from the outside.</span> <span id="s466">Did your family -- were you aware of your family receiving packages or letters?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: No, we ne -- I don’t think I remember anybody sending us packages, because all my family from my mother’s side -- [phone rings] Ah, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s468">[indecipherable] where we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: Does this map look familiar to you, or not very familiar, actually?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: Not at all.</span> <span id="s471">I know the main square.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: And this says post office.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Street.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Street, or [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s476">The only thing is maybe this --</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Number 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: -- teen was what?</span> <span id="s479">SS billets, no.</span> <span id="s480">Let’s see why -- what.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Let’s see now, maybe if we read this, it might tell you something that you would recognize.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: I look -- children’s pavilion during the embellishment.</span> <span id="s483">No, that was not [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: That was in preparation for the Red Cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: Yeah, no, we were put there.</span> <span id="s486">We were taken there when they came and inspected us, and we -- we all were fixed up with beautiful hairdos, flowers, and new clothing if -- if they had.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: Did you understand what was happening at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Not at all.</span> <span id="s489">I-I can’t even remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: But you know that something was different, you know that you were given --</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: Yes, yes, later on we heard that this was an inspection for the Red Cross, for the international Red Cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: And did you meet anybody from the Red Cross at that time, or see anybody coming through?</span> <span id="s493">Were you aware of their visit?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: I -- no, I -- a ve -- we -- you know, I was way in the back, and there were a lot of children, a lot of people that they brought there.</span> <span id="s495">I think now I’m finds it.</span> <span id="s496">L -- Main Street.</span> <span id="s497">We were on the Main Street.</span> <span id="s498">I would say maybe here, these two buildings, one was for just Czech, Slovak people, and one was for the German Dutch children.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: So when -- so what else do you remember, if anything about the time period right before -- well, when did the Red Cross come to visit, and what do you remember about that whole time period?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: I do remember nothing very much, except that I was happy to be in company with my own grade -- kind, and I was not a good eater before we left Germany, and that’s why my -- my hunger, probably was not so bad that time.</span> <span id="s501">I didn’t feel it.</span> <span id="s502">Or I felt it, but whatever we got at that time seemed to be a little bit sufficient, even though probably it wasn’t sufficient.</span> <span id="s503">But I think it was sufficient for me if they ar -- selected me in Auschwitz to go on labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: And you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: Even so, I was small, skinny, not very tall compared to a lot of other girls that were hefty, and tal -- and robust, muscular and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: So what were your -- what were your actual barracks like, and -- and how crowded were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: Well, as I said, the barracks where my parents were e -- were first brought, where one family was put in one little compound, in a corner, next to another family, another family, another family and so on.</span> <span id="s508">And as I said, it was th-the more elite part of the ghetto that we were brought to.</span> <span id="s509">There were only lawyers, doctors, and prominent people.</span> <span id="s510">I remember even one of my mathematics teacher from Frankfurt with his family, Dr. Naleftchuwitz, that he was right near us, across this -- from our compound, the same big room.</span> <span id="s511">Then there was a famous lawyer, Lervenstein, whose daughter Ruth Lervenstein?</span> <span id="s512">I forgot her first name now, was a very accomplished pianist, and performed on the stage in Theresienstadt, and she took me to many of her concerts.</span> <span id="s513">What I remember most is that a -- the last night before our deportation, my mother and I -- that means my father was deported already, a month later my mother and I went to a performance of Hayden’s Creation, and I never will forget that.</span> <span id="s514">Next morning we were all rounded up for Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s515">.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: And the night before you were very happy, would you say, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: Ah, yeah, it impressed me very much to hear that chorus, and I have a ticket to hear it at Lincoln Center a -- a -- on August 23rd, and I wonder what reaction it gives me.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: So did you have many interactions with any of the Nazis overseeing, or I believe there were some Czech gendarmes who were also the guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: Yes, the Czech gen -- gendarmes were with us in the Vesherie garden on the outside.</span> <span id="s520">On the general they were very humane, let’s say as humane an -- as they could be.</span> <span id="s521">They let us work, we -- we naturally had to work, but they were not like the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: And you did see Nazis inside Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: I never really -- I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s524">I really don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: When -- when were you aware of your father leaving?</span> <span id="s526">Did you know beforehand?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: No, all of a sudden they said tomorrow -- this is -- in this time my father and lots of other men have to be ready to go on labor on the outside, and they rounded up all younger men in their 30’s and 40’s.</span> <span id="s528">My father was at that time -- born in ’93, f -- about 51 or 52, but very tall, and not overweight, and he was amongst those that were selected on this first trip to Auschwitz from Theresienstadt, the first men’s transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: And when was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: August, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: Had you heard anything about Auschwitz at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s533">Maybe it was mentioned, but nobody could make any il -- illustration how it would look.</span> <span id="s534">I don’t think I heard anything about it.</span> <span id="s535">They only talked about labor camps for the Reich.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: And you did not know your father was going to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s538">As a matter of fact, they duped us when one month later, they said all wifes and children of the men that were transported last month will now be able to go to the labor camp, and live with their husbands.</span> <span id="s539">So it should be an enticement to go on this trip.</span> <span id="s540">I don’t know if my mother f -- did that out of her free will and registered us, or if we were just selected.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: Did you have any -- do you remember any holidays, religious holidays in Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: Well, as we -- as we had a very Zionistic, and also religious hofsayren instead of teacher, Eta Noyman, a prominent Zionist and Judaic scholar, she made sure we had a nice celebration on the various Jewish holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: So by the time -- oh, I wanted to ask you -- here, I can take that -- I wanted to ask you, when you were, you know, studying and learning, and this was a fruitful time for you, did you have any dreams, or aspirations for what you would like to do later, as you grew up?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: I don’t remember, but I was so -- so hungry for knowledge, for knowing things.</span> <span id="s545">I was always competitive even in Frankfurt in the ha -- in the school we went to.</span> <span id="s546">And I basically was not a top student like my friend Eva Warburg, but I was a good student.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: What were the subjects that you liked the most in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Science.</span> <span id="s549">I was good in mathematics.</span> <span id="s550">That was my father’s influence.</span> <span id="s551">He had us do arithmetic when we were four years old.</span> <span id="s552">And I remember as a child three years, or four years old, playing around with w, because I liked that letter, and made out two v’s and turned it around to make an m. All these things, and the n, I made into a u upside down.</span> <span id="s553">And those were sort of -- I think ingenious ideas that not every child has.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: And -- and you were -- it wasn’t necessarily every other child around you who was as hungry for knowledge, right?</span> <span id="s555">It was sort of unusual.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: N-No, no, that’s true.</span> <span id="s557">But I sought out those kids that had the same interest.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: And who were your closest friends at that time in Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: As I said, Eva Hashkowitz Goodman, who just published a book in German.</span> <span id="s560">Ouse wonderum forloifish nish merklish.</span> <span id="s561">She was a good friend of mine, and it was by coincidence that we were -- met again in Auschwitz, and she gave me a half a loaf of bread, and I’ll never, never forget that.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: Any other good friends in [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: Oh yeah, I had a lot of good friends in Theresienstadt that came from my neighborhood in Friedberg.</span> <span id="s564">Her name was Ruth Wertheim.</span> <span id="s565">She married a Mitchell Bakehow, a lawyer in Detroit -- in Pontiac, Michigan.</span> <span id="s566">And we were lifelong friends.</span> <span id="s567">She saved my life on several occasions in Auschwitz by being like a mother, very protective.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: Before you were sent to Auschwitz, you also had another job in Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Yes, I was washing children’s diapers in cold water.</span> <span id="s570">I remember it was fiercely cold that winter, and my hands used to freeze, and I’m surprised I don’t have any frostbites or anything.</span> <span id="s571">That was part of my job.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: You did that outside in the winter?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: We did it -- we -- I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s574">No, we did that inside, but no heat.</span> <span id="s575">Cold water only.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Oh, and in -- in your living arrangements after you were with your parents all together, then you are with other young women your age, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: Yes, a -- as I said, the twins -- the Hashkowitz twins were on my ps -- on my bunk.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: And was it very uncomfortable, was everybody crowded in?</span> <span id="s579">Was it hard to --</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: We sort of maked go -- do.</span> <span id="s581">I don’t remember that, but I know we suffered from the -- from lice, and from bedbugs.</span> <span id="s582">Bedbugs were s -- I was terribly allergic to bedbugs.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: What happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: Oh, my -- my body was full of pustules.</span> <span id="s585">They treated us with disinfectant, whatever they had, but that was not enough, it was so endemic.</span> <span id="s586">And the lice, they were all over our head, and no washing and cleaning could bring that out.</span> <span id="s587">So this was one bad thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: But everything got better for a little while when the Red Cross was going to come, and then did things change back to the sort of normal, the Jewish --</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: Yes, and right away after that really, the deportations from Theresienstadt started.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: So the day that you were deported, what do you remember that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: It was in September, I think it was September 17th, and my mother said, “It must be Rosh Hashanah,” when our -- Rosh Hashanah just passed.</span> <span id="s592">I don’t remember exactly what she said, and we were together in wagons again, coal wagons, or whatever they were, and taken to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s593">That was a terrible trip.</span> <span id="s594">There was one pail where we could go and defecate and urinate, and at some stations the SS came, and somebody had it to empty them.</span> <span id="s595">Then the trip went on, and it took about two or three days to li -- to get to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s596">Luckily, it was cool, and we didn’t need too much water.</span> <span id="s597">But I remember that sitting in the -- in -- in the middle of the wagon, without any backrest, or so on, was very painful.</span> <span id="s598">My mother must have suffered tremendously, because when I think about my back now, and it’s -- bother it gives me, I think back how these older people suffered.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: Did you eat, or have anything to drink?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: I don’t remember, but as I said, my mother took some things along, probably, because everything was confiscated in Auschwitz then.</span> <span id="s601">But till we got to Auschwitz, we did have something.</span> <span id="s602">I don’t remember what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: And were you scared?</span> <span id="s604">What did you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: T -- well, I wasn’t scared, just ignorant, we all were ignorant.</span> <span id="s606">Maybe the older people knew, but basically I wonder what other testimonials people give if they have -- young people, if they have had i -- any idea what would happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: I think it seems that most of the time people either didn’t know, or couldn’t believe that this would be truly happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s609">I could -- I could not believe.</span> <span id="s610">I absolutely was stunned.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: So when you arrived, what did you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: I never saw the crematorium, that was later on pointed out to me, after we were in -- in -- in our bunks already.</span> <span id="s613">But we were on this platform, and Mengele makes the selection, and my -- my mother, my brother were taken from me.</span> <span id="s614">I was taken t-to the other side, and luckily my friend Ruth Wertheim was there, and we two held hands, and kept together, and were put into the same barrack, slept on the same bed.</span> <span id="s615">There we met another girl.</span> <span id="s616">Her name was Hannah Laura Breaker.</span> <span id="s617">She immigrated to Israel a long, long time ago.</span> <span id="s618">And the second time I came to Israel, she had passed away already.</span> <span id="s619">She was very much taken, and suffered greatly from her experience.</span> <span id="s620">She took it in very, very much, and I think that led her to an early death.</span> <span id="s621">Also my friend Ruth Hershkowitz Goodman, and her sister -- can’t think of her name.</span> <span id="s622">I’ll look it up after.</span> <span id="s623">The twins.</span> <span id="s624">Not identical twins.</span> <span id="s625">She also was selected to our area, but sin-since they were twins, were taken out to be with -- for experimentation.</span> <span id="s626">But somehow or other they had the luck that Mengele left -- let them be for last, and used them as messengers.</span> <span id="s627">So that they were able to get a little bread here and there, and once when I met Ruth Hershkowitz on the way out of Auschwitz, she gave me a half a loaf of bread, and she mentions it in her book.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: Did -- did you know this -- this doctor was named Mengele at the time, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: No, no, not at all, didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: It’s much later when you learned.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: Yes, who know -- knew anything.</span> <span id="s632">We knew our -- when we got to the labor camp, we knew the German woman that was our -- a -- a real terrible bitch, if I can say that she was.</span> <span id="s633">Inhuman.</span> <span id="s634">Inhuman and how would I say, a -- had no scruples whatsoever to hit us, or to kill us, or whatever.</span> <span id="s635">She always wore a revolver in her polster, and was ready to shoot anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: And who was she?</span> <span id="s637">Who -- what’s her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: That wa -- I don’t remember her name.</span> <span id="s639">I think her first name was Ilsa.</span> <span id="s640">I only remember when we were liberated by the Russians, some of the Polish girls in the labor camp took her and shaved her hair, and gave her over to the Russians.</span> <span id="s641">I don’t know what happened to her.</span> <span id="s642">I was too sick at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: I wanted to go back for a moment, one thing I didn’t get a chance to ask you.</span> <span id="s644">When you were still in Germany, and growing up, and moving from one place to the other, once Hitler came to power, or even right before that, what -- what was your awareness of Hitler?</span> <span id="s645">Had you been hearing anything he said over the radio?</span> <span id="s646">Did you parents talk about this person, Hitler?</span> <span id="s647">What did -- what did you know, what was your awareness?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: You know that since we went to -- still to German schools in the beginning, we took all these things in, and when all the young people were selected for the youth -- the Hitler yugen, and for the gymnast -- gymnastic classes and so on, no Jews were allowed to enter, nor half-Jews.</span> <span id="s649">And that was really the only thing that bothered me.</span> <span id="s650">Everything else, we copied, sort of.</span> <span id="s651">When they sang German folk songs, and we went right along with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: Did you feel that sense of German nationalism then, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: I -- I didn’t -- you know, they -- they said the Polacks, the Polish people, and the French people, they are so dirty, they don’t wash themselves, they had all kinds of preconceived notions, or -- that was drilled into the German youth.</span> <span id="s654">And we staying there, and being with them, believed the same things.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: And you felt very German?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: And we felt very German.</span> <span id="s657">After all, my father was more German than the Germans, I would say.</span> <span id="s658">He -- he belonged to the Reichpont yudizhafront soldaten.</span> <span id="s659">That means the ri -- the reich -- the club of the reich of the Jewish s -- soldier of the front.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: And so you, for a while you actually had non-Jewish friends who were joining the Hitler youth, and you were wondering why --</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: Oh yes, all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: -- Jewish people weren’t allowed to --</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s664">And then, after awhile, they -- their -- their parents said, “Don’t talk to this Jewish girl any more.</span> <span id="s665">Don’t -- don’t play with her.</span> <span id="s666">Stay away.”</span> <span id="s667">So we were really alone.</span> <span id="s668">We were sort of es -- ostracized then, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: And do you remember hearing Hitler’s speeches at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: No.</span> <span id="s671">But my husband told me he went, when he opened up the airport in Frankfurt, he went with his father to hear him, and that gave him the first time an idea that this man is a dictator.</span> <span id="s672">My husband was seven years older, and had much more knowledge, was very brilliant.</span> <span id="s673">And he told me this later, when we were married, naturally.</span> <span id="s674">He said that he could not understand it, that German people were so after him, spe -- especially some women that were enamored in him.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: -- morial Museum interview with Gisela Zamora.</span> <span id="s677">This is tape two, side B.</span> <span id="s678">This is also a map here of Birkenau, and I think this is around the time when you would have been there, it says late October --</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: Mm-hm, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: -- ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: When did -- when did you arrive?</span> <span id="s683">You arrived in September, ’44?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: In ma -- in September ’44, and was shipped out of Auschwitz in October, late October, to --</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: To --</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: -- Mattsdorf [indecipherable] to work at Krumstar, Maidna and Franna.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: Do you recognize where you would have been in the maps here?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: No, no, no, they were so close together, I could never tell this.</span> <span id="s689">I -- I have absolutely no recollection.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: But you were in Birkenau, you were in Auschwitz two, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s692">I -- I really didn’t know at that time that it was Birkenau, but in the mornings we used to stand at the barbed wire, and we used to see naked men, and real musselmen go by, and waving and sought -- were -- were scr-screaming across the wire if they knew of this and this person, either their wife, their mothers, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: They were on the outside, asking --</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: They were -- yes, they were in the men’s -- in the men’s camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: So you were there for approximately four to five weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: And dur --</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: Longer I wouldn’t have survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: And during that time you said at one point you did become aware of the crematorium, when was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: Yes, the girls, first of all -- the first -- after the first night in Auschwitz, we got out on appelle, to be s-standing in line and being counted.</span> <span id="s701">There was one girl missing, and we saw her at the barbed wire, she had committed suicide.</span> <span id="s702">And there -- there was a big to-do in that camp, in our barrack, what happened, there’s one missing.</span> <span id="s703">And then finally somebody got up and said, “She is lying near the barbed wire.”</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: Was this a real shock to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: Yes, it was a shock, I saw it.</span> <span id="s706">I saw the woman.</span> <span id="s707">A very good looking, Czech, Jewish, a younger woman, maybe in her early 20’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: And did you already have a sense that this was a very different place than Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s710">We talked among ourselves that -- we stood outside for hours, and I didn’t -- I was given one shirt, sort of, that went down to my knees.</span> <span id="s711">It was a little flannel inside, thank God.</span> <span id="s712">No socks, no underwear, nothing.</span> <span id="s713">Somehow or other, later on somehow, I got a -- a rag somewheres, and I used that around my -- my sp -- private par -- parts to be like an underpair of -- under -- pair of pantyhose, or panties.</span> <span id="s714">I was always cold in Auschwitz, I cannot remember that I wasn’t cold, and suddenly I noticed that I -- my breathing started to be short, and I realized I had fever, and was coughing.</span> <span id="s715">Those were the first signs of having TB.</span> <span id="s716">I didn’t realize it, and my friend Ruth said, “Don’t say anything, just stay and we’ll take care of you.”</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: So do you feel like at this stage you were starting to feel more depressed or hopeless about things, or -- or did you still somehow not realize what was possibly going to happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: We all didn’t know what was going to happen to us, but we felt -- we -- we smelt a stench from the crematoria.</span> <span id="s719">By that time we knew that there was gassing going on.</span> <span id="s720">I mean, that was the -- the underground informed us.</span> <span id="s721">“And if you don’t behave you’re going to go there too,” they said, “so just do what they say.”</span> <span id="s722">And since I was the smallest, or one of the smallest, I was always hidden by taller girls, and good looking girls.</span> <span id="s723">And somehow I escaped, this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: You think this helped you, to be small?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: It -- it helped me at that moment, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: Were you searching for your mother, your father, your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: I -- I would have liked, I wasn’t -- yes, I was trying to find out what happened to them, but we were so occupied in our own psyche, that it was just self-determination to stay alive, that we didn’t think about anybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: Did you help each other out, the -- the women you were with?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: Oh, I must say, these -- we -- the three girls that we were -- Hannah Laura Breaker, Ruth Wertheim and myself, we were like three sisters.</span> <span id="s730">We helped each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: You shared food, and you --</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: Well, the -- the -- this comes later, when -- after we left Auschwitz, naturally we -- we couldn’t share foods, we each got our plate of soup, and a piece of bread, and everybody said, “Don’t hide your bread, it’s going to be stolen, eat it as soon as you get it.”</span> <span id="s733">And that was the truth, because some of the girls, if they hid their bread for the night, or for whatever, they were gone.</span> <span id="s734">Some of the other mates were so hungry, and at that time you were doing anything you could to get more food.</span> <span id="s735">Later on, when we were already deported to Mattsdorf and Reasonkeperga, which happened at dusk, really, it was almost dark in October, very dreary day, and maybe Mengele didn’t see how small I was, and said I was being selected to go out, because there was nobody among those girls that was as small and perishable as I was.</span> <span id="s736">So emaciated, I would say already, and coughing.</span> <span id="s737">And that’s when I red -- I met Rose Hershkowitz with the half a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s738">And we went out of Auschwitz that night, and arrived in Mattsdorf, it’s a krumstin maidnon farflanna parachute factory.</span> <span id="s739">And right away we were put in our bunks, and assigned to work for the next day.</span> <span id="s740">I was put on the machine that was absolutely one of the worst.</span> <span id="s741">You had to take raw flax, which came from the outside, the door was always open, and they threw that flax in and I had to lift it up and put it into the machine, to take off the seeds on the top.</span> <span id="s742">They had to be put in a certain way into the machine.</span> <span id="s743">[phone rings]</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s745">Okay, before we move on to talk about the labor camp, just a little bit more of a sense of what it was like day by day in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s746">Did you ever do any work in Auschwitz, or every day you were just sort of fighting to -- to stay healthy?</span> <span id="s747">You know, what was -- what was --</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: We were -- first of all, I spent an awful lot of time on the latrines, I had terrible diarrhea, and I took every minute I could to run to the latrine, which was not always allowed, and it had a permanent affect on my bowels, which I suffer today.</span> <span id="s749">We -- we were asked by different older supervisors of our -- our kind in the barrack if we want to bring the soup up.</span> <span id="s750">It was a steep little hill, and I volunteered a couple of times, but I found it very, very hard to shlep maybe 20 liters or more of soup in the barrel.</span> <span id="s751">And I remember that as the worst labor for me in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s752">I -- we didn’t do anything, we just stood at the appelle morning and night, cleaned the barracks if possible, if they let us, and waited for our meal.</span> <span id="s753">We were just the reserve for going out, and not employed in any way in Auschwitz itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: Were you worried about being sent to the crematorium at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: I don’t remember, I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Sometimes one wished already that it’s -- it might be, but the self-preservation within one was so strong that you wanted to survive under any circumstances.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: Did you think that your -- your family was still alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: I s -- I thought of it till the end of the war, and that’s why I went back to Friedberg.</span> <span id="s760">The Russian soldiers, and the Russian Jewish officer wanted me to go with him to Russia.</span> <span id="s761">I said, “No, I have to go west.”</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: Did you ever -- later, did you ever receive any confirmation of exactly how they died?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: Yes, when we wrote to Garovstein and we found out that this -- the day when they arrived in Auschwitz, that’s their death day, that’s the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: And that was your mother and brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: Mother, and my father also, before.</span> <span id="s766">I have all the -- the documents about this.</span> <span id="s767">The funny thing is, my poor husband never could find out where his mother was, and we have a letter that they don’t know where she passed away.</span> <span id="s768">We think -- or he thought that she died in Litzmannstadt, in Lódz, in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: Did you -- the documentation that you have about your family, did you ever send copies or any of that to the museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: I think they have it.</span> <span id="s771">I’m sure -- my husband did all of this, I am not aware of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: Okay, so -- so now tell me about -- tell me about the day that you were sent out of Auschwitz, and -- and the circumstances.</span> <span id="s773">What -- what exactly happened that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: We were up -- we were rounded up, about 800 - 900 young girls, Hungarians, German Jews, Polish Jews.</span> <span id="s775">The German Jews were a minority -- I was among those, and Czech.</span> <span id="s776">Our Czech brothers and si -- our Czech sisters that were -- came from Theresienstadt with us, we assembled on the plaza, and then gi -- Mengele came and selected about four to 500 women.</span> <span id="s777">Among them was me.</span> <span id="s778">I had held the hand of my friend Ruth Wertheim, who probably pulled me over, because I was so small, and sickly already.</span> <span id="s779">And he might not have seen it, it was dusk, and gray and evening, and we were put on the train, on the last wagon again, a closed train, and were taken to Mattsdorf and Reasonkeperga.</span> <span id="s780">We arrived there the next day, and were unloaded, and the thing was they didn’t have enough room for us, so they quickly built Quonset huts on top of the factory, and that’s where we were located.</span> <span id="s781">That was a -- an plus for us, because the heat rises up from the machinery that went on 24 hours a day in the factory, and we felt the first time a little warmth.</span> <span id="s782">And also, the factory had to get rid of dirty water that -- hot water that came out of the machinery, since they were cooled by water, and we washed ourselves, and we kept ourselves pretty clean during that time.</span> <span id="s783">But that was a time I got sick very fast, and a doctor came and put me in the infirmary.</span> <span id="s784">I was coughing, I had a mastitis which was draining.</span> <span id="s785">My l-le -- ma -- in ma -- on my ri-right breast for eight months, even after we were liberated yet.</span> <span id="s786">It gave me terrible pain, and I had absolutely no incentive or will to live at that time any more.</span> <span id="s787">But my friend Ruth Wertheim, and Hannah Laura Breaker, both kept me going.</span> <span id="s788">One day as we were standing there and talking in appelle, somehow or other, the foreman of the factory came by, and he said, “How come you girls speak so well German?”</span> <span id="s789">So we said, “We -- we are Germans.</span> <span id="s790">We went to German schools.”</span> <span id="s791">He couldn’t understand it.</span> <span id="s792">So next day he brought us an apple, and we divided the apple in three.</span> <span id="s793">And that was the first time that a German showed some kind of compassion.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: Was he an SS?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: No, he was a worker, a -- a -- the foreman.</span> <span id="s796">Not -- not an SS.</span> <span id="s797">If the f -- SS would have known, probably he would have been fired, or whatever.</span> <span id="s798">But at that time, it was towards the end of the war, and they were very much wrapped up with the Russian front that was very close to us.</span> <span id="s799">We heard the shooting all night long.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Can you describe, approximately where -- where this labor camp was?</span> <span id="s801">You -- you were saying --</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: It was very near Gross-Rosen, and right across from us was a labor camp of French prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s803">They actually wor-worked in our factory, too -- do -- to -- did some heavy man’s labor.</span> <span id="s804">And some girls even sort of befriended them, or made some kind of contact with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: So in your factory it was only for women, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: That, yes, that part was only for women, where -- where the flax was made into -- mixed with a certain synthetic material for parachutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: And you were telling me before, when the tape ran out, the exact job that you were doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: Yes, I was -- as the raw flax, which -- which made sores on my hand because they are stalks, and you had to be fast putting it into the machine.</span> <span id="s809">My hands were always bloody, and injured from this job.</span> <span id="s810">And the seeds went into a bucket used for something else, and the stalks w-were put through other machines, and refined towards cha -- changing it into a material.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: And this was pretty hard -- you know, difficult labor, would you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: It was very difficult labor.</span> <span id="s813">I was on one of the worst machines.</span> <span id="s814">My friend Ruth Wertheim was lucky, she was actually in a part of the sewing part, where they already mixed the nylon, or whatever they had, some synthetic type of process, with the flax material.</span> <span id="s815">And it was easier.</span> <span id="s816">So, actually, I was on the worst end of the labor.</span> <span id="s817">That’s why I got sick very fast.</span> <span id="s818">The -- the door was always open for the flax to be thrown in, which was also done by girls, and some French prisoners brought the heavy bundles.</span> <span id="s819">And this went for eight -- almost eight months, from October to May, 1945.</span> <span id="s820">We almost worked towards the very, very end of April in -- fully on these machines.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: Were you hearing any news about the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: Yes, we heard that they were coming nearer, nearer.</span> <span id="s823">The French soldiers warned us that they might blow us up, so one morning all of a sudden, all the Germans were gone.</span> <span id="s824">They were -- the factory was locked up, all Quonset huts were locked up, and everything.</span> <span id="s825">We thought they are going to blow us up, but nothing happened, nobody was around, nuth -- nobody came.</span> <span id="s826">That went on for 24 hours, and we searched for food, and there was really nothing left.</span> <span id="s827">And then finally we saw a Russian soldier come on the bicycle, and s-somebody yelled out of a window, or whatever, and he came and alerted the Russian army.</span> <span id="s828">And the first thing the girls did -- I was too sick, slaughter a cow, or sa -- or a -- or something, or [indecipherable] just to get some f -- real good food into us.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: There was a cow nearby, you mean, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: Oh, there were farms nearby.</span> <span id="s831">It was a very beautiful area.</span> <span id="s832">Oh, besides our regular job, many times in middle of the night, some of us were taken, every time a different c-cloud to shovel coal, to di -- ti -- when the coal wagons were brought in, we had to empty them so they could be used right away.</span> <span id="s833">And I remember one night was terribly cold, snow on the ground, and we found something that looked so red, we took it, and was a liver from some kind of an animal, or whatever.</span> <span id="s834">And we took it into the barracks, and my friend Ruth put it on some kind of a heating mechanism, maybe a radiator, or a machine that had heat, and sort of fried it a little, and the three of us divided it and ate it.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: You were with a third friend as well there?</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: That Hannah Laura Breaker, three of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: How was -- you said there was one woman in particular, she was a -- a German guard there?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: Yes, that -- that was in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s839">There too, there wa -- there were two Polish girls, and they claimed that they were lesbians.</span> <span id="s840">Polish Jewish girls that this German woman used them for sexual whatever, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s841">And they were put in charge of us.</span> <span id="s842">And afterwards we really got after the two.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: The two in -- in Auschwitz, or in the labor camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: In -- in -- in the labor camp, not in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s845">In Auschwitz I don’t see -- I have seen a non -- none except SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: But in the labor camp, these two women --</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: The Polish Jewish women --</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: -- Jewish women, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: -- were in charge of your group.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: [indecipherable] group, yeah.</span> <span id="s852">A -- except in the morning that we stood outside, were counted by that SS woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: And she was very harsh?</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: Very harsh.</span> <span id="s855">She right away came with her what do you call, a riding --</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: A whip?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: Whip.</span> <span id="s858">And used to, if you didn’t stand strai -- straight, hit you over the shoulder, on your hands, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: So when -- when you were not feeling well, you were also given some medical attention while you were in the labor camp, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: Yes, that was after awhile.</span> <span id="s861">A man came, a Dr. Hoffman, and apparently he was only a medic, he was not a doctor, we found out after the war.</span> <span id="s862">We searched him.</span> <span id="s863">He actually helped a lot of the girls.</span> <span id="s864">Few girls that -- that came with us to the labor camp were pregnant, and had babies there, and miscarriages.</span> <span id="s865">Maybe three or four, but I think two survived and took their babies.</span> <span id="s866">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: They were able to keep their babies there, at the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: At the -- I don’t know, it was so late in the year already.</span> <span id="s869">March, April, I mean how -- the g -- the Germans were afraid of everything already.</span> <span id="s870">They knew it was going towards the end, and they were so afraid of the Russians.</span> <span id="s871">And no more trains, and no more gas chambers in Auschwitz, you know.</span> <span id="s872">Auschwitz was dismantled in January.</span> <span id="s873">So they --</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: Had -- had you heard about any of those developments?</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: No, we didn’t know about this.</span> <span id="s876">We didn’t know.</span> <span id="s877">But the French soldiers informed us a lot about.</span> <span id="s878">They -- they talked to some of the girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: Now were you regularly having your menstrual cycles, or were you so --</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: No-o, I had -- that is the funniest thing, my friend Ruth Wertheim had it a few times, and she had nothing to use, she used paper, or whatever she found, even flax.</span> <span id="s881">I had my menstrual period once in Theresienstadt, and that was it.</span> <span id="s882">But one month after liberation, I had it again, and regularly till it stopped at age 52.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: But for almost the entire time during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: I had none, none at all.</span> <span id="s885">I had -- I had maybe three, four menstruations before we were deported, because I was about 14 and a half, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: And you -- you did get fairly ill by the end, it seems.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: I was very ill.</span> <span id="s888">As a matter of fact, it took me many -- I would say a year or two to recover.</span> <span id="s889">And how I ever got to Friedberg -- I walked, with French prisoners of war, with Germans, on this general exodus from the east towards Germany, and I had my yellow stripe on a jacket, and we looted some things in German houses, so I had enough cl-clothes to wear.</span> <span id="s890">And I went e -- west.</span> <span id="s891">And it was a beautiful June, I remember.</span> <span id="s892">Oh, first there was one month -- I’m sorry, I was taken to a -- to a German hospital that was taken over by the Russians, and I stayed there four weeks, and they sort of healed m -- healed me, they helped me to get much better and stronger.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: Well now, when liberation occurred.</span> <span id="s894">--</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: Everybody left, but the ones that were in the sick brai -- sick --</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: Sick bay?</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: Bay.</span> <span id="s898">Couldn’t go.</span> <span id="s899">So I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: How many were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: Oh, there were about, I would say, 25 to 30 girls.</span> <span id="s902">And the ones that --</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: So you were already there for -- how long before liberation were you in the sick bay?</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: I would say two or three months.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: And you were not working during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: No, I couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: And you had tuberculosis?</span> <span id="s908">What did you have at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: I’ve had tuberculosis, and the mastitis.</span> <span id="s910">And I had a fever all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: So when liberation took place, ji -- and you were still so unwell health-wise, did you feel free and happy?</span> <span id="s912">Wha --</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: I was so happy, and so elated that we were free, we could do now whatever we wanted to, and it was -- this feeling, I wished I could get back.</span> <span id="s914">This was nirvana.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: So you really understood this was the end of the war, this was it.</span> <span id="s916">It had really happened, and you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: It had happened.</span> <span id="s918">But then I realized I was alone in this world, and luckily when I arrived at Friedberg, I got a ride with a -- an American, with two American soldiers as soon as I came to Holf and Saxon, they gave me a ride to Birkenback in Germany, and from there some trains were leaving, going towards Frankfurt, and I took a train to Hanau, which was very close to Friedberg, because the train from Frankfurt did not go to Friedberg yet.</span> <span id="s919">So from Hanau I took the train to -- where I got the money from, I don’t remember, but everything was on the -- on the road.</span> <span id="s920">I got to Friedberg, and I wa -- a-asked the stationmaster, “Do you know if Mr. Mowra, Edgar Mowra is here, and where does he live?”</span> <span id="s921">And he said, “He just came back from Dachau.”</span> <span id="s922">He was in Dachau, and he told me where he was.</span> <span id="s923">And that’s where I ended up, and stayed with him, his son, and the housekeeper till my papers came through.</span> <span id="s924">Actually not the whole time.</span> <span id="s925">He felt that I should be taken care of with my tuberculosis, and took me to the hospital in Bad Nauheim.</span> <span id="s926">And a very fine German radiologist said, “Well, she has pretty bad tuberculosis on the left side of -- the left lung.</span> <span id="s927">And we should give her pneumothorax.”</span> <span id="s928">So I s -- End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: They don’t do it any more today, it’s very dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Gisela Zamora, conducted by Amy Rubin, on June first, 2003.</span> <span id="s931">This is tape number three, side A.</span> <span id="s932">Since we were just cut off then, tell me again -- if you would also, just make sure I understand the chronology from the labor camp, and where you went next, and then of course, tell me about the medical procedure that you had.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: I had a medical procedure in the labor camp, by the way.</span> <span id="s934">This Dr. Hoffman, or medic Hoffman that arrived there, who came from Bardkissingin, which we lateler -- we later found out he was a medic with the German army corps.</span> <span id="s935">He made two incisions in my cyst, or whatever it was in my right breast, and the pus finally came out, and he entered a canula and this drained for eight months.</span> <span id="s936">But he did a pretty good job, and even though he was just a medic, not a medical physician, it helped me to survive through the other months.</span> <span id="s937">However, I continued coughing, suffered very much from shortness of breath, and know that I have had something -- I have something with my lungs.</span> <span id="s938">And when I finally arrived in Friedberg, and stayed at Edgar Mowra’s, I was very grateful that he took me to the hospital in Bad Nauheim, which is known as one of the top heart spas in the world, and had an excellent, at that time, staff in it’s hospitals.</span> <span id="s939">A woman physician, a radiologist, was very kind to me, and explained everything, and said, “You need a pneumothorax for eight -- for as long as we can do it.</span> <span id="s940">We collapse your left lung so it can rest.”</span> <span id="s941">And they pump air into the cavity, but very shortly already, water filled up -- fluid, after the cavity was empty, and that’s the danger of this procedure.</span> <span id="s942">And actually it does not help very much.</span> <span id="s943">After awhile they decided to refrain from that, and my lung seemed to ex --</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: Expand?</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: Expand again to almost normal size, but my pleural covering was completely disintegrated, which I did not find out till I arrived in the United States, and had a triple bypass at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital.</span> <span id="s946">And due to this finding, I finally got, a month later, operation from the German government for gesundheit sharden.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: You got -- I’m sorry, here in the s -- States --</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: -- you got compensation, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: Yes, finally when -- when Columbia -- when the physician from Columbia gave me the operative report, and I send it to the German authorities.</span> <span id="s951">I had gotten the compensation for time in camp, and for labor, but nothing monthly.</span> <span id="s952">And I am grateful now that I get this monthly compensation, because I am alone.</span> <span id="s953">My Social Security is very small.</span> <span id="s954">I have some resources, and own my apartment, but as I get older, I’m alone, I have to think about the future.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: And that’s because of the medical --</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: Yes, the comp --</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: -- issues.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: Yes, the compensation is purely for medical reasons.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: So -- so after -- after liberation, and -- well, what -- tell me what happened to your close friends you were with at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: Oh, this is very interesting, too.</span> <span id="s961">I -- I -- my friend Hannah Laura Breaker was living pretty far away from Friedberg, where I was, and she decided -- and call -- t-told me that she will not stay in Germany, she does not want really to go to America, but she might go to America in order to get to Israel.</span> <span id="s962">She went to the U.S. -- she ca -- with one of the first refugee transports in 1946, at the end of ’46, and stayed with her relatives in Washington Heights in New York, and then decided to join an aliyah.</span> <span id="s963">And one year later went to Israel to live there.</span> <span id="s964">She lived in Moetine, and I visited her the first time when I got to Israel in 1963.</span> <span id="s965">She wa -- had married, and had children, was a heavy smoker, and a -- gained it -- lot of weight, and when my husband and I returned in 1973, we looked up again where she was living, and she had passed away.</span> <span id="s966">My friend Ruth Wertheim I kept in touch all along in this country.</span> <span id="s967">We were like sisters.</span> <span id="s968">We called each other almost weekly.</span> <span id="s969">She understood more of the horrible times we went through, and she had lost a sister before she got to Theresienstadt, because she was -- she gave [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: She was attacked, or lynched, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: No, no, she hit into the -- in the face of a -- of a Nazi boy who called her something, and she was right away taken, and they hanged her.</span> <span id="s972">And this left a terrible scar on my friend Ruth during all this time.</span> <span id="s973">She married this lawyer, who was very good to her, had two children, a boy and a girl.</span> <span id="s974">Her son is now president of -- he was at M.I.T., a provost.</span> <span id="s975">He is now the president of the -- what is the Jewish university --</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: A school -- Brandeis?</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: Brandei -- not Brandeis, another one there, very famous college in Boston, he is the president.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: But it’s Jewish, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: More or less -- not -- I forgot.</span> <span id="s980">I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s981">Maybe it’s Brandeis.</span> <span id="s982">No, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s983">My friend Ruth Hershkowitz knows, I’ll ca -- ask her, and call her, and let you know, if you want to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: And -- and your friend Ruth also came to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: Yes, that was -- and she had many good years, she had a good life in Pontiac.</span> <span id="s986">I visited her there twice.</span> <span id="s987">And we were like sisters, and she had the quadruple or quintuple bypass in Boston at Brigham Hospital, and unfortunately it didn’t help her, she passed away two years later.</span> <span id="s988">I was more lucky, I had only a triple bypass.</span> <span id="s989">Dr. Eric Rose, who does now only heart transplants did mine, and did a good job.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: When you were back in -- in Friedberg, did you also look for your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: Yes, that’s why I went back, and we’d searched.</span> <span id="s992">Edgar Mowra helped me very much to search, he went to the authorities.</span> <span id="s993">At that time Germany was in chaos.</span> <span id="s994">A lot of soldiers had vanished, even, in Russia, and po -- in Poland and -- and so on, they -- they were -- the German people were interested in their own first.</span> <span id="s995">But the American, and the British authorities [indecipherable]on the west, established registration, camps, and eventually I ended up in Feldafing, which was a -- in Barbaria, which was a refugee camp, but it had a TB hospital.</span> <span id="s996">And they send me to Bardkolegrup for re-rehabilitation, and for the air, which was in the Alps.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: And when was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: In 1946 - ’47.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: After Bad Nau -- Nauheim?</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: Nauheim, yes, after b -- after I stayed with the Mowras for a little while, with Mr. Mowra.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: So you looked for your family, and couldn’t find any trace of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: No, no, and I didn’t know -- well, I -- I f -- I surmised they were killed in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: And how did you feel --</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: How wa -- how did I feel --</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: N-No, I was going to ask you how you felt being back in Germany, and after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: You know, it’s a funny thing, is that I felt happy to be so liberal-lated, that I was able to -- to partake in everything.</span> <span id="s1007">And it never crossed my mind what the Germans did to us, really.</span> <span id="s1008">Ignorance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: You think you just weren’t thinking of it in that sense?</span> <span id="s1010">I mean, you knew that the Germans were responsible for the war --</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: Yes, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: -- starting the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: As time went on, and as I talked to American soldiers, and my uncle here in America, Louie Marx, my mother’s brother, made sure that I come as soon as possible.</span> <span id="s1014">He put everything into motion, and he asked my relatives here in Scarsdale, who were bor -- she was a born Lanksdorf, and a distant relative to my grandmother on my mother’s side, to help, and they did, and brought me over in 1947.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: And that was also through the Offbau newspaper?</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: Yes, oh yes, they -- an American soldier, unfortunately I don’t remember his name, and I never kept a record of it, he published an announcement in the Offbau to say that Gisela Eckstain is looking for relatives, and a friend from Battenberg read it, and called my uncle, she knew where he was in Washington Heights, and told him, “Your niece is looking for you.”</span> <span id="s1017">And that’s how I got in contact.</span> <span id="s1018">And I lived with them for a little while.</span> <span id="s1019">But unfortunately my uncle had a horrible wife.</span> <span id="s1020">She was a witch.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: And the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: But he was such a good man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: And at the time you actually felt you would have preferred to have stayed in Germany, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: You know, I was so attached to the Mowra family, they were so good to me.</span> <span id="s1025">And the housfrau -- the -- the -- the housekeeper is one of my most -- the person that gave me the most soul input.</span> <span id="s1026">I have to show you a picture, it’s on the wall there, of all my favorites.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: And what’s her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: Her name was Meeta Oyla.</span> <span id="s1029">She was a bastard girl apparently, and she kept the household for the Mowras.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: And you didn’t feel anti-Semitism after the war in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: No, but I think they didn’t like that there were coming so many refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: How did you -- there was also, I think, a document you sent to the museum, something from a Russian sergeant allowing you to go from one zone to the next.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: Yes, I am going to show you the original.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: The museum have a copy of this?</span> <span id="s1035">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: They have the copy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: This is the original, prayerbushka, made out by a Russian officer, and he was wonderful to me, because I didn’t understand any Russian, and he talked Yiddish to me, or German a little bit, and he helped me so much when I was in this lotsarett it was called, in Mattsdorf and Reasonkeperga.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: And what does it say, or what do you -- what -- what did it help you to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: That’s my husband.</span> <span id="s1041">Jewish museum in Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s1042">That has a wonderful Jewish museum.</span> <span id="s1043">They were trying to find his mother, they never found her.</span> <span id="s1044">Elinore Zamoira.</span> <span id="s1045">They changed the name from Zamora to Zamoira -- ets -- so -- from Zamoira to -- to Zamora in Italy.</span> <span id="s1046">They were in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: So tell me about this document, when did y -- how did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: This document helped me to get from the Polish -- through the Polish zone, to the -- it was the Russian zone, and then into the American zone.</span> <span id="s1049">It was quite a -- a big deal to get from one to the other, but somehow or other, I kept this.</span> <span id="s1050">I also had a document from Krumstar, Maidna and Fron, and I think they have that too at the museum, but I don’t have -- I can’t find the copy.</span> <span id="s1051">However, the German gir -- government acknowledged that I worked there, and that I got my compensation for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: Oh I’d -- I just found this, my husband had so much -- oh, I -- I put my -- my parents and his parents in -- on the Miami Holocaust Museum --</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: Memorial?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: Memorial.</span> <span id="s1056">Have you seen that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: No, not in Miami.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: It’s beautiful, really beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: So from my understanding, after the war, you were first in a hospital for about five weeks in -- in the same area --</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: Bad Nauheim.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: But -- but -- but before that, were you still --</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: Oh, I was in a Russian -- I -- I mean a German lotsarett, which is like a -- a field hospital for soldiers, which the Russians took over after they liberated this area, and made it into a Russian hospital, and took in some refugees that were sick, and I stayed there for approximately six weeks.</span> <span id="s1063">And the food I remember very well, was every day a herring, which was so salty, and grits, or something like a cereal.</span> <span id="s1064">They didn’t have much themselves.</span> <span id="s1065">And black bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: Is that where you met the Russian sergeant who gave you this document?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1068">I -- I talked to all the Russian soldiers there, and some of them were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1069">They were very interested in our stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: And had you grown up speaking Yiddish, did you know Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: I learned a little Yiddish in Theresienstadt, but not really -- they -- they understood German somewhat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: And did you grow up learning Hebrew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s1074">My husband did.</span> <span id="s1075">He was a specialist in languages.</span> <span id="s1076">As a matter of fact, he translated a book from Hebrew into English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: So after -- after that is when you walked.</span> <span id="s1078">You walked, and then you took a train in the end of your journey.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: A train, yes, after I got this lift from Saxony, approximately, there were no trains going whatsoever, no transportation.</span> <span id="s1080">And then finally somebody hold it for me, and gave me a lift.</span> <span id="s1081">And nobody was afraid at that time of hijacking, and so on, so forth.</span> <span id="s1082">They deposited me at the railroad station in Wordsport, not Werdham -- Werdham -- Wordsport, not Werdham back.</span> <span id="s1083">And I found my way back to Friedberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: How long were you on this walking journey, were you with other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: Two ow -- two weeks, with other people, we slept in hay lofts, we slept with farmers, and I even was enamored in a German soldier that walked with us.</span> <span id="s1086">Just -- it was such a liberating idea, and everything.</span> <span id="s1087">I didn’t think what they did to us really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: Did you have any feelings of resentment toward anybody at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: No resentment.</span> <span id="s1090">I still must say I don’t want to sis -- resentment to c-come into my heart.</span> <span id="s1091">I have contact with some very fine Germans that could have been probably more helpful, but I don’t know if -- what we would have done in the circumstances.</span> <span id="s1092">Their lives were put on the edge, too, when it came to help Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: So what is your feeling about this idea of forgiveness, or do you think about it in that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">A: Well, today’s world is so full of turmoil, and hate between various peoples.</span> <span id="s1095">And I hope that Israel and the Palestinians will come to some kind of accord, that would be a blessing for all the Jews.</span> <span id="s1096">But the Jews have to give also, they cannot just take all the time.</span> <span id="s1097">And we must learn a lesson, that there are ways to find one’s own salvation, and can still be active in the Jewish faith.</span> <span id="s1098">I’m reading a letter f -- about Judaism now, very -- pretty much at the end of my life, I want to return to my original upbringing, and so on.</span> <span id="s1099">But I have reservations.</span> <span id="s1100">When I think about all the ceremonies that we have, and circumcisions, and these feasts.</span> <span id="s1101">They are two, 3000 years old.</span> <span id="s1102">They don’t have to be replicated in the way we are replicating them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: And you have shown an interest in studying other religions, as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: Yes, I would say monotheism is not the answer, it’s monism.</span> <span id="s1105">One self above all.</span> <span id="s1106">And everybody has some of that self, and maybe it’s the same as God.</span> <span id="s1107">And monotheism is not so far away from monism.</span> <span id="s1108">I have learned a lot from Ratunda, I had a wonderful, wonderful teacher.</span> <span id="s1109">A swami that was here for several years is teaching now in Chile.</span> <span id="s1110">And what I learned through my husband -- I myself would na -- would not have come to this, is -- is not to be -- it -- it’s gold to me.</span> <span id="s1111">It’s more than gold, it’s an inner richness that I received.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: Do you consider yourself to have a religion in the way that people label religion these days?</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A: No, definitely not.</span> <span id="s1114">I -- I’m a free thinker, and as I said, I had some -- I have some friends at the Quakers, I have attended some of their sittings, just for meditation, and they are very good to me.</span> <span id="s1115">I don’t know if my family here in Scarsdale ap -- appreciates it.</span> <span id="s1116">They are very much into the Reform Judaism, which is very good.</span> <span id="s1117">I go with them at the Jewish holidays for service there.</span> <span id="s1118">But it’s too much materialism amongst we Jews.</span> <span id="s1119">And they have to do much more self searching, and giving.</span> <span id="s1120">With that I want to end.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: What’s that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: With that I want to end.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Q: Oh, you want to end.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">A: And I still have anot --</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: One thing I’m wondering about is when it was that you finally felt healthy again, after the war, and after being in the hospital, a couple different places.</span> <span id="s1126">When were you feeling healthy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">A: I would say a hundred percent healthy I did not f-feel ever.</span> <span id="s1128">I ge -- always had a tiredness about myself.</span> <span id="s1129">Wasn’t very able to do a lot of things, and very soon exhausted.</span> <span id="s1130">But once I met my husband, who was a mountain climber, a hiker -- I was also a hiker before that, I must say I have walked, I love to walk.</span> <span id="s1131">He changed my whole outlook, and introduced me to the eastern philosophies, and I learned yoga, I taught it about eight years here in Greenburg, in the adult education center, and also at the high school, at -- at the co -- co-op in the Bronx, Truman High School for adult education, and also for teenagers towards the end.</span> <span id="s1132">And I also taught yoga here and there when I was asked by some organization, or make a demonstration.</span> <span id="s1133">When the Madison Square Garden was still in existence, I had a headstand on the stage of Madison Square Garden.</span> <span id="s1134">Not alone, with two other students of the swami at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: And how do you see your experiences, what you went through during the war, having affected your -- your own interest in religion?</span> <span id="s1136">Do you think it’s directly connected what you went through, and then sort of this exploration that you’ve been on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">A: I-I think that is a question of development.</span> <span id="s1138">I was very much impressed first with science.</span> <span id="s1139">But science also does not give all the answers.</span> <span id="s1140">And I was in the medical field, in laboratories, doing research, especially in human blood, and sera, and so on, and so forth.</span> <span id="s1141">And routine analysis of all fluids.</span> <span id="s1142">My husband also was a chemist, and we discussed a lot of s-sciences, and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s1143">It left me with some questions and doubt, and it was sometimes quasi quasi, there were not hundred percent answers to anything.</span> <span id="s1144">When my husband branched out into philosophy and religion, I got a whiff of it, and he passed it on to me, and he would be proud today if he would be alive to see me pursue it so vigorously.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: Do you feel in other ways that -- that what you experienced during the war really stayed with you throughout the years after?</span> <span id="s1146">Are there certain things that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">A: That humans can be very cruel to each other, and we talk about heart, and love, and so on and so forth, but the -- the principle of self preservation is so strong, that any human being resorts to any criminal action, even killing another human being, maybe a -- even a sibling for his self preservation.</span> <span id="s1148">So this all has to be worked out by men.</span> <span id="s1149">And I think I got wiser by having had this experience, and I wonder what the other side will bring, if there is another side, and so more learning, and more experiencing.</span> <span id="s1150">We don’t know.</span> <span id="s1151">I have my doubts, like everybody else, and to erase doubt is the hardest thing of any journey, I think.</span> <span id="s1152">If you don’t have any more doubts, then you are a saint.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: Did you -- I -- I felt that you had told me over the phone that perhaps one -- one way that the experiences during the Holocaust stayed with you is that you decided not to have children, is that -- is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: That was my husband’s decision, more or less.</span> <span id="s1155">And then I had this toxic pregnancy, or whatever it was, it was never found out.</span> <span id="s1156">But I had a very bad case of hepatitis, and was sick for seven weeks in Presbyterian Hospital in New York.</span> <span id="s1157">So after that, my gynecologist, who was Dr. Gisela Pearl said, “If you don’t want children, just don’t have them.”</span> <span id="s1158">And the sex life was not the most important thing for me.</span> <span id="s1159">Maybe when I was younger, yes, but not at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: But it wasn’t as much an active decision not to bring children into the world, as --</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: No, it was not an act of precision, but my husband took precaution always.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: He -- he felt he did not want children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: He didn’t -- he didn’t want.</span> <span id="s1164">He had a strong feelings that the suffering on this planet is very -- he said planet earth is one of the most insignificant planets in this universe.</span> <span id="s1165">And he learned that from Gerchiev, the Russian philosopher mystic.</span> <span id="s1166">And he dabbled into that, and why perpetuate this race, and we really don’t know if we ever will know.</span> <span id="s1167">The real, final answer is -- every scientist is groping for it, every f -- philosopher, and ever -- every religious thing are -- is
