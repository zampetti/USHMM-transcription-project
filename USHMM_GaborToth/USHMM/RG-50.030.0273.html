Jew who would fight for his Judaism any chance he would get.</span> <span id="s43">See, in those years Jews were already taunted a lot, being called names and even physically pushed around and my father would go out at night with his snappy walking stick and when somebody would taunt him or he would come across a young Nazi boy he would try to hit them with his cane which sometimes got him into trouble and my mother was always worried about him.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: I'm trying to get a sense of just the build up on the anti‑semitism and whether this was a fact of life before Hitler came to power and how it progressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: It was already before Hitler came to power.</span> <span id="s46">There were already signs of anti‑semitism and then when Hitler came to power, as I said, in 1934 most of the men had joined the Nazi party.</span> <span id="s47">The youngsters were in the Hitler youth and they had horrast us Jews quite a bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Well, they would call us names.</span> <span id="s50">They sometimes would push me around in school and out.</span> <span id="s51">They were belittling us and, you know, it was not too pleasant.</span> <span id="s52">I mean, some of the Gentiles, I had some Gentile girlfriends, but later on when they joined the Hitler youth they were so brainwashed against Jews that former friends would not dare to associate with a Jew any longer.</span> <span id="s53">Because in a small town, you know, everybody knew everybody.</span> <span id="s54">It was different in a large city like Jovian (ph.).</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: How did you make sense of it?</span> <span id="s56">Did you talk about it with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Yes, certainly we talked with my parents also with other youngsters.</span> <span id="s58">You know, we were talking about these things.</span> <span id="s59">Aboutthey were invisible because, you know, the Nazis got stronger and stronger and life became more difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Did your parents have any lose of ____________ in their life?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s62">We hadwe were desperately trying to get out of Germany.</span> <span id="s63">And my parents really never had a chance.</span> <span id="s64">We had no relatives in America who could have sent us an affidavit or any place else where we could have gotten us out.</span> <span id="s65">The only possibilities for my parents were either to go to Palestine or to Shanghai in China which my father was afraid he would not tolerate the climate because he was suffering from athsma.</span> <span id="s66">Then my parents at least wanted me to get out and I had a fairly good chance.</span> <span id="s67">The director of the household school in Berlin had immigrated to England and she opened a children's home there.</span> <span id="s68">She sent papers to some of us young girls to come to England and work with her in the children's home, but somehow the papers meant for me got lost.</span> <span id="s69">I have a feeling they must have been sold to somebody and by the time the director was able to make out new papers it, unfortunately, was too late.</span> <span id="s70">So in 1938 when I came back from household school and moved in with my parents again the persecution of Jews in Berlin had become quite bad already and then later on we were forced to wear the Jewish star.</span> <span id="s71">We had to take the added first names of Sarah and Isreal.</span> <span id="s72">Doctors, lawyers and other professionals could no longer attend to their professions.</span> <span id="s73">Jews were not allowed in the university.</span> <span id="s74">In fact, already in '39 we were not allowed to go to the theater, to the opera, the movies even.</span> <span id="s75">So our life was very limited for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: Whatwere youdid you see a lot of difficulties in the streets or round ups, anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Well, yes.</span> <span id="s78">____________ happened on November 9, 1938 and I saw the destruction of Jewish business' and Jewish homes and there was terrible vandalism and it was just a horrible sight.</span> <span id="s79">Fortunately, somehow they missed our apartment and we were not directly affected by that.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Did you hear it happen at the ____________?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s82">Well, heard what went on.</span> <span id="s83">We also, you know, if you lived in Berlin was pretty close to the sports palace in which Hitler frequently spoke.</span> <span id="s84">So right near our house we had these parades of Hitler and his whole enteras coming around quite frequently.</span> <span id="s85">That was about what happened in those years.</span> <span id="s86">You know</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Did you feel at risk when you saw these parades come on?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: Well, you were always at risk especially, you know, once we start wearing the Jewish star, butwell, fortunately, II, personally, my parents, we were never really bothered too much by that.</span> <span id="s89">I mean, we could not associate with Gentiles anymore.</span> <span id="s90">In fact, one of my father's brothers had been married to a Gentile woman for years.</span> <span id="s91">In fact, he had converted to Christianity and the brothers could not see each other because they were afraid to be seen with Jews because</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: This is a bit of a digression, but what happened to that brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: That brother survived in Berlin, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: As a Christian?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: As a Christian which was unusual because I know of other people where one spouse was Jewish and the other spouse had to suffer for it and also was reported, so that was quite unusual.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Was there, kind of an inward growth of the Jewish community because you were so isolated from the rest of the city?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s98">In a way it was, of course, you know, we moved to Berlin late, so we really didn't have too many friends.</span> <span id="s99">We had relatives in Berlin and on the outskirts of Berlin I had an aunt who had a beautiful villa in a beautiful suburb of Berlin where I actually had spent a lot of my school vacation when we still lived in Penslo.</span> <span id="s100">And my mother had sisters in Berlin and some of us were together mostly with family and relatives inin Jewish France.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: WasI mean, were there ever by the Jewish community to kind of take care oftake care of each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Yes, there were.</span> <span id="s103">You know, the Jewish community set up a lot of opportunities for us Jews especially us Jewish youngsters.</span> <span id="s104">For instance, in 1940 I found out that the Jewish community had established some dress making courses and I enrolled in one of these courses.</span> <span id="s105">Unfortunately I could not quite finish it because before the end of it I was ordered to force labor.</span> <span id="s106">That was in April of 1941.</span> <span id="s107">And the forced labor I had to do was in a large commercial laundry on the outskirts of Berlin.</span> <span id="s108">I had quite a lengthy train ride getting there.</span> <span id="s109">At that time the war in Europe was on and British bombers would come over Berlin practically every night and bomb Berlin.</span> <span id="s110">So we, Jewish, forced labors worked on the four p.m. to midnight shift and we had to sort dirty laundry for the German army.</span> <span id="s111">Well, on my way home after midnight I was usually caught in an air raid on the train and had to go to a shelter at the Neil (ph.) station and sometimes I didn't get home till eight, nine o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s112">That's how long the air raid lasted.</span> <span id="s113">Once in a while I would just make it home and immediately had to go into our cellar which was set up as an air raid shelter.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: Was the work hard?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Yeah, well, we had to work hard.</span> <span id="s116">You know, dirty laundry e had somebody standing over us to see that wewe didn't sit still.</span> <span id="s117">We really worked all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: I want to ask you to go back a minute because</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q:before you had mentioned to me that as a school girl</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q:there was a lot of anti‑semitism in the school itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: Can you tell me</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Well, I'll tell you for instance I had a primary teacher in my school who was a stanch in the semite (ph.) and she always preached anti‑semitism.</span> <span id="s126">Hatred for Jews.</span> <span id="s127">And of course that dropped off on the young students who already were in the Hitler youth and were indoctrinated anyway and therefore made life miserable.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Was she mean to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: She wasno, she always made an exception of me because she had known my family.</span> <span id="s130">One of my father's sisters had been a teacher years earlier together with her.</span> <span id="s131">So she was familiar with my family and she always said "Well, of course there are exception and Isle is one of these exceptions, but in general, all Jews are bad and all Jews are doing bad things," and this was the jist of her story.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Was that a relief to you that you were an exception?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: No, I felt terribly embarrassed by it.</span> <span id="s134">Especially there was another Jewish girl in my class who was of course was meant by all this insinuations and it made me feel very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Is there anymore, in a detail you can give me about the persecutions or what you saw and heard ininin the atmosphere in Berlin before you were deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Well, you know, in Berlin we really kept pretty much to ourselves except, you know, getting together with our family.</span> <span id="s137">There really wasn't much contact with the Gentile population.</span> <span id="s138">They were to stay from us anyhow.</span> <span id="s139">And well, you saw that very often even before the pro bone of 1938 that a Jewish source would be vandalized and Jewish homes, you know, they werepainted swastikas on them and, in general, these were the things that stand out in my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Did people continue going to synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Yes, people did go to synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: So that wasn't totally restricted?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: No, that was one thing that was not restricted at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: And your father continued to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Um, my father, no.</span> <span id="s146">My father only got permission to move to Berlin under the regulation that he would not work in Berlin.</span> <span id="s147">That he could not make a living.</span> <span id="s148">Actually, we had to live on the pension and some papers, you know, treasury papers or things like that that we had.</span> <span id="s149">So that he could not work anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Howdid your family have friends or did they have any sense of what was coming?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s152">We definitely had a feeling that we wanted to get out of Germany desperately.</span> <span id="s153">I think I mentioned that before that we didn't have a chance to get out.</span> <span id="s154">Yeah, no.</span> <span id="s155">My mother, she was very a pestimate person, pessimistic, and then the news of the pertration (ph.) started to come about.</span> <span id="s156">She suggested that we should commit suicide together because we would never survive any kind of deprecation (ph.), but I sort of talked her out of it and said "Oh, you'd be surprised.</span> <span id="s157">We will manage.</span> <span id="s158">We will live through it," and I still had hoped that it wouldn't be quite as bad as theas she had anticipated.</span> <span id="s159">So then while I was doing the forced labor and that laundry in January of 1942, the beginning of January, we got a notice that we would be resettled to the east.</span> <span id="s160">They did not mention where to, just to the east.</span> <span id="s161">And we were suppose to pack our clothing, bedding, a kerosene heater, and possibly sewing machine which I had of course and which we packed, we packed all these things and never saw any of it again.</span> <span id="s162">Then on January 11, 1942 the German secret police came to our house and took us away and they sealed off our apartment which most likely later on was plundered.</span> <span id="s163">They took us to a gathering place at the synagogue in Berlin where a whole group was assembled for this transport which consisted of 1,037 people.</span> <span id="s164">Mostly middle aged and older people.</span> <span id="s165">Very few young ones.</span> <span id="s166">My mother discovered one young girl by the name of Stella.</span> <span id="s167">She introduced me to her and we befriended each other and went to the first part of the diplocation together.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: But did they tell you when you got there anything more about where you were going or what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: No, they just said "To the east."</span> <span id="s170">We would be sent to the east to work there.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: Were they polite?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: Not too polite.</span> <span id="s173">I mean, they just out right told us we would be resettled to work in the east.</span> <span id="s174">Then we stayed in that synagogue of two days.</span> <span id="s175">We slept on the floor of course, being that many people.</span> <span id="s176">And on the 13th of January the Jewish communities made sandwiches for us to take along on the trip.</span> <span id="s177">And on the 13th we were put aboard an old, unheated train for our trip east.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: What was the general mood like?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: Well, we were all quite depressed of course.</span> <span id="s180">And onon this old train.</span> <span id="s181">Our mood became more somber and it was really bad.</span> <span id="s182">It was so cold that even the drinking water froze.</span> <span id="s183">My father was not able to take his asthma medication which had kept him asthma free for several years before and he suffered his first asthma attack on the train to Lega (ph.).</span> <span id="s184">Then the arrived in Lega after four days on the train.</span> <span id="s185">We arrived at the Skiatave (ph.) freight station outside of Lega.</span> <span id="s186">And we were told by the SS that there were trucks available for the transport to the ghetto which was seven kilometers away, but there were not enough trucks for everybody.</span> <span id="s187">Just for the older and infirm people and everybody people would have to walk those seven kilometers.</span> <span id="s188">So my father got upon the truck and my mother was first standing in line next to me and then she suddenly said "You know, your father might have difficulty understanding orders the SS might give him," because he was somewhat hard of hearing from an accident in his childhood.</span> <span id="s189">So she left my side and got up on the truck with my father and that was the last time I ever saw my parents.</span> <span id="s190">I was barely 19 years old at the time.</span> <span id="s191">So the rest of the group of us marched towards the ghetto.</span> <span id="s192">The seven kilometers as I said.</span> <span id="s193">It was 40 degrees below zero.</span> <span id="s194">The snow was very deep and it was very difficult to march those seven kilometers.</span> <span id="s195">I was luck.</span> <span id="s196">Before we were deported a relative had given me ski boats and I was wearing these ski boats all through my time in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s197">Summer and winter.</span> <span id="s198">Um, so here every time, you know, somebody slowed down a little bit on the march, the SS would use their rifle butts and kick them in the rear to turn them on until we finally made it to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: And when you got to the ghetto did anyone ask "Where's my mother.</span> <span id="s200">Where's my grandfather?"</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: Oh, absolutely.</span> <span id="s202">The first thing I did was frantically look for my parents and so did all the other people who had left parents on the truck.</span> <span id="s203">And the truck never arrived at the ghettos.</span> <span id="s204">We were told by the SS that the trucks had been taken to Dunamenda (ph.) for the people to work at the canning factory.</span> <span id="s205">And, in fact, there was no such thing as Dunamenda and the trucks were taken directly into the woods which we found out only later and the people had to strip and were shoot into open mass graves.</span> <span id="s206">All this, of course, we found out later.</span> <span id="s207">Meanwhile, we settled down in the houses or shacks that were assigned to us because the ghetto was in the worse slum area of Lega.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Lega, actually, was a beautiful town, but this was in a very bad area and it had occupied by the Leucoline (ph.) troops.</span> <span id="s209">It was a Leucoline ghetto before we Germans arrived there.</span> <span id="s210">So</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: They weren't there anymore?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: No, there was nobodyyes, there were some out ofwe found out, we were told that out of 34,000 Leucoline Jews, who had lived in the Leucoline ghetto were all murdered except for 4,000 young men who had occupations that were important to the war effort.</span> <span id="s213">And they were separated from us German Jews.</span> <span id="s214">They were in a Leucoline ghetto what we called in the German ghettos, separated by wire fences.</span> <span id="s215">There were some gates in the fence and on weekends the Leucoline Jews men would sometimes get permission to come over to the German ghetto and visit with us.</span> <span id="s216">And they all told us that they had all lost their entire families.</span> <span id="s217">That they all had been killed before the first German transport arrived.</span> <span id="s218">In fact, we were told that the first German transport in November of 1941, and when they came to the ghetto there was stillthere was still food in thein the houses, in the ovens and on the table.</span> <span id="s219">The sign that the previous occupants must have just left before.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: But when you got there it was</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: When we got there, no, there were several transports before ours.</span> <span id="s222">The ghetto was separated into different groups from different parts of Germany and also from Austria and some from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s223">Each had their own area in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s224">And each school had their own tempt elders and the chief of labor assignments which were Jews that were assigned to do the selection for the outside labor detail.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Soso the real ghetto was divided.</span> <span id="s226">There were various communities?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Yeah, I mean, we were all together, but differentin different streets.</span> <span id="s228">In fact, the streets were named after the area where we had come from.</span> <span id="s229">There was Berlina Strasusa (ph.), Cologne (ph.) Street and all these various, you know, we gave them the names of the people who were living there now from German.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Did all of the people that were in the German ghetto get along or that you communicated?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s232">Yeah.</span> <span id="s233">And in the beginning in the ghetto, families were still allowed to be together which was a good thing and didn't last all too long because every few weeks there would be a selectionoh, yeah.</span> <span id="s234">When we first go there I was assigned to shoveling snow in the sleet of Lega for the whole winter.</span> <span id="s235">That was an assignment.</span> <span id="s236">In the morning we would be escorted out of the ghetto to the place of work.</span> <span id="s237">In the evening we would be escorted back and always in the ghetto they had gallows set up.</span> <span id="s238">And we were always led by the gallows and usually there was a corpse hanging there.</span> <span id="s239">Being hanged because they had bartered for some food on the outside which was strictly forbidden.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: I'm afraid we are going to run out of the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s242">The Leucoline Jews had pretty bad feelings toward us German Jews of course because all their families had been murdered to make room for us.</span> <span id="s243">And they had lost everybody.</span> <span id="s244">Sobut</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Was there tension between you?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: Well, I personally didn't notice that much tension.</span> <span id="s247">Maybe, in general, I didn't notice it too much.</span> <span id="s248">Um, these work details, the outside work details, went on, you know, these work details had to do with the war effort.</span> <span id="s249">You know, working for the German army and theand the war industry.</span> <span id="s250">And some assignments were reversed and others, they were always selection.</span> <span id="s251">Every few weeks we would be assembled and sent either to the right side or left side.</span> <span id="s252">One side meant being marked for extermination.</span> <span id="s253">The other side meant being selected for work detail.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Did you know that at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: No.</span> <span id="s256">Wenot right in the beginning and then later on, of course, we realized what was happening every time there was a selection and we didn't see those people anymore that had been sent to the one side.</span> <span id="s257">So we had a pretty good idea that they had been sent to the woods too andand shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Did you think when you first got that that the ghetto had been cleared specifically for you in therefore you would be safe?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: I don't know if we really felt that way.</span> <span id="s260">It seemed that way, really.</span> <span id="s261">It seemed that way, but we were all pretty much in the same predicament.</span> <span id="s262">We all had to work and as long as we were able to work and be of help to the Germans we werewe would be aloud to work.</span> <span id="s263">Otherwise that was the end of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Well, you were talking aboutabout the selections</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q:that I think you learned</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Yeah, we learned pretty fast that the people who had been sent to one side would be sent to their death.</span> <span id="s268">That they were being taken to the woods and also shoot into the open graves.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Tell me a little bit more about how the ghetto bureaucracy was set up and what people's responsibilities were.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: Well, like I said before, there wasfirst of all, was the SS ghetto comman.</span> <span id="s271">Then all his under links, all our guards.</span> <span id="s272">They selected German Jews from each school to serve as group elders or as chief of labor assignments and theythat was their responsibility.</span> <span id="s273">And that was about as far as it went.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">You know</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Did theywere they respected by the</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: Oh, there was also ghetto police.</span> <span id="s277">Some of our young Jewish men had to man the gates that were separating the ghettos and were used as our own internal police.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: You were talking about the people who guard the camp and you say SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Yeah, when I saw SS I meant the German SS as well as the Leucoline SS.</span> <span id="s280">And frankly the Leucoline SS were even worse then the German SS.</span> <span id="s281">They tookthey were real anti‑semitism.</span> <span id="s282">They took their jobs very seriously and, you know, they were, besides the hangings, the regular hangings of people who had bothered for foodby the way, the first transports that had come into the ghetto, when they first came into the houses they found that the apartments had been pretty much plundered.</span> <span id="s283">They had been destroyed.</span> <span id="s284">All of the valuables had been taken out.</span> <span id="s285">But once in awhile hidden away some place we would discover a piece of jewelry or something and then even though we had never gotten our own clothing in the ghetto there was a clothing depot set up thatwhere we issued our clothing and these things were used to bother on the outside for food.</span> <span id="s286">A piece of bread or whatever we could get.</span> <span id="s287">Because you could not live on the food rations we got in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s288">We were given 200 grams of bread a day issued once a week and ____________ potatoes and old cabbage leaves and fish heads.</span> <span id="s289">And once in a great while a small portion of horse meat which was a great treat.</span> <span id="s290">So as I said, you had to supplement your food through outside bartering.</span> <span id="s291">Otherwise you could not exist.</span> <span id="s292">So you had to take your chances of being hanged.</span> <span id="s293">Sometimes one of our SS commendans would shoot people on the spot besides the hangings.</span> <span id="s294">So we had shootings and hangings all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Who were you bartering with?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: With the Leucoline Gentiles that we met on the outside.</span> <span id="s297">You know, when our guards weren't looking or so.</span> <span id="s298">And they knew all ready.</span> <span id="s299">They would see us day after day and they would know that we had something to give them and they brought us some bread or something edible.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Did you ever talk to someone on what was going on when they</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: No, we couldn't really.</span> <span id="s302">First of all, we didn't know the Leucoline language.</span> <span id="s303">See, and in that respect, the Leucoline Jews, the few surviving Leucoline Jews were better off.</span> <span id="s304">They knewknew the language and also some of them escaped from the ghetto and joined the Protestants because they were able to speak the language and they could go in the country side and meet farmers and some of them got away with it.</span> <span id="s305">And later on we found out that they were working with the Protestants.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: But none of you were able to?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s308">One of the Leucoline fellows once suggested I shouldhe would escape and I should come with him.</span> <span id="s309">And I said it would be out of the question because we would certainly be found out because I don't speak the language.</span> <span id="s310">So I turned that offer down.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Where did you live in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: Well, at first, as I said, we lived with the group that we had come with from Berlin in these houses.</span> <span id="s313">Some houses were literally like three story buildings.</span> <span id="s314">Others were just shacks, but all of them had outhouses.</span> <span id="s315">You know, they had no toilets inside.</span> <span id="s316">Sowell, life was still bearable because as I said, families were still together except for those who had been singled out andduring the selections.</span> <span id="s317">This came later on that the families were separated.</span> <span id="s318">In the summer of 1942, that was the first summer there, there was another selection and 50 young girls including my girlfriend Stella who I met in Berlin, we were selected for a work detail at the Baltic (ph.) seashore.</span> <span id="s319">This was the best assignment ever.</span> <span id="s320">We had to fix up formally Jewish homes, Nazi confiscated estates that were suppose to be made ready for recreation places for high SS officials and high German officials to come there for theduring the summer for their recreation.</span> <span id="s321">We were housed in the, what formally must have been servants quarters and we had no waterunfortunately we had no water.</span> <span id="s322">We couldn't was ourselves or bath.</span> <span id="s323">So at night after dark the SS would take us to the Baltic sea to wash ourselves.</span> <span id="s324">We got our food from a soup kettle.</span> <span id="s325">Thia was the most obstrensed (ph.) soup than the food we had had in the ghetto, so we could easily survive on that.</span> <span id="s326">We got bread.</span> <span id="s327">One man had been taken along from the ghetto besides us 50 girls who operated the soup kettles.</span> <span id="s328">So then we girls also cleaned the homes for the occupants.</span> <span id="s329">I, myself, had the gardening detail.</span> <span id="s330">So as I said, this was a very good assignment.</span> <span id="s331">You know, we weren't beaten.</span> <span id="s332">We weren't arrested much.</span> <span id="s333">Yes, we were under observation of the S, but they pretty much left us alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: How were you chosen for this?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: Well, the commandant must have looked over us young girls and who ever suited his fancy he thought we would do for that assignment.</span> <span id="s336">So I befriended five of the girls on this labor detail and we decided that once we would get back to the ghetto we would try to move together.</span> <span id="s337">Where as, you know, they all had been from different districts in Germany and we had all lived in different places.</span> <span id="s338">So after the summer was over we got back to the ghetto and our life went on as usual in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s339">We went on our work assignments and as usual.</span> <span id="s340">Then inyeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: What other work assignments now?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: Well, you know something.</span> <span id="s343">It's really not clear in my mind anymore.</span> <span id="s344">It all had to do with the army, with the, you know, fixing up uniforms for the army and shipments, doing shipping and prettysome work was very hard and we were very much abused by our captures.</span> <span id="s345">Others were not quite as difficult.</span> <span id="s346">You know, they were a little more lenient and so that was a little easier to handle.</span> <span id="s347">But all this time our life was in constant danger.</span> <span id="s348">First of all because of the bartering and a chance of being hanged or shot.</span> <span id="s349">And secondly, because of the constant selections.</span> <span id="s350">We were afraid to get sick, of course.</span> <span id="s351">Which happened to me andin the early fall of 1943 I got very sick.</span> <span id="s352">I got jaundice and hepatitis.</span> <span id="s353">And I was put into the ghetto hospital which was set up instead by a German inmate doctors and nurses who were in the ghetto with us.</span> <span id="s354">There weren't many medications available for us, but over some weeks I got better.</span> <span id="s355">Never really regained my strength, but they discharged me after several weeks.</span> <span id="s356">But I was too week to go on outside assignments, so Ioh, by this I forgot to mention.</span> <span id="s357">When we had gotten back, the six girls from thefrom the work commander at the Baltic sea, we did move together into a very old shack at the end of the ghetto that had been unoccupied.</span> <span id="s358">So we were under the jurisdiction of the Colon group.</span> <span id="s359">So now, when I wasn't able to out on outside work detail I talked to the chief of the labor assignment and told him of my predicament and he said "Oh, I tell you what.</span> <span id="s360">You can help my older daughter Lilly who has to take care old my six young children because my wife goes outside to work to bring in some food for the family."</span> <span id="s361">Well, this for me was great.</span> <span id="s362">I enjoyed being with the children.</span> <span id="s363">I enjoyed being with a family because I hadn't had a family in all this time.</span> <span id="s364">I lived with my friends there in the, you know, in the shack, but the daytime I spent with my friends there.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: This just brings up a question before you were gone.</span> <span id="s366">There were a lot of children in this ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Yes, at that time there still were a lot of children until later.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: Were there activities for the kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: Yes, they did have activities for the children.</span> <span id="s370">I'm really not too clear on that.</span> <span id="s371">I think they did have some schooling and some play groups, you know, where older youngsters took care of the young children.</span> <span id="s372">And I'm really not too clear anymore, but there were some activities for the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Were there activities for the rest of the people?</span> <span id="s374">Were there vocational courses or was there religious activities?</span> <span id="s375">Was there any culture?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Well, any religious activities would have to be held in the various apartments.</span> <span id="s377">You know, there was nono synagoguenothing of that kind and they were held in secret.</span> <span id="s378">Services were held, you know, there were some Orthodox Jews there who held services in their apartment and invited some other Orthodox people to participate in them.</span> <span id="s379">I understand that there once in awhile was a concert.</span> <span id="s380">You know, I was never part of it and I really wasn't personally there.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">But I've heard that once in awhile there were some performances.</span> <span id="s382">You know, some of our ghetto inmates still had some, I don't know how they managed to get instruments unless they found them inwhen they got to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s383">You know, left behind by the Laclians.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">It's quite possible because everything had been taken away from us.</span> <span id="s385">You know, any kind of jewelry had been taken away from us.</span> <span id="s386">Also, fur coats.</span> <span id="s387">Everything, you know, and that was all sent back to Germany for, you know, for use there.</span> <span id="s388">And, you know, as I said, e never saw any of our own clothing anymore.</span> <span id="s389">Only, you know, if it happened to be in the clothing depot.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: So whatafter you came home from work in the evening what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: Well, we had</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s393">One second.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Well, in the evenings of course we cooked our meals from the meager rations that we had and sat around the dinner table and had conversations.</span> <span id="s395">We had found some books in the apartments from the Leucoline Jews we were reading.</span> <span id="s396">But we went to bed pretty early because we worked very hard and we were very tired.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Do you remember any of those conversations and the types of things you would talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Well, actually, we reminisced more about our childhood and about the good times than we wanted to dwell on the hard times that we had there.</span> <span id="s399">Which actually became worse later on.</span> <span id="s400">Well, anyway, while I was helping my friend Lilly to take care of these younger children I had a relapse of my hepatitis and the jaundice and I was taken back to the hospital.</span> <span id="s401">This was in the later fall of 1946.</span> <span id="s402">And I was in the hospital again for several weeks and improved to some extent, but really not enough to be discharged.</span> <span id="s403">So one day my girlfriend Lilly who had visited me regularly at the hospital, came by ____________.</span> <span id="s404">There was no visiting time and she called me at the window and said to me "I'm very glad to hear that you're coming out of the hospital tomorrow."</span> <span id="s405">Well, I understood immediately what that message meant and I told the doctor, the chief doctor in the hospital, that I would be leaving the hospital the next day and he said "Not with my permission.</span> <span id="s406">You are in no condition to be released from the hospital."</span> <span id="s407">I said "With or without your permission I'm leaving."</span> <span id="s408">And so here I was barely able to stand on my feet, but I left the hospital the next day.</span> <span id="s409">It so happened that Lilly's father, the chief of labor details, had gotten wind of the fact that there would be athat the hospital would be evacuated.</span> <span id="s410">All these people would be sent away to their deaths and that's why he had told his daughter to warn me of that.</span> <span id="s411">So I came out.</span> <span id="s412">This was in November of '43.</span> <span id="s413">I came out of the hospital and sure enough a few days later the hospital population was taken out and put to death, but all the other ghetto inmates had to stand for selection.</span> <span id="s414">And this time not only were the infirm people taken away, all the older ones who were left and there were not many of them, but mothers with young children.</span> <span id="s415">All young children were put to one side and we were asked at what places we had worked.</span> <span id="s416">And I of course have nothaving not had worked on the outside, lied that I had been working at the Aviar (ph.) which was the army clothing depot.</span> <span id="s417">Otherwise, it would have meant death for me too.</span> <span id="s418">And luckily I got away with it.</span> <span id="s419">I was putput on the right side.</span> <span id="s420">So all these mothers with the young children got taken away that time to their death.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: When you say that the hospital was evacuated</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Yeah, well</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q:did you know where these people wereI mean, what happened?</span> <span id="s424">How did you know what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: Well, we had a pretty fairly good idea that it didn't mean anything good.</span> <span id="s426">That they were meant for death because, you know, there were previous selections in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s427">So we had a fairly good idea and my girlfriend Lilly actually saved my life by getting me out there in time.</span> <span id="s428">Otherwise, I certainly wouldn't be around anymore.</span> <span id="s429">So now, this meant, this was November '43, that meant the end of the Steliga (ph.) ghetto.</span> <span id="s430">All the ghetto inmates that were left were sent to concentration camp, Kisavold (ph.), outside of Lega.</span> <span id="s431">And some of them stayed there for work details there.</span> <span id="s432">Most of us were sent to outside installations where we were housed at our work places.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">So I was sent to this Aviar (ph.), to the army clothing depot where we were housed in barracks that had double or triple bunks where we slept and we were given a mesket (ph.) and a canteen and we worked there taking care of the clothing for the army.</span> <span id="s434">Sorting it.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Shipping it out and all these things connected with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: How many of you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: You know, I don't really recall.</span> <span id="s438">There were quite a few of us.</span> <span id="s439">Maybe a 100.</span> <span id="s440">I'm really not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: You weren't in Camp Kisserwal (ph.) were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: No, I was lucky.</span> <span id="s443">We were only processed in Camp Kisserwal.</span> <span id="s444">Now, all these outside installations were under the jurisdiction of Camp Kisserwal.</span> <span id="s445">So thethe food there, again, we got soup that was made with potato peels and we got some bread.</span> <span id="s446">It was sufficient, but just barely so.</span> <span id="s447">That we could just live on it and do our work.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Were you with the other girlfriend that you had been living with?</span> <span id="s449">Did they make it?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: No.</span> <span id="s451">In this particular work detail I was not with any of my friends.</span> <span id="s452">These were all other whom I met in the ghetto, but nobody that I was really friends with.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Were you pretty strong or did you feel</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Well, I really wasn't strong yet because I hadn't fully recovered from thefrom the jaundice and the hepatitis, so I was quite week yet.</span> <span id="s455">But I mustered all my strength and did my work.</span> <span id="s456">Then, this was from November '43.</span> <span id="s457">July of '44 we were still working there.</span> <span id="s458">Even other people had other work, outside detail work details, but all having to do with the army.</span> <span id="s459">In July of '44 a delegation came from Camp Kisserwal and Viverman (ph.) had our hair ____________ off.</span> <span id="s460">So now we were all bald and we were given prison clothing.</span> <span id="s461">Then in August we were suddenly assembled and taken away from our work places and we were put on freighters of bargers (ph.) you might call them.</span> <span id="s462">Open bargers.</span> <span id="s463">Pressed in like sardines.</span> <span id="s464">You know, that how many of us were there and we were being shipped out again.</span> <span id="s465">The conditions on these bargers were terrible.</span> <span id="s466">I mean, we were just laying one on top of another.</span> <span id="s467">We barely had a little water to drink and it was just horrible conditions.</span> <span id="s468">Now, on the barge I was very lucky.</span> <span id="s469">All of a sudden I found my girlfriend Lilly and two other friends from the ghetto, Margaret (ph.) and Gerta who were sisters and who were there with their mother.</span> <span id="s470">And all of a sudden the fourthe five of us, actually, with the mother, were together and from that moment on the five of us were together until our liberation actually.</span> <span id="s471">So we were happy to have found each other on the bargers.</span> <span id="s472">The trip on the barger took three days and took us to the port of Dansic (ph.) or ____________ as it was called in Polish.</span> <span id="s473">And we were shipped to Camp Stitof (ph.).</span> <span id="s474">Now, Stitof</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: How much informationdid you know where you were going or why you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: No, we had no idea.</span> <span id="s477">They just put us on the freighter and</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: Had you at this point had any information about the war?</span> <span id="s479">Did you have a sense of what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: Well, somehow we sensed that thethe war was not going to well for the Germans.</span> <span id="s481">That's why they kept shipping us from place to place and that the Russians must have been coming closer.</span> <span id="s482">We sensed that.</span> <span id="s483">We didn't really know for sure, but we sensed that.</span> <span id="s484">So when we saw Stitof, it was a horrible sight.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">You know, the chimneys were smoking and the smell was like stuck yards.</span> <span id="s486">And we immediately thought that if we had to stay there we would never make it out alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">So</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: What did you see when you went in ____________ together, people in there?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: Well, we saw other people behindthere were different sections in Stitof.</span> <span id="s490">They had different areas all separated by barbed wire where different people from other camps, I guess, had been assembled.</span> <span id="s491">And luckily we were kept together in one area behind barbed wire.</span> <span id="s492">And we didn't stay there long.</span> <span id="s493">I think we were there only maybe a week.</span> <span id="s494">Not even a week, so we were very lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: So you weren't working or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Not at Stitof.</span> <span id="s497">We were sent away to work details.</span> <span id="s498">So luckily my four girlfriends and the mother and I were selected together.</span> <span id="s499">We were all together a group of 1,000 women who were sent to the Polish country side which had been taken over by the Germans to dig trenches for the German army.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: We stopped when you had ride from Stotif to the ____________ side, but I wanted to ask you to go back a little bit more to the Raga (ph.) ghetto and maybe tell me a little bit more about the lifestyle in there and whether you had social life, whether you worked everyday, whether you celebrated holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Yes, first of all, a lot of the Jewish girls befriended the Leucoline Jews who came over on the weekend to be withwith us girls.</span> <span id="s502">And as a matter of fact somesome of them later on after the liberation married them because, I mean, most of these fellows had been previously married and had lost their family.</span> <span id="s503">But we hadthere also were, of course, boyfriends, girlfriends in the German ghetto, you know, that were together and on weekends we enjoyed each others company and the Leucoline fellows would come over and we would socialize together.</span> <span id="s504">We would get together in groups of two couples, three couples in somebody's apartment we would get together.</span> <span id="s505">And, in general, enjoy each others company and enjoy the day off from work.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: Oh, you had a day off.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: Well, yes.</span> <span id="s508">We had a day off from work.</span> <span id="s509">That's on the weekends when the Leucoline Jews also had their dayday off from work.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: So that you had the freedom to go back and forth between the Leucoline ____________ when the German ____________.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: No.</span> <span id="s512">We German Jews were not allowed to go to the Leucoline ghettos and I think the Leucoline fellows had to get special permission to come over to visit in the German ghettos.</span> <span id="s513">Which they got quite readily.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Did the Leucoline Jews get any kind of favorite treatment in terms of work assignments or freedom?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: Well, I believe that their work assignments were better because they had special skills that were needed for the war effort.</span> <span id="s516">Tool makers and whatever other tools they had that came in handy for the war effort and for that reason I believe that they had preferred treatment at work.</span> <span id="s517">Whereas we just were assigned, you know, general labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: What were the differences between the way men and women were treated.</span> <span id="s519">How did you feel as a women?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: No, lots of time we women were treated just as rough as the men.</span> <span id="s521">Of course, well, some of them might have treated some of the young girls a little bit better, maybe, than they would have men or older women.</span> <span id="s522">Which applies also to the SS.</span> <span id="s523">You know, some of the German SS sort of favored some of the German girls and saw to it that they had better work assignments.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: Were there girls that you knew who would take great advantage of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: Well, I personally didn't have that experience.</span> <span id="s526">I mean, my girlfriend Lilly and Margaret and Gerta and myself, we didn't have that experience.</span> <span id="s527">My friend Stella who I had met in Berlin on the transport befriended a Leucoline Jew and later on after the liberation she married him.</span> <span id="s528">But, in general, you know, we girls were together and socialized.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: And those relationships would be under girls that were important to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: Oh, very important.</span> <span id="s531">Very important because you could always rely on them to help you in any situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: What aboutyou mentioned that people might be able to pray in private at home, what about when Jewish holidays arose?</span> <span id="s533">Were you aware?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: Well, we Orthodox Jews, of course, tried to observe the Jewish holidays.</span> <span id="s535">In fact, the Youngkiper (ph.) which wasn't difficult anyhow because we didn't get much to eat in any case.</span> <span id="s536">I remember on Passover people tried to barter for flour instead of bread.</span> <span id="s537">And Lilly's mother, for instance, was able to bring some flour into the ghetto and while we of course never given any matza by the Natzis, we managed to bake matza ourselves.</span> <span id="s538">Lilly and I for instance, through her father who had talked to some Leucoline Jews and knew that they had some ovens available in the Leucoline ghetto.</span> <span id="s539">We sneaked over in the middle of the night with our flour and we baked matza for ____________.</span> <span id="s540">And so her father conducted the seta (ph.) as much as you could.</span> <span id="s541">You might even have had hagolta (ph.) which you might have found in the Leucoline ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Was that risky for you to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Oh, absolutely.</span> <span id="s544">We risked our lives by doing it, but then you risk your life everyday.</span> <span id="s545">Even bartering for food or anything like that.</span> <span id="s546">So that was nothing unusual.</span> <span id="s547">You know, we forget everyday could be our last day and we tried not to dwell on that.</span> <span id="s548">We dwelled on the past and on better life and were hoping that we might survive and have a better future.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Didn't that give you a sense of excitement or pride or something ____________ ____________?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: Yes, it made us happy and proud that we were able to observe a Jewish holiday and even with matza.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: In a way that's a form of religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Oh, absolutely.</span> <span id="s553">Try to resist.</span> <span id="s554">I mean, there was not much resistance that we could matza in our condition.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: Do you remember the ____________ in general?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s557">We were there for quite some time.</span> <span id="s558">No, really nothing too much that I can add to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: And I want you to pick up now</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: Where we had left off?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q:you had been in Stitof about a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: And you were housed</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Well, there were house and barrack there behind barbed wire and we were assembled.</span> <span id="s565">Like I said, a 1,000 women were picked out for this work detail.</span> <span id="s566">Not all of us were from the German ghettos.</span> <span id="s567">We had Jewish women there from Laclia, from Lithoania and Istonia (ph.).</span> <span id="s568">All the three different countries.</span> <span id="s569">All the countries.</span> <span id="s570">So here we were in the Polish country side assigned to digging the trenches.</span> <span id="s571">We were housed in a wooden tent with hightents.</span> <span id="s572">Like circle tents.</span> <span id="s573">Round wooden ply wood tents.</span> <span id="s574">100 women to each tent in two layers.</span> <span id="s575">One layer of straw on the ground, a plank, a wooden plank, and another layer of straw for the second layer.</span> <span id="s576">50 on the bottom and 50 on the top.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">We were each given a horse blanket.</span> <span id="s578">That's the only way that you can call it and, of course, there was no light, no heat.</span> <span id="s579">Nothing.</span> <span id="s580">In the beginning it was summer.</span> <span id="s581">We would dig our ditches and we would all, in the morning, we would first shovel a seat for Margaret and Gerta's mother so that she could sit down in the green and we warned her when the gaurds were coming closer to look busy and shovel the earth.</span> <span id="s582">Wewe girls would work harder to make up for her part of the work and we really dug these drenches which became very difficult in the winter because we first had to loosen the ice and snow with pick axes before we even getcould get at the earth.</span> <span id="s583">We also built barbedbarriors across the road that were suppose to stop the Russian army from advancing.</span> <span id="s584">Now, in our tents here in this place we were, also we were given very meger rations.</span> <span id="s585">We got the soup each day that was made out of potato peels and ____________ and cabbage leaves and things like that, and really unsufficient for the work ew were doing.</span> <span id="s586">So at night, in the dark, we young girls, two at a time, we were four, we would sneak out into the feilds and steal turnips and potatos.</span> <span id="s587">The turnips we would eat raw and the potatos of course you couldn't eat raw so we once in awhilewhile were able to make a fire and bake some poatos in the fire.</span> <span id="s588">We had, occassionally we had SS guards who were a little more leaniant and who looked the other way and let us get away with that.</span> <span id="s589">So that was a special treat when we had baked potatoes.</span> <span id="s590">In thein the tents wewe were infected with lice and there were mice or rats rustling around under the straw and we'd never forget any of them because as soon asas it got light they got away and so we lived with this.</span> <span id="s591">People got sick.</span> <span id="s592">There were so many that died.</span> <span id="s593">That I think at the end of this work detail out of 1,000 women maybe there were 100 left.</span> <span id="s594">Not more than that.</span> <span id="s595">____________ for it and dysentery and they just died off.</span> <span id="s596">I got sick too.</span> <span id="s597">I hadI had intestinal problems too.</span> <span id="s598">My legs were covered with open boils that were oozing puss.</span> <span id="s599">And I felt pretty bad, but we got through this and the mother of Margaret and Gerta got through with it.</span> <span id="s600">And this lasted from August of '44 till January of '45.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: Had, in this period of time, did you learn anymore about what was going on in the outside world?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Yes, we had heard that the war was not going well for the Germans and that the Russians were coming close.</span> <span id="s603">So in January of 19of 1945 all of a sudden we were assembled and we started on a death march.</span> <span id="s604">The SS wanted to get us closer back to Germany towards Germany.</span> <span id="s605">So here we marched.</span> <span id="s606">Had we stayed in Lega originally we understand that Lega was liberated in '44 already and I think in October of '44, so many more of us would have stayed alive, but the Nazis always took us a step further closer towards Germany and here we were on this death march and marching day and night and all of us were really sick.</span> <span id="s607">My girlfriend Margaret was desperately ill at the time.</span> <span id="s608">And, you know, I also had diarea and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">And whoever wasn't able to march any further and fell by the bay side would get shot by the SS accompanying us in ____________.</span> <span id="s610">So we marched through several nights, but then one night the SS finally let us stay over night in a barn.</span> <span id="s611">In an empty barn.</span> <span id="s612">And when we woke up the next morning, I believe it was January 21st of 1945, our SS guards were gone and we were suddenly fee or so we thought, but our joys were short lived.</span> <span id="s613">We moved on by the timethere were just the five of us together.</span> <span id="s614">Maybe a few other women were with us at first, but eventually there were just the five of us.</span> <span id="s615">We went on because in the barn there was nothing to eat for us.</span> <span id="s616">We looked and found another deserted farm house where we moved in.</span> <span id="s617">And the first thing was to kill the chickens and made chicken soup and gave it to our friend Margaret who I'm sure would not have survived another week of marching.</span> <span id="s618">She was that ill at the time.</span> <span id="s619">And she ate the chicken soup and then we found some canned cherries in the cellar of the farm house and she ate a whole jar of the sour cherries and that really cleaned her out.</span> <span id="s620">And from that day on she started to get better.</span> <span id="s621">Now, two days after the SS had left the Russian soldiers started to march in, but they never really liberated us.</span> <span id="s622">We were just a handful of women and we told him that we were Jewish and had come from concentration camp and they wouldn't believe us.</span> <span id="s623">They kept saying "Nancy," and we were saying "Yes, ____________."</span> <span id="s624">Which means I'm Jewish.</span> <span id="s625">But they didn't believe us.</span> <span id="s626">They thought we were Gentiles and Nazis ____________ and so they were after us.</span> <span id="s627">And alsothey were after us, yeah, the soldiers were after us young girls.</span> <span id="s628">They were always trying to rape us and we somehow managed to evade them all the time.</span> <span id="s629">All four of us managed to get away without being raped, but it was difficult.</span> <span id="s630">We were</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: ____________ ____________.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: We were hiding under the beds, in the cellar.</span> <span id="s633">When we saw them coming we would, on the way, hide outside in the barn yard some place.</span> <span id="s634">And the mother would protect the ____________.</span> <span id="s635">She would trytry to talk to them.</span> <span id="s636">We learned a few word of Russian which I have long since forgotten, but it didn't help us really.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: It must have been frightening for ____________ with the Nazis to be liberated and still be fighting for your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: Yeah, see we never had anywe never got any papers because nobody really liberated us.</span> <span id="s639">It was plain Russian soldiers who marched in.</span> <span id="s640">Who had no authority to give us any papers or who didn't even believe that we were Jews.</span> <span id="s641">So we were suppose to go to a town called ____________ in Polish where they had the Russian war commander.</span> <span id="s642">And the Russian war commandant was suppose to give us instructions what to do further.</span> <span id="s643">Now, we had heard since there were women from the Baltic sea among us that women from the eastern state would be sent home because the war there us over already, but the German Jews would be shipped off to Siberia because they didn't really the German Jews and, you know, these soldiers must have notified the Russian authorities, so they were constantly after us.</span> <span id="s644">And, so we tried desperately to avoid the soldiers ____________ of Nunmark (ph.).</span> <span id="s645">And we marched around the Polish country side looking for one shelter after another and the farmers would sometimes put us up, give us shelter in their attic and we would work or them.</span> <span id="s646">I did some sewing for them.</span> <span id="s647">My girlfriend Gerta mending socks for them.</span> <span id="s648">The others worked in the fields sometimes and so we found one place after the other.</span> <span id="s649">Sometimes we slept in a church and this went on for five months.</span> <span id="s650">Five months we struggled through this and meanwhile, you know, I always thought coming back to the rapes, attempted rapes, I thought the soldiers would leave me alone because if they would see my legs with all the puss running out of the sores that they wouldn't be interested in me, but that never would have stopped them.</span> <span id="s651">The only reason we ____________ ourself was, you know, beinghiding away or some other way, but that would have never stopped them.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: Were there any women soldiers or Jewish soldiers around?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: Occasionally we had a Jewish mentor, but we never say a women soldier, but we had, once in awhile we had a Jewish soldier who, of course, told the others to leave us alone.</span> <span id="s654">And that also saved us.</span> <span id="s655">So, you know, after these five months, practically five months, of wandering around Poland sometimes we would be given, you know, ____________ ____________ they had school lunches and they would give us some milk and potatoes to eat.</span> <span id="s656">You know, and other times the farmers would give us food for work that we did for them.</span> <span id="s657">So by this time we not only had the Russian authorities after us, but we also had the Polish militia (ph.) who was looking for us too.</span> <span id="s658">And, you know, the Polish, they are the greatest anti‑semitist.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">They are known for that.</span> <span id="s660">So by this time we already figured it didn't make any difference anymore who would catch us.</span> <span id="s661">The Russians or the Poles, we had to take a chance and go to ____________.</span> <span id="s662">So we did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Came to ____________ and we were lucky.</span> <span id="s664">The day we arrived there the Russian war commidant was not there and his under link did not know the procedure.</span> <span id="s665">Did not know that they should, the Germans, were being moved to Siberia and didn't know what to do with us, so he told us to go to ____________.</span> <span id="s666">In ____________ we would find the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s667">Now, earlier on our friend Lilly had found a few small pieces of gold on our death march which was also, you know, the road was also being used by Nazis who were fleeing when the Russians came closer.</span> <span id="s668">So somebody must have lost these pieces of gold and my girlfriend really found them.</span> <span id="s669">We gave a piece of gold to for our trip to ____________.</span> <span id="s670">We got on a freight train and that train never stopped at the station in ____________.</span> <span id="s671">It only slowed down, so we had to jump off the moving train.</span> <span id="s672">We girls helped one another and then we helped the mother off the train and we made our way to the Red Cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: This was when?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: This was in June of 1945.</span> <span id="s675">And the Red Cross put us up.</span> <span id="s676">Took care of us for awhile and the mother by this time had a very bad cold and was really sick, but we didn't realize how serious it really was.</span> <span id="s677">So after we had stayed there for awhile we also went to the side of the ____________ ghettos which had been demolished by then and after awhile we decided it was time to move on and we wanted to try to get back to Germany.</span> <span id="s678">So with another piece of gold from Lilly we got on a train to Berlin and in Berlin we were some of the first refugees coming back and they had just set up a Jewish relief center.</span> <span id="s679">And that was opposite the Jewish hospital.</span> <span id="s680">And Margaret and Gerta's mother was immediately hospitalized.</span> <span id="s681">She had ____________ and even though she got good treatment there she died on us in Berlin.</span> <span id="s682">Which was very sad because after all she had gone through, three years of concentration camp, five months of wandering through Poland, she made it all the way to Berlin and then past away.</span> <span id="s683">And the hospital and the relief center were located in the British sector of Berlin.</span> <span id="s684">We met some British soldiers and they gave us money to bury the mother.</span> <span id="s685">I knew the large Jewish cemetery there and that's where we buried her.</span> <span id="s686">So meanwhile, we had stayed at the relief center across from the hospital and because they had just been set up they had nothing really to give us.</span> <span id="s687">They had no clothing to give us, so they gave us some blue, white checkered blanket covers from the hospital.</span> <span id="s688">Out of which they had sewing machines there.</span> <span id="s689">Out of which I sewed dresses for us four girls and these dresses werewere all the ____________ in Berlin were our first clothing.</span> <span id="s690">Then after the mother had died some of theses British soldiers found us ana nice house in Berlin.</span> <span id="s691">There must have been Nazis living there who had fled and well, we made ourselves at home there.</span> <span id="s692">We took some of the clothing there.</span> <span id="s693">Then I found my Uncle in Berlin, in a suburb of Berlin and he told me he wanted me to stay in Berlin whereas I had intended to go with my girlfriend to Levitt (ph.), but he convinced me that it would be better for me to stay in Berlin since I was entitled to food ration in the Soviet after the war.</span> <span id="s694">And my other benefits were two days where I had ____________.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">So he rented me a furnished room and the girls tried to get back to their homes in the west.</span> <span id="s696">On a British truck, you know, British army.</span> <span id="s697">But the first time they couldn't make it.</span> <span id="s698">They got stopped by the Russians at the boarder and were sent back.</span> <span id="s699">So all of a sudden they appeared in my furnished room, my furnished room again and we spent two more days together and then they made a second attempt.</span> <span id="s700">This time the British soldiers hid them among barracks on the trucks and they made it to the west.</span> <span id="s701">They made it to Margaret and Gerta's house which was still found intact in their home town.</span> <span id="s702">And our friend Lilly stayed with them.</span> <span id="s703">So we were always in contact with one another.</span> <span id="s704">I had to find myself a job.</span> <span id="s705">I had to earn a living and I absolutely did not want to work for any Germans.</span> <span id="s706">I figured they were all Nazis and I'm certainly not going to work for them.</span> <span id="s707">And I managed to find myself a job with the American army that was stationed in the suburb of Berlin where I had my furnished home.</span> <span id="s708">I got a job there in the office.</span> <span id="s709">That was the quarter master's supply people where all the American troops were supplied that were stationed all around Berlin.</span> <span id="s710">And I was in charge of the supply.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: ____________.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: You had gotten a job in Berlin with the American army.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: Right.</span> <span id="s715">Yeah.</span> <span id="s716">At this army base I was the only Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s717">All the other girls were Nazi girls who had befriended American soldiers and who got them into this job.</span> <span id="s718">So</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: What did that seem like?</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: It didn't make me feel very good, but that's the way it was and I found there was one Jewish man at the base who was playing the accordion and the piano for the soldiers.</span> <span id="s721">And he came over to me one day and said "Are you the Jewish girl that just returned from concentration camp.</span> <span id="s722">It's the talk of the town that there's a Jewish girl."</span> <span id="s723">I said, "That's me.</span> <span id="s724">I'm the one."</span> <span id="s725">He said "You know, we have quite a few Jewish soldiers.</span> <span id="s726">I'll introduce you."</span> <span id="s727">So he did.</span> <span id="s728">He introduced me to the Jewish soldiers who were really wonderful.</span> <span id="s729">I mean, here the soldiers were not suppose to give us anything.</span> <span id="s730">You know, us employees at the base, but they always managed to give us, you know, instant coffee and soda and cigarettes.</span> <span id="s731">And, you know, it was very good because, I mean, all the supplies in Berlin were very short ____________ ration.</span> <span id="s732">But I could eat at the army base, but ____________.</span> <span id="s733">Now, the Jewish soldiers had services Friday night at the temple.</span> <span id="s734">They took me along for the service.</span> <span id="s735">They had asked me if I wanted to go and I said absolutely.</span> <span id="s736">I would like to attend a service.</span> <span id="s737">And every Friday night they would take me in their army vehicle and take me to the ____________ where we had a Jewish service.</span> <span id="s738">After the services there was a Jewish family in Berlin who had lived under ground, meaning they had been hidden by German gentiles all during the war and who had come back to their home which had not been destroyed, which, by the way, I found out that the house that my parents and I had lived in was bombed to the ground.</span> <span id="s739">You know, when I came back I saw it bombed to the ground which made me very happy.</span> <span id="s740">But not the anti____________.</span> <span id="s741">That was never ____________.</span> <span id="s742">Anyway, we came to this open house and they always invited all the ____________, you know, refugees or people who had lived under ground and had very interesting discussions group and socializing at their house every Friday night.</span> <span id="s743">Which made it very pleasant, you know, very nice escape.</span> <span id="s744">Then inwhen was itin April of 1946, you know, me and my other fellows were working at the</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Where were you living at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: I had a furnished room.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: You were basically alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: Yes, I was basically alone.</span> <span id="s749">I had a furnished room not too far from the army base.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: Did youweredid you have any family?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: No, none, I mean, at that time only later on did I get in contact with my Uncle.</span> <span id="s752">Besides from this Uncle in the Gentile andand their family.</span> <span id="s753">I really didn't have anybody there.</span> <span id="s754">I befriended the Jewish family who really took in like I was their own child.</span> <span id="s755">That was also a mixed marriage, but they had suffered persecution.</span> <span id="s756">The Gentile husband had been taken to a concentration camp for awhile.</span> <span id="s757">So they treated me very well and treated me like family.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: What about your relations with the German people in Berlin?</span> <span id="s759">What kind of response?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: Well, of course, none of them ever admitted that they ever had been Nazis.</span> <span id="s761">Of course, there were no more Nazis around, you know.</span> <span id="s762">As far as that was concerned they all lied, but, of course, everyevery person at the age they could have been Nazis.</span> <span id="s763">You know, I'm sure they were Nazis before and aside from some of the girls that I worked with at the base I really didn't have much contact.</span> <span id="s764">As I said, all my spare time I spent with this one Jewish family that had befriended me.</span> <span id="s765">So one Friday night in April of 1946, this Jewish family told us that they had obtained questionnaires from the American Joint Distribution Committee to apply for visas to go to the Unites States for usfor us, mostly girls who had returned and some fellows too.</span> <span id="s766">Some fellows who regularly attended these open houses.</span> <span id="s767">And I, even though I was not that anxious to go to America because I had nobody there, but I knew I couldn't get to Palestine (ph.) at that time, so I filled out the form to apply for a visa.</span> <span id="s768">And to my greatest surprise, several weeks later I was called to the American consulate and they questionedin fact, I had gottenI had just arrived at my office at the army base.</span> <span id="s769">I had not even had my breakfast yet when I received a telegram from the Joint Distribution Committee telling me to come to the consulate.</span> <span id="s770">So I immediately went to the consulate and I was questioned there the whole day.</span> <span id="s771">Making sure I was really the person I claimed to be.</span> <span id="s772">I had by this time, I can show it to you later, I had a little thing like a passport stating I was a victim of fasisim (ph.) and at the end of the day they finally believed me and it didn't take that much longer then I got my visa.</span> <span id="s773">Through the generosity of President Truman who had allocated visas for this place person.</span> <span id="s774">Fromit was a complete supply and several weeks later there in May of 1945'46 excuse me.</span> <span id="s775">I was sent to Bromine (ph.) to the port of Bromine on my way to America.</span> <span id="s776">So I first notified my friends that I was coming to Bromine and all three of them, Margaret, Gerta and Lilly came to Bromine We were housed there in the British camps they had set up and we were housed there four weeks before we left on a ship.</span> <span id="s777">And my girlfriends spent the whole week with me there which was absolutely wonderful.</span> <span id="s778">We had a great time together.</span> <span id="s779">And they saw me off.</span> <span id="s780">On the 14th of May 1946 we were put aboard a liberty ship.</span> <span id="s781">It was, you know, a former American troop transport, the marine perch.</span> <span id="s782">And we were put aboard the ship on our trip to America.</span> <span id="s783">Now, it was quite primitive of course.</span> <span id="s784">Being an army ship we had tripletriple bunks, but I really spend no time in the bunk at all.</span> <span id="s785">I spent the whole time up on deck because down below you would only get sea sick because everybody there got sea sick, so I stayed on top and our whole group had a wonderful time.</span> <span id="s786">We were on the ship for 10 days and we were supplied there by the sailors with fresh food which to us was a real novelty and I was never sea sick, so I could enjoy all the good foods that they offered me and had really a great time.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: Did you knowdid you have any friends on this boat before you</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: No, none of my friendswell, not really.</span> <span id="s789">They were mostly not from my camp.</span> <span id="s790">There were different people who had just come back to Berlin, but no, I don't recall that I met anybody from my camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: Weren't you a little nervous about taking this large trip all by yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: Oh, certainly.</span> <span id="s793">Oh, certainly.</span> <span id="s794">And I had nobody inin America.</span> <span id="s795">It was a big undertakingtaking, but I certainly wasn't going to stay in Germany.</span> <span id="s796">That I couldn't do.</span> <span id="s797">I couldn't stay there.</span> <span id="s798">So we all wanted to get out.</span> <span id="s799">My friends wanted to get out.</span> <span id="s800">So when we spotted the Statue of Liberty as we were close to New York that was the biggest thrill of my life.</span> <span id="s801">So we landed in New York and the Joint Distribution committee was there to greet us and they put us up in a hotel and they took care of us.</span> <span id="s802">And what they had in mind was they were going to send, there were quite a few young girls among us and they had in mind to send us young girls out of New York because they figured we wouldn't be able to get jobs in New York and even, you could even get housing or even a furnished room was difficult to come by.</span> <span id="s803">It was shortly after the war when all the soldiers had come back, so they tried to place the young girls with Jewish families all over the country.</span> <span id="s804">You know, to be baby sitters, household help to Jewish families and for some reason I was absolutely determined to stay in New York.</span> <span id="s805">I don'tI don't really know why.</span> <span id="s806">I had nobody there.</span> <span id="s807">The only thing I had was mymy Jewish soldiers from my army base in Berlin had given me addresses of their families in New York whom I contacted and this somehow made me feel I wanted to stay here and even though the Jewish committee told me I probably wouldn't be able to find a job in New York and I wouldn't find accommodations in New York I managed through these contacts to find myself a furnished room.</span> <span id="s808">I also found a job as a seamstress and so then I was on my own.</span> <span id="s809">You know, II moved into the furnished room and I started a life on my own being a steam stress.</span> <span id="s810">Now, in the meantime, my health, of course, had been permanently impaired through all the years of concentration camp and wandering around in Poland and I had this serious intestinal problem.</span> <span id="s811">Always pain and diareah and so, which was later on diagnosed as ____________.</span> <span id="s812">So that made it very difficult.</span> <span id="s813">I mean, I went to work as a seamstress.</span> <span id="s814">I went to work everyday.</span> <span id="s815">I didn't even miss work even when I was running a fever, I went to work.</span> <span id="s816">And this went onmeanwhile, my girlfriends Margaret and Gerta were still at their home in the west.</span> <span id="s817">My girlfriend Lilly had found two of her brothers, two older brothers were alive and she found them back in Colon and they had gone to an Uncle in France and they were living in France at that time.</span> <span id="s818">Now, umI'm stuck.</span> <span id="s819">I hadyeah, so a year after I had gotten to America, in fact, in June of 1947 I met my future husband at the swimming pool.</span> <span id="s820">I forgot to mention, my friends Margaret and Gerta came to America a year after me.</span> <span id="s821">They had an Uncle in Chicago and they settled in Chicago.</span> <span id="s822">So meanwhile, I met my husband into the end of June of 1947 and three months later we got married because he had had similar experiences that I had except that he had come to America just before the war, but he us never able to get his parents out and his parents and younger sister were also killed in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s823">So for our wedding in October, my girlfriends Margaret and Gerta came to celebrate our wedding even though they were here only such a short time and had just started jobs.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">But they managed to come here and it was really wonderful.</span> <span id="s825">So, I mean, we were able to find, my husband and I got a basement apartment.</span> <span id="s826">You know, apartments were very hard to come by and started a new life.</span> <span id="s827">I continued on sewing.</span> <span id="s828">You know, working as a seamstress.</span> <span id="s829">He had come back fromfrom the service.</span> <span id="s830">He was in the American army and he was working in the post office, so we got settled in for a new life.</span> <span id="s831">And the only draw back was that I was sick so much.</span> <span id="s832">Then in 1949 our son was born and after that my ____________ really got bad.</span> <span id="s833">Even worse than before and while he was quite young yet I was in and out of hospitals and that made it, of course, quite difficult for my husband.</span> <span id="s834">He had to go to work and had to take care of the child after work.</span> <span id="s835">He got some from cousins and from friends who helped out, but in general, it was quite difficult.</span> <span id="s836">But all in all, we had a good life.</span> <span id="s837">And so, you know, we can't complain.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">We're very happy that we are here in this country and were able to start all over again.</span> <span id="s839">And in the mean time then just about three years ago to ad to my other aliments I got a very sever case of shingles in my head and my eye and because of my impaired immune system through all the years of concentration camp I could never get over it.</span> <span id="s840">I hadI suffered a severely damaged nerve that leaves me in constant pain and, but you have to put up with it.</span> <span id="s841">You know, life goes on.</span> <span id="s842">We have a very close relationship.</span> <span id="s843">We have a 16 year old granddaughter and we have a very close relationship with our family and so life is good.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: I'm going to ask you a few more questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: Can you turn on the air conditioner or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: Do you want to take a break for a couple minutes?</span> <span id="s847">Okay.</span> <span id="s848">We'll have a couple of photographs.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: Did you think that you would survive all of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: Well, I tell you, we were hoping.</span> <span id="s852">We didn't think with a clear mind.</span> <span id="s853">We were hoping we would survive.</span> <span id="s854">In fact, when we were in these wooden tents doing our last work detail in Poland, at night, you know, wethere was no light in the tent or anything, we would lay down and we would reminisce and make believe we were in our cozy living rooms at home and the mother of Margaret and Gerta would ____________ us the story of her news and how she had spent time at the English finishing school, so we kept ourselves alive.</span> <span id="s855">In fact, when we were digging the trenches we were standing on top of a mountain where we dug the trench we would sing.</span> <span id="s856">So we would always try to look on the bright side and hope we would survive it.</span> <span id="s857">Never really believing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: What do you think gave you the strength?</span> <span id="s859">I mean, you were a young girl.</span> <span id="s860">You were all alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: Yeah, well</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: What do you think got you through this?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s864">I just had the will to live.</span> <span id="s865">It's as simple as that.</span> <span id="s866">So after my husband and I were married already as I said, my girlfriends Margaret and Gerta lived in Germany in west Germany until they came to the states.</span> <span id="s867">Our girlfriend Lilly immigrated from France to Palestine.</span> <span id="s868">That wasn't quite Australia and she met a young man that became a doctor and who is a professor in medical research and they still live in Israel.</span> <span id="s869">And we four girls have kept in contact steadily over all these more than 50 years.</span> <span id="s870">We telephone each other.</span> <span id="s871">We get together once in awhile.</span> <span id="s872">Even when Lilly from Israel has been here on anyany number of times and then we try to all four get together and reminisce about the old times and think how good we have it now in contrast.</span> <span id="s873">So the friendship has gone on between our families now for all these years.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: You guys have quite a bond.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: Yes, quite a bond.</span> <span id="s876">We are very close.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: Werewere there other people who, I guess, didn't survive by helping each other and who wereI mean,well, I guess what I'm asking is was there a different sense of morality at that time being that people were struggling so hard to survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s879">Yes.</span> <span id="s880">I mean, you fought for every piece of bread, for every, you know.</span> <span id="s881">And it made it very hard.</span> <span id="s882">You know, people did fight with each other and which we never did.</span> <span id="s883">You know, we alwaysshe had every bit that we had and that saved us because I'm sure none of us would be alive today if we had not had this close bond andand did everything together and shared everything.</span> <span id="s884">All our experiences.</span> <span id="s885">All our food.</span> <span id="s886">Everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: How important was religion to you through out all of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: Well, I still believed in God even though it was very difficult under the circumstances to believe that there was a god.</span> <span id="s889">That he let us go through all these hard times, but I guess menI guess it was meant to be.</span> <span id="s890">So, I mean, I looked at it that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: Did you pray?</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: Yes, I prayed that we would some day be freed.</span> <span id="s893">We would some day be able to go back to a normal life.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: You never resented the ____________.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: Or though about</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: No.</span> <span id="s898">No, nevernever did.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: It's still important.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: It's still very important and it's very important to my granddaughter especially.</span> <span id="s901">She is very aware of the Jewish ____________ synagogue.</span> <span id="s902">You know, they don't keep a kosher house, but she goes to synagogue regularly.</span> <span id="s903">And is involved with Jewish youth groups.</span> <span id="s904">Go away together on weekends some times with Jewish youth groups and she says she will only marry a Jewish fellow.</span> <span id="s905">She wants to go to a college where there are a lot of Jewish fellows.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: Did you think that America was any different for you being a young women and getting through all of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: Oh, definitely.</span> <span id="s908">You know, an older person certainly wouldn't have had the strength to survive all these hardships and all these illnesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: But what about being a women versus a man.</span> <span id="s910">Did you survive differently?</span> <span id="s911">In terms of relationship.</span> <span id="s912">In terms of</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: I don'tI wouldn'tcouldn't really tell.</span> <span id="s914">I'm really not aware of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: Was it difficult to begin again?</span> <span id="s916">Either</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s918">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s919">It was difficult.</span> <span id="s920">We had nothing, you know.</span> <span id="s921">We came back to Germany with the dresses that I had made for us.</span> <span id="s922">That was at that time our only clothing, so we later on got some others.</span> <span id="s923">And we started from scratch.</span> <span id="s924">From nothing.</span> <span id="s925">Got ourselves jobs and then we were all fortunate to find husbands.</span> <span id="s926">Well, we were finished anyhow, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: What</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: You too, huh?</span> <span id="s929">Not only happens to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: Um, when you think back on this period of time and I'm sure the image is with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: Well, the image, of course, that sticks most in my mind is when my parents were taken away on that truck.</span> <span id="s932">Never to be seen again.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: Other than all these very, how do you say it, health problems you went through, do you feel that phsycologically the experiences you went through at that time impacted you in the way you live your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: No, actually, that when wewhen I first came over here and then we first got married, actually my husband and I, we were so full of hate for Germany and all it stood for that we refused to speak German which now, I sort of regret because my son could have grown up with two languages, but we just didn't want to be reminded.</span> <span id="s935">And actually, I mean, II learned my English actually while I was working at the American army base from all the soldiers who came form allall parts of the country.</span> <span id="s936">So we really don't dwell on the past.</span> <span id="s937">I must say though that most of our friends are German or Austrian born.</span> <span id="s938">We have American born friends too, but most of them are European born.</span> <span id="s939">None of them had been in concentration camps really.</span> <span id="s940">I'm the only one of that group, butso we never really dwell on the past much except for occasions like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Have youdid you befriend mostly Germans and Austrians because coming over here you felt more in common with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: Yes, first of all, we lived in the, what is called here in New York, the third ____________.</span> <span id="s943">Because it's only really occupied by European Jews.</span> <span id="s944">So we live there.</span> <span id="s945">In fact, there are many Jews living in that area now who mostly speak German.</span> <span id="s946">There is a park there that's called ____________ and that's up in that area.</span> <span id="s947">And if you go to that park you hear more German than English.</span> <span id="s948">So</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: You remember thisdo you remember different impressions when you arrived to New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: No, my first impressions were really thewell, the statue of liberty of course.</span> <span id="s951">And seeing the tall buildings very impressive even though, I mean, from Berlin it's not exactly a small city, but it doesn't have sky scrappers like New York.</span> <span id="s952">I was very much impressed by that and then I must say we were well taken care of at first.</span> <span id="s953">You know, we were put up at a hotel for awhile, you know, to get out of my own.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">And we were made to feel at home.</span> <span id="s955">The relief of ____________ were really good.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: Nothing that startled you about the lifestyle though?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: Well, in those days the lifestyle was better than it is now a days.</span> <span id="s958">So, no, nothing really startled me too much.</span> <span id="s959">There was one point ____________ furnished rooms here before I met my husband that a Jewish family had taken me into and I was taking care of their boy.</span> <span id="s960">I was babysitting for them.</span> <span id="s961">Then again, I found another, you know, furnished room later on andand then, you know, I got married very soon.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: Is there anything else.</span> <span id="s963">I don't think there's too much time left on this tape, but is there anything else you'd like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: No.</span> <span id="s965">I think that's about it.</span> <span id="s966">Yeah, that's about all I have to say.</span> <span id="s967">Well, thank you.</span> <span id="s968">That is a picture of me in my home town of Penslo when I was about 10 years old.</span> <span id="s969">That is a picture of my parents and myself taken in 1941 which I carried around in my shoe, the original of this, I carried around in my shoe all through concentration camp and had it reproduced.</span> <span id="s970">From left to right is my girlfriend Gerta, her sister Margaret and myself.</span> <span id="s971">All three of us are wearing dresses made from blanket covers that I sewed for us when we got back to Berlin.</span> <span id="s972">These are my girlfriends Gerta, Margaret and Lilly at their in the west.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: What are they wearing?</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: Oh, they're still wearing the dresses that I sewed from the blanket covers.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: These are my girlfriends Margaret and Gerta at our wedding on October 5, 1947 in New York.</span> <span id="s977">This is an identification card that was issued to me in Berlin.</span> <span id="s978">I think by the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s979">I'm not quite sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: When?</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: Oh, in 1945 when I was back in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: With my name other than my birthday.</span> <span id="s984">Oh, what does it say there?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: That's the German.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: The German
