or Philadelphia - I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s372">And so my brother-in-law and my sister-in-law got another sponsor from someplace.</span> <span id="s373">Later on, we got an affidavit from strange people, and we had to promise not to thank them for getting out.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Who were the people who gave you the affidavit?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: Some people from Chicago or Philadelphia, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s376">And I believe they had connection with the yeshiva.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Tell me about his affidavit.</span> <span id="s378">What did the affidavit say?</span> <span id="s379">I don’t need the exact words, but what were they promising in that?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: I don’t remember any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: But you needed that affidavit to...</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: We needed this to get out, yes.</span> <span id="s383">And many people who didn’t have the chance to go to the yeshiva people had to wait a little longer, and they got out through the Committee.</span> <span id="s384">But we came first to America, earlier than the other ones.</span> <span id="s385">My son was in the yeshiva, and therefore, some people had interest in us.</span> <span id="s386">We had to promise that we don’t come to them, that we stay on our own, that we are on our own.</span> <span id="s387">They wouldn’t support us, and we should never thank them for getting out.</span> <span id="s388">I know the name of the people, but I forgot the name of the town where they lived.</span> <span id="s389">We heard they were very rich, and they brought several people out, not us alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: So how long did it take from the time you made that connection with those influential people until you actually were out of China?</span> <span id="s391">Was it a year, or was it a few months?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Just a few months then.</span> <span id="s393">it went very fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: And during this time, Shanghai was still under the control of the Japanese?</span> <span id="s395">Is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s397">These Japanese people had then connections with the Nazis.</span> <span id="s398">They built already a gas chamber in Shanghai to kill us, and this we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s399">We heard it here in America, the first time.</span> <span id="s400">Chinese people, they acted a little funny, and tried to tell us what they did - the Japanese people - but we didn’t know it was true or not.</span> <span id="s401">As we came to America we heard here from the synagogues, the Rabbis, they told us from the pulpit that really they built gas chambers, and they wanted to kill us just as the people were killed in Germany and all over.</span> <span id="s402">We were lucky to go out, because the war was finished.</span> <span id="s403">If the war wouldn’t be finished, we would to the same way then in Germany and all over.</span> <span id="s404">I still have everything here, I believe.</span> <span id="s405">We had to sign a form with our pictures.</span> <span id="s406">We didn’t know what it was.</span> <span id="s407">We had to sign our name, and therefore, they could get us right away to get in the gas chamber, but thanks God, the war was finished, and they couldn’t do nothing anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: What was this paper you had to sign?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: It was in Chinese.</span> <span id="s410">We had to bring a photo of ourself, and our name and where we born, and sign.</span> <span id="s411">I still have it here.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: The JCRC-ADL, for the Holocaust Project, is asking people if they have some mementos from that period that they want to donate to the project.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: I wouldn’t give it away, because it’s a document for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Was there any discussion at this time, before you decided on coming to the United States, about the possibility of going to Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Yes, we were just set for Israel - at that time Palestine - already in Germany.</span> <span id="s416">We had a very low number, and we couldn’t come out, and waited and waited, and then we had a chance to go to Shanghai, and we went to Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: But when you got to Shanghai, was there any thought given to going to Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: No, because my whole family went there.</span> <span id="s419">We were thinking on Palestine, but we didn’t go.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: So when did you leave Shanghai for the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: July, 1947.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: And who all left, who survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: From Shanghai, we left together.</span> <span id="s424">My brother-in-law, my sister-in-law, and two kids, and my husband and I with my son.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: And what happened when you got to the United States then?</span> <span id="s426">Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: Here was a committee, and we had to register.</span> <span id="s428">They picked us up from the boat - the committee, the people.</span> <span id="s429">They registered us, and we had a choice to go to Chicago, to New York.</span> <span id="s430">We came by boat, in California,.</span> <span id="s431">But there were many, many people, they didn’t want to go, would like to stay in California.</span> <span id="s432">They had too many people, so the committee told us it’s better to go someplace else where not so many people are now, and they suggested Chicago, New York, and here, Minnesota.</span> <span id="s433">I had a girl friend, Rosa Goldsmith, she was here two months before us - or more.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: She was with you in Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: She was in Shanghai, too, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Did you know here from Germany, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s438">They left much earlier than we to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s439">They left in December and we left in July.</span> <span id="s440">She wrote us that we should come to here.</span> <span id="s441">This is the same climate as Germany, so we decided to come here.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: So you maintain contact with Mrs. Goldsmith, who you’ve known since Germany.</span> <span id="s443">Are there others that you maintain contact with in the Jewish community who survived the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Yeah, there’s another fellow - Herbert Herzberg.</span> <span id="s445">He was in Shanghai, and he’s here in St. Paul.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Is there an organization of people who survived the Holocaust and lived in Shanghai, that you know of?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: No, not the people from Shanghai.</span> <span id="s448">As we came here, there was a Neighborhood House, they call it.</span> <span id="s449">We met each other there.</span> <span id="s450">We don’t go anymore.</span> <span id="s451">Now everyone is in the Jewish Community Center.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Can you tell me in your own words what you think it means to be a survivor of the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: It means that we were very lucky.</span> <span id="s454">How we came through, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: Reflecting on your experience through the war years, can you describe to me your general feeling about human nature, non-Jewish people, and Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: Still there is something inside, when you hear about German people.</span> <span id="s457">It’s a funny feeling.</span> <span id="s458">Even if they say, “We never were Nazis,” but where did the Nazis come from?</span> <span id="s459">And still the hate goes on.</span> <span id="s460">I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s461">You see we have here just the same.</span> <span id="s462">The people are hating Jews.</span> <span id="s463">I don’t know why.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Do you think your belief or practice in Judaism, or a supreme being, is changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: This I don’t know, I can’t answer this.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Have you read any of the books about the war period and the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: Yes, I read them, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: And the films.</span> <span id="s469">Do you think that they tell the story right?</span> <span id="s470">The books and the films?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: The films, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s472">But some of the books, it was true.</span> <span id="s473">it’s really true.</span> <span id="s474">Maybe not true enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Any particular book come to mind, that you can think of?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: I just bought a book for my son in Los Angeles last year.</span> <span id="s477">So many things written.</span> <span id="s478">It was true, but not good enough, not tough enough.</span> <span id="s479">Nazi and Japanese was the book.</span> <span id="s480">And then my son has Fugitive.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Fugitive?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: Yes, he has that book, but I didn’t read it at all.</span> <span id="s483">The book is good, but still not enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: When you say “not enough,” do you mean a lot of the details are missing?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: Yeah, it’s not enough details.</span> <span id="s486">That’s what he said.</span> <span id="s487">I have here a book that is so old, from Emily Harden.</span> <span id="s488">She wrote about Shanghai.</span> <span id="s489">it’s familiar to me, what she wrote, but not enough what happens before in all countries.</span> <span id="s490">It is not enough.</span> <span id="s491">You know that film, Exodus?</span> <span id="s492">I couldn’t see that.</span> <span id="s493">It was too sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Is there anything we should add we didn’t cover?</span> <span id="s495">That’s a long time to be living in Shanghai, for almost nine years.</span> <span id="s496">There certainly was a lot that went on there, I’m sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Oh, yeah, we had diseases.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Diseases?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: Oh, yes, we had the malaria.</span> <span id="s500">My son had the malaria and diphtheria.</span> <span id="s501">Many people died.</span> <span id="s502">Many, many people died.</span> <span id="s503">Oh, Got!</span> <span id="s504">They had the diarrhea so much.</span> <span id="s505">But you forget, you know.</span> <span id="s506">Maybe you don’t want to remember any more what’s happened.</span> <span id="s507">So therefore, I don’t see any sad films.</span> <span id="s508">And especially when you lose more of your family.</span> <span id="s509">We had good times, but we had bad times.</span> <span id="s510">We were very nervous before we left Germany, because always the scare: What will happen?</span> <span id="s511">We got support from an organization - Hitzim.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: Tell me about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Hitzim is an organization built many, many years ago for everyone, for every Jewish people, and this is like a community center.</span> <span id="s514">This was in Germany, all over, international.</span> <span id="s515">This is a wonderful organization, and they gave us a check, I believe, in Shanghai, as we entered Shanghai.</span> <span id="s516">It was not much, but it was a little support from the Hitzim.</span> <span id="s517">And with this check, I must say, I bought affidavit.</span> <span id="s518">I shouldn’t tell you on this tape.</span> <span id="s519">Some of the Jewish people had connection with the Japanese and they could give you an affidavit.</span> <span id="s520">And I took that money from the Hitzim and bought an affidavit for my parents.</span> <span id="s521">My parents were still in Germany, and they had already everything sold from their apartment, and they were sitting on suitcases waiting for our affidavit.</span> <span id="s522">They got the affidavit, and couldn’t get out anymore.</span> <span id="s523">And so we went, in Shanghai, day by day we went, to the harbor.</span> <span id="s524">We went day by day, and waited for my parents, and they didn’t came and didn’t came.</span> <span id="s525">Meanwhile, my father suddenly died.</span> <span id="s526">For grief, he died, and my mother was alone.</span> <span id="s527">And then it was a month later my mother got picked up, to the concentration camp in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s528">I think it was Warsaw.</span> <span id="s529">Then we got a Red Cross brief from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s530">What happened then, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s531">So, whatever was, it was.</span> <span id="s532">We saved our lives, this I can say, nothing else.</span></p></body></html>
