<p><span id="s3">Q: This is an interview of Mrs. Ruth Feist by Ann Hurst.</span></p> <p><span id="s4">A: I am a 60 year old female.</span> <span id="s5">I was born in Mannheim, Germany.</span> <span id="s6">I lived there all the time I was in Europe.</span> <span id="s7">My parents had lived there ever since they were married, which was in 1914.</span> <span id="s8">My father lived in Mannheim before 1914.</span> <span id="s9">He met my mother at a convention.</span> <span id="s10">They got married subsequently and lived there all the time they lived in Germany, until they left in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: You left in 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: I did not leave in 1940.</span> <span id="s13">I left in 1934.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: You left in 1934?</span> <span id="s15">I see.</span> <span id="s16">How many brothers and sisters do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: I have one brother and I had one sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: Any other family members who lived in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: An aunt lived with us for a good many years.</span> <span id="s20">She was a sister of my father’s.</span> <span id="s21">She was an unmarried lady.</span> <span id="s22">Although she had an apartment of her own early in my childhood, she was fairly ill and therefore moved in with the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: When did you leave?</span> <span id="s24">When did you come to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: I left in Jan. 1934 and came to the U.S. at that time, directly.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: What language was spoken in your home, mainly?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: The only language spoken in our home was German.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: What was your father’s occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: He was a teacher, a grade school teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: Did your mother have an occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: My mother had been a high school teacher before she married.</span> <span id="s32">She gave up all work when she got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: What was the education of your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: My father attended normal school, and so did my mother.</span> <span id="s35">This was about the normal education for a teacher in those days, in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: The religious life in your home, what were the practices?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: We were an observant Jewish family.</span> <span id="s38">We observed all the Holy Days.</span> <span id="s39">They were joyous occasions in our house.</span> <span id="s40">We were traditional Jews.</span> <span id="s41">We were more interested in the ethics of Judaism than in all the observances.</span> <span id="s42">We were not orthodox.</span> <span id="s43">My father felt very strongly about the ethics of Jewish teachings and was relatively unconcerned with some of the minor observances.</span> <span id="s44">He felt that these minor observances were sometimes not necessary, or very relevant.</span> <span id="s45">He had strong feelings about ethical living and the tradition of living of Jews rather than just observances which he felt were often not connected to anything that was not intellectually active.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: Did you and your family attend synagogue on a regular basis?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: Yes, we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Did your parents keep kosher?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Oh!</span> <span id="s50">Kind of!</span> <span id="s51">That means within limitations.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: You celebrated the Sabbath?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Yes, we did, we celebrated the Sabbath and all the Holy Days.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Were the males in your family bar mitzvahed?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Did your parents speak any language, other than German?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: My mother spoke some English because she had lived, for a short time, in England in her girlhood; I suppose in her later teens.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Did you think yourself amongst the rich or the poor, in the community?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: We did not think about it very much.</span> <span id="s60">We had everything we needed.</span> <span id="s61">My father was a state employee.</span> <span id="s62">He earned the necessities of life.</span> <span id="s63">We were never considered rich, but we certainly were not poor.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Did your parents associate socially with non-Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: On a limited basis.</span> <span id="s66">On a very limited basis, however they had some contacts.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: To what extent was the synagogue the center of Jewish life?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: It was and it wasn’t.</span> <span id="s69">It was the center of religious life but not of the social life of the community.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: The synagogue related to you pretty much as it did to the community?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Yes, that is right.</span> <span id="s72">The synagogues were a place for prayer, they were not necessarily a place for social activity.</span> <span id="s73">I believe that is the difference between the synagogues here and the synagogues as they were in Germany, at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: What activities or associations did your family engage in other than religious associations?</span> <span id="s75">By that I mean: theater, politics, music in the Jewish and in the non-Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: My father was very happy with music and I was probably the child which was the most interested in music of us three.</span> <span id="s77">We attended theater performances, concerts, we went to the museums, that was about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Can you think of anything else, in your general background, which would be of interest, at this time?</span> <span id="s79">Anything which you would want to include.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Yes, my father was writing a book, when I was a young girl.</span> <span id="s81">He was writing about the history of the Jews in the German State of Baden, in Southern Germany.</span> <span id="s82">That is where we lived.</span> <span id="s83">He was doing a tremendous amount of research on that.</span> <span id="s84">It was published in 1928, I believe (and reprinted in 1981).</span> <span id="s85">As I was growing up, I was very much aware of what he was doing because he used to take me on field trips with him.</span> <span id="s86">We went to cemeteries (it used to be customary to write brief summaries of peoples’ accomplishments on headstones where they often were preserved while city halls were often ransacked and/or destroyed while soldiers fought battles in the XVII and XVIII centuries), and city halls to get source material for the book (he succeeded in tracing one Jewish family by the name of Weil back to the 1360th).</span> <span id="s87">We usually connected this research with some kind of excursion or hike or something, maybe an overnight stay in an inn, which was really interesting and fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: About your childhood, how would you describe your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Happy!</span> <span id="s90">Very happy, very satisfying, very pleasant, secure, good, nice all the good things.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Are there any special events which you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: My brother’s bar mitzvah was a very special event because a lot of the relatives from all over, came.</span> <span id="s93">Plans were made months ahead.</span> <span id="s94">It was a really festive occasion.</span> <span id="s95">That was one of the good times which I can remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Did you attend school?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Secular school?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s100">Public school, strictly public school, both Grade and High school.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: What other language did you speak at this time other than German?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: None other than English.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: To what extent did you associate with non-Jewish boys and girls in school and outside of school?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: Yes, I played with non-Jewish kids in the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Prior to the war and/or the Nazi (National Socialist party which was the official name of the party lead by Hitler) occupation, to what extent were you aware of anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: It was with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: It was with you!</span> <span id="s108">And did it affect you personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Nothing physical.</span> <span id="s110">Some slurs and slurred remarks, innuendoes; it was something which you more or less lived with constantly.</span> <span id="s111">It was below the surface.</span> <span id="s112">It was never terribly overt, but you knew that it was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Were there any laws or any ordinances which affected you, because you were Jewish, considering that you left Germany before the Nuremburg Laws (the anti-Jewish laws which were promulgated by the Nazis in 1936 at the party conclave held in the city of Nuremburg, in Bavaria).</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: Yes, shortly before I left we were supposedly thrown out of school (it was no longer allowed for Jewish children to attend instruction together with non-Jews).</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: Otherwise said it affected the educational system?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s117">My father also was forced to resign his job (Jewish instructors no longer were allowed to teach non-Jewish children).</span> <span id="s118">Things were just beginning to be very noticeable when I left.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Do you recall incidents of anti-Semitism in your school?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Remarks, you know and slurs, again innuendoes and unpleasantness.</span> <span id="s121">They had the beginnings of Nazi rallies at street corners.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Newspapers?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: No.</span> <span id="s124">No, I don’t believe so.</span> <span id="s125">The “Sturmer”, the newspaper of the Hitler party, was not very well known in the city where we lived.</span> <span id="s126">Mannheim was a city which did not take very kindly to Hitler, in the beginning, and was trying to stay away from him, in most things.</span> <span id="s127">I mean that they did not try to stay away in all aspects, but it was not one of his areas of most support, in the beginning.</span> <span id="s128">However there were street corner rallies and brown shirted men (the SA or Schutz Abteilung, meaning Protective Section wore brown shirts and coats as uniforms and were the average uniformed Nazis) who were meeting and marching and gathering and fighting with other people (at the end of the “Weimer Republic” the supporters of various political parties would fight with each other in the streets).</span> <span id="s129">We were told to stay away -- go far away from them-- and to get home as quickly as we could, when we saw anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: Were you told this by your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s132">That was supposed to keep us safe, to keep us out of harm’s way.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: What was the response to public or private incidents of anti-Semitism?</span> <span id="s134">Let us say by anything other than the Jewish Community?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: There wasn’t any, I believe, at least none that I knew about.</span> <span id="s136">Of course I was pretty well politically unaware, at that age.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Did you notice any response from your family to these incidents?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: If I remember right my father tried to appeal his dismissal, as being unjust and uncalled for etc.</span> <span id="s139">However it didn’t do him much good, even at that time, which was the very beginning.</span> <span id="s140">So he accepted his retirement.</span> <span id="s141">He was not too far off from retiring anyway.</span> <span id="s142">He felt that it was probably just as easy to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Were there any neighbors who responded or reacted to any of these instances in the beginning?</span> <span id="s144">any non-Jewish neighbors, I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Not particularly, to my knowledge.</span> <span id="s146">It was early, you see.</span> <span id="s147">People were just beginning to realize what was happening.</span> <span id="s148">I mean, non-Jews and Jews alike were still very insecure in getting used to what was really happening.</span> <span id="s149">Nobody really knew at that point what was going to happen, who was doing what to whom and why, any of that.</span> <span id="s150">That came much later, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: How about your peers?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: They fell into the same category.</span> <span id="s153">One girl said to me: “You are not supposed to be in school anymore!</span> <span id="s154">Are you?”</span> <span id="s155">However she was not sure either.</span> <span id="s156">It was one of these things where nobody knew what was happening.</span> <span id="s157">It was all very new, all around.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Do you recall when your town was occupied by the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: It wasn’t.</span> <span id="s160">People in all these towns and cities were beginning to form a Nazi party.</span> <span id="s161">Also Nazis in the cities and towns were beginning to build a political organization.</span> <span id="s162">(Hitler came to power when his party, and those who allied themselves to his party, commanded the largest number of deputies in the German parliament, the Reichstag, not before).</span> <span id="s163">You see Mannheim was never occupied by anybody until the Americans came in 1945.</span> <span id="s164">(There is a short time Allied presence followed WWI).</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Of course, you were in Germany.</span> <span id="s166">That was a bad use of the word.</span> <span id="s167">What I meant to say was: “The people who belonged to the Nazi party began to show themselves!”</span> <span id="s168">Would that be a better way of putting it?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Not exactly.</span> <span id="s170">This was not a sudden thing.</span> <span id="s171">They had been showing themselves right along.</span> <span id="s172">Gradually, very gradually, this developed.</span> <span id="s173">Obviously this is my memory of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: How did this begin to affect your family?</span> <span id="s175">That is before they left.</span> <span id="s176">In your everyday life, in your family’s everyday life such as shopping, religious life, business life?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: School ended around Christmas time for me and I left Germany in January, so I had about two months.</span> <span id="s178">Not very much happened to me in these two months, which I am aware of.</span> <span id="s179">There was no difference in shopping, at that point yet.</span> <span id="s180">There was really no difference in anything at that point.</span> <span id="s181">It was just beginning to get organized.</span> <span id="s182">It just did not happen all at once.</span> <span id="s183">I left before all these bad things really happened.</span> <span id="s184">So, you see I don’t have that much of a story to tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Your family left then shortly after this?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: Let me see: I left in 1934; my sister left for England in 1936; my brother went to Munich, the former capitol of Bavaria) and he was in Munich, working, and didn’t leave until 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Your family didn’t leave together then?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: No!</span> <span id="s189">No.</span> <span id="s190">Everybody left at a different time.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Would you like to explain that, please?</span> <span id="s192">Just exactly how that came about.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: OK!</span> <span id="s194">My farther had two sisters and one brother living in NYC.</span> <span id="s195">When things began to look bad his younger sister, who was married and had two children, two girls, wrote to him and said: “Send one of your girls to us, for safekeeping and who knows what else.</span> <span id="s196">Let us help you that much.</span> <span id="s197">We will let her live with us and we will get her to finish her education.</span> <span id="s198">Then we will see what she can do from thereon in.”</span> <span id="s199">That was me.</span> <span id="s200">I left in 1934.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Before we go any further!</span> <span id="s202">I have been remiss, would you please tell us what your father’s full name was?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A; Berthold Rosenthal.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: And your mother’s maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: Johanna Renzian.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Sorry for the interruption!</span> <span id="s207">You were then situated in NYC in 1934?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Right.</span> <span id="s209">Then I finished High School and went to Nursing School.</span> <span id="s210">Then I started to work.</span> <span id="s211">I went into the U.S. Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: You went into the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: At what time?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Not until 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Let us go back then and pick up the rest of your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: My sister, Lotte, took some kind of schooling for mentally retarded and disturbed children and worked in a home, a little bit north of Mannheim.</span> <span id="s218">Then, when things got fairly difficult she left and went to England.</span> <span id="s219">We had some relatives there.</span> <span id="s220">She worked as a babysitter and children care person, in private homes.</span> <span id="s221">(England would let people come in only if they belonged to certain categories; students, nurses, maids and butlers only).</span> <span id="s222">In 1939 or 1938 she came to the U.S.</span> <span id="s223">She also lived with my aunt for a little while, until she found a job.</span> <span id="s224">My parents stayed in Mannheim until 1940.</span> <span id="s225">When things really began to go terribly bad they wanted to leave to go to Berlin.</span> <span id="s226">From there they wanted to go to Sweden, where my mother’s brother lived.</span> <span id="s227">He had emigrated there.</span> <span id="s228">He had some connections to Sweden from WWI.</span> <span id="s229">However my parents were denied a visa to go through Finland, which they would have had to go through (Finland was then fighting against Russia).</span> <span id="s230">Then they were allowed to go through Spain and Portugal.</span> <span id="s231">They flew down there and then took a ship from Portugal and came to NYC.</span> <span id="s232">(RF was by then a U.S. citizen so she could demand that her parents be allowed entry into the U.S., outside the regular quota, which quota prevented many would be immigrants from receiving permission to come to the U.S.).</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: Did all of the family finally get together then?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Yes, in NYC.</span> <span id="s235">Yes we were all together.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Congratulations!</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Yes, it was nice, that is that we were together, except for my brother.</span> <span id="s238">He was not with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: My father and mother had actually decided to stay in Mannheim.</span> <span id="s241">They had talked about it.</span> <span id="s242">They were happy about where they lived.</span> <span id="s243">They were retired and my father kept doing genealogical research, he also kept writing papers about his research.</span> <span id="s244">They were satisfied, but of course they were in danger.</span> <span id="s245">This was between 1936 and 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: In other words, they lived a rather quiet, sedentary life, out of the public eye.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: Yes, and the city of Mannheim, as I said previously, was not a hotbed of Nazi activities.</span> <span id="s248">It was an industrial city.</span> <span id="s249">Its political climate was just that way.</span> <span id="s250">I believe that that has been documented officially, at least up to a point, of course.</span> <span id="s251">You know that, of course, it contained plenty of Nazis and there were plenty of difficulties and people from Mannheim got deported.</span> <span id="s252">My father was arrested and sent to some kind of jail or camp, I believe out of town, near Karlsruhe, which is a little south of Mannheim.</span> <span id="s253">Later he was set back home again, because he was over the age limit.</span> <span id="s254">The age limit, at that time was forty or forty-five.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: What year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Probably in 1938, or something like that.</span> <span id="s257">(This is a correction of what is on the tape).</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Was it considered a work camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: No.</span> <span id="s260">I remember that it was a jail.</span> <span id="s261">It was sort of a processing center of some kind.</span> <span id="s262">He was told to go back home and that they didn’t have any provisions for people of his age.</span> <span id="s263">He came home then and he was not arrested again.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: At what point did they decide that it was time to get out of Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: When people were beginning to be deported into the camp of Gurs, in Southern France.</span> <span id="s266">(That camp had been set up by the French government for “Germans” prior to the fall of France in May-June 1940, not far from Marseille.</span> <span id="s267">It was in the area of France which was controlled by Vichy, the so-called “Unoccupied France”.</span> <span id="s268">It was used by the Germans as a staging camp from which emigration out of Europe was not only possible but even encouraged.</span> <span id="s269">Those who did not manage to leave Europe were later transported to death camps.)</span> <span id="s270">They realized that the Jewish people round them, in their neighborhood, in their own city, were being deported.</span> <span id="s271">Then they knew that it was time to leave and they went to Berlin then.</span> <span id="s272">If you were not home, they could not find you, you see, that was a device which many people were smart enough to take (the Nazis arrested people by coming to homes or apartments listed for individuals) so, you see, if you were not at home and no one knew where you were, they could not find you and they could not arrest you.</span> <span id="s273">My brother did that.</span> <span id="s274">He rode his bicycle for the entire day in Munich during the day following Kristallnacht (the night of Nov. 9-10, 1938 when all over Germany synagogues and stores owned by Jews were ransacked and torched), when they were arresting people, so that he would not be home where they could find him.</span> <span id="s275">When they couldn’t find him, they could not arrest him.</span> <span id="s276">There was a whole lot of luck connected with it, but it didn’t necessitate only luck; it also involved planning.</span> <span id="s277">For example, if you weren’t around when someone knocked on your door, you weren’t there, and they had to keep on looking for you.</span> <span id="s278">Then, if you were lucky enough to be able to hide until things settled down a little (maybe they had filled their quota of arrests), you might be able to keep from being arrested.</span> <span id="s279">However my parents had planned and they packed up everything which they could carry in a couple of suitcases; they even packed their household goods.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Did they, at this time, I realize what was happening to the people who were arrested?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s282">Whether they knew of the ovens (the actual extermination camps, including the ovens actually did not come into production until 1941/42) and extermination, I am not 100% sure.</span> <span id="s283">However they knew that things were not going well.</span> <span id="s284">I am not quite sure that they knew the real gruesome details at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: In 1940, how did they plan to come to this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: They had planned to go from Mannheim, to Berlin, to I believe that they had said Finland and then Sweden and later to the U.S.</span> <span id="s287">They did not get the Finnish transit visa.</span> <span id="s288">I believe that the Finnish government was afraid that too many people were going to stay and they were concerned that they could not absorb them (Finland was also in a war with the Russians).</span> <span id="s289">That is what I was told.</span> <span id="s290">Therefore, since they could not go through Finland (WWII had started before then with the German invasion of Poland in Sep, 1939) they could not go into Sweden.</span> <span id="s291">Therefore they had to change their mind.</span> <span id="s292">They had a lot of rearranging to do in Berlin.</span> <span id="s293">They pulled all the strings which they knew how to pull and paid a certain amount of money to get a transit visa to fly from Berlin into Madrid.</span> <span id="s294">I believe that they sailed out of Lisbon, Portugal.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Now this visa which they paid for, whom did they pay, what visa was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: I do not know.</span> <span id="s297">I really don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Did your parents, at this time, have any knowledge of what was going on in the world at large?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Not 100% obviously, but yes, in general.</span> <span id="s300">However they were well enough informed to know that things were really happening all around them.</span> <span id="s301">They were very worried, yes indeed!</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Now, what knowledge did you have as to what was going on with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: I was about 95% informed about what was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Through letters.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Was your mail censored?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: I wouldn’t be surprised if it was.</span> <span id="s308">I couldn’t say officially that it was, but I am pretty certain that there was some interference with foreign mail.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: How about on the other end?</span> <span id="s310">Was your mail to them censored?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: The same supposition exists, but again I have no real proof.</span> <span id="s312">They never mentioned it but it was taken for granted that mail was not foolproof.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Now, what arrangements did you make in order to help your parents come to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: By that time I was a U.S. citizen so that I could ask for them, outside of the immigration quota.</span> <span id="s315">That was part of the law of 1921, revised in 1927, which stated that children could ask for their parents.</span> <span id="s316">My uncle, who had helped me come over, consulted a lawyer, all the forms had to be made out.</span> <span id="s317">These were forms going back and forth.</span> <span id="s318">(that is how they got their visas very quickly, after they decided to leave Germany).</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: They then had entered Spain with some German paper?</span> <span id="s320">Were they forged papers or were they legal papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: To the best of my knowledge they were legal papers (you could not have received Spanish, Portuguese and U.S. visas except on legal documents excepting for legerdemain).</span> <span id="s322">I don’t believe that they were forged.</span> <span id="s323">I am almost positive that they were not forged.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: Then from Spain, the request by you for them to enter this country outside of the quota was made.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: No, that happened before Spain.</span> <span id="s326">That happened while they were in Germany, that they had their immigration permits for the U.S. I think that if they hadn’t had those, they would not have been able to go into Spain or Portugal (they could not even have purchased the tickets).</span> <span id="s327">That had all been taken care of ahead of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: How did the experiences which you had affected your religious beliefs?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: I believe that my religious experiences evolved.</span> <span id="s330">They didn’t happen all at once.</span> <span id="s331">I told you that I was brought up to be fairly observant didn’t I?</span> <span id="s332">That I was brought up to be more interested in the ethics of Judaism than in the observances of Judaism, although we enjoyed, I mean that we really enjoyed, the Holy Day festivals and things like that.</span> <span id="s333">That was because they were family centered, and we were a warm family.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: Do you feel that as a result of this you were not disappointed in your religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: No, I was never disappointed in my religion.</span> <span id="s336">I don’t believe that my religion ever let me down.</span> <span id="s337">I felt that human beings do things to each other which are outside of a true religion; you know that the less marvelous part of human nature comes through.</span> <span id="s338">I don’t believe that this has anything to do with religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: You feel that your religious beliefs have evolved.</span> <span id="s340">Have your practices changed a great deal?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s342">I would think so, in some ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: Do you feel that that is because of your experiences or just a normal evolution?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: It is more apt to be a normal evolution.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: Again, you came to this country in 1934.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Yes, I came at the end of Jan.</span> <span id="s347">And I started High School about four or five days later.</span> <span id="s348">I finished High School in about two years.</span> <span id="s349">I graduated in 1936.</span> <span id="s350">Then I worked for a year as a babysitter and things like that.</span> <span id="s351">Then I went to nursing school.</span> <span id="s352">I stayed there for three years.</span> <span id="s353">I got licensed as a RN (Registered nurse).</span> <span id="s354">Then I worked for another year at the hospital where I had trained.</span> <span id="s355">Then I worked for the U.S. Public Health Service in NY State.</span> <span id="s356">Then I went into the army.</span> <span id="s357">I was in the Philippines for a year.</span> <span id="s358">After I came back, I started college.</span> <span id="s359">I went to NYC (New York University) and graduated one full year later.</span> <span id="s360">That was little more than one calendar year.</span> <span id="s361">Then I worked for the Visiting Nurses in N.Y. By that time my parents had moved to Omaha, Nebr.</span> <span id="s362">Because my sister who had gotten married and opened a restaurant in Omaha with her husband, had a small child.</span> <span id="s363">My parents went out there to baby sit because the hours at the restaurant were so long.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Your parents were retired?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Yes, they were retired.</span> <span id="s366">My father had worked a little for one of his cousins, while in NYC.</span> <span id="s367">Obviously living in NYC was boring and they could use the money.</span> <span id="s368">The income from that job wasn’t bad.</span> <span id="s369">He actually lived on a German pension.</span> <span id="s370">That is an interesting part: They paid him his pension, Nazi or non-Nazi.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: They continued to pay him the German pension?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: Yes, that is what they lived on.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: That is interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Very bureaucratic!</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Yes, very!</span> <span id="s377">Bureaucratic to the nth degree.</span> <span id="s378">It was just sickening actually and senseless in some ways.</span> <span id="s379">I could even call it idiotic.</span> <span id="s380">This was a good deal for us, so I can’t knock it.</span> <span id="s381">He worked long enough in the U.S. to collect Social Security.</span> <span id="s382">When they lived in Omaha, they lived with my sister and did the babysitting and helped bring up one and then two children.</span> <span id="s383">Then everybody was happy you know, everybody was on their feet.</span> <span id="s384">I worked in Omaha for a year or two and got a Master’s Degree from the University of Omaha.</span> <span id="s385">Then I worked in Iowa for a couple of years and then got married.</span> <span id="s386">Shortly after we were married my husband got a job here, in the Miami Valley.</span> <span id="s387">That is how we got here.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: What is your husband’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Robert Feist.</span> <span id="s390">We have been here ever since!</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: You moved to the Miami Valley in what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: In 1954.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: And your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: They stayed in Omaha.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: I mean your own family.</span> <span id="s396">Do you have children?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s398">I have two daughters!</span> <span id="s399">I have a daughter Bette and a daughter Debbie.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: What are their ages?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: Bette is 24 and Debbie will be 22.</span> <span id="s402">They were both born in Dayton.</span> <span id="s403">Debbie is still in College and Bette is out of College.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: How would you compare your life and your family’s life in the U.S. with life in Europe or can you make such a comparison?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: I don’t really think that I can compare.</span> <span id="s406">You know that you get introspective when you speculate what would have happened if you had continued to live the way you started without Hitler, without anything.</span> <span id="s407">I often felt that with all the agony and all that, I personally came out pretty lucky.</span> <span id="s408">I mean I, as an individual.</span> <span id="s409">Nobody can truly say what would have happened in Europe if the Nazis had not reached power.</span> <span id="s410">It is hard to say.</span> <span id="s411">Here the society is much freer.</span> <span id="s412">The opportunities are much greater.</span> <span id="s413">Individual advancement is much easier.</span> <span id="s414">You would have to pay me to go back and spend more time there.</span> <span id="s415">I really mean that, because from what I see and hear it is a much more restricted life.</span> <span id="s416">I verified that the one time I was back there.</span> <span id="s417">As I said, I personally came out fantastically well, in my own individual way, you know just considering me and myself, and of course my family.</span> <span id="s418">I, personally considering how horrible the situation was, I am well ahead of the game, really -- in all ways.</span> <span id="s419">This definitely is my own opinion, and I may be wrong, but I don’t really think so.</span> <span id="s420">From all that I know and gather I rather live here.</span> <span id="s421">You know that they say that the German mark is better than the U.S. dollar, at present, but German living is not as happy living as American living.</span> <span id="s422">That is just my own personal feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Have you been back to Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Once, and then not to Germany at all.</span> <span id="s425">We went to see my brother, who emigrated to Israel.</span> <span id="s426">That was our primary reason for going.</span> <span id="s427">When we all came to the U.S. he decided that he would go to Israel.</span> <span id="s428">He left Germany in 1939.</span> <span id="s429">They took a little boat down the Danube, then a boat which capsized in the Black Sea.</span> <span id="s430">It took them nine months to get from Germany to Israel.</span> <span id="s431">He said that this was his rebirth, because of the nine months.</span> <span id="s432">In Israel (Palestine at the time) he was interned by the British, as an illegal immigrant.</span> <span id="s433">He finally made it out and he is very happy now.</span> <span id="s434">We are going to visit him again next month.</span> <span id="s435">He is married and has children, and all that.</span> <span id="s436">He came out good too.</span> <span id="s437">However it is difficult to say what all would have happened to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: How often do you go to synagogue now?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: At least once a month, occasionally more.</span> <span id="s440">However we do attend lecture series at Temple, when they are in session, every week on Sunday mornings because we are very interested in them.</span> <span id="s441">We also are involved in other ways.</span> <span id="s442">Actually we go to the religious services on the average of about once a month.</span> <span id="s443">We do attend some Holy Day services, the ones for the more important Holy Days, very faithfully.</span> <span id="s444">The less important ones, we do not attend so faithfully.</span> <span id="s445">I occasionally attend services over where I work.</span> <span id="s446">There they have services on all Holy Days and I participate in them once in a while.</span> <span id="s447">(RF was, in 1979, Director of Nursing at Covenant House, the Jewish Home for the Aged of the area of Dayton).</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: To what extent do you feel that the synagogue is or is not the center of the Jewish Community life here, in Dayton?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: It is to a great extent.</span> <span id="s450">I think that it is to more of an extent than the Jewish Center, which is supposed to be for the entire community.</span> <span id="s451">A synagogue is a strange place.</span> <span id="s452">I think that most Jews would say that you have to have a synagogue even if they never attend it: they would still say that they want to have a synagogue.</span> <span id="s453">They would feel, even the most unobservant and the most irreligious individuals, that there should be a synagogue, even though they don’t go.</span> <span id="s454">It is one of these things which should be there and we need it and we must have it.</span> <span id="s455">It is a paradoxical sort of a thing.</span> <span id="s456">I feel very strongly that there have to be synagogues.</span> <span id="s457">There has to be continuation, perpetuation, that is important.</span> <span id="s458">It is a good ethical system which Judaism represents and it should not be lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: With whom do you usually associate, Jews or non-Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: With more Jews than non-Jews.</span> <span id="s461">Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: How have you found Jewish and non-Jewish life different or similar to those of your European experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Oh, I can’t compare it!</span> <span id="s464">Absolutely not!</span> <span id="s465">I left when I was 15 and I am now way past that age.</span> <span id="s466">I have no way of comparing an adult situation with a child’s.</span> <span id="s467">It wouldn’t be right.</span> <span id="s468">It would be meaningless.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: Do you ever think of your former life and how do you feel about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: I very rarely think about it.</span> <span id="s471">It seems like a terrible far past.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Will you ever visit Germany again?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: I have no great desire to do it.</span> <span id="s474">We will go to France and we will go to England and we will go to Greece this time, and we will go to Israel, of course.</span> <span id="s475">If we go across the river, which is the Rhine (that is the border between France and Germany in the area of France where RF intended to go) into Germany, it will maybe on a business matter which my husband is connected to, but not to sightsee.</span> <span id="s476">I have no real desire to sightsee there.</span> <span id="s477">Germany is a beautiful country but I have no great desire to spend time there.</span> <span id="s478">If I would ever go, it probably would be to visit cemeteries, because my grandparents, and all kind of other relatives are buried there.</span> <span id="s479">(After this interview was concluded RF looked back at old records of the family with the following results: On her mother’s side she traces her ancestry to grandparents three and four generations removed being born in the Hamburg, Berlin and Silesia area -- on her father’s side the records go back five and six generations, back to the 1680th, all pretty much being born and dying in the area 50 miles of Mannheim, but then her father did the basic research on the question from Mannheim).</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: How do you view your children’s lives as different from your own?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: I think that everyone who has ever lived, really lived, in Europe realizes the difference between the freedom and the openness and the permutation of the democratic spirit which exists in the U.S. versus Europe.</span> <span id="s482">I know that we laugh at it -- and we think that it is so imperfect -- but nothing in this world is very perfect -- but if you really compare and you really live it I think that you realize that it is very much different.</span> <span id="s483">I know that all the people who are dissidents and malcontents and dissatisfied, they don’t know, they really don’t know how good they have it.</span> <span id="s484">They really are selling themselves down the river for nothing.</span> <span id="s485">Again that is only my own opinion.</span> <span id="s486">I am really not blind to all the things which should be improved, really not, I really see a heck of a lot of things which ought to be better, but at least you can try and so many times you get there.</span> <span id="s487">We talk about classes, this, in the U.S. is basically a classless society compared to what you have in Europe.</span> <span id="s488">There you cow-tow to this one and to that one.</span> <span id="s489">In the Orient it is ten times worse.</span> <span id="s490">When I was in the Philippines it made me ill; they used to do our laundry and practically bowed from the waist for the permission to do our laundry.</span> <span id="s491">I used to say: “For goodness sakes, get up!”</span> <span id="s492">I don’t know; I am not a super patriot but I sure feel that there is an awful lot which is good here.</span> <span id="s493">Even though there are some things which are not that good, which could be improved, we have a good thing going.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: What portion of your life would you choose to pass on to future generations?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: I think the nice childhood which I had before the trouble started.</span> <span id="s496">I have often said to myself when I see so many people who are maladjusted in life and have hang-ups.</span> <span id="s497">I mean had hang-ups!</span> <span id="s498">People who can’t cope with life and who can’t do anything.</span> <span id="s499">They get so hung-up on things.</span> <span id="s500">I have often thought -- I mean that if I do any praying -- that I thank God that I had parents who had their feet on the ground and were wholesome, had wholesome personalities and were able to make our childhood secure and give us a good background.</span> <span id="s501">They made us want to grow up as normal human beings.</span> <span id="s502">They gave us the capacity to grow up as normal human beings.</span> <span id="s503">I believe that this is a great heritage and I wish it on every child.</span> <span id="s504">That would be great.</span> <span id="s505">We would have no problems, or hardly any problems.</span> <span id="s506">Those are the things I would like to see passed on to future generations.</span> <span id="s507">Hopefully I have done this to my children.</span> <span id="s508">I would like to pass this on to other people, to anyone for that matter.</span> <span id="s509">It is something very nebulous; you know, hard to give it to other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: Thank you Mrs. Ruth Feist, that was beautiful.</span></p></body></html>
