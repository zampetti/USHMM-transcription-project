Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Halina Peabody, conducted by Esther Finder, on June 3rd, 2002, in Rockville, Maryland.</span> <span id="s4">This interview is part of the museum’s project to interview Holocaust survivors and witnesses who are also volunteers with the museum.</span> <span id="s5">This is a follow-up interview that will focus on Halina Peabody’s post-Holocaust experiences.</span> <span id="s6">In preparation for this interview, I listened to the interview conducted with the Survivor’s of the Shoah Visual History Foundation on October 25th, 1996.</span> <span id="s7">I will not ask you to repeat everything you said in that interview.</span> <span id="s8">Instead, I will use this interview as an opportunity to follow up on that interview and focus on your post-Holocaust experiences.</span> <span id="s9">This is tape number one, side A.</span> <span id="s10">What was your name at birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Answer: Halina Janna Litman, L-i-t-m-a-n.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: And when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: I was born in Kraków on December 12th, 1932.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: Were you known by any other names during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: Yes, I had to assume a name, a Catholic name by the name of Halina Litinska.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: And how old were you at the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: I was 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: What can you tell me about the day that you realized that you were no longer under Nazi control?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: That day was a very difficult day in our lives because my mother, who was working for the German army, got up in the morning and thought -- it was very quiet out there, we were -- we knew that the -- the Russians were coming closer.</span> <span id="s20">We didn’t know where they were and the quiet was just eerie.</span> <span id="s21">And she didn’t know whether to go to -- to her job or not.</span> <span id="s22">And we were standing talking about it and suddenly a hand grenade split over the -- the house, which I didn’t know at the time, and I s -- hit my hand.</span> <span id="s23">I didn’t know what happened, I started screaming like Mother, Mother, my hand.</span> <span id="s24">And she realized that I was wounded, and everything went black, we didn’t know what was happening.</span> <span id="s25">The house sort of was coming down.</span> <span id="s26">And she grabbed my sister, who was only a few years old, and took her in the arms and grabbed me by the hand and we got out of the house.</span> <span id="s27">And my hand was bleeding and there was not a soul in the street.</span> <span id="s28">She tried to get somebody to pick us up, but nobody would.</span> <span id="s29">So I just had to hold her hand and we walked to the hospital, which was at the end of the street.</span> <span id="s30">At that time somebody came out of the hospital, picked me up and dragged me off -- took me to the hospital.</span> <span id="s31">And -- where they examined my hand.</span> <span id="s32">My thumb was cut off, was hanging on a piece of skin, and my little finger was ha -- half cut.</span> <span id="s33">My inside of the hand was a complete mess, it was just completely open.</span> <span id="s34">And they -- there was no penicillin, so they had to sort of clean it as best as they could.</span> <span id="s35">They told my mother my ha -- my arm might have to be cut off because of the infection that they expected.</span> <span id="s36">And they just put us all up in one bed in the hospital.</span> <span id="s37">So that was my day of liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: When was this?</span> <span id="s39">Do you happen to know the date?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: I don’t know, but it was spring or summer because we -- it was warm.</span> <span id="s41">We walked on the streets and I remember the sun was shining.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Was this 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: I believe it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: And where were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: We were in Jaroslaw, which is not too far from Kraków, which is not our hometown, but where we went as Catholics because nobody knew us there and it was sort of on the way to Kraków.</span> <span id="s46">I guess my mother was trying to be close, but not too close, in case she needed to look up somebody, or -- I don’t know why, really, but that’s where we -- we spent the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Can you tell me the names of your mother and your sister and how old your sister was?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: My mother’s name was Olga.</span> <span id="s49">My sister’s name was Eva, which she kept even as a Catholic.</span> <span id="s50">And she was born in June 30, 1939.</span> <span id="s51">So she must have been like almost six years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Who were your liberators?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Well, they had to have been Russian, which my mother referred to as not liberators, but occupiers, again.</span> <span id="s54">But at least they weren't killing us any more.</span> <span id="s55">Although there was a pogrom she told me, and she refused to let me speak my name.</span> <span id="s56">I still had to use the Catholic name because she said they’re going to kill us.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Did you see any other Jewish survivors at the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: Not at that point.</span> <span id="s59">Not -- not til much later.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: What did being free of the Germans mean to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Well, it meant a great frustration because I wanted to say who I was and I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s62">And there I was with my hand in a -- on the -- on the railing for two months, and my mother in the meantime -- well, they had to put it on a rail because they -- the hand was -- was going to grow in such a way that I wouldn’t be able to straighten it.</span> <span id="s63">It -- it -- it bent like that.</span> <span id="s64">If you -- if -- the nuns really saved my hand, because they kept on stretching and stretching.</span> <span id="s65">And my mother, in the meantime, was diagnosed with cancer.</span> <span id="s66">And so -- they didn’t -- they weren’t even sure a hundred percent if it was cancer, but there was a lump.</span> <span id="s67">And they felt that, you know, they didn’t want us to be orphans, they said, and they told me to go and convince her to have the -- the breast off.</span> <span id="s68">So on top of everything else, she had to have her breast off and she had this operation.</span> <span id="s69">And we discovered that the lady with whom we had been living during the war was killed by the same hand grenade that -- that hit me.</span> <span id="s70">So we had no -- no room, no place to go, although the neighbor next door took us in.</span> <span id="s71">So my mother spent th-the -- sort of the d-days before she got the operation between the hospital and home and with my sister.</span> <span id="s72">And then after she was operated on, she was also in the hospital.</span> <span id="s73">I guess my sister was with the lady sometime and sometimes with us in the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Were you a witness to any acts of retaliation or retribution against people who had helped the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Not personally, but when we already lived in London, we had a couple living in the house, we used to rent out hou -- rooms.</span> <span id="s76">And one of the guys was all broken up and beaten up and my father said that it was because he was a collaborator, that he -- he got beaten up.</span> <span id="s77">But not of my own eyes or experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Did you yourself, even though you were a child, want revenge?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: I don’t know what I wanted.</span> <span id="s80">I was too miserable and too weak to think about anything.</span> <span id="s81">My hand was occupying my -- my thoughts.</span> <span id="s82">Re-Reuniting with my father after so many years and not knowing him and not knowing, you know, how to behave.</span> <span id="s83">It was a strange world all of a sudden.</span> <span id="s84">I really didn’t think about it, I remember Mother saying that no matter what they will -- what kind of sentences they’ll give the Germans is not enough and there is just no kind of punishment that could punish them for what they’ve done.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: You mentioned a reunion with your father.</span> <span id="s86">Did that come immediately after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: No.</span> <span id="s88">After the war we knew he was alive because my mother got a Red Cross telegram.</span> <span id="s89">That is, she didn't get it directly, the people who never survived to tell us anything about what went on, but were killed by the Germans, sent us a letter that there was a communication from my father through the Red Cross that he was alive in Palestine with his sister.</span> <span id="s90">So we knew he was alive.</span> <span id="s91">We had no idea where exactly he was, but after the war there were announcements all over the place, and my mother put announcements in the radio.</span> <span id="s92">And they found him in Palestine.</span> <span id="s93">And that’s why he contacted us.</span> <span id="s94">He sent my cousin, his nephew who was in the British army in Palestine to Poland to get us out and to put us in touch with the Jewish agency, and that’s how we reunited.</span> <span id="s95">We reunited with him somewhere near Munich, after we crossed the Brenner Pass.</span> <span id="s96">He came to get us.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Do you know when that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: I’m not sure, but it was somewhere -- probably before April 1946.</span> <span id="s99">Probably March.</span> <span id="s100">March, April ’46 because by April I was in the -- in -- in the DP camp in -- in Italy, and I know he didn’t stay very long because he had to report back to the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: What was he doing in the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Well, he was part of the General Anders, the Polish army that fought along with the British army against the Germans.</span> <span id="s103">And apparently Stalin made this agreement at Yalta that they would let out the prisoners, all the prisoners out.</span> <span id="s104">However, he tells us that he had to run away and -- and found -- find a way to get out with the Polish army.</span> <span id="s105">He was in Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Did you make any attempts to find other relatives or friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Yes, we did.</span> <span id="s108">My mother went to Kraków and found that there was no sign of our grandparents.</span> <span id="s109">We did find that my uncle, my father’s brother survived Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s110">And we kept missing him.</span> <span id="s111">We kept trying to find him and we didn’t know where he was exactly, but we knew he was alive.</span> <span id="s112">He lost his wife and daughter, who was exactly my age.</span> <span id="s113">And he was the only one that survived in Poland.</span> <span id="s114">The others -- whoever -- whoever else was in Poland did not survive, in my family, but my aunt, uncle and cousin who were taken to Russia, to Siberia, also survived.</span> <span id="s115">My uncle died in [indecipherable] on the way out already of Russia, but my aunt and cousin lived in England with us afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Did you go back to your pre-war home?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: I could not.</span> <span id="s118">It’s in Russia -- it’s -- it’s in Ukraine now, it’s in Zaleszczyki, which is on the frontier of Romania.</span> <span id="s119">At the time, it was Poland.</span> <span id="s120">Now it’s Ukraine and they tell me it’s much too dangerous.</span> <span id="s121">They still would like to kill us all.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: When did you realize the full extent of the genocide?</span> <span id="s123">When did -- you know, it -- when did it all come together for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: Strangely enough it came to me when I was watching “World at War” with Lawrence Olivier.</span> <span id="s125">I had never really thought about it.</span> <span id="s126">I guess I was too young and too concentrated on my own problems.</span> <span id="s127">But when I saw that program, it struck me and it really hit me very, very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: I think I was already -- I don’t know, it has to be in England, or maybe even in the States.</span> <span id="s130">It was a -- much, much later.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: After your liberation, when you st-started moving to different places, did you have much contact with other survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Personally, no.</span> <span id="s133">My mother went to Kraków and tried to track, as I said, everybody down.</span> <span id="s134">There was no room for us in Kraków, so she found a -- a small place to live in, very close to one of the village near Kraków.</span> <span id="s135">Again they asked her directly if she was Polish, meaning was she Jewish and she had to say she was Polish.</span> <span id="s136">So again we were under the assumed names, and again we had to cover up.</span> <span id="s137">I went to school there.</span> <span id="s138">It was very strange, I was the only one who could read and write.</span> <span id="s139">And my mother went to the Jewish agency, and strangely enough, I don’t know why it is, but she only registered herself as being alive, never put the children down.</span> <span id="s140">They were very surprised that she had two children, that she managed to survive with two children.</span> <span id="s141">I never went to the Jewish com -- agency, as far as I remember, I think she went by herself, but I may have forgotten.</span> <span id="s142">Very -- something very strange happened there because an old friend of hers who was remarried to a Catholic man and had big cross on her breast, said to her that my hand happened because I became a Catholic without being baptized.</span> <span id="s143">I’ve never -- never forgotten that, my mother was absolutely infuriated and sort of stuck in my mind that some of us were not perfect.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: How long was it before you were able to -- to freely admit that you were really Jewish, and use your own name?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Well, it was when we manage -- when we finally got into the Jewish agency groups and everybody was Jewish.</span> <span id="s146">However, there was another little wrinkle.</span> <span id="s147">They thought we were not Jewish and they tried to say that my mother was trying to get out of Poland under the guise of being Jewish and that she really wasn't, and we were not.</span> <span id="s148">So she had to try to convince them that she really was Jewish.</span> <span id="s149">And there we were, you know, trying to convince them we are Jewish.</span> <span id="s150">And finally -- all she would say was that my -- her husband’s name was Isaac.</span> <span id="s151">And finally some people who knew us from Kraków did sign that -- sign off on us, that we were legitimate.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: You said you were with the Jewish agency groups.</span> <span id="s153">Where were you exactly?</span> <span id="s154">Can you clarify that?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Yes, we were in sort of group homes, they -- they had us in groups and they were going to transport us out one -- one group at a time.</span> <span id="s156">It was somewhere near Kraków, I -- I don’t know, is closer to the German border.</span> <span id="s157">And what happens was -- was that they took one group after a time, they took pregnant and old -- elderly people first.</span> <span id="s158">The Russians had a sort of agreement that they would let us through, but they liked to be paid on the border, so they always had prepared money and there was a Polish guy, then a Russian guy, then they kind of closed their eyes to us, but -- but you had to still pay your way through.</span> <span id="s159">The first lorry that went out got caught, and apparently they were put back into some other camp and then they were let go.</span> <span id="s160">They didn’t really want to keep us, but the second one went through and the problem was that before we got onto the truck, they attacked us at night, the Polish militia.</span> <span id="s161">And they wanted t-to -- to probably rape an-and steal from us, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s162">We had to stand there and scream on top of our lungs in order for them to go away.</span> <span id="s163">We were lucky that they in -- in the end they went.</span> <span id="s164">In the morning they turned up and said, oh, what was the problem, we heard there were noises.</span> <span id="s165">But we knew exactly what it was, so we were just looking forward to getting out.</span> <span id="s166">It was a very strange, very strange time.</span> <span id="s167">Strange time.</span> <span id="s168">The last -- the -- when we ca -- got out, we -- they put us out wha -- three kilometers past the frontier.</span> <span id="s169">Once my mother gave up her watch because the Russians wanted watches in addition to whatever they got.</span> <span id="s170">And then another guy gave his watch up.</span> <span id="s171">So we got through and then the German refused to sell us tickets.</span> <span id="s172">We were supposed to buy tickets in the train and then get to Berlin on our own accord.</span> <span id="s173">And the leaders went to buy tickets and the Germans didn’t want to sell them to us because we were Jews.</span> <span id="s174">I don’t know what they did in the end, but we did get on the train and we did get to Berlin.</span> <span id="s175">We were in the Russian sector first and they tried to also establish that we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s176">They took two or three people and had them sign their name in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s177">And the -- then they came back and it was okay.</span> <span id="s178">We went from there to the British section and then to the American section, we were kind of carted around.</span> <span id="s179">And in the end they sent us on to DP camp in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Do you remember the name of the DP camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Yes, it was -- there were two near Ancona, there was Trani and Barletta.</span> <span id="s182">And we did not spend much time there, but have quite nice memories.</span> <span id="s183">I remember the music.</span> <span id="s184">And well, I -- as I said, we were young and we wanted -- we were happy to be alive.</span> <span id="s185">It was a -- it was a better time.</span> <span id="s186">The weather was beautiful, we had food, and my father told them explicitly to keep us there as long as possible, to have us recover in the nice weather and the good food.</span> <span id="s187">My father, who was a dentist, had privilege in the hospital there and so we used to go and have our meals at the hospital.</span> <span id="s188">My mother taught us to swim there in the -- in the gorgeous sea, you know, and we had a very pleasant time.</span> <span id="s189">The food was marvelous, the -- the -- the cherries particularly, just absolutely wonderful.</span> <span id="s190">And the ice cream, I’ve never tasted -- maybe because it was after the war and we were so hungry, but never tasted anything like it.</span> <span id="s191">And it was -- it was very pleasant pastime.</span> <span id="s192">Unfortunately, because my father asked them to send us late -- last, they sent us first to England, because we chose -- my father and my mother decided that out of the choices, Palestine or England, we should go to England.</span> <span id="s193">So they sent us in a very cold time to England.</span> <span id="s194">It was not -- not a very happy experience to begin with.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Stay with me for just a minute in the DP camp.</span> <span id="s196">Can you tell me a little bit about the conditions there with respect to housing and work and education opportunities.</span> <span id="s197">Can you talk a little bit about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: We were there only two months, and we -- we were just there, I think, for sleeping, because we spent most of that time in the hos -- near the hospital and -- and on the beach.</span> <span id="s199">We didn’t have much education, no there was no education, I mean, there was nothing going on.</span> <span id="s200">At the time it was not organized for that yet.</span> <span id="s201">Very early, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Do you know when?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: I don’t, I’m afraid.</span> <span id="s204">But as I said, I found that we were there in 19 -- in -- in April 1946, so that -- that’s the date that I have because I found some document that states April ’46, we were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Did you have any trouble letting go of some of the behaviors you had to use to survive during the war, like you know, did you have any trouble with your name or with anything else?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: I didn't have any na -- trouble with my name.</span> <span id="s207">I do remember when we first found Father and we -- he ha -- he brought a -- a chauffeur and a Mercedes and we traveled through -- through part of Italy and at one point we got off and went into some side -- side -- what do they call it, the gardens.</span> <span id="s208">And we found these beautiful red cherries and we picked up some and we came -- came to -- back to the car and he almost killed us.</span> <span id="s209">I mean, he was furious.</span> <span id="s210">He told us no more stealing.</span> <span id="s211">We were so used to do that during the war in order to survive.</span> <span id="s212">So that stands out in my mind.</span> <span id="s213">What was the other question?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Do you have any trouble, you know, just identifying yourself as a Jew at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: No, not I, but my sister.</span> <span id="s216">My sister, who did not know she was Jewish, because we couldn’t tell her, she was too young.</span> <span id="s217">When my cousin from Palestine came, even though he didn’t look that Jewish, she immediately recognized that he had a long nose, and she said, Arayed, you’re Jewish, but you’re nice.</span> <span id="s218">And he said, but you’re Jewish too.</span> <span id="s219">And she said absolutely not.</span> <span id="s220">She would not believe him.</span> <span id="s221">And it took her quite awhile before she accepted it, but I had no trouble, no.</span> <span id="s222">I just kept going to church, though.</span> <span id="s223">I was so used to it, I kept going to church until they stopped me.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: What did going to church give you?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Oh, just being with friends on Sunday.</span> <span id="s226">I mean, that was the only recreation we had during the war, you know, the only time that you dressed a little bit, whatever you had and it was a social occasion, so it was very hard to -- you know, not to do it.</span> <span id="s227">Everybody else was Catholic.</span> <span id="s228">Most of the people we were with was -- are, you know, officer’s families.</span> <span id="s229">So that was something that I -- I missed.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Can you remember the very first time after the war that you felt free enough to admit that you’re a Jew to somebody in public?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Not until we left Poland.</span> <span id="s232">Not in Poland, but once we left Poland, then yes.</span> <span id="s233">And I was very -- I was very happy about be-being able to admit it, but I wasn’t proud of it until I lived in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: What steps did you and your family take to rebuild your life?</span> <span id="s235">For example, were you able to get any rehabilitation for your hand?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: There was no such thing as rehabilitation for anything in those days as far as I know.</span> <span id="s237">What I did get was some help from the teachers, who tried to accommodate my -- both the lack of no -- knowing English and my lack of thumb, to do subjects that would make it easier for me.</span> <span id="s238">And that’s why they immediately switched me to commercial subjects like shorthand, which meant that I didn’t have to spell, and typing, which means I learned how to spell by copying.</span> <span id="s239">And then also arranged for me -- showed me how to use my fingers so that I wouldn’t need the thumb or the little finger, so that I could type.</span> <span id="s240">And I did type over a hundred words a minute at one point, so I -- I did pretty well on that.</span> <span id="s241">And I also found that I could knit, which I could before the war, before I lost my thumb.</span> <span id="s242">And whatever I could do before, including even cutting my cuticles, I found I could do.</span> <span id="s243">At one point they decided they wanted to help me and they got me to a doctor and the doctor was going to try to do something with my hand, they wanted to adjust my -- one of my fingers so that I could use it as a thumb.</span> <span id="s244">I don’t know, it was -- it was a very difficult situation.</span> <span id="s245">My mother didn’t know what to tell me cause she was in such pain about this, and w -- I ended up being in the hospital and already the -- getting the first shot before the anesthesia and I said no, I don’t want to do it, and I just got out.</span> <span id="s246">And I said I -- you know, I just got off the bed and -- and thanked them and -- and never tried that one again.</span> <span id="s247">I felt that it was just too difficult and I’m glad I did because my instinct just told me not to.</span> <span id="s248">But other than that my rehabilitation was mainly my own doing.</span> <span id="s249">The other thing I did was play table tennis, which meant that I was easier with the company I was in.</span> <span id="s250">I liked the company of boys, which was easier [indecipherable] to play table tennis.</span> <span id="s251">And plus, when you play a -- a sport like table tennis or any other sport, you have no time to think of your hand.</span> <span id="s252">You know, I used to stand with my hand in the back so that it doesn’t show.</span> <span id="s253">But when you play, you know, you have to serve, you have to put your ball up and -- and you -- you have to look at the ball, so you don’t have time for the hand.</span> <span id="s254">And that, I think, is my cure.</span> <span id="s255">That was my cure.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Where were you that they were teaching you English?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: I was in England.</span> <span id="s258">Yeah, my father, as I said, decided to go to England, and after spending about a year in Liverpool in a camp, we -- also they taught -- tried to teach us English there.</span> <span id="s259">They taught us and -- and I was sent to a school in Ulverston, which was a little way away -- away, and I was surprised how well I was doing until I learned it was a technical school.</span> <span id="s260">But anyway, my English started getting slowly better, you know, you’re like -- 13 and a half I was by then.</span> <span id="s261">My sister had no problem whatsoever, but I had troubles.</span> <span id="s262">I was reading Polish books and knitting in school, but they didn’t mind.</span> <span id="s263">They let me -- they let me do what I needed to and I did math.</span> <span id="s264">So that’s how I started learning English.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: You mentioned a camp in Liverpool, can you elaborate?</span> <span id="s266">| A: I -- it was a military -- I mean, it was for m -- for officer’s families.</span> <span id="s267">The English were very nice to us, but it was such a hard time at the time because they were so worn out themselves that r-rationed food was very scarce.</span> <span id="s268">They gave us what they gave to th -- to their own, but it was -- we were always hungry.</span> <span id="s269">And, as I said, we had heating only a -- a couple of hours a day.</span> <span id="s270">We were in barracks, you know, it was beds, stacked beds, and did our best that we could.</span> <span id="s271">We go to Liverpool with our ration cards and get some bit of clothing here and there, but mainly we lived on kippers, because you know, we were hungry for meat and meat was very scarce.</span> <span id="s272">So the kippers were the only ones that you could get without rationing.</span> <span id="s273">I don’t think I’ve ever seen a kipper since, because I can’t stand it.</span> <span id="s274">But mainly that’s wh-what we ate as -- as protein.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: During that period of time, were you aware of the events that were unfolding in Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: No, not at all.</span> <span id="s277">I -- I hardly knew what Palestine was all about.</span> <span id="s278">I had very little knowledge about that.</span> <span id="s279">It was not until they declared the state of Israel that I remember my father coming in with absolutely shining eyes and saying, we have a country.</span> <span id="s280">And that was when I really paid attention.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: Did you follow the Nuremberg Trials?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s283">I guess I was too busy with my own problems again, but I remember my mother tell -- saying that there was no punishment that she could think of that would be enough for them, so there was a lot anger.</span> <span id="s284">But as I said, I -- I was too busy with doing other things and I was just too young to -- to think about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: Some.</span> <span id="s287">Not very overt, but I’ll never forget when I applied for a job at the automobile association in London.</span> <span id="s288">The personnel officer asked me what religion I was, she said I didn’t have to say.</span> <span id="s289">But I wanted to, at that time I felt I needed to say who I was, so I said Jewish.</span> <span id="s290">And she said to me, we don’t ma -- mind Jews, but you can’t have Jewish holidays off.</span> <span id="s291">And I was so stung by it.</span> <span id="s292">Now, I’m not religious, but it stung me, I’ve never forgotten it.</span> <span id="s293">I did get the job.</span> <span id="s294">I did very well there, too, but I’ve never forgotten that.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Did the people in England ask you about your wartime experiences?</span> <span id="s296">And if they did, what did you tell them?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s298">Not -- people were not very interested.</span> <span id="s299">There were a lot of refugees and nobody was really curious about u -- me as far as I knew.</span> <span id="s300">They were very helpful.</span> <span id="s301">The English are very -- how can I put it?</span> <span id="s302">They don’t -- they don’t question you, they don’t ask you things like that.</span> <span id="s303">They were very quiet about it and they knew, but they didn't really know.</span> <span id="s304">But they didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s305">So they were very nice, as I said, they put themselves out, they tried to help me in school.</span> <span id="s306">They gave me secondhand clothing which they said would be for somebody in the camp, which they meant for me.</span> <span id="s307">But other than that, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: I think we’re going to pause, and I’m going to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: -- the interview with Halina Peabody.</span> <span id="s311">This is tape number one, side B. And I was asking you about your time in England and you said that this -- the British didn’t ask you much about your wartime experiences.</span> <span id="s312">Did anybody ask you about your hand?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Not really, they didn’t.</span> <span id="s314">They were too polite.</span> <span id="s315">The British are like that.</span> <span id="s316">They just don’t ask you.</span> <span id="s317">But as I said, they were very nice and helped me a lot in other ways, but never asked me anything about my hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: Were you happy there?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: No.</span> <span id="s320">No, I was very miserable.</span> <span id="s321">Look, I didn’t know the language, I had my hand to cover up all the time.</span> <span id="s322">That was before I was playing table tennis, and it -- it was a miserable time.</span> <span id="s323">The weather is miserable in England.</span> <span id="s324">It was cold, I was always cold, and rainy.</span> <span id="s325">I didn’t have enough clothes really and it was hard getting used to being a family with Father again.</span> <span id="s326">We were so used to being with just Mother and plus, during the war I was the -- the s -- the second partner, you know, and then after the war I was a child again.</span> <span id="s327">It was very uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s328">And we struggled, because when they decided to come to London, we bought a house.</span> <span id="s329">The way you bought a house that time, all the refugees wanted a house to have roots, but you lived in a -- one level and you rented out the rooms at the top so that you could pay the mortgage.</span> <span id="s330">So it was a hard life.</span> <span id="s331">And my mother didn’t realize that by law I had to go to school, so before we came to London, she and my sister went first to look for the house and she broke down in one of the schools because they said that they had no room for me.</span> <span id="s332">And -- and th-the director took pity on her and said he s -- he’ll send her to another school in Fulham, which is southwest London, where they did accept me.</span> <span id="s333">It was a very nice -- it was actually a girls’ school.</span> <span id="s334">And the headmistress, Dr. Toms, I’ll never forget.</span> <span id="s335">She was a very -- very lovely lady.</span> <span id="s336">And so they accepted me there, but when they moved to the house -- when we went to [indecipherable] London, she insisted I continue going to s -- to Fulham, which meant about an hour on the underground every day, cause she was so afraid that they -- I wouldn’t get education.</span> <span id="s337">So it was a hard time.</span> <span id="s338">I liked school, and they weren't having any -- any excuses there, you know.</span> <span id="s339">I said I didn’t know enough English to do my homework and they said never mind, just keep trying.</span> <span id="s340">So I ended up really doing just as well as any other, and as I said, because I was on commercial subjects, I did pretty well.</span> <span id="s341">In fact, I did -- I think I was one of the first pupils in -- in school that passed the shorthand test.</span> <span id="s342">So I was happy in that, from that point of view, but living at home was difficult.</span> <span id="s343">We -- as I said, we struggled every week, there was not enough money for anything.</span> <span id="s344">My father was able to practice dentistry in -- in the army, but not in England.</span> <span id="s345">He wasn’t -- his -- his education wasn’t a-a-apparently sufficient, so he was a difficult situation too.</span> <span id="s346">So it was not -- not an easy time at all.</span> <span id="s347">My mother was miserable.</span> <span id="s348">She felt very much an incomplete person because of her operation for cancer.</span> <span id="s349">And she was very, very unhappy and that made me unhappy because, you know, I loved my mother very much.</span> <span id="s350">I did realize what she did for us during the war, I mean, she just absolutely used up every inch of her strength and I think she didn't have much strength left in her to fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: How long did you stay in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: About 11 years.</span> <span id="s353">I stayed from when we arrived to 1957 and my mother died in 1954 and -- ’53 - ’54 -- 1953 was the first time that I went to Israel for the Maccabiah with my table tennis.</span> <span id="s354">I joined the Maccabee club in London and became very good at it and we represented England in the Maccabiah games.</span> <span id="s355">That was the happiest trip in time I’ve ever had, I -- you know the ship, the old, old ship that was horrible, that was such -- I had such a wonderful time and we stood on the -- on the ship all night coming through to Haifa and I’ll never forget that experience.</span> <span id="s356">So in 1953 was my first trip to Israel.</span> <span id="s357">And unfortunately my mother came down with cancer when I got back and in 1957, I left England for good, but until then I lived in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: And where did you go when you left England?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: To Israel, to the second Maccabiah, where there was some family.</span> <span id="s360">We had the family that emigrated to -- to Palestine in 1932, my father’s sister and her four children.</span> <span id="s361">There were just grandchildren there by then already, and I had friends.</span> <span id="s362">The one couple that survived that we knew from before the war in Haifa.</span> <span id="s363">And I had the most wonderful time there.</span> <span id="s364">And there was another woman who was my age, whose parents knew my parents.</span> <span id="s365">And we were in touch, so I had friends in both Haifa and Tel Aviv, and it -- I felt so much at home.</span> <span id="s366">I mean, it was just wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: When you moved to Israel, what were your expectations as to what you would do there?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: I was hoping to get a job, just to be able to stay and that was my primary concern, and I knew I couldn’t just stay with my friends forever, and my aunt, so I start looking for a job.</span> <span id="s369">And because I spoke and -- and -- and was educated in England, I found a job in Haifa, which was near Haifa, actually.</span> <span id="s370">Haifa refineries, which belonged to British petroleum, and they grabbed me because I was British educated.</span> <span id="s371">So I had no problem and I got into a -- a hostel, there were lovely youth hostels there.</span> <span id="s372">And started working there and lived there for many years, until they sold the refineries.</span> <span id="s373">And then they tried to teach us Hebrew, I didn’t do very well.</span> <span id="s374">I did speak, but I didn’t write or read and I couldn’t work in the language.</span> <span id="s375">So I started looking in Tel Aviv, and I had two offers.</span> <span id="s376">One was from the Wisotsky tea; they would have taught me better Hebrew, and then there was the American embassy in Tel Aviv, and that was more glamorous.</span> <span id="s377">Even though the-they offered a lower salary, I decided that that was the place for me.</span> <span id="s378">So I took the job at the American embassy and moved to Tel Aviv.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: And what was your social life like?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: Well, my social life was -- was good.</span> <span id="s381">I had lots of different boyfriends and I was trying very hard to settle down, but it wasn’t easy.</span> <span id="s382">Never easy.</span> <span id="s383">I was not so young any more, I was in my late 20’s.</span> <span id="s384">For me I thought that was very late.</span> <span id="s385">I missed my boat.</span> <span id="s386">So I -- I had some friends in Haifa and lots of girlfriends, that was easy.</span> <span id="s387">And we had a good time.</span> <span id="s388">And -- and then in the embassy there was some very interesting and attractive young men, so that’s how my social life was pretty good there.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Did the Israelis ask you about your wartime experiences, and -- and what did you tell them?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s391">I don’t recall them.</span> <span id="s392">I tried to tell them about my hand, I was always warning people about my hand because I was still at the point where I thought I had to warn them so that people wouldn’t get a shock.</span> <span id="s393">And I remember one young man who tried to grab my hand, and I said don’t, you’ll be sorry.</span> <span id="s394">And he insisted and then I could see him going absolutely stiff and -- and -- and -- and surprised.</span> <span id="s395">And that was a terrible experience.</span> <span id="s396">And so I -- I tried to warn people about that, but not -- not -- about the rest of the experiences, nobody really wanted to know.</span> <span id="s397">They all be -- they were busy themselves, you know, building up the country and my family would not speak any Polish, they said that that was not the language that they wanted to use.</span> <span id="s398">And so we spoke English actually [indecipherable] until I learned enough Hebrew to speak with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Did you get a sense from the Israelis that you socialized with and spent time with of what their reaction to the Holocaust was?</span> <span id="s400">Did they ever speak about that with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: Not then, but later on I’ve heard remarks like, you know, we got to get on with our lives, you know, this was then, this is now, we’ve got a new fight on our hands.</span> <span id="s402">They really didn't want to get involved.</span> <span id="s403">Of course, the Eichmann trial came afterwards and that really became a big, big thing in Israel and a lot of people -- well, a lot of people fainted, a lot of people had heart attacks, because it all brought it back and there were witnesses that had to appear.</span> <span id="s404">And I remember then that there was some more interest in it, and most of the people didn't want to know, tried not to think about it, but you could not help it, it just floated back and flooded you with memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: Did you ever serve in the army or were you ever asked to serve?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: I was about to be asked and then I got married.</span> <span id="s407">So as a married person I did not have to go into the army.</span> <span id="s408">I have a feeling that if had gone, because of my hand I would not have been on the front lines anyway, but I was afraid.</span> <span id="s409">I didn’t want to go into the army.</span> <span id="s410">I didn’t get married for that reason, but I did -- I did li -- like the idea not having to go into the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: So tell me about getting married and who you married.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: Well, I married a guy who worked for the U.S. Information Agency, and who was Bulgarian and was very, very -- how can I put it?</span> <span id="s413">Very important in the USIS, he was the head of the local people and he did a very good job, spoke beautiful English, so I had no problem, but he was a Sephardic Jew.</span> <span id="s414">So that was a little problem for my family, they didn't like the idea very much, but well it was, as I said, it was a different time in -- in everybody’s life and everybody was mingling by then.</span> <span id="s415">And his mother was very, very lovely, I remember that.</span> <span id="s416">And his father was a little bit strange, was very autocratic.</span> <span id="s417">I didn’t like that, but I wasn’t marrying the family.</span> <span id="s418">And I met him at the embassy and we got married at the em -- well, actually, at the embassy.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: When you think back on your time in Israel, what come to mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: It comes -- what comes to mind in mainly that I loved Israel and I still do.</span> <span id="s421">It’s my place, it’s my country and even though I don’t live there, it’s the most important thing in my life is that Israel survives.</span> <span id="s422">It’s something that I’m so proud of, and I’m -- I’m just so worried about all the time, and there’s always been problems there, as you know.</span> <span id="s423">So it’s so difficult to now accept the fact that we’re still again at war, and more and more killings and more killings and I feel haunted -- ho-hounded.</span> <span id="s424">It’s like it’s never ends.</span> <span id="s425">I was just go -- getting over the Holocaust and here we are again, another Holocaust.</span> <span id="s426">And it’s frightening what’s written in the papers, that they want to demolish us again and that the Arabs are against us and that we may not survive.</span> <span id="s427">I just hope not to live that long to see that.</span> <span id="s428">But I do believe it will survive, and I think that the spirit of the people and the strength of Israel is such that there’s just no way that they can finish them off.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: When did you leave Israel and why?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: I left Israel in 1968, and the reason for that was that my husband was, as I said in the U.S. Information Agency, and he wanted, for his own career development, wanted to go and expand a little.</span> <span id="s431">Israel is a small country.</span> <span id="s432">He felt that in his profession, he needed a little more air.</span> <span id="s433">So we thought we’d come for a year, at least that was the plan.</span> <span id="s434">We rented our apartment and came with the best hope.</span> <span id="s435">He also wanted to go to school if possible, and I was supposed to go to work.</span> <span id="s436">My son was then five and a half, so he was going to go to kindergarten.</span> <span id="s437">And that’s how we planned it.</span> <span id="s438">We got to Washington, but by the time we got to Washington he got an offer from the Hoover Institute, which is near Stamford University in California.</span> <span id="s439">So in the end we went out to Palo Alto and that’s where we spent two and a half years and -- and he actually did some very good work at the Hoover Institute.</span> <span id="s440">He was the first Israeli to work there and the local Jewish community was very nice to us and very interested in what we were about and wanted to know more about us.</span> <span id="s441">This was part of the Jewish community that was never very much involved with Israel and that was a time that they suddenly awa -- awoke to the fact that Israel was something that would be of interest to them.</span> <span id="s442">And so we had a very, very nice social life there.</span> <span id="s443">And he did very well.</span> <span id="s444">He did very well, but then he changed, he went to work for San Francisco Examiner, and after awhile he felt that the only way to complete his rise in the -- in the profession, he had to come east.</span> <span id="s445">So that’s -- after two and a half years we moved back to Washington and he went to work for Voice of America.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: You said your husband was from Bulgaria, is he also a survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Yes, but Bulgarian Jewry was not killed, only -- only the other areas, I think the -- the Bulgaria proper, the king would not let anybody be killed.</span> <span id="s448">They put them in camps, they told them to give up all their goods, gold, silver, money, whatever, property.</span> <span id="s449">But they never killed anybody.</span> <span id="s450">And so they survived as a -- as a community and the whole community after the war, immigrated to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: Can you tell me your husband’s name and also your son’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: My husband’s name is Norbert Yasharoff, and I have two sons.</span> <span id="s453">One is Dov Yasharoff and one is Joe, or Yosi Yasharoff.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: Before you came to the United States, what were your expectations of America?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: Well, I was a little worried.</span> <span id="s456">I was happy that they spoke English.</span> <span id="s457">I thought they were supposed to speak English anyway.</span> <span id="s458">It didn’t turn out completely correct, but -- and I was a little concerned, I -- you know, it -- I heard about the United States for the first time in more detail when I worked for the American embassy where I also worked.</span> <span id="s459">I forgot to tell you.</span> <span id="s460">Oh yes, I did tell you.</span> <span id="s461">And it was frightening, was a long way away.</span> <span id="s462">It was a long, long way away and I thought that it was going to be strange, but I saw the Hollywood films and I thought that couldn’t be like that.</span> <span id="s463">Turned out it was, almost, you know, and people had three cars in the family, I thought they were lying, but that’s how it is, they do.</span> <span id="s464">We do.</span> <span id="s465">And the thing that struck me about the United States was how beautiful it was.</span> <span id="s466">And they never -- Americans who travel abroad never tell you how beautiful America is, they just complain.</span> <span id="s467">And the vastness of it.</span> <span id="s468">Th-The -- the size, th-the width and th-the breadth of it, it’s just amazing because we come from Europe, small countries, you know, you go for a few ki-kilometers and you’re at the border of one country and another country.</span> <span id="s469">And in the States you can travel for days and days and days and you can still be in the same country.</span> <span id="s470">And also the fact that whether it’s pal -- Palo Alto or Washington, you can go to a store and get the same product, which is -- as I said, it was kind of strange for me, I d -- not -- not expected that.</span> <span id="s471">Life was very nice, all the machines that I never would have thought of.</span> <span id="s472">Never dreamt I would have a car, that my most valued possession.</span> <span id="s473">And altogether the Americans are much nicer than the British, they’re much friendlier.</span> <span id="s474">And it’s easy to make yourself a little niche and to live happily in your corner.</span> <span id="s475">It’s true there’s a lot of other problems in the States, but you don’t have to be involved.</span> <span id="s476">In the smaller country I think you -- you -- you -- willy nilly you’ve got to be involved.</span> <span id="s477">But in the United States, you live in beautiful Bethesda or beautiful Palo Alto and you can forget about the other parts.</span> <span id="s478">Not nice maybe, but after what we’ve been through we felt very -- I felt very relieved and -- and I needed the rest from all the problems.</span> <span id="s479">So that was nice.</span> <span id="s480">We had other struggles because we had, obviously, to make a living, and my son went to school, and that was alright.</span> <span id="s481">He learned English very, very fast, so that was not a problem.</span> <span id="s482">But life was not easy, but it was more comfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: Did any Americans ask you about your Holocaust experiences, or your hand, or anything else, and what did you tell them?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Yeah, the Americans did, especially, you know, when I first got to Palo Alto they did.</span> <span id="s485">I told them my story, they want to know about my hand, yes.</span> <span id="s486">And I told them.</span> <span id="s487">In fact, in Palo Alto our group of friends were -- were doctors and one of them was a plastic surgeon.</span> <span id="s488">And that was the other time when they -- he offered to do something on my hand.</span> <span id="s489">And it was going to be a very interesting project, he was going to do it for free.</span> <span id="s490">He was going to si -- take my little -- what was left of my little finger and transplant it to make a thumb out of it, and then cover my -- all the inside of the hand, the palm.</span> <span id="s491">It was going to take a couple of years to do it because I had to -- it was grafting -- grafting was going to take all this time and I was not going to be able to do anything at home.</span> <span id="s492">My husband was not at all for it.</span> <span id="s493">But even I felt that I -- I said to him, if he could give me back my hand as it was, I would do it, but not if it’s going to give me something else new to -- to get used to and to learn how to use.</span> <span id="s494">It’s been too long that I’ve known how to use my hand as it is.</span> <span id="s495">I’m not suffering.</span> <span id="s496">I probably can’t play the piano, but that’s about all I can think that I can’t do.</span> <span id="s497">So at that point in my -- in my life, was not worth it and I backed out.</span> <span id="s498">But he did try.</span> <span id="s499">And I did tell people.</span> <span id="s500">They listened to the story, they weren't -- it wasn’t goi -- a big deal, but -- but I did tell them the story, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: Were you able to get any additional education in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Not really, I went to work.</span> <span id="s503">I had to work.</span> <span id="s504">I did learn a lot on the jobs.</span> <span id="s505">I really learned a lot on the jobs and I went -- got better and better jobs in the office, and yes -- and I -- I -- I did very well, I got to be administration director and hired and fired people, and that was good, I just wished that I’d gone back to school, but I had a child and I had to babysit him, sort of thing and my husband just didn’t want to do that for me so I missed out -- out on that a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: How many children do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: I have two sons.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: And the second one’s name is?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: Dov.</span> <span id="s510">Dov and Joseph.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: Wa -- one was born in Israel and the other one was born in the States, am I understanding it?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: No.</span> <span id="s513">I mean, my first child Dov was born in Israel and he has Down’s syndrome.</span> <span id="s514">And he is the one who is now in a -- in a special school, it’s a special place in England.</span> <span id="s515">And my second son was born in Reading, England because mainly, my husband had an offer to go to try for the BBC job at the time I was pregnant, and I was only too pleased to get out because I was still worried about my birth, because of the first experience, that I wanted to be everything different and every -- somewhere else.</span> <span id="s516">So we agreed to go for a year to England and that’s where I gave birth to Joe, in Reading, England.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Have you spoken to your son about your experiences during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s519">Never, never kept it from him.</span> <span id="s520">It wasn’t much of interest to him perhaps to begin with, but then he started when he was in school, he did a paper, he interviewed me and did a paper on me, so he was always aware of -- of my experiences.</span> <span id="s521">And asked them questions definitely, but it was never a secret, so I don’t think he ever felt that he had to pry things out of me.</span> <span id="s522">If he asked I answered.</span> <span id="s523">I had nothing really dramatic to tell him except the horror of the whole thing, but I wasn’t in a camp, I wasn’t tortured.</span> <span id="s524">My hand happened, but it happened, it didn’t -- wasn’t somebody, you know, cutting me up.</span> <span id="s525">So my -- I always felt that my story was not too horrifying for anybody to listen to.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about his education, what he does today?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: Joe was -- well, he was kindergarten age when he came here and he went straight to school, through school and he got a Bachelor’s from Maryland, University of Maryland.</span> <span id="s528">Took him a little longer than he should have, but he did it having a job already.</span> <span id="s529">He worked for Fox sports for 15 years, I think.</span> <span id="s530">And now he’s with Comcast.</span> <span id="s531">He does producing and he’s a -- what’s called assignment management for Comcast in Washington, D.C..</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: You haven’t said much about your sister.</span> <span id="s533">Can you tell me a little about her?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: Oh yes, my sister, my sweet little sister, she was a baby two months old when the war broke out and my mother and I always took care of her.</span> <span id="s535">And she was very, very ill during the war.</span> <span id="s536">In fact, my mother thought she would not survive even after the war, because she was -- she was like skin and bones.</span> <span id="s537">The doctor said that she wouldn’t live, but thank God, she’s a very healthy girl now.</span> <span id="s538">She’s had five children.</span> <span id="s539">She is a lovely lady, bit of a flirt.</span> <span id="s540">She lives in London, and -- with her husband.</span> <span id="s541">She -- unfortunately her firstborn son was killed when he was about 12 and a half years old, he fell under a car, it was a freak accident.</span> <span id="s542">Terrible, terrible accident.</span> <span id="s543">But she -- she went ahead and had another one, and it was another boy, so she has two girls and two boys and got a little granddaughter now.</span> <span id="s544">Wonderful to have a sister.</span> <span id="s545">And all -- all through the war we -- we took care of her, and well, she turned out okay.</span> <span id="s546">And very, very pro-Jewish now, and spend time in Israel, and -- both her husband and she -- she -- there’s no problem being Jewish any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Are you more religiously Jewish now than your family was before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: My family was not religious at all before the war.</span> <span id="s549">That’s the problem and I really never -- we never had any holidays at home, we never did anything like that, but I did know I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s550">And it was very upsetting to me to have to say that I wasn’t, and I was very happy to come back to it, but I am not religious.</span> <span id="s551">And having lived in Israel, I feel I have somehow become Jewish and I can -- I don’t have to feel guilty about that any more.</span> <span id="s552">But I do not like rituals.</span> <span id="s553">And I do feel very close to the Jews, to my brethren.</span> <span id="s554">I don’t mind going to the synagogue, but I don’t like preaching and I don’t like rituals, so it’s a bit of a tug of war within me.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: During your time in this country, the United States has gone through some changes, let’s put it that way.</span> <span id="s556">What were your thoughts, given your background, when United States was in conflict with the Soviet Union?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: Well, we were all afraid.</span> <span id="s558">We were afraid of the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s559">We knew that they wouldn’t le-leave voluntarily, wouldn’t give up places voluntarily.</span> <span id="s560">When they walked into Poland my mother said, they are not leaving.</span> <span id="s561">She knew.</span> <span id="s562">I mean, again I have to quote her because I was too young to understand.</span> <span id="s563">And we were afraid when Kennedy gave the ultimatum about removing the missiles in Cuba.</span> <span id="s564">My husband said it was a terrible thing.</span> <span id="s565">I didn’t know what to think.</span> <span id="s566">I know I was afraid.</span> <span id="s567">I didn’t expect the outcome as it -- it was when the wa -- Berlin wall fell down.</span> <span id="s568">And the only thing I have to say about that is I was afraid about Germany getting too strong again, when the wa-wa-wall came down.</span> <span id="s569">That was -- I knew definitely that I was afraid.</span> <span id="s570">And I was afraid of Russia, yes.</span> <span id="s571">I’m -- I’m a -- still afraid, because they are not in a very good situation and there’s too much crime there.</span> <span id="s572">The world is a very, very shaky place, an-and -- and every way you look, it’s not safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: Were you aware of some of the events in the Civil Rights movement when you first came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s575">The only one if I have is that the Jews helped the Civil Rights, I do know that.</span> <span id="s576">And then we got kicked in the teeth and they didn’t really appreciate it and there was a lot of anti-Semitism coming from the black community, which hurt, because they’re always trying to help others who are in the bad situation and unfortunately don’t get any thanks for it.</span> <span id="s577">And so I’m not too keen on -- on that black community for that reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: The United States was also involved in a war in Vietnam.</span> <span id="s579">Do you have any recollections on -- on what that meant to you, having gone through a war yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: The recolatio -- recollections I have is because we both worked with American embassy.</span> <span id="s581">The Americans were trying to -- to promote and to present the side on Vietnam war to the Israelis.</span> <span id="s582">And I believed what I heard.</span> <span id="s583">I did not really have my own opinion since I wasn’t living in the States at the time.</span> <span id="s584">And later on I understood, but at the time I was all for what the American was doing -- what the Americans were doing and I thought communism was a great, great threat.</span> <span id="s585">So at the time yes, I did believe that, but now I realize that it wasn’t so, that there was a different way to deal with it, that it should have been.</span> <span id="s586">And they lied to much, and they -- as usual, they didn’t tell the truth.</span> <span id="s587">And the mothers who marched deserve -- deserved a -- a -- a prize.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: I-I’m going to pause now and change the tape [indecipherable] End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Halina Peabody.</span> <span id="s590">This is tape number two, side A, and you were telling me about some of the experiences in this country, and we had talked about Vietnam.</span> <span id="s591">I wanted to ask you if you had any experience with any anti-Semitism in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s593">I am quite aware of the fact that Jews are not loved everywhere, but not really.</span> <span id="s594">I have not come across anybody specifically not liking me because I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s595">I had a couple experiences -- well, I had a very cute experiences at work where a lady was mad, a -- a colleague was mad at somebody because they was -- kept bugging her on the phone and she slammed the phone down saying, that Jew.</span> <span id="s596">And then looked at me and, oh Halina, I didn't mean it, I didn’t mean it.</span> <span id="s597">And then two weeks later she said, you know, I’ve got to go have an operation, I have a wonderful Jewish doctor.</span> <span id="s598">So that was -- but from then on, you know, I understood where -- she was a redneck, so I -- I -- I guess that that was part of it.</span> <span id="s599">I know there are people who are not particularly keen on Jews, but we have lots of friends who are not Jewish and who like us, so n-n-no -- no other problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: I’m going to try and ask this discreetly, but your name is now Mrs. Peabody.</span> <span id="s601">Can you take me from being Mrs. Yasharoff to being Mrs. Peabody?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s603">I got divorced in 1972, I believe.</span> <span id="s604">We had problems for awhile, and hoping that the United States will help us, but -- moving away from families, but it didn’t work.</span> <span id="s605">So when my husband decided to go abroad on a mission, he went -- he went into the foreign service.</span> <span id="s606">And that was the time when we really broke up, because he was going to Yugoslavia then, and there was no American school in Yugoslavia, so it would have meant that I had to send my son to an American school in Italy or in Israel and I would have to go to Yugoslavia with him and I certainly couldn’t -- couldn’t have done that.</span> <span id="s607">So that was the breaking point, and so we divorced.</span> <span id="s608">And he went off to Yugoslavia and I stayed here with my son, and eventually met somebody very nice, name of Richard Peabody, whose mother happens to be Jewish, in fact.</span> <span id="s609">And so I wasn’t so worried, because being from Poland and having heard that you should not marry out of your religion even if you’re not religious, I figured he couldn’t call me a dirty Jew anyway, because he was one, technically anyway.</span> <span id="s610">And we’ve been married for the last 20 years, very happily and I hope we continue for another 20.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: Please tell me about the work that you do for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: Well, I do whatever they need.</span> <span id="s613">I am working mostly in the office because they didn’t -- they were supposed to put me on Polish translations, but they don’t happen to need any work there.</span> <span id="s614">So I work in Martin Goldman’s office, who is the Director of Survivor Affairs, and I also joined the circle for -- writer’s circle there, I’m trying to put my story down from the war, which is very, very difficult for me, but I like the people there and I feel very comfortable.</span> <span id="s615">And when I came to the point where I felt I wanted to volunteer somewhere, I went around and I thought, where would I do best?</span> <span id="s616">And I thought, well where would I do best, th-the only place I could so is the U.S. Holocaust Museum cause that’s where I belong.</span> <span id="s617">And I do anything they ask me for and I’m enjoying just being there and I’m on my own.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: What’s your reaction to the resurgence of interest in the Holocaust in recent years?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: Surprise.</span> <span id="s620">I never thought it was -- I -- I’ve never thought it was important enough for people to know, I didn’t realize people wanted to know.</span> <span id="s621">And I’m -- I’m pleased to tell my story.</span> <span id="s622">It does hurt, and it does exhaust me, but I feel very much obligated any time I’m asked, to tell it.</span> <span id="s623">And I do keep telling it.</span> <span id="s624">I’ve got a button, if you push it’ll just come out.</span> <span id="s625">I’ve talked to a couple of schools here and there and I always feel that perhaps my story is not sufficiently big to -- to -- to -- just for the whole lecture, so I always like to take somebody else with me, and -- but I have no problem in telling it, and -- and I do.</span> <span id="s626">And if they help me to tell it better, perhaps I would do better job at it.</span> <span id="s627">So maybe the museum can do that for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: In your opinion, do you think the American Jewish community might ever be in danger because of skinheads or neo-Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s630">I think that we are all always in danger.</span> <span id="s631">We always have to watch and we always have to worry.</span> <span id="s632">I think that the ameri -- America is the safest place for Jews right now, but I certainly don’t feel completely safe anywhere in the world, especially now.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: Would you like to elaborate on that?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: Well, because the Arabs are attacking Israel and because the Moslems [indecipherable] I do believe that the whole world is in danger, but I don’t think people understand that they’re starting with the Jews just like Hitler did.</span> <span id="s635">Hitler wasn’t going to just kill the Jews, he was going to kill Slavs, and whoever else, to make a perfect race.</span> <span id="s636">The Moslem wants every -- want everybody to be Moslem, and be an -- just like the Al-Qaida in Afghanistan.</span> <span id="s637">So I don’t think people realize the danger, but I do, because we’ve been through it and we know what it -- what it can create.</span> <span id="s638">And if America backs off, it’s going to be very, very bad for the world.</span> <span id="s639">I just hope that they’re strong enough and that they will continue rooting them out and somehow manage to turn the world around, keep the democracies.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Israel has fought in several wars.</span> <span id="s641">I’d like to know what your thoughts were during these times when Israel was in danger.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: Well, I had nightmares.</span> <span id="s643">I was running with my son, I was hiding and -- and -- and trying to find a safe place.</span> <span id="s644">Mainly, I couldn’t tell you how proud I was that they’ve always won, tha -- how strong they were.</span> <span id="s645">And that gives me courage to think that they will survive no matter what.</span> <span id="s646">There’ll be pain, there are killings, there are murders, we lose people.</span> <span id="s647">But we manage to recreate and somehow continue, and I hope that that will continue forever, so that my children can also see Israel and -- and -- and grad -- great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: Have you ever regretted having left Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: Yes, I have.</span> <span id="s650">I -- I loved living in Israel.</span> <span id="s651">I’ve -- I’ve regretted it many, many ways, but I find life so much easier here.</span> <span id="s652">I a -- you know, I -- I suppose in my old age, I would be -- find it rather hard to go back -- especially I wouldn’t go back cause my son is here an-and his life is here, that I -- that I would never go back to Israel for that reason, but when we left, yes, I do regret.</span> <span id="s653">I’ve never felt as happy and as free and at home as I felt in Israel.</span> <span id="s654">But again, you know, for selfish reasons I guess I’m -- I’m comfortable here.</span> <span id="s655">So one has to make accommodations.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: How do you think your Holocaust experience influenced the choices that you made over the years?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: I think my main reason, my main choice was to take care of th -- my kids.</span> <span id="s658">I think that this is what my mother taught me by doing what she did during the war, by putting herself out and letting anything happen just as long as she could save her kids, transferred it to me.</span> <span id="s659">So I would do the same for my kids and my grandchild and those are the choices I’ve made, always whatever’s goos -- good for my children.</span> <span id="s660">Other than that, I have enjoyed having a lot of things that I was not allowed to have during childhood.</span> <span id="s661">I missed a lot of things by -- by being during the war and running for my life and wanted to give it to my grandchildren as much as possible.</span> <span id="s662">I think that was -- that’s my main -- my main outcome of the -- of the experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: You mentioned that during the time that Israel was at war you had nightmares.</span> <span id="s664">Have you had any other recurring nightmares since -- since the Shoah?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s666">I -- I’ve not had many nightmares, no.</span> <span id="s667">I happen to be quite healthy, I think, in that respect.</span> <span id="s668">I don’t dream, I sleep very well.</span> <span id="s669">So perhaps I did the right things.</span> <span id="s670">I didn't -- I don’t feel guilty about anything.</span> <span id="s671">I -- I -- I’ve often wondered why I don’t feel guilty like some people, that others didn’t survive and we did.</span> <span id="s672">I am asking the question why I survived and the others didn’t, but I don’t feel guilty.</span> <span id="s673">I think that everybody tried their best and luck was with us and God was with us.</span> <span id="s674">That’s -- I don’t know what else I can think about that, but that’s my reaction.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: Are you involved with any survivor groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: Oh yes, very much so.</span> <span id="s677">I have been coordinator and now I’m a treasurer for the Association of Child Survivors.</span> <span id="s678">And that’s another group that I love dearly and everybody there is my best friend and -- and I wouldn’t never leave that group.</span> <span id="s679">This is my -- this is my -- how can I say it?</span> <span id="s680">My home away from home.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: Are you also involved with any hidden children’s groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: That is the group.</span> <span id="s683">The Association of Child Survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: Oh, they’re also hidden children?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: They are called hidden children, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: Thank you for clarifying that.</span> <span id="s687">What has been your best surprise about life in America?</span> <span id="s688">A: The comforts, the ease of living, the fact that if you work hard anybody can really have a wonderful life here.</span> <span id="s689">And that’s what I’m finally getting to, a wonderful life, and I’m hoping it’ll last for a very long time.</span> <span id="s690">There are problems here with the governments and other things, which bother me a little bit, worry me.</span> <span id="s691">But overall, personally, I have a very, very nice life and I’m enjoying it.</span> <span id="s692">I’m hoping that I can achieve all the little things, all my little dreams.</span> <span id="s693">Practical things, you know.</span> <span id="s694">Making a nice home, having practical and -- and -- and material things, because that’s all I -- I can do now.</span> <span id="s695">I am -- you know, almost 70 years old, so I want to travel a little bit, and as long as I can see my family in London, my son, my sister, her kids.</span> <span id="s696">My children here, my grand -- my granddaughter.</span> <span id="s697">I -- I love living in America.</span> <span id="s698">I would like to spend a little more time in Israel, but I have really no complaints, knock on wood, right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: Do you have any special memories of your experiences at the Holocaust Museum that you’d like to share?</span> <span id="s700">Any interesting experience, anything special happen to you during the time that you’ve been either visiting there or a volunteer there?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: I don’t have any experiences, special experiences.</span> <span id="s702">I love the Szyk expe -- the Szyk ec -- exhibition.</span> <span id="s703">I haven’t worked there very long, so I don’t have too many.</span> <span id="s704">I do know that I feel very comfortable there and I like the people there.</span> <span id="s705">I hope to have some more experiences there, but not anything that stands out, except that, as I said, I enjoy being there and I hope to do more work there.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: What would you like your family and friends, or anybody who might be listening to this tape to know about you that they may not already know?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: I -- I suppose I want them to know that it’s all very genuine what I do.</span> <span id="s708">I never -- I never -- try to never pretend and I like them to know that I like everybody.</span> <span id="s709">I’m not sure what else I can tell them, I don’t have any secrets, really.</span> <span id="s710">And the secrets I have I’m not willing to tell.</span> <span id="s711">Th-They’re not many, though.</span> <span id="s712">I really don’t have much to say on that score, cause I -- I’ve always tried to say what I feel, so there’s not much I think people don’t know about me.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: Tell me about your reaction to what happened in this country on September 11th, 2001.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: Oh, that was very traumatic, that brought me right back to where I came from, from the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s715">That ruined my -- my -- my quiet.</span> <span id="s716">I was feeling very comfortable and quiet and I’m no longer so.</span> <span id="s717">Since then I have been in turmoil.</span> <span id="s718">And the longer it goes on after, the aftermath, the worse it gets.</span> <span id="s719">And I don’t know if I’ll ever see peaceful world again, as long as I live.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: Is there anything
