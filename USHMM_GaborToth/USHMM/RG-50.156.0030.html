Relations Council, Anti-Defamation League of Minnesota and the Dakotas HOLOCAUST ORAL HISTORY TAPING PROJECT</span></p> <p><span id="s4">Q: I’m in the home of Gisela Konopka for the Oral history Project of the Jewish Community Relations Council.</span> <span id="s5">It’s January 26, 1985.</span> <span id="s6">I’d like to ask you first of all, your name.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">A: This is Gisela Konopka.</span> <span id="s8">My maiden name was Peiper, and what I’m talking about was much done under my maiden name.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Q: What were your parents’ names?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">A: My father’s name was Mendel and my mother’s name was Bronia.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: Do you remember any of the grandparents’ -- on either side?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: They were not existing anymore.</span> <span id="s13">I have to explain that.</span> <span id="s14">My parents, as young people, were immigrants from Krakow and Prezemysl to Berlin, Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: This is where you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: That’s where I was born.</span> <span id="s17">But that means I never knew my grandparents.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: Can you give me your date of birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: It’s February 11, 1910.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: Do you have clear memories, in your early years, of life in Berlin?</span> <span id="s21">Religious life?</span> <span id="s22">Cultural life?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: Very much, because I have a memory like an elephant, and I can talk for ages about it!</span> <span id="s24">My parents were what you might call, here, Orthodox Jews, but at the same time, my father, as a young man, was very early part of the Polish Socialist movement, so it’s kind of a combination that I did think existed a great deal in eastern Europe-- but is not as well known here.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Did he have a specific party?</span> <span id="s26">Do you remember the name of the Polish party?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: No.</span> <span id="s28">He belonged all his life, the way knew it, to the Social Democrats in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: Did he identify at all with the Arbeiterung?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: I wouldn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: You never heard that phrase in the home?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: No.</span> <span id="s33">My father was a Social Democrat.</span> <span id="s34">And he was very much for the women’s movement.</span> <span id="s35">And was very active in all these things.</span> <span id="s36">He read The Forward, which is the German Social Democrat Party paper.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Written in German.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: In German, yes.</span> <span id="s39">I sometimes regret it, but they did not teach us Polish -- ever.</span> <span id="s40">They only talked Polish when we shouldn’t understand them.</span> <span id="s41">But I also know the reason.</span> <span id="s42">My mother told me once that she was about 16 years old when she came alone to Berlin with her very long hair, and very heavy headaches, because it was sitting on top of her head.</span> <span id="s43">Her brother had immigrated earlier.</span> <span id="s44">Germany, at that time, was the refuge of freedom to the Jews that came from that area.</span> <span id="s45">And she came, got off, and threw her arms around him, and spoke in Polish.</span> <span id="s46">And the first thing she got was her ears boxed -- from her brother.</span> <span id="s47">He said, ‘ You don’t speak Polish here.</span> <span id="s48">That’s bad.’</span> <span id="s49">So my parents never spoke Polish, with the exception to each other.</span> <span id="s50">But I have to say, at the same time, all this nonsense about eastern Jews and western Jews against each other -- I have never experienced.</span> <span id="s51">As in many other ways you will hear, I feel totally a person-of-the-world, even in that, I with most of my relatives, lived in the eastern part of Berlin, because that was where the poor Jews, mostly, lived.</span> <span id="s52">And I knew them all, and I was very close to them.</span> <span id="s53">On the other hand, my parents had a little store in West Berlin, so I grew up with what you might call western German culture.</span> <span id="s54">I had deep respect for both and have never lost it.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Did your parents ever speak Yiddish that you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s57">They spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s58">I understand Yiddish.</span> <span id="s59">I’m not very good at speaking it, but I can understand it.</span> <span id="s60">And when my mother, many, many, many years later came to visit me here in the Unites States, that was a great help, because I found then other people who could speak Yiddish, and that way she could communicate, because she didn’t know English.</span> <span id="s61">But I have to say, she lived from 1936, I think, on, in Israel, and she told me that in Israel, she doesn’t dare speak in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s62">It’s considered inferior.</span> <span id="s63">I still remember my mother saying to me that never in her life has she felt as much appreciated by everybody than when she was here.</span> <span id="s64">Nobody made fun of her about not speaking English, or speaking Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: I wanted to ask you more about your father’s store.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Well it was West Berlin.</span> <span id="s67">Oh, what business!</span> <span id="s68">It was a little store.</span> <span id="s69">We had very little money.</span> <span id="s70">Started out, like many Jews that were immigrating at that time, it was just eggs!</span> <span id="s71">Big crates of eggs.</span> <span id="s72">That’s what we were selling.</span> <span id="s73">It was just a little tiny store.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: Do you remember helping at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Oh, G-d, yes.</span> <span id="s76">But first I have to explain that when the war came, my father was called into the war as an Austrian.</span> <span id="s77">And mother was alone with three children.</span> <span id="s78">Mother was much more enterprising than my father, so meanwhile, she got a bag of flour, or a bag of sugar.</span> <span id="s79">And in the long run, we were a little grocery store.</span> <span id="s80">Heaven help me, I have sworn in my life, and it’s the one thing that I have kept, is that I never in my life will have a store.</span> <span id="s81">It was the most horrible experience, I think, of my childhood, helping in the store, because we always had to carry -- either half-a-pound of butter, or 20 pounds of something else which was heavy -- to the rich people in the neighborhood, who would never come and pick up anything themselves.</span> <span id="s82">And you always had to go through the ‘hintertrapper.”</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Back roads, avenues…</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: No, these are apartment houses.</span> <span id="s85">The front is always for the good people.</span> <span id="s86">That has carpets and decent flights.</span> <span id="s87">And in the back are always these round ones that’s called “spindletrapper” -- very difficult to walk.</span> <span id="s88">You only got into the kitchen that way.</span> <span id="s89">And certainly those who delivered could only go there!</span> <span id="s90">So it was kind of demeaning.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: It didn’t apply to Jews, it applied to anyone in the trades.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: To anybody!</span> <span id="s93">Anybody who was in the trades.</span> <span id="s94">So I hated it1 I literally hated it!</span> <span id="s95">And then the worst time, I have to say, was Passover, because that store was very strange -- typical for Berlin stores, this is not just for Jews -- there was one little room in the front and one little room in the back, and between was the store.</span> <span id="s96">So we were always sleeping, four people, in one room, and doing all our schoolwork in one room, but at Passover, because everything had to be changed -- everything had to be taken out of the store into the cellar.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: So your parents were strictly kosher then?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Oh, this wasn’t for us, it was for selling, also.</span> <span id="s99">So the whole store had to be changed, and huge rolls of matzoh.</span> <span id="s100">They didn’t come in nice little packages, as they come here, they came in huge rolls.</span> <span id="s101">And the whole store looked different, and we had practically no place to sleep, and we would be up all night, taking matzoh flour and put it in little bags, because it would come in big sacks, and also getting things ready -- again, the rich Jews would order all that stuff, but would never put a foot in by buying it themselves -- so we would put it in big boxes, and we children would do that.</span> <span id="s102">And we went to school.</span> <span id="s103">I have to tell you, I once fell asleep sitting on the toilet.</span> <span id="s104">I have no good memories of the store.</span> <span id="s105">And I never will have a store.</span> <span id="s106">(Laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: How many brothers and sisters did you have that were doing these things with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: We were three girls.</span> <span id="s109">And school is another side that I think one should know.</span> <span id="s110">Germany is a class society, which meant only kids with money could go to the better schools.</span> <span id="s111">I’m talking about just gymnasium.</span> <span id="s112">We went to the lyceum ,which already had to be paid.</span> <span id="s113">It’s difficult to explain.</span> <span id="s114">It’s higher than the gemeindeschule than the general school.</span> <span id="s115">But anyhow, that’s the first few years.</span> <span id="s116">Then my sister asked that she would like to be transferred --the older sister, she’s two-and-a-half years older than I -- to the gymnasium, and that was all right.</span> <span id="s117">My parents worked very hard to get the money.</span> <span id="s118">And then came my time, and I always say I cried myself into the gymnasium, because I wanted to learn!</span> <span id="s119">My parents would have liked us to learn, but they didn’t really have the money.</span> <span id="s120">My mother always said: “Every girl can make a living by sewing.</span> <span id="s121">Well, I probably couldn’t, but that’s another story.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Did you have this awareness of a very class-conscious society when you were very young?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: From very early on.</span> <span id="s124">I repeat, my father was a socialist.</span> <span id="s125">That means we read the literature.</span> <span id="s126">(Laughs) I read Bebel and Braun.</span> <span id="s127">I grew up with Kaete Kollwitz, the painter, with Barlach.</span> <span id="s128">I’m in Berlin!</span> <span id="s129">This is the time of the Piscator ,the great plays of all the revolutionary things.</span> <span id="s130">We saw the revolutionary theater.</span> <span id="s131">We saw Yiddish theater that would come.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Is this all before the First World War?</span> <span id="s133">Or are we talking in the Weimar Period?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Right now I’m talking post-war, but let’s go back.</span> <span id="s135">I’m four years old when the First World War breaks out.</span> <span id="s136">I do remember that, because my father was called up, and we were all crying.</span> <span id="s137">And he was away.</span> <span id="s138">But he came back, because he had a bad heart.</span> <span id="s139">I had an uncle who was living in east Berlin, who was a prisoner of war, whom I saw when I was seven years old, when the war was kind of over, coming back.</span> <span id="s140">And didn’t look like the same man I remembered when I was four years old.</span> <span id="s141">I mean, there were these kinds of things.</span> <span id="s142">I remember the war years because we had a little bit more than other people, because we had always eggs that were broken, but I remember the long lines of people, and I do remember that they sent me, always, to get in line for the butter, because I was little and very thin, and so people let me go in front.</span> <span id="s143">So I remember all these things during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Do you think you can recall whether or not in the wartime, that you ever felt that you heard any remarks against the Jews, or particularly when the war was going badly at the end, or just after?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: No, not during the war!</span> <span id="s146">Maybe I was too young.</span> <span id="s147">But the war ends in 1918 and I’m eight years old.</span> <span id="s148">And there definitely anti-Semitism started.</span> <span id="s149">I remember there were swastikas at that time in the streets -- painted.</span> <span id="s150">Being that I’m conscious of being very much for “human liberty” and “human rights” from very early on, we had little pocket knives, and we would scratch them off.</span> <span id="s151">I did that.</span> <span id="s152">And I remember one example when I was probably eight or nine years old, when one of the girls in my class drew a swastika on the blackboard.</span> <span id="s153">And all the kids came up to me, “Gisela, you have to go and protest.”</span> <span id="s154">I don’t know why I was always the protest leader.</span> <span id="s155">But in that whole school, was only one Jewish teacher!</span> <span id="s156">That was very unusual.</span> <span id="s157">Jewish teachers were not allowed to be in the Lyceum.</span> <span id="s158">And she was only allowed to teach Jewish religion.</span> <span id="s159">She wasn’t allowed to teach anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: But this was allowed by the state -- in other words, the state financed the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: This is still the monarchy.</span> <span id="s162">Again we are just now coming into the revolution, right?</span> <span id="s163">I went to her, and she says, “Oh, don’t make any fuss.”</span> <span id="s164">Because she was very afraid.</span> <span id="s165">And so then I was in school, and the teacher who was responsible for all of us, stood up in front of the class, and she said, “There’s some kids that make trouble…” and the swastika was still on the blackboard.</span> <span id="s166">“There’s some kids that make trouble, and I don’t want that there’s any nonsense done here.”</span> <span id="s167">And I started to cry and I went home.</span> <span id="s168">My father said to me, “ Gisela, you’d better learn, Jews are there for suffering.”</span> <span id="s169">I was very angry.</span> <span id="s170">I must have been eight or nine.</span> <span id="s171">And I said, “You taught me that we should fight.’</span> <span id="s172">This is an experience that I vividly recall.</span> <span id="s173">And I don’t make it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: You felt that your father’s remark was inconsistent with his own beliefs.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: I felt so, but I found him very often inconsistent.</span> <span id="s176">My father was a very, I think intelligent, frustrated man.</span> <span id="s177">Both my father and mother had no opportunity for any education, but they were highly educated people.</span> <span id="s178">The house was full of books.</span> <span id="s179">But I think that my father was always inconsistent.</span> <span id="s180">I’m older now, already twelve, and I didn’t like his being so orthodox, and at the same time being a socialist.</span> <span id="s181">I thought it was inconsistent.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: What about your own Jewish education?</span> <span id="s183">Did he have an interest in the daughters going to cheder or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Ah God, yes.</span> <span id="s185">Now I can’t tell you anymore whether it was every day or every second day I was in Hebrew school.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: This is after the regular school?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: That’s after regular school.</span> <span id="s188">I always went to that.</span> <span id="s189">They were very poor, very strange teachers.</span> <span id="s190">I must say, I have that memory, that all the kids made fun of them, and I felt sorry for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Well this doesn’t change.</span> <span id="s192">In America, too, the same thing, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Just terrible!</span> <span id="s194">And we went.</span> <span id="s195">I learned Hebrew.</span> <span id="s196">I learned the Bible.</span> <span id="s197">I liked it.</span> <span id="s198">I was very curious about it, but I have to say, at the time -- I’m talking about between 10 and 13 years old -- the revolution has already been.</span> <span id="s199">But for instance, I remember that one of the teachers talked about Christ as a “momzer.”</span> <span id="s200">And I got up in class -- furious!</span> <span id="s201">I said, “ You don’t talk about other people’s religious…” Well, I was just an outcast.</span> <span id="s202">And I loved art.</span> <span id="s203">From little on, I have seen, I have walked and because I wasn’t allowed to go on the streetcar, to go on Saturdays, and Sunday, we walked to the museum -- for two hours -- and saw all the art.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: So you saw all the great Greek antiquities and everything in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: Oh, I saw the Pergamon, but I saw all the moderns!</span> <span id="s206">Franz Marc.</span> <span id="s207">I’m filled with the beauty of that.</span> <span id="s208">But I loved the paintings of Marees.</span> <span id="s209">I didn’t ever think there was a contrast.</span> <span id="s210">There is a very beautiful experience that I always talk about.</span> <span id="s211">I have to say it!</span> <span id="s212">And I was very young then.</span> <span id="s213">This is during the war, when my father’s away, so I’m not yet in school.</span> <span id="s214">I must be about five years old.</span> <span id="s215">My youngest sister was a baby.</span> <span id="s216">And so a woman came running into our store and said to my mother, “Mrs. Peiper, we are planning…” they called it “lebenbilder” -- “living picture.”</span> <span id="s217">Tableaus.</span> <span id="s218">“for Christmas, but the Christ child that we wanted is sick.</span> <span id="s219">Could we have your little Ruth -- as Christ Child?”</span> <span id="s220">and my mother was, strange enough, always much more open-minded than my father.</span> <span id="s221">She said, “Well certainly1 Under the condition that the two older ones can come along and see it.’</span> <span id="s222">It was beautiful!</span> <span id="s223">Here was my little Ruth lying in the crib with all the angels around her, being very quiet and very sweet, and Mary was in the back of her.</span> <span id="s224">And I have never forgotten that, because they all came later and stood around us and loved my mother, and loved us.</span> <span id="s225">I’m just thinking of that as a symbol that I did not grow up with hate of one way or the other!</span> <span id="s226">Father was more inconsistent.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: It sounds also, that your family was unusually open to the surrounding culture and felt very much, maybe, a part of German culture.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: Yes, but not in the way that they forgot their own.</span> <span id="s229">People are always thinking you have to be hating your own to like the other.</span> <span id="s230">No.</span> <span id="s231">Only, as I say, my father, the older he got, the more rigid Jewish he became.</span> <span id="s232">And he didn’t get very old, you know.</span> <span id="s233">He died very young</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: Did he ever talk about the war as a particularly Jewish experience for him?</span> <span id="s235">Or whether he had Jewish officers or comrades?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: No, never.</span> <span id="s237">My father didn’t ever tell us about the war!</span> <span id="s238">He was away for two years.</span> <span id="s239">He was sick.</span> <span id="s240">I never knew about the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: I ask this, because of course, in the rise of Nazism, the theory developed -- the “big lie” -- one of the big lies that the Germans were stabbed in the back, of course, the Ludendorff Theory that Jews were the ones that were doing the stabbing, the betrayal.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: But we all know that this is a lie.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: And we know that so many German-Jewish Germans served in the war with medals</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: By the way, I have a medal, too, from the Germans, but that’s later.</span> <span id="s245">I knew many who had been in the war, but my parents were not “Deutsch nazionale” -- they were not German nationals.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: They were more internationalists if they were socialists.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: They were much more internationalists.</span> <span id="s248">They were socialists.</span> <span id="s249">1918, you remember, is the revolution.</span> <span id="s250">I’m the little girl, bringing out the goods to rich people, my father once had to go with me because there was too much.</span> <span id="s251">Big camions came up with people on top of it, showing the lights, and red flags, and I got very scared.</span> <span id="s252">And father said, ‘Don’t be scared, they are good people, they just don’t want the Kaiser.”</span> <span id="s253">So, you know, that was kind of the attitude in my family.</span> <span id="s254">I am a history major, besides the other things.</span> <span id="s255">This is all a lie, certainly, to disadvantage the Jews.</span> <span id="s256">The war wasn’t ended because there was a revolution.</span> <span id="s257">You can be sure of that.</span> <span id="s258">They were really defeated.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: So now you’re growing up in the famous Weimar Republic, which is now being studied very much again by historians.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: And there is a lot.</span> <span id="s261">One of the magazines -- I have it upstairs -- wrote when they had that exhibit here, about my experiences with that.</span> <span id="s262">I am definitely a product of the Weimar Republic.</span> <span id="s263">I’m a strange mixture.</span> <span id="s264">But that, to me, is the time of great excitement.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: This is German expressionism and many other movements.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: Everything, these things.</span> <span id="s267">I am part of the Youth Movement, which is, you know, the revolutionary movement.</span> <span id="s268">We think all people who are adults are stupid.</span> <span id="s269">(Laughs) And wish we could do away with them.</span> <span id="s270">We hiked all over the country.</span> <span id="s271">We saw art.</span> <span id="s272">I loved the churches, I loved the synagogues, they were beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: In your group together, were Jewish and non-Jewish young people?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: In the beginning I belonged to a Jewish youth movement.</span> <span id="s275">I started out with the Kamaraden, which was a German-Jewish youth movement, not Zionist.</span> <span id="s276">And we did split off from that, and that is a very radical split off.</span> <span id="s277">A very radical split of the Kamaraden that I belonged to.</span> <span id="s278">Very much interested in art and the social conscience kind of business.</span> <span id="s279">I have to think of time.</span> <span id="s280">I would think I’m about 18 -- or 17 years old -- when that group again splits, because this was very revolutionary times.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: This was about 1922, ’23?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: No, it’s ’27.</span> <span id="s283">And they joined parties.</span> <span id="s284">Many went to the Communist Youth.</span> <span id="s285">Some went to the Social Democratic Youth.</span> <span id="s286">At that time, you have to know we were reading so much.</span> <span id="s287">Bellamy and the Fabians, and Marx.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: So the Fabians were very influential.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Very influential on me.</span> <span id="s290">On some not, but on me.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: This is Beatrice Webb, and Shaw…</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s293">This is 1927, about.</span> <span id="s294">So I am somebody, and I was a little bit the maverick in that group, who didn’t want to join the Communist Youth, because I said that Marx -- I totally agreed with him that you have to fight for the poor people and all that -- but I didn’t believe in determinism in history.</span> <span id="s295">And so I couldn’t find my niche.</span> <span id="s296">The Social Democrats were a little too soft for me.</span> <span id="s297">So there is a group that was called “Internatzionale Sozialist Tzecumpfbund.”</span> <span id="s298">The International Socialist Fighting Unit.</span> <span id="s299">They belonged quite a long time to the Social Democrats.</span> <span id="s300">But they were kind of a split, because their leader, if you want to call it, was Leonard Nelson, who had been a university professor of philosophy.</span> <span id="s301">He is translated.</span> <span id="s302">Yale has all his books.</span> <span id="s303">I don’t agree with him today anymore.</span> <span id="s304">There are lots of things I don’t like, really, about him anymore.</span> <span id="s305">And I did not know him personally.</span> <span id="s306">But the movement began to appeal to me, because they were idealists.</span> <span id="s307">They called themselves idealistic socialists.</span> <span id="s308">I think they had a lot of stuff that I, today, wouldn’t agree with.</span> <span id="s309">They were all vegetarians, so I became a vegetarian because you shouldn’t eat meat.</span> <span id="s310">They were thinking we shouldn’t get married because we have to be there for the great fight.</span> <span id="s311">But they all stood straight under the Nazis, I have to say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Were they programmatically anti-Zionist at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Well, no.</span> <span id="s314">First of all, that I’m not talking about, as a socialist group who is not Jewish anymore.</span> <span id="s315">It’s very difficult to put me into boxes, and I always have that difficulty.</span> <span id="s316">The Jewish Youth Movement to which I belonged first, was not a Zionist one.</span> <span id="s317">But my best friends, and my cousins, whom I loved very much, were very strong Zionists.</span> <span id="s318">Some of them are founders of Givat Brenner in Israel.</span> <span id="s319">So again, I wasn’t separated from that.</span> <span id="s320">I had great respect for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: Did the cousins all live, also, in Berlin?</span> <span id="s322">Or the environs?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Oh, yes, they lived in the eastern part of Berlin.</span> <span id="s324">I had respect for them, but we had lots of discussions, and I always said, “I’m an internationalist.</span> <span id="s325">I don’t want to start any new state, anywhere.</span> <span id="s326">If you start a new state, I guarantee you there will be wars around that again, because there will be new borders.”</span> <span id="s327">So I just wanted to say, I still remember that, because they reminded me of that when I came back to Israel later.</span> <span id="s328">The other youth movement is later.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: What are your observations, particularly in relation to this project?</span> <span id="s330">Of course there was the growing National Socialist movement.</span> <span id="s331">There is the Kultur Kampf going on between various parties as well as more basic political struggle.</span> <span id="s332">I’d appreciate knowing where you sensed anti-Semitism, if it was growing?</span> <span id="s333">If you saw it or if you felt that really the atmosphere was, as we learn from history books on the Weimar Republic, supposedly very, very open and very experimental.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: It was very open.</span> <span id="s335">I told you that anti-Semitic thing around 1918, 1919.</span> <span id="s336">There is a National Socialist Party, but it’s a very small one.</span> <span id="s337">I’m now talking about 1924, ’25.</span> <span id="s338">1929, I have to say, I’m leaving Berlin and go to Hamburg and work in a factory.</span> <span id="s339">I was very much imbued with the feeling that we are in the middle of a terrible hate of class against class.</span> <span id="s340">For instance, I worked in a factory, where I was very poor, and I was thrown out because I belonged to the labor unions, and that in the German Republic.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: This was in Hamburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: In Hamburg.</span> <span id="s343">But then I got into another where the labor union was very active.</span> <span id="s344">Now you did find here and there anti-Semitism as you found other things, I have to say.</span> <span id="s345">For instance, I remember in that factory, there was a woman -- she wanted to be my friend, and then when she got mad at me, she said something, “You are a Jew.’</span> <span id="s346">I expected that!</span> <span id="s347">That these kind of things would happen.</span> <span id="s348">Now I have to say, the way the Nazis came to power, I have always said to people, “We knew, by 1932, that horrible things were happening!”</span> <span id="s349">I saw with my own eyes that they would march through the streets, because they weren’t allowed to carry weapons, they were carrying spades!</span> <span id="s350">If you were standing at the corner and would say something against them, the spades would fall on your back.</span> <span id="s351">By 1932, this movement to which I belonged, we went to the harbors and distributed leaflets against the Nazis -- not ’33 -- remember, he comes to power -- but ’32 we distributed leaflets against the Nazis.</span> <span id="s352">Jews and non-Jews together.</span> <span id="s353">In that movement, there was no difference.</span> <span id="s354">We were very aware what would happen.</span> <span id="s355">Some of you might know that Kaete Kollwitz, herself, signed one of those calls that were put on all the walls, that say, “Workers unite!</span> <span id="s356">So that you have to get against the Nazis!”</span> <span id="s357">I think that there was partially lethargy, partially, certainly, there was poverty, and poverty breeds an awful lot of awful things, and partially -- I know some of my friends don’t like that I say that --I blame the Communists.</span> <span id="s358">I do blame them, because they split the labor movement, and did not want to join in anything.</span> <span id="s359">I went to a big rally where there were Communists and Socialists, and they would say, loud and clear, “It doesn’t matter.</span> <span id="s360">Let the worst come, then we will be victorious.”</span> <span id="s361">Then not my husband, but my very close friend, and who’s later my husband for many years, and who’s not Jewish, got up in that huge rally and said, “The worst will be that we all meet each other in the mass graves!”</span> <span id="s362">And this in 1932!</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: This he said?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s365">I know that I’m not quoting him wrong.</span> <span id="s366">I know that.</span> <span id="s367">“In the mass graves.’</span> <span id="s368">“We will meet in the mass graves!”</span> <span id="s369">So this is 1932.</span> <span id="s370">And what I’m saying is, it is a fight between (them and) those who believe in humanity and decency of everybody, not just Jews.</span> <span id="s371">Do I make that clear?</span> <span id="s372">We knew there was anti-Semitism!</span> <span id="s373">My G-d, we read Mein Kampf!</span> <span id="s374">It was sold!</span> <span id="s375">You had to read it.</span> <span id="s376">You knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s377">But you knew they would kill the Jews and they’ll kill everybody who has some decent thoughts.</span> <span id="s378">And this is 1932.</span> <span id="s379">That’s why I will never accept this business, “We didn’t know.”</span> <span id="s380">I will say something loud and clear.</span> <span id="s381">There were many Jews who said, “Oh, it won’t be so bad.’</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Well how did your parents react?</span> <span id="s383">Do you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: I’ll go into that, but I remember one who said, “I have a good business, and at least we get rid of the labor unions.”</span> <span id="s385">My parents had a little store (Laughs).</span> <span id="s386">They had very little money.</span> <span id="s387">The children, meanwhile, my younger sister was still in the gymnasium, my older sister was studying medicine.</span> <span id="s388">I was in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s389">I had finished working in the factory and was studying to be a teacher.</span> <span id="s390">So my father was very scared that this would come, and was very much against it.</span> <span id="s391">And I do remember that once the shoemaker next to us was attacked by Nazis -- this was before they are in power.</span> <span id="s392">And he is not a Jew!</span> <span id="s393">And my father was the one who helped him and called the police, but later he would spit at him.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Even though he helped him.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: Oh, yes!</span> <span id="s396">So, I do remember my father was shocked that I had a non-Jewish friend.</span> <span id="s397">Jews, I think, were just as prejudiced in that area.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: This is your future husband you’re talking about</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s400">And he was absolutely shocked that one of his daughters would do that, and that would be terrible.</span> <span id="s401">And I do remember the Nazis came, but the Nazis were in power just a few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: He never went so far as to forbid the relationship, did he?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: He couldn’t.</span> <span id="s404">My father couldn’t forbid me anything any more after I was 18 or 19.</span> <span id="s405">He knew that.</span> <span id="s406">And I was away!</span> <span id="s407">I wasn’t at home anymore.</span> <span id="s408">There were others who were sitting shiva when something like this happened.</span> <span id="s409">It’s just awful.</span> <span id="s410">But now he couldn’t.</span> <span id="s411">He knew he couldn’t.</span> <span id="s412">But he was against it.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: Did he reconcile?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: Yes, I want to say that.</span> <span id="s415">Shortly after the advent of the Nazis, my father came visiting me in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s416">And at that time, Paul showed him Hamburg and went with him everywhere.</span> <span id="s417">And my father said, ‘Well for heaven’s sake!</span> <span id="s418">I didn’t know there was somebody like that!”</span> <span id="s419">And I will be eternally grateful, when my father died -- and he died at the age of 52, which is very young, but the Jews fell like the flies even when they were not attacked -- he called for Paul.</span> <span id="s420">He called for him!</span> <span id="s421">Because that was a symbol to him in many ways.</span> <span id="s422">I will quick go back, 1933, the Nazis come to power.</span> <span id="s423">I have seen them come to power.</span> <span id="s424">I was in Hamburg, now.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: I feel like I’m neglecting your mother a little bit because we haven’t talked about her influence on you.</span> <span id="s426">Here she’s married to a man of strong political feelings.</span> <span id="s427">Did she have a voice of her own, do you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Mother was a very quiet person.</span> <span id="s429">Many years later, when I saw her later, I found she was very strong!</span> <span id="s430">And she was strong always.</span> <span id="s431">She got us through the times of hunger and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s432">But she also had a terribly domineering husband.</span> <span id="s433">When I say about my father, I respect him, but I think he was terrible!</span> <span id="s434">He would scream and shout!</span> <span id="s435">And she had always to smooth the waters.</span> <span id="s436">And this is the way I have known her mostly.</span> <span id="s437">And I think, inside of her, my mother was in many ways a much more tolerant person.</span> <span id="s438">I gave you that example.</span> <span id="s439">My mother told me about her father.</span> <span id="s440">I have to say, mother’s family was very different.</span> <span id="s441">My great-grandfather was a writer of the Torah.</span> <span id="s442">They were very important people.</span> <span id="s443">But my mother told me about her father, a story, and that was that there was a “miracle rabbi” coming around.</span> <span id="s444">They came in these little shetls there.</span> <span id="s445">Everybody was admiring him, and they would come out and kiss his hands.</span> <span id="s446">But, she said, her father said.</span> <span id="s447">“I don’t kiss anybody’s hands!</span> <span id="s448">He’s not a God!”</span> <span id="s449">And she told me that was pride.</span> <span id="s450">What I’m saying is, I think my mother had a lot of strength, but she wasn’t politically that involved.</span> <span id="s451">And when the Nazis came to power, she was mostly afraid for all of us.</span> <span id="s452">But later, when I was in a concentration camp, my mother was strong.</span> <span id="s453">She was willing to go up to the Gestapo to tell them that they should let her good girl go.</span> <span id="s454">She didn’t, but I mean, she could have done that.</span> <span id="s455">And then later she lived in Israel.</span> <span id="s456">And she’s lived for one year with us here.</span> <span id="s457">No, it’s the quiet person.</span> <span id="s458">It’s not the terribly involved person.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: There can be great strength!</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Oh, enormous strength!</span> <span id="s461">I still think she was the one who got us through it all.</span> <span id="s462">And she dared -- as I say she dared -- but she would dare, like the lioness that defends her cubs, I think.</span> <span id="s463">She wouldn’t go and demonstrate.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: But you were out there actually in the streets, participating with leaflets, and…</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: And all that.</span> <span id="s466">And very active in it.</span> <span id="s467">We had always these debates with the Communists on the one hand, with the Nazis on the other hand.</span> <span id="s468">You debated with Nazis1.</span> <span id="s469">In 1932, with their swastikas.</span> <span id="s470">And you would debate, and you would discuss, and I still remember some of these young -- and I was young then too.</span> <span id="s471">I was 22.</span> <span id="s472">They would say to me, “You’re such an active girl!</span> <span id="s473">You should really join our group!”</span> <span id="s474">And I would continue debating.</span> <span id="s475">At the end I would always say,” Now you better know I’m a Jew.”</span> <span id="s476">They recoiled!</span> <span id="s477">How can such a nice person be a Jew?</span> <span id="s478">Oh yes, we knew this.</span> <span id="s479">I will give you one example in ’33.</span> <span id="s480">I’m still at the university, and already, the Jewish professors have had their dismissals, and all that, but they still were allowed to give the final examinations.</span> <span id="s481">I will say that the day before my final examination, the Nazis searched my room.</span> <span id="s482">Threw out every book.</span> <span id="s483">They’re such idiots, you know.</span> <span id="s484">They would see naked figures, and they said, “Those dirty schwein Jews.”</span> <span id="s485">There was a Michelangelo.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Where was this?</span> <span id="s487">Where were you living?</span> <span id="s488">Were you still in Hamburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: Hamburg.</span> <span id="s490">They saw Michelangelos and they would say, “That dirty Jew has naked figures.”</span> <span id="s491">So it’s just ridiculous.</span> <span id="s492">But they threw everything out.</span> <span id="s493">This was the evening before my final oral examinations.</span> <span id="s494">We were always on bicycles.</span> <span id="s495">I went there.</span> <span id="s496">I first vomited, then got in there.</span> <span id="s497">There were the other students sitting.</span> <span id="s498">There was one girl who had always been a Nazi.</span> <span id="s499">She was sitting next to me.</span> <span id="s500">She was talking about that “dirty Jew William Stern” who was a famous psychologist, who was born in this country, too, and she hated to take examinations with him, “All these dirty Jews.”</span> <span id="s501">And I finally turned to her and said, “I’m one of them.</span> <span id="s502">You say you smelled it, you didn’t smell it for three years?”</span> <span id="s503">and she said, “ I’ll denounce you, because you are not a Jew!</span> <span id="s504">You just say so.”</span> <span id="s505">You know she was furious that she hadn’t “smelled” it.</span> <span id="s506">I passed my examinations, always superior.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: This was for a teaching degree?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Germany is different.</span> <span id="s509">It was in psychology, philosophy, history.</span> <span id="s510">I forgot what the other one was.</span> <span id="s511">Pedagogics, I think.</span> <span id="s512">I was always superior.</span> <span id="s513">And I still remember, I came out of the examination room, and there stands that one professor and says, “This is the coming genius of our schools,” And I turned around and said, ‘that genius is not allowed to enter any school.”</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: At that point, you already knew that the final exam was almost useless for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: At that point -- it was ’33 -- we knew it.</span> <span id="s516">William Stern was, for instance, in psychology.</span> <span id="s517">He was a Jew.</span> <span id="s518">He was giving the final examination.</span> <span id="s519">At the other end of the table sat the Nazi in uniform -- watching what we were doing.</span> <span id="s520">Already there was the Reichstag fire.</span> <span id="s521">You see, people who were arrested first, which often we don’t know, were not just Jews.</span> <span id="s522">The famous Socialists, the famous Communists, too were arrested, made to scrub the floors -- we knew all the worst things --were beaten.</span> <span id="s523">And then the terror starts.</span> <span id="s524">All over, we knew it.</span> <span id="s525">I couldn’t go to school service anymore.</span> <span id="s526">A few months later, there was a person coming from Switzerland to ask, would we be willing to do underground work.</span> <span id="s527">And we did.</span> <span id="s528">I can go into a long tale of what we did, but it’s not important.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: I think it is important.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: It’s all in that book.</span> <span id="s531">You read about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: The book, by the way, that Dr. Konopka is referring to, is an autobiography that’s in manuscript, partially typed, that I will review just for the sake of getting a better sense of the record.</span> <span id="s533">And provisionally, I think, you have a title for it -- In Spite of Everything.</span> <span id="s534">Which is a wonderful title, by the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: I would love to get it published.</span> <span id="s536">Just for the sake of…that people understand that some of us fought.</span> <span id="s537">We weren’t all just victims lying in the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: Well the underground movement, was that mostly then Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: Inside of Germany, were many German nationals, but again, we were part of groups, because across the group lines, you couldn’t meet anymore.</span> <span id="s540">It was much too dangerous!</span> <span id="s541">You wouldn’t trust anybody anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: No gatherings were allowed.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Nothing!</span> <span id="s544">You couldn’t trust anybody.</span> <span id="s545">You could only trust people you knew.</span> <span id="s546">But these were Jews and non-Jews together.</span> <span id="s547">There were a few other Jews.</span> <span id="s548">I’m not the only Jew in that.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Were there a lot of people in the professions, do you recall?</span> <span id="s550">People like lawyers, or… A; Both working people, students.</span> <span id="s551">In that movement in which I was, certainly were many working peoples, because already, around ’32, there was a much closer identification with the labor unions.</span> <span id="s552">I really felt that what I was doing in the underground movement was mostly related to the labor unions.</span> <span id="s553">But the labor unions weren’t what they are sometimes here, you know, just being for wages and so on.</span> <span id="s554">They were really cultural organizations.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: So they had complete programs of education.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A; Yes, everything.</span> <span id="s557">Very strong.</span> <span id="s558">In fact, my thesis, many years later here, in this country, in Pittsburgh, was on labor union education in this country.</span> <span id="s559">Because it interests me that they did this here, too.</span> <span id="s560">But what I’m saying is, when somebody asks me, “With whom did you work in the underground?”</span> <span id="s561">I would say the labor unions, because that was really the nationals and internationals.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: And of course, Hitler quickly forbade the…</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: Oh, that was totally forbidden.</span> <span id="s564">When people ask, “What did you do?”</span> <span id="s565">There were very thin little leaflets -- newspapers -- because we felt people have to know.</span> <span id="s566">There was no other communication.</span> <span id="s567">This is something that I think people don’t understand.</span> <span id="s568">We tried to paste slogans on the walls, because it was very important that people should know that there is a resistance.</span> <span id="s569">That we think we could do.</span> <span id="s570">My own husband invented incredible things…</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: What would have been the penalty at this time if you were caught putting one of these posters up?</span> <span id="s572">Was there an awareness that there might be a risk at your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: Death!</span> <span id="s574">It was always death, for all those things.</span> <span id="s575">But when, for instance, he did something that we could put up, and I won’t go into the details, but at the time of the Olympics, big signs that “The German calm is the calm of the cemetery!”</span> <span id="s576">This is what we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: This was 1936.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: Naturally, all this was death: distributing leaflets was death.</span> <span id="s579">We knew that.</span> <span id="s580">And I can’t describe the atmosphere.</span> <span id="s581">Everybody talks only about the horrors in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s582">I think we should once feel the horror of a society saturated with fear!</span> <span id="s583">I was sent back, you know, by the American government later, and have really helped them to build up their social organizations again.</span> <span id="s584">When people would say to me, “I didn’t know.”</span> <span id="s585">I said, “Were you afraid?”</span> <span id="s586">“Yes.”</span> <span id="s587">Then I say, “Then you did know.”</span> <span id="s588">This is saturated with that!</span></p> <p><span id="s589">When people say, “How did you eat?”</span> <span id="s590">Well, I ate.</span> <span id="s591">There was a little bookstore that let me work with some Jewish children.</span> <span id="s592">I’m just not going into all the details.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: Let me ask you this: The underground, to me, sounds like it was still a continuation of the Youth Movement -- rather than the involvement of people in position, or the middle-age group that had more authority and a little bit more power.</span> <span id="s594">I’m talking about the middle classes.</span> <span id="s595">Even if they had a socialist orientation, did they at all help the underground?</span> <span id="s596">Or give money to the underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: There is no real underground.</span> <span id="s598">That’s the wrong way to put it.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: Well your group then.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: It doesn’t exist!</span> <span id="s601">It’s all small little totally unrelated groups.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: So it was uncoordinated.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: Couldn’t be!</span> <span id="s604">You couldn’t trust anybody.</span> <span id="s605">People do not understand what the word “totalitarian” means.</span> <span id="s606">We know about “authoritarian” but “totalitarian” is different.</span> <span id="s607">There is no way that you can communicate with anybody you haven’t known before.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: So you’re saying that the state terror existed from the very beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: From the very beginning!</span> <span id="s610">From the second that Hitler is made Reichscounselor…in the Reichstagfire…There is incredible terror!</span> <span id="s611">There’s no communication anymore.</span> <span id="s612">So when we say, “There is no underground,” after the war I found out there are people like Catholics who were fighting, other people were fighting.</span> <span id="s613">You don’t know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: Everyone had to do it on their own.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: You had to do it just as an act of conscience with a few people that existed, that you knew!</span> <span id="s616">So that’s number one.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Now this is a terrible thing, when one thinks that people had to act out of a pure drive -- inward drive --without any sense of any help anywhere else.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: I have always said, “All this business…” That’s why I somehow resent some of the books that have come up.</span> <span id="s619">It sounds almost as if you knew the glory.</span> <span id="s620">I remember, I stood later in the concentration camp -- in a cell --and I said, “ The worst thing is that nobody will know that I was even a decent person.”</span> <span id="s621">There’s no glory!</span> <span id="s622">There’s nothing!</span> <span id="s623">There is no satisfaction.</span> <span id="s624">I hate behavior modification!</span> <span id="s625">It tells people that if you behave well, you get a reward.</span> <span id="s626">And I think that’s the worst lie!</span> <span id="s627">That’s not the way you can get anybody to act ethically!</span> <span id="s628">It just isn’t true.</span> <span id="s629">There is no reward!</span> <span id="s630">Absolutely none.</span> <span id="s631">I can’t remember.</span> <span id="s632">Now I have a reward!</span> <span id="s633">Because first of all, I am alive.</span> <span id="s634">And people are nice to me.</span> <span id="s635">But at that time, there is none!</span> <span id="s636">There isn’t even anything in meeting, because when you meet, you’re deathly afraid!</span> <span id="s637">We met what we called private groups.</span> <span id="s638">At most five people.</span> <span id="s639">You took ten minutes to discuss why you are here, because you had to pretend that you were here for a birthday, or something like that.</span> <span id="s640">Nothing is simple!</span> <span id="s641">Everything is drenched by fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Even between friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s644">And you had to be very sure that you knew this other person.</span> <span id="s645">Paul and I, I have to say that, were very much in love.</span> <span id="s646">There was no way to get married.</span> <span id="s647">No way!</span> <span id="s648">He was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s649">I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s650">Right?</span> <span id="s651">That was one of the greatest crimes for the Nazis.</span> <span id="s652">Immediately the laws forbade that.</span> <span id="s653">The laws made me an outlaw very early, because the Nazis had a law that any Jew who was naturalized after 1918, his citizenship would be revoked.</span> <span id="s654">So, my family who had become German after 1918, because we were nothing, we were Austrians, or whatever we were, right?</span> <span id="s655">This was taken away.</span> <span id="s656">I was stateless.</span> <span id="s657">That means you didn’t have a passport anymore.</span> <span id="s658">We went for a little while, still to a theater, and I still am very, very pleased that I saw Schiller’s Don Carlos being played in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s659">And then Marquis Posa stands there and says, “Sir, give us liberty of thought.’</span> <span id="s660">A whole theater got up and applauded.</span> <span id="s661">That, if you talk about reward, that’s a reward I remember.</span> <span id="s662">The next day, they forbade to play Schiller!</span> <span id="s663">(Laughs) their greatest!</span> <span id="s664">Ridiculous!</span> <span id="s665">This is another lie, to say that all Germans were Nazis.</span> <span id="s666">They were not!</span> <span id="s667">There were lots of Germans that were not Nazis.</span> <span id="s668">There were lots of people who were cowards, who wouldn’t move.</span> <span id="s669">And there were some people who were fighting.</span> <span id="s670">And I fought side-by-side with Germans.</span> <span id="s671">When I say “fighting” I’m not talking about weapons, because nobody had weapons.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: And you’re saying there was not even an awareness that there may have been opposition to Hitler in the higher levels -- even say among the military -- the older Juncker groups that probably would have regarded him as an upstart.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: I think there were.</span> <span id="s674">Later, after the war, I found out that there were people.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: Well we all found this out, but at the time you were saying that no one had awareness of where the opposition was.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: We did not know.</span> <span id="s677">That’s why we had those leaflets.</span> <span id="s678">Because we thought, that way at least some people will find out.</span> <span id="s679">There’s strange things, they’re ridiculous things that one did.</span> <span id="s680">I remember we had little things printed that said, “In some place they obstructed Hitler’s speech.”</span> <span id="s681">Then that had to be distributed.</span> <span id="s682">How do you distribute it?</span> <span id="s683">You can’t distribute it!</span> <span id="s684">It was an act of incredible courage, and I know who did it.</span> <span id="s685">Who went up to the roof of one of the big apartment buildings in Hamburg, put that stack of leaflets at the corner of the roof and then left.</span> <span id="s686">The wind distributed them.</span> <span id="s687">Now these are things that…I don’t know how to describe them!</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: This is really to report a little piece of news about a disruption of a speech.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: That’s all!</span> <span id="s690">That’s all!</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: It would not be in the newspapers.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: Nothing is in the newspapers.</span> <span id="s693">Nothing is.</span> <span id="s694">In the newspapers is only how wonderful the Fuhrer is and so on.</span> <span id="s695">One more example.</span> <span id="s696">The first of May was always a labor holiday.</span> <span id="s697">The Nazis made it into their holiday.</span> <span id="s698">All, the workers had to go.</span> <span id="s699">They had to go.</span> <span id="s700">So they demonstrated.</span> <span id="s701">I saw with my own eyes, that the workers went, and then, when they had to stand around and listen to Hitler’s speech, I don’t know how to describe it.</span> <span id="s702">These are very strong!</span> <span id="s703">These are workers from the harbor.</span> <span id="s704">They lifted their arms, and there was a cordon of police around, so that they shouldn’t leave and they hit down at the police.</span> <span id="s705">.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Dr. Konopka is illustrating this by holding her arms over her head with her hands locked, and then she’s showing how they came down with their strength.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: Yes, on the police, so that the police had to let their arms go, and they left.</span> <span id="s708">Just as a protest.</span> <span id="s709">I saw that.</span> <span id="s710">But, who would know about it?</span> <span id="s711">Nobody.</span> <span id="s712">You had to have a leaflet to explain that this happened.</span> <span id="s713">To say that this happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: It strikes me that it’s similar to the Jewish resistance in the camps.</span> <span id="s715">We now know there were many revolts, and many, many protests, but nobody knew, one from the other.</span> <span id="s716">And even the great uprising in Auschwitz was not known, at the time, outside or in other places.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: Right!</span> <span id="s718">And I think, that’s what I want.</span> <span id="s719">I’m getting angry when people tell me, “All the Jews just went” like sheep to the slaughter” That’s not true!</span> <span id="s720">Yes, some did, and they couldn’t do anything else!</span> <span id="s721">I’d like to know what people would do if you are stripped naked with dogs on you.</span> <span id="s722">What else can you do!</span> <span id="s723">In fact, I’m told that one of my uncles, was one of the leaders, and he went in with the Sh’ma Yisroel -- somebody who had seen it told me that.</span> <span id="s724">Yes, and I think that’s courage, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: I also believe, myself, that there is heroism in the mothers who quietly, with their children, tried to keep them calm in the face of a terrible…</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s727">And we have to say, “ But there was resistance!”</span> <span id="s728">Two, there were women who resisted, which is never told.</span> <span id="s729">And three, I want the people to know the Germans resisted!</span> <span id="s730">It isn’t only Jews!</span> <span id="s731">It’s anybody who had decency.</span> <span id="s732">I also have always underlined, and we can talk now about my other experiences, that the worst isn’t killing somebody.</span> <span id="s733">The worst is demeaning people.</span> <span id="s734">And they did that, systematically!</span> <span id="s735">Scrubbing floors with toothbrushes.</span> <span id="s736">That’s demeaning.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: People could see this!</span> <span id="s738">In other words, the ordinary citizen could walk by and see a group of Jews…</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s740">It was Jews, and I have to repeat, also the high Social Democrats, for instance, in Hamburg that were, I have to quick go now into what happened.</span> <span id="s741">I’m very poor right now at dates.</span> <span id="s742">1936.</span> <span id="s743">My husband, I had to warn him.</span> <span id="s744">The underground -- and I say husband, but he wasn’t my husband then, not legally -- gave me the information -- that was one thing the underground did, they got information and they got, sometimes, people out of the country -- that the Nazis were waiting in his room and that I should prevent him from going home.</span> <span id="s745">I will not go into the details, but just know how complicated that is.</span> <span id="s746">A man is coming home on his bicycle from work.</span> <span id="s747">I greet him with smiling, you know, “How nice that I meet you!”</span> <span id="s748">And whisper to him, “Go to the cemetery, we meet you there.”</span> <span id="s749">In the cemetery, with flowers in our hand, on a grave that nobody knows who it is, there were some others, and in a very complex way, which I will not yet describe now, we got him out of the country.</span> <span id="s750">I stayed, because we had made an agreement, that anybody who can still stay, stays, to continue the fight.</span> <span id="s751">But then, only a few months later, there is that famous ring at night.</span> <span id="s752">I was at that time living in a room with a family, not my family, some other family in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s753">There is that ring at the night.</span> <span id="s754">And you know what it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: This is Kristallnacht we’re talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: No, no, it’s much later.</span> <span id="s757">Kristallnacht was much later.</span> <span id="s758">This was ’36.</span> <span id="s759">But we knew when it rings at night that the Nazis are coming.</span> <span id="s760">I was, at that time, one of the major contacts to others, which means I had a few little addresses around.</span> <span id="s761">We had practiced -- I can swallow, still today, any pill without water -- and I swallowed that very fast.</span> <span id="s762">Everything was swallowed.</span> <span id="s763">And the door was opened by the landlady.</span> <span id="s764">And in marched three of those young storm troopers.</span> <span id="s765">Get right in front of my bed, and say, “Get up!</span> <span id="s766">Out!”</span> <span id="s767">And I pretend that I am very surprised what they are doing there, and say, “Would you turn around when I get dressed?”</span> <span id="s768">And they laugh in my face, naturally.</span> <span id="s769">And meanwhile, they are tearing apart everything in my room.</span> <span id="s770">Strange the way…they were very smart, actually, they tore apart all the books, because they knew that sometimes you hide things in the backs of books.</span> <span id="s771">They tore apart, were terribly interested in the photos of a little boy I had.</span> <span id="s772">I had a lot of photos of that little boy.</span> <span id="s773">It was actually my nephew in Israel.</span> <span id="s774">But that little boy -- I knew why they were so interested -- is a blond child.</span> <span id="s775">They thought I had done something with that child.</span> <span id="s776">So they were very mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: It shows their stupidity, in a way.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: Oh, they were stupid.</span> <span id="s779">Then they said, “You come with us!”</span> <span id="s780">I told the landlady, “Please tell my mother.”</span> <span id="s781">And I left with them.</span> <span id="s782">They had me between them in a car.</span> <span id="s783">In the night -- it was night -- they stopped at another place, and out came another person of the same underground group that I knew.</span> <span id="s784">A young woman who is not Jewish, a factory worker.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: Did you feel she had denounced you?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: No.</span> <span id="s787">Not at all.</span> <span id="s788">I knew that that was not the case.</span> <span id="s789">We were very aware of each other to find out what we would say.</span> <span id="s790">And she was very, very intelligent!</span> <span id="s791">The first thing she said was.</span> <span id="s792">“What are you doing here in the night?’</span> <span id="s793">Remember I met you once when we did that trip with the children of the school.”</span> <span id="s794">She immediately gave me the idea what she would say how we knew each other.</span> <span id="s795">Very, very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: So that your stories would concur.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: The stories would concur.</span> <span id="s798">She played the dummy.</span> <span id="s799">I have never seen anybody playing that well.</span> <span id="s800">With the Nazis going into the worst place at the city hall where we knew everybody would be beaten up.</span> <span id="s801">She would stand there and say, “kitty, kitty, kitty,’ and all, “Come little cat,” or something.</span> <span id="s802">I mean, she played the dumb one, and they would look at each other and say, “that dummy!”</span> <span id="s803">I mean, it was good.</span> <span id="s804">She played stupid.</span> <span id="s805">But we were both at the same time, so I knew something had happened, that somebody had given names.</span> <span id="s806">That much we knew, already.</span> <span id="s807">The first night in the -- it’s not yet concentration camp -- police thing -- it’s unbelievable.</span> <span id="s808">I always have said, if they tell you it wasn’t so bad.</span> <span id="s809">They put us into what I would call “a standing coffin.”</span> <span id="s810">It’s really a box.</span> <span id="s811">Small, dark.</span> <span id="s812">I think maybe there was a hole in, because you could breathe.</span> <span id="s813">I couldn’t sit.</span> <span id="s814">I could only stand in that coffin.</span> <span id="s815">And that’s where they put you for hours.</span> <span id="s816">I heard men scream around me!</span> <span id="s817">“Let me out, let me out!</span> <span id="s818">I’ll tell you what you want.”</span> <span id="s819">I have a very good imagination.</span> <span id="s820">It still has stood me in good stead, years later when I was very ill here, I can do something with myself.</span> <span id="s821">I use my imagination.</span> <span id="s822">I can put myself away from where I am.</span> <span id="s823">Now they tell me, that’s a technique they teach people, but I didn’t know it.</span> <span id="s824">(Laughs) That’s very odd, but I didn’t know it.</span> <span id="s825">I could do that at that time.</span> <span id="s826">I was on a meadow.</span> <span id="s827">I still see that meadow.</span> <span id="s828">The sun was flooding, and this is where I was.</span> <span id="s829">It still stands out.</span> <span id="s830">An old man was the jailor, who opened that thing.</span> <span id="s831">And I have always said, “Angels in heaven, obviously, have long beards.”</span> <span id="s832">Because it was one of the old -- you know, once in a while there were old jailors that were still used -- because he was kind.</span> <span id="s833">He shook his head and said, “ What do they do to these poor people?”</span> <span id="s834">And he asked us whether we had eaten.</span> <span id="s835">And he brought us soup.</span> <span id="s836">Most of us couldn’t hold the soup.</span> <span id="s837">Interrogations, interrogations.</span> <span id="s838">Through the interrogations, you know what they know.</span> <span id="s839">You deny.</span> <span id="s840">You have learned, meanwhile to deny anything and everything.</span> <span id="s841">The concentration camp I was in is known comparatively little.</span> <span id="s842">I read it though, the other day, in a book, so it’s known.</span> <span id="s843">It’s Fuhlsbuttel.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: Very near Hamburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: Very near Hamburg.</span> <span id="s846">It’s really the Hamburg prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: But it was used, you think, very early on for political prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: Yes, completely.</span> <span id="s849">And the guards were the SS.</span> <span id="s850">We called them, “the black guards.”</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: Not the SA.</span> <span id="s852">By this time, they had been purged.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: Yes, it’s the SS, which is much worse.</span> <span id="s854">Much, much worse.</span> <span id="s855">I will not go into all the details.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: At any point in this process, were you able to send a note to your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: Yes, I must have been able to send a note to my family.</span> <span id="s858">I was even able to send a note to somebody to bring me something, I remember, because we had practiced disguised writing.</span> <span id="s859">And I must tell you, that I partially forgot how we did it.</span> <span id="s860">Which is good.</span> <span id="s861">But I did get messages out.</span> <span id="s862">That I know.</span> <span id="s863">There were lots of other people brought in that night, but I was the only one who was put in solitary.</span> <span id="s864">Part of it is, because I think I was considered an “intellectual” -- and a “political” -- and a “Jew.’</span> <span id="s865">I had three things, while my young friend was at least not an intellectual, and not a Jew.</span> <span id="s866">The experiences, I can’t go into all of them.</span> <span id="s867">I remember that young SS guard who was about my age.</span> <span id="s868">I was then 26.</span> <span id="s869">He was maybe 24.</span> <span id="s870">Standing in front of me.</span> <span id="s871">It was like a flood of dirty words that I had hardly ever heard.</span> <span id="s872">He’s yelling at you and you stand in front straight.</span> <span id="s873">And years later, I have said, it did something for me.</span> <span id="s874">I suddenly thought, “I’m wearing a raincoat, and it’s just running down me.”</span> <span id="s875">That’s the way I felt.</span> <span id="s876">I remember that I was very surprised that the ones that were treated at that moment worst -- most yelled at, pushed -- were women, older women.</span> <span id="s877">I had no idea who they were until a few days later, and these were Jehovah’s Witnesses.</span> <span id="s878">So we better know.</span> <span id="s879">They didn’t say, “Heil Hitler!”</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: Just as today, they wouldn’t in America.</span> <span id="s881">They don’t believe in taking oaths or saluting the flags.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: No.</span> <span id="s883">But we have to say, that that was there!</span> <span id="s884">I saw them.</span> <span id="s885">Lots of other people that I don’t know who they were.</span> <span id="s886">I was put into the cell in solitary, and I always say the most incredible thing to me was, that right there on the little wooden table, was lying a sharp knife.</span> <span id="s887">They wanted us to commit suicide!</span> <span id="s888">That was their intent!</span> <span id="s889">And all I can think, is they have now done the dumbest thing, because I’m a very, how do you call that, trotsich.</span> <span id="s890">You just do that to me, and I get very, very angry.</span> <span id="s891">And I thought, “The dirty job you do!</span> <span id="s892">You want to kill me?</span> <span id="s893">You kill me.</span> <span id="s894">I’m not doing it for myself.”</span> <span id="s895">But that was the intent.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: It’s interesting that a lot of survivors in the camps often have come through with a similar philosophy.</span> <span id="s897">They’ve said, “ I will not do their work for them.”</span> <span id="s898">“I will not let myself collapse or die.”</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s900">No, let them do it.</span> <span id="s901">“Let them do it.”</span> <span id="s902">It’s their dirty job.</span> <span id="s903">Anyhow, I’m only telling you that I was in solitary.</span> <span id="s904">That I consider solitary an inhuman thing, because I wasn’t allowed to do anything, and I can tell another time how I dealt with that.</span> <span id="s905">I will not go into it anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: It is terrible isn’t it, when one has nothing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: Nothing, nothing.</span> <span id="s908">And especially if one is a very active person.</span> <span id="s909">I don’t think you want that right now, how I dealt with these things, because here and there, these long interrogations.</span> <span id="s910">I was there over Christmas.</span> <span id="s911">And the Christmas Night was something to behold, because I was locked in.</span> <span id="s912">I was locked in in that solitary.</span> <span id="s913">I heard them pulling out one person after another and beating them, like merciless!</span> <span id="s914">If I have seen sadists, this is what they’re used for.</span> <span id="s915">And while they were doing it, you could hear these cries!</span> <span id="s916">The beating!</span> <span id="s917">Then they would sing this: “And when the blood of the Jews…” I don’t think were only Jews.</span> <span id="s918">I want you to know that.</span> <span id="s919">But that’s what they did.</span> <span id="s920">This was the Christmas night!</span> <span id="s921">One day there was commotion.</span> <span id="s922">If you talk about a window, there’s a little hole like in many prisons -- a little opening, high up, you can’t really look out.</span> <span id="s923">I heard a lot of commotion.</span> <span id="s924">I heard a lot of shouting and there’s a little footstool.</span> <span id="s925">I stood and I looked out.</span> <span id="s926">And I’ve seen it with my own eyes, a man literally hunted to death, like you hunt an animal.</span> <span id="s927">He was not running.</span> <span id="s928">They made him run.</span> <span id="s929">They made him run.</span> <span id="s930">Then he had to jump, run, lie down --this was winter, so it’s cold -- and he had to jump, throw himself down, jump up, and I saw with my own eyes when the blood spurted out of his mouth and he was dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: Do you recall the name of anyone who ran this prison?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: No.</span> <span id="s933">I don’t know a single name.</span> <span id="s934">I have to say that.</span> <span id="s935">That’s terribly wrong, but it’s because all this is about six weeks.</span> <span id="s936">There was no name.</span> <span id="s937">There was one woman who was wonderful.</span> <span id="s938">Kind, did everything to make things a little easier, and I do know from this other person who was arrested with me -- who by the way, later, was another two years in prison; I was gone already -- she is in Germany.</span> <span id="s939">She is not a Jew.</span> <span id="s940">And she wrote to me that she testified for that woman when the de-Nazification came.</span> <span id="s941">Because she remembered her, and she has done good things for all of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: She acted out of some instinct.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s944">It was just one of the old women that apparently worked in this prison work, but she has done good things for us.</span> <span id="s945">She always made things a little better.</span> <span id="s946">I was a very short time, a very short time.</span> <span id="s947">Six weeks is nothing!</span> <span id="s948">But six weeks is an eternity if you think you are in it all your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: When you don’t know what’s going to happen next.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: And you don’t know.</span> <span id="s951">You have no idea.</span> <span id="s952">The things I saw.</span> <span id="s953">We were allowed once to go to the showers -- once.</span> <span id="s954">These are still showers, real showers.</span> <span id="s955">In front of me walked a woman whose hands hang in a totally distorted way.</span> <span id="s956">I could see that the hands were broken.</span> <span id="s957">When we had to walk back from the showers, everybody had to take two heavy pails with water to carry.</span> <span id="s958">She was supposed to carry that!</span> <span id="s959">She lifted.</span> <span id="s960">And she couldn’t.</span> <span id="s961">I jumped up and simply took it -- another pail -- which was totally forbidden.</span> <span id="s962">But that one decent woman was in charge, and she said, “ Forbidden, but go.’</span> <span id="s963">These things are unbelievable.</span> <span id="s964">I later heard she was a Social Democratic fighter.</span> <span id="s965">They had taken her child away from her.</span> <span id="s966">But I don’t know the name.</span> <span id="s967">And I know a lot of the names of people who later were arrested.</span> <span id="s968">I would say how I got out, but I want to say, I never got before a trial.</span> <span id="s969">Others did!</span> <span id="s970">The young woman that was arrested with me, got before a trial and got two years.</span> <span id="s971">I never did.</span> <span id="s972">I was called in one day.</span> <span id="s973">They had told me at the last interrogation, “You will never get out of here, because you are the worst.</span> <span id="s974">You don’t say anything.”</span> <span id="s975">Then they called me in, and the man said to me, “You can go home.”</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: Just like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: Yes, “You can go home.”</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: Did you know that you were classified “intellectual?”</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: Did you know any of those classifications were then being put by your name?</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: No, I tell you, I know it before, only about my husband, because later he was with the O.S.S. in the American Army, and he saw his own dossier.</span> <span id="s982">He was classified as one of the most dangerous.</span> <span id="s983">“Watch weapons!”</span> <span id="s984">He never had weapons.</span> <span id="s985">And he found me, but I don’t know what classification I was.</span> <span id="s986">The interesting thing is, that I was told, “Put your clothes on.”</span> <span id="s987">I was put against the wall.</span> <span id="s988">There were people next to me in the cell -- mostly prostitutes --who came out and put their arms around me and said, “ The worst will happen, but we are with you.”</span> <span id="s989">They were kind people.</span> <span id="s990">I went out.</span> <span id="s991">I went into the police thing again, and the policeman who had interviewed me all the time said, “You can go home.”</span> <span id="s992">I said, “What!”</span> <span id="s993">and he said, “You go home.”</span> <span id="s994">And he shook my hand, and he said, “Auf Wiedersehen.’</span> <span id="s995">I have never forgotten.</span> <span id="s996">And I said, “ No, not auf wiedersehen.”</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: (Laughing) you certainly hoped not “auf wiedersehen.’</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: I went out, and I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s999">I knew later what happened…they had done that with others.</span> <span id="s1000">The ones that they felt they couldn’t interrogate -- and this is still the period where they want to get the network -- they let go, because they wanted us to meet others.</span> <span id="s1001">There were others who were then caught and brought back and so on.</span> <span id="s1002">They really were very smart on that one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: So you feel that if you had divulged information, your life might have been worthless to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: Yes, that’s right.</span> <span id="s1005">I was still worth something, and they thought I would meet all these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: It’s diabolic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: I can give you a story that I have here, that my mother wrote, and it’s a true one -- of one of our friends who was released that same way, and he was smart.</span> <span id="s1008">He had arranged to meet somebody!</span> <span id="s1009">And he just threw himself under a car, because the other one would have come up to him!</span> <span id="s1010">They followed him!</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: So he sacrificed his life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s1013">And that, by the way, was a Polish Jew, who in these early days who was also an anti-Nazi fighter.</span> <span id="s1014">Just let’s know that there are these people!</span> <span id="s1015">Hilda Monte was one, and really her name was Meisel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: She’s a wrier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: She was.</span> <span id="s1018">She was killed.</span> <span id="s1019">In Austria, they have a stone for her.</span> <span id="s1020">We don’t know enough about all these people, but I can show you some things upstairs if you want to.</span> <span id="s1021">I have a lot of these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: I want to go back just a little bit.</span> <span id="s1023">You had passed your examinations in ’33, but you couldn’t go into the profession of teaching.</span> <span id="s1024">So survival was just happenstance?</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: Well, I have always been able to do some tutoring.</span> <span id="s1026">Then there were children whose parents wanted to emigrate -- Jewish children -- who wanted to emigrate to England, or to the United States.</span> <span id="s1027">I taught them English.</span> <span id="s1028">You make a little money that way.</span> <span id="s1029">Very little.</span> <span id="s1030">People don’t understand.</span> <span id="s1031">I lived on nothing, practically.</span> <span id="s1032">But I’ve been used to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: That was more towards the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: This is before that time.</span> <span id="s1035">It’s not war yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: And the other question I had for you, about how you got Paul, your husband, out of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: I didn’t do it alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Q; Were there any Jewish organizations that were helping with his escape?</span> <span id="s1039">Do you recall that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: At that time?</span> <span id="s1041">No.</span> <span id="s1042">This was purely through the labor unions.</span> <span id="s1043">That I know.</span> <span id="s1044">But we are not yet in America, so I had better tell you quick.</span> <span id="s1045">Cause it’s a long story.</span> <span id="s1046">I’m not going from Germany.</span> <span id="s1047">I went back to Berlin after that.</span> <span id="s1048">Got my mother out of the country.</span> <span id="s1049">My sister was already in Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: And of course it’s her child whose picture you had on the table that the Nazis had noticed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: Yes, my sister’s child.</span> <span id="s1052">But my mother I got out.</span> <span id="s1053">I got her out of the country.</span> <span id="s1054">And because I thought they’d get me back anyhow, what difference does it make.</span> <span id="s1055">I was left with nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: Your father had died?</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: My father had died earlier.</span> <span id="s1058">I had a cousin, who was a very decent person -- who nobody, nobody would dare touching me; I had been a person in a concentration camp!</span> <span id="s1059">But she said, “You can stay with me for a few days.”</span> <span id="s1060">So I stayed there.</span> <span id="s1061">And I have said, in my life, are strange miracles!</span> <span id="s1062">You sometimes just wonder how all this happens.</span> <span id="s1063">I’m guessing everybody tells some of those strange things.</span> <span id="s1064">I walk in a street.</span> <span id="s1065">I see a young woman whom I knew was Jewish, who looks beautifully suntanned!</span> <span id="s1066">At a time when most of us didn’t look very suntanned.</span> <span id="s1067">I said, “ Where have you been?”</span> <span id="s1068">she says, ‘ I was in Carlsbad.’</span> <span id="s1069">In Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1070">And I said, ‘ How did you get out?’</span> <span id="s1071">I knew that she also had no passport, no nationality.</span> <span id="s1072">She said, “ Oh, we have these passports.</span> <span id="s1073">They had given us passports, the stateless passports.”</span> <span id="s1074">She says, “ If you are sick, there is a doctor at the Czechoslovakian embassy who writes out a certificate and they let you go.”</span> <span id="s1075">I went to that doctor.</span> <span id="s1076">He looked at me, and he said, “What is it?’</span> <span id="s1077">and I said, “I’m run down.’</span> <span id="s1078">And he said, ‘ Well, for that you don’t go to Carlsbad.’</span> <span id="s1079">And I said, “Well, I have kidney problems and all that.”</span> <span id="s1080">And he looked at me with his big sad eyes, and he wrote out a certificate, how desperately ill I was.</span> <span id="s1081">Not a cent he asked.</span> <span id="s1082">I will never know, his name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: This was a German doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: No, a Czechoslovakian doctor.</span> <span id="s1085">At the Czechoslovakian embassy.</span> <span id="s1086">In Berlin.</span> <span id="s1087">And then there was a contact with some of the underground people, including that Julius, who was in one of the major show trials, and I can’t think of his name right now, who was formerly a teacher, is also a Jew, and one of the most extraordinary people, who said, “Gisela, we’ll get you out illegally.</span> <span id="s1088">You have to get out of the country.</span> <span id="s1089">You’re no use anymore to the underground.”</span> <span id="s1090">And I said, “ I’m not going illegally, because they find their ways of finding out who smuggled me out.</span> <span id="s1091">If I go out, I go legally.’</span> <span id="s1092">To go out legally, I needed a visa.</span> <span id="s1093">That you could get only in Hamburg, because my passport was issued in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s1094">I went back to Hamburg.</span> <span id="s1095">I was in the police station.</span> <span id="s1096">This is incredible -- here in that office where they arrested me that night, and next to it is that office where I went and they gave me the stamp -- on grounds of that sick certificate.</span> <span id="s1097">They’re not always smart.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: So no questions were asked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: No questions asked.</span> <span id="s1100">They didn’t even look at my dossier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: Well you just maybe were there on a good day, and they were in a nice mood.</span> <span id="s1102">(Laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">A: It’s very strange!</span> <span id="s1104">I have to say that I got out of Germany in a regular train with very little money.</span> <span id="s1105">Mother had given me some before she left for Israel.</span> <span id="s1106">I got into Carlsbad.</span> <span id="s1107">I lived about a week.</span> <span id="s1108">Mostly on the hot water that they have there.</span> <span id="s1109">There was a Socialist who had been contacted.</span> <span id="s1110">Klein is the name.</span> <span id="s1111">Today I think it probably was a Jew too.</span> <span id="s1112">And he was a wonderful newspaperman, and he and his wife committed suicide when the Nazis invaded Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1113">But they were kind to me, and they gave me also something to eat.</span> <span id="s1114">And meanwhile, the refugees of that group to which I belonged -- which is both Jews and non-Jews, I repeat -- the person who was very active was -- and he is very well known -- Eric Levinski.</span> <span id="s1115">Eric had been a very famous lawyer in Germany, and was also part of that group to which I belonged, and had just made it, to come out.</span> <span id="s1116">And he was in France helping a lot of refugees.</span> <span id="s1117">He and others had arranged for me to get to Bratislava.</span> <span id="s1118">In Bratislava was a non-Jewish lawyer, who was a Socialist, who helped people whatever it is to help them to gain, regain something.</span> <span id="s1119">They thought I was too valuable to the underground movement to just let me go.</span> <span id="s1120">And I was willing to continue fighting the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1121">So the decision was made, that I would continue to fight the Nazis in Austria, which at that time was under Schuschnigg.</span> <span id="s1122">Schuschnigg, at that time, was arresting both the Nazis and the Socialists.</span> <span id="s1123">He sure didn’t know who were his friends.</span> <span id="s1124">I was continuing the fight against the Nazis in Germany in Austria, and the only way to do that was that I had an Austrian passport, and the only way to do that was to get married to an Austrian.</span> <span id="s1125">So somebody -- I won’t name him -- was willing to marry me.</span> <span id="s1126">It’s a sham marriage.</span> <span id="s1127">It’s not a real marriage.</span> <span id="s1128">I didn’t want to do it.</span> <span id="s1129">Paul was sitting, poverty stricken, and eaten by vermins in France.</span> <span id="s1130">As one of my friends said, “ In the olden days, kings and queens had to get married.”</span> <span id="s1131">You know, whether they wanted to or not.</span> <span id="s1132">And that friend I have never forgotten said, because I didn’t want it, said, “ In our days, it’s the anti-Nazi fighters that must do it.”</span> <span id="s1133">So with that conviction, I did it, but I never… That poor guy once wanted just to say “hello,” and I said, “Don’t you ever touch me!”</span> <span id="s1134">And that wasn’t very friendly, because actually, he did take a risk, too.</span> <span id="s1135">But I was mean.</span> <span id="s1136">I didn’t want to have anything personally to do with that person.</span> <span id="s1137">I did have his name!</span> <span id="s1138">I had an Austrian passport at that point!</span> <span id="s1139">So I could go across the border.</span> <span id="s1140">In Czechoslovakia, I lived with some lice.</span> <span id="s1141">Anyhow, I got into Austria, and now I’m doing this again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: When you entered Austria, it was 1937?</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: When did the Nazis invade?</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: They didn’t march into Austria until ’38 -- the Anschluss.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: That’s ’38, so it’s ’37.</span> <span id="s1146">I get into Austria.</span> <span id="s1147">I’m a married woman entering Austria, and another person from the German underground, whose name I don’t like to mention right now, she’s not Jewish, but as active as anybody else, had to do the same thing.</span> <span id="s1148">She also had to marry an Austrian.</span> <span id="s1149">So we moved together, telling that our husbands had to do something else, and so on.</span> <span id="s1150">Anyhow we moved into a small room.</span> <span id="s1151">What we had to do, was again, getting leaflets and all that into Germany, which is much more complicated across borders.</span> <span id="s1152">And how did I make a living?</span> <span id="s1153">By again taking care of children.</span> <span id="s1154">Absolutely a miserable life, but we were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: Were you able to continue your cultural and artistic interests, and your professional interests?</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A: No, but I wouldn’t have lived through the solitary -- ever --without being able to say hundreds of poems to myself.</span> <span id="s1157">I can do that by heart.</span> <span id="s1158">I read whole pages of books without having the books.</span> <span id="s1159">In Czechoslovakia, I grabbed very quickly a lot of the books that were written against Hitler.</span> <span id="s1160">Everybody had it!</span> <span id="s1161">There were an awful lot of Nazis in that period.</span> <span id="s1162">But I could read those.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: Bratislava – was that in the Sudeten area of…</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: Yes, it’s Prestbourg.</span> <span id="s1165">Now the Sudeten area is Carlsbad, and, oh, were they Nazis!</span> <span id="s1166">It was just terrible.</span> <span id="s1167">So all this was published, but there they didn’t believe the newspapers!</span> <span id="s1168">And in Austria, I was again part of the underground.</span> <span id="s1169">Life was very miserable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q: I don’t like to interrupt the flow.</span> <span id="s1171">Your mother got to Israel, obviously with the help of her daughter, who was already an Israeli.</span> <span id="s1172">Is that how it was arranged then, through the Israeli Consulate?</span> <span id="s1173">It’s Palestine, of course -- I shouldn’t say “Israel” --at this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">A: She got out legally.</span> <span id="s1175">She had papers.</span> <span id="s1176">She could sell very little at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: So she left Germany about the time you were just coming out of the prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: I had just come out of prison, and I said, “ Mother, you go!”</span> <span id="s1179">She didn’t want to go, but I practically pushed her out of the country, and I’m glad I did.</span> <span id="s1180">I had to go.</span> <span id="s1181">I’m in Austria.</span> <span id="s1182">Part of the Austrian movement -- mostly Social Democrats at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: Right, it wasn’t Schuschnigg’s and the Party.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1185">Then I once had the opportunity to go to France.</span> <span id="s1186">So I saw Paul again.</span> <span id="s1187">We hadn’t had any contact for two years.</span> <span id="s1188">Oh he had done some terrible things!</span> <span id="s1189">He wanted to go into Germany to get me out of the concentration camp, and they held him, practically physically held him back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: Where was he living in France?</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: In a hole, eaten by vermin, literally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: But where?</span> <span id="s1193">Was it in the capital?</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: In Paris.</span> <span id="s1195">Paris treated refugees’ abominably1 I will not go into all that.</span> <span id="s1196">Just abominably!</span> <span id="s1197">They were not allowed to work.</span> <span id="s1198">They were not allowed to do anything.</span> <span id="s1199">It was just awful.</span> <span id="s1200">The French were very awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q: And he was a non-Jewish refugee.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: Yes, but that isn’t it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: Sometimes the Jewish refugees were helped by agencies in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: Well, he was, too.</span> <span id="s1205">The Socialists did some, but my God!</span> <span id="s1206">I mean, what was it!</span> <span id="s1207">Naturally, they helped each other1 But it was still very bad.</span> <span id="s1208">I go back to Austria, because I was able to go out.</span> <span id="s1209">Talk about culture, I still remember the time when they had the great Van Gogh exhibit in Paris and in spite of everything, I saw the beautiful Van Gogh exhibit.</span> <span id="s1210">Paul and I were both there.</span> <span id="s1211">But I had to go back.</span> <span id="s1212">We had agreed that as long as I could, I would fight.</span> <span id="s1213">And I went there, but then this other friend also went out and she came back, and she said, “ Gisela, let’s burn everything.</span> <span id="s1214">In about an hour the police will be here.</span> <span id="s1215">They caught me at the border.”</span> <span id="s1216">And so there was a police.</span> <span id="s1217">And we burned everything.</span> <span id="s1218">We both were put into an Austrian prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: You were again put in a prison, with the friend, who had also made a marriage in order to become an Austrian.</span> <span id="s1220">In Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s1222">This is before the Anschluss.</span> <span id="s1223">I’m in a horrible police prison in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1224">Really awful.</span> <span id="s1225">It’s dirty, filthy.</span> <span id="s1226">They wanted to take my glasses away.</span> <span id="s1227">that’s something I don’t let anybody do, because I have very bad eyes, and I fought it.</span> <span id="s1228">They interviewed me.</span> <span id="s1229">I thought that they would send me back to Germany, because they can hear my accent is German, not Austrian, But I was still kept in the police prison.</span> <span id="s1230">I can’t tell how many days, but it was quite awhile.</span> <span id="s1231">I think, if people talk about it, I remember going through a dark corridor with a big fat policeman who tried to rape me, but he didn’t quite succeed.</span> <span id="s1232">These are the kinds of things you experience.</span> <span id="s1233">But it was police.</span> <span id="s1234">It wasn’t yet the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1235">It’s the strange, Austrian kind of thing.</span> <span id="s1236">I was experiencing on week-ends, these poor fat women coming in, who weren’t allowed to sell the apples that they wanted to sell.</span> <span id="s1237">I’m just not going into all that.</span> <span id="s1238">I saw poverty, and I lived with a girl who was found in the streets.</span> <span id="s1239">And in some ways, it was very strange, because they always felt most sorry for me, because I was political, and they were just poor.</span> <span id="s1240">But it was a very strange experience.</span> <span id="s1241">Finally, the police decided that I should get into a concentration camp, and not be in the police station anymore.</span> <span id="s1242">Vienna had concentration camps within the Vienna walls.</span> <span id="s1243">I’m talking concentration camps under Schuschnigg, not yet under the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1244">I can’t give you the streets anymore, because you get always transported.</span> <span id="s1245">You don’t really know where you are.</span> <span id="s1246">It wasn’t comic then, but today I think it’s like a comic opera, because it was a men’s prison, actually.</span> <span id="s1247">There were no women.</span> <span id="s1248">It was huge!</span> <span id="s1249">But they had no other rooms.</span> <span id="s1250">Through the lines of all these men, I was pushed into a huge room with hundreds of mattresses, it seemed, but I was the only one in that room.</span> <span id="s1251">It was just idiotic.</span> <span id="s1252">And every time I had to go to the washroom, everybody was called out to go back in.</span> <span id="s1253">I had strange experiences there.</span> <span id="s1254">I had nothing again.</span> <span id="s1255">I wasn’t allowed to write, or do anything.</span> <span id="s1256">Suddenly paper and pencil flew through a little hole at the door.</span> <span id="s1257">And it said, “ Who are you.</span> <span id="s1258">Nazi or Sozi?”</span> <span id="s1259">So the co-prisoners wanted to know.</span> <span id="s1260">And I didn’t answer, because I had learned to be so suspicious of people, that you didn’t give an answer.</span> <span id="s1261">So I didn’t answer, and then they said, “Say at least that one, Nazi or Sozi,” and I said, “ Well, definitely not Nazi.”</span> <span id="s1262">That much I thought I would say.</span> <span id="s1263">A man came --it was very cold -- to put coal in my oven.</span> <span id="s1264">A prisoner I think.</span> <span id="s1265">Left some newspaper.</span> <span id="s1266">When I opened the newspaper, everywhere there were words like.</span> <span id="s1267">“Don’t feel too bad, you’re not alone.</span> <span id="s1268">We think of you.”</span> <span id="s1269">It was one of the most touching human communications.</span> <span id="s1270">I can’t tell you even how long I was in there.</span> <span id="s1271">I have probably documents on it, but I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1272">It wasn’t so long.</span> <span id="s1273">At one point they again said, “ Go home, but you have to be available for the trial of your friend.”</span> <span id="s1274">Because she was caught with the stuff.</span> <span id="s1275">I went back to the room, and very short after that -- a few days after that -- I went back, taking care of some of these kids whom I had taken care of.</span> <span id="s1276">This was a Jewish family.</span> <span id="s1277">And that day I went there, and I went home and it was getting dark.</span> <span id="s1278">And there were rumors flying that the Nazis were coming.</span> <span id="s1279">And I said to the mother of the children, “Don’t listen to rumors, but it’s possible.”</span> <span id="s1280">I walked into the street, and I met an old woman -- people were walking, like always, in the streets -- and that old woman came right up to me, crying, just crying, and handed me a leaflet.</span> <span id="s1281">And that leaflet said, “ We are entering…and it was a German, Nazi…</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: It was an announcement that the Reich was coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: It was a Nazi announcement leaflet.</span> <span id="s1284">At that moment I went upstairs, and there was this friend of mine who had been released.</span> <span id="s1285">Schuschnigg, I should have said, by amnesty, let everybody go just before the Anschluss.</span> <span id="s1286">So she was just let go, because of the amnesty.</span> <span id="s1287">She was sitting there with the man whom I so-called had married.</span> <span id="s1288">And I said, “The Nazis are coming.”</span> <span id="s1289">And they said, “Don’t pass rumors.”</span> <span id="s1290">I showed them the leaflet.</span> <span id="s1291">At that moment we turned on the radio, and there was Seizenkrat, saying, “Viennese, the Germans are coming as friends.</span> <span id="s1292">Be quiet.”</span> <span id="s1293">So that night, I don’t wish it for anybody, but to see Vienna, it was unbelievable!</span> <span id="s1294">The sky was filled with smoke and fire, everybody was burning material that was dangerous.</span> <span id="s1295">I’d never seen anything like that city.</span> <span id="s1296">The German planes were circling, circling, circling.</span> <span id="s1297">And that Seizenkrat voice simply said, “This is probably the end.”</span> <span id="s1298">At that moment, we decided that this other woman should immediately leave the country, because she had a passport.</span> <span id="s1299">The people who had gone under amnesty had got their passports back.</span> <span id="s1300">I did not.</span> <span id="s1301">I was again left without papers.</span> <span id="s1302">But she had it, and I said to her, you go, not to the closest border, Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1303">Go to the French border, because you can always say you go to your husband who is in France.</span> <span id="s1304">Well this saved her life, because the Czech border was already closed.</span> <span id="s1305">And they took everybody.</span> <span id="s1306">I was still there.</span> <span id="s1307">So very quick, I was alone in that place with a landlady who was decent.</span> <span id="s1308">She was a Catholic, but she loved a Jew.</span> <span id="s1309">And she knew that she has to protect what she could.</span> <span id="s1310">But there wasn’t much protection she could give.</span> <span id="s1311">I had to get out of that place.</span> <span id="s1312">I came the next day to these Jewish people where I had taken care of the children.</span> <span id="s1313">The furniture was already demolished.</span> <span id="s1314">That means in that first night when the Nazis invaded, the Austrian Nazis knew where the Jews were.</span> <span id="s1315">They were much more anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s1316">And they had already destroyed the furniture.</span> <span id="s1317">The mother was lying on a couch.</span> <span id="s1318">The two children were with her.</span> <span id="s1319">I have used that, once in a speech, to say to people, this is the way one teaches children to be afraid.</span> <span id="s1320">Because the child says, “I am going to school.”</span> <span id="s1321">And the mother says, “ You can’t go to school.</span> <span id="s1322">They’ll spit at you.”</span> <span id="s1323">He says, “ I’ll spit back.”</span> <span id="s1324">And the mother says, “ You can’t because you are a Jew.”</span> <span id="s1325">This is the way one learns.</span> <span id="s1326">When people say Jews are cowards, that’s the way you make cowards.</span> <span id="s1327">And it’s tragic!</span> <span id="s1328">And all I could do was say good-bye to them.</span> <span id="s1329">I went back.</span> <span id="s1330">I had to take another little room -- I had practically no money anymore -- in a family that I knew was Jewish, but I didn’t know, really, what they were, and they didn’t know who I was.</span> <span id="s1331">The interesting thing is that they were Sephardic Jews.</span> <span id="s1332">And they were from, I think, Turkey.</span> <span id="s1333">They had Turkish, I think, passports.</span> <span id="s1334">So they could get out pretty soon.</span> <span id="s1335">But during that first days, they couldn’t go in the street, because they had very dark hair, and beautiful, these beautiful black eyes, but that for the Nazis was a stereotype!</span> <span id="s1336">Now I’m grey, but I always had kind of a light brown hair.</span> <span id="s1337">So they couldn’t go out.</span> <span id="s1338">I went out to the marketplace and bought the food for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: You wouldn’t be an obvious stereotype.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: No.</span> <span id="s1341">I could go out and buy food for them.</span> <span id="s1342">But there wasn’t much food.</span> <span id="s1343">I lived on potatoes.</span> <span id="s1344">They lived on very little too.</span> <span id="s1345">I can tell you, I want to tell the world.</span> <span id="s1346">I would like to tell what happened in Vienna, because this isn’t yet Crystal Night!</span> <span id="s1347">It’s Anschluss.</span> <span id="s1348">They searched out the pregnant Jewish women, and they made them scrub the streets.</span> <span id="s1349">Because there were slogans by Schuschnigg on the street.</span> <span id="s1350">These were highly pregnant women!</span> <span id="s1351">They were sure showing.</span> <span id="s1352">They were scrubbing streets.</span> <span id="s1353">I saw it!</span> <span id="s1354">I’m now talking about things I saw.</span> <span id="s1355">I saw these women, and some pregnant and some not.</span> <span id="s1356">They made them carry heavy -- do you know what a long carpet weighs?</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: Yes, I have an idea.</span> <span id="s1358">It is heavy.</span> <span id="s1359">It’s heavy for a strong man, anyone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: To carry them into these offices where the Nazis…the Nazis came to Vienna totally prepared with everything.</span> <span id="s1361">They didn’t trust the sloppy Viennese.</span> <span id="s1362">They made their own offices.</span> <span id="s1363">They had everything there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q: So they came with all the furniture.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">A: The women had to carry those furniture, the carpets.</span> <span id="s1366">I saw them.</span> <span id="s1367">I saw with my own eyes, a woman on two sides storm troopers, and it was a very handsome blonde woman, and they had put a sign on her brow, “ I slept with a Jew.”</span> <span id="s1368">And she had to walk the streets.</span> <span id="s1369">I had seen bad things in Germany.</span> <span id="s1370">In Austria, they were drunk.</span> <span id="s1371">They were drunk with victory!</span> <span id="s1372">They really knew now they had the world!</span> <span id="s1373">They really showed it!</span> <span id="s1374">So I saw all this!</span> <span id="s1375">And I was sure I would die anyhow, so what difference does it make?</span> <span id="s1376">I walked the streets.</span> <span id="s1377">I saw all of it!</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">Q: Did this fatalism that you felt, at that time, do you think that it gave you the courage to still continue the struggle?</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s1380">I think I didn’t really struggle anymore.</span> <span id="s1381">This is the days in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1382">I myself think that you get into a very strange, almost shock-like… For instance, I slept.</span> <span id="s1383">I have never slept as much as during that time.</span> <span id="s1384">I slept.</span> <span id="s1385">I didn’t have to eat, either, much.</span> <span id="s1386">But I slept.</span> <span id="s1387">I don’t think I was very courageous.</span> <span id="s1388">I really don’t.</span> <span id="s1389">I slept and then I walked out and I thought, “ if ever I come out, I want to tell them, but otherwise, what difference does it make?”</span> <span id="s1390">In some ways I felt oddly protective of that family whom I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1391">But I felt they were so beautiful!</span> <span id="s1392">I like dark-haired people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">Q: And you took this as your responsibility, even in these circumstances.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1395">And I heard later that they were saved, somehow they got out.</span> <span id="s1396">A letter came.</span> <span id="s1397">I still got mail through others.</span> <span id="s1398">Again, in the way in which we could write, my younger sister was at that time a nurse in London.</span> <span id="s1399">And she was in contact with Paul.</span> <span id="s1400">So she could write to me, because it was my sister.</span> <span id="s1401">She gave me instruction in that way that isn’t obvious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">Q: Did she get out at the same time the older one did, about the same time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">A: No, my older sister came out early to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1404">Ruth, my younger sister, had just finished her Abitur, which is the entrance to the University.</span> <span id="s1405">There was only one way to go to England, and that’s to be a domestic servant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q: So she had a work permit, in other words.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A: She had a work permit to go there, and then she became a nurse.</span> <span id="s1408">I still think Ruth was the most beautiful and the most gifted of all of us three, but she’s not alive any more.</span> <span id="s1409">I will say in a minute how this went, but I can say that later.</span> <span id="s1410">We two were very, very close.</span> <span id="s1411">By the way, all her letters are there, and they should be collected some way.</span> <span id="s1412">But she gave me instructions to get out of Austria, and go to France.</span> <span id="s1413">I didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s1414">I thought, “ It’s enough running -- from one place to the other.</span> <span id="s1415">I don’t want anymore.”</span> <span id="s1416">But there was one man -- and it’s terrible that I forgot names, but he had his doctorate already -- one of the very young doctorate.</span> <span id="s1417">He was also Jewish, but also a part of the Social Democratic underground.</span> <span id="s1418">He talked with me and I never forget, because he said, “Gisela, do you like to go under a cold shower?”</span> <span id="s1419">and I said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s1420">He said, “ That’s just what this is.</span> <span id="s1421">You are trying.</span> <span id="s1422">And you must go.</span> <span id="s1423">There is no way that people should just stay here!”</span> <span id="s1424">So, you must imagine the Vienna railroad station filled with jubilation and I’m going on a train to go to Innsbruck, in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1425">They are drunk in there -- literally!</span> <span id="s1426">They were drinking.</span> <span id="s1427">They were young.</span> <span id="s1428">Everybody wanted to grab me and put me on their laps.</span> <span id="s1429">Nazis.</span> <span id="s1430">It was their day.</span> <span id="s1431">There was an agreement in Innsbruck, a person would meet me with white gloves, and that’s the way we would recognize each other.</span> <span id="s1432">Not somebody I knew.</span> <span id="s1433">Once more, I underline, when somebody’s helped me, it was sometime Jews and sometimes not.</span> <span id="s1434">This is a person whose name I will never know.</span> <span id="s1435">I only know that she said that she was a minister’s daughter -- a Swiss minister’s daughter, who had never done anything illegal, but for this, she would do it any day.</span> <span id="s1436">She helped Jews and others.</span> <span id="s1437">I got on a false passport.</span> <span id="s1438">I had to go.</span> <span id="s1439">It was something I thought was the worst, because I had to go back to Germany!</span> <span id="s1440">I was in a train where they were jubilant, and I didn’t dare open my mouth, because I knew they would recognize my accent.</span> <span id="s1441">Once when I had to say something, one of them said, “You don’t sound Swiss.’</span> <span id="s1442">And I said, “ My mother was a German.”</span> <span id="s1443">I had to go through Munich, which was the worst.</span> <span id="s1444">I cannot describe that trip.</span> <span id="s1445">It was like a nightmare.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Q: You must have had your heart in your mouth through the whole…</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: I did, but the other side of me said, “ I don’t care.</span> <span id="s1448">Let them kill me.”</span> <span id="s1449">On the other hand, I wanted to be out.</span> <span id="s1450">It’s this kind of dual thing.</span> <span id="s1451">Anyhow I got out.</span> <span id="s1452">I got into France.</span> <span id="s1453">And then I have to say, the life of a refugee, which is horrible…especially if you used to be important, because at least you were part of an underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">Q: You had a mission.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">A: You had a mission -- was gone.</span> <span id="s1456">There wasn’t anything.</span> <span id="s1457">You are just nothing, right?</span> <span id="s1458">France treated people abominably.</span> <span id="s1459">When you ask about the interest, yes, I got a taste of Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1460">I wished I had that letter.</span> <span id="s1461">I wrote an article about Masaryk and his son, who later was killed.</span> <span id="s1462">He wrote me a beautiful letter, thanking me for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">Q: Masaryk was the leader of…</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">A: The underground against the Nazis later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">Q: What was the route of the train?</span> <span id="s1466">It went through Munich and then Koblenz and over to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">A: I think it’s Koblenz but I can’t tell you for sure.</span> <span id="s1468">I crossed the border in Alsace-Lorraine, that I know.</span> <span id="s1469">I didn’t really care.</span> <span id="s1470">France was miserable.</span> <span id="s1471">France didn’t give any permission to stay.</span> <span id="s1472">Some Austrians were allowed to be in France, I was not Austrian, I was considered an Austrian refugee.</span> <span id="s1473">I wanted to stay with Paul, but that wasn’t allowed, because the Austrian refugees had to go.</span> <span id="s1474">There was a big, fat guy from the committee -- he made every woman sleep with him until he got her some help.</span> <span id="s1475">I just didn’t go back there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">Q: There’s always some corruption.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">A: There’s always corruption, even on the committees there.</span> <span id="s1478">I got to Lyon, to be a maid in somebody’s house, and was terribly exploited!</span> <span id="s1479">Really badly exploited.</span> <span id="s1480">But you are alive.</span> <span id="s1481">Also there was a wonderful Protestant man in the government.</span> <span id="s1482">He later became very famous after the war.</span> <span id="s1483">His name was Monet.</span> <span id="s1484">A very famous person, who helped me to get some permission to stay in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">Q: Is this the Monet, he developed the concept of the United Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">A: Yes, he’s very famous.</span> <span id="s1487">But that’s the one who helped me with that.</span> <span id="s1488">I stayed then with these awful people in Lyon.</span> <span id="s1489">What happened then?</span> <span id="s1490">I got a job in a tiny little place outside of Lyon, in a family of very high nobility in France.</span> <span id="s1491">I have had the most odd life, because this was unreal.</span> <span id="s1492">It was a castle with young girls, very protected.</span> <span id="s1493">But I also learned something about the life of nobility.</span> <span id="s1494">The mother and father were separated, and I was always having to sit there in the evening and do some cross-stitching, and suddenly I realized that some evenings she didn’t want me there.</span> <span id="s1495">Then I realized that there was a young man with whom she slept on those evenings.</span> <span id="s1496">You live a totally unreal life!</span> <span id="s1497">The kids -- there were two young girls -- had to go on a trip and I was a governess.</span> <span id="s1498">I had to go with them.</span> <span id="s1499">We went first to Paris, and then to someplace near the Gulf of Viscaya.</span> <span id="s1500">I saw horrible scenes of these poor, Spanish refugees that tried to escape Franco, and were shot right on the water there across from us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">Q: Really!</span> <span id="s1502">As they came over into France?</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">A: As they came into France.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">Q: This was near Biarritz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">A: Right there in the south.</span> <span id="s1506">So I saw it!</span> <span id="s1507">They tried to cross.</span> <span id="s1508">If they didn’t quite make it, the Spanish bullets hit them and they died.</span> <span id="s1509">We found a naked man in the bushes when he made it.</span> <span id="s1510">The world was crazy.</span> <span id="s1511">I tell you that.</span> <span id="s1512">And that I saw there.</span> <span id="s1513">Then I had to go back with the two young girls to Paris.</span> <span id="s1514">This is the period of what they called the “droll de guerre.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: The “Funny War.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">A: And I have to get the sequence straight.</span> <span id="s1517">The Funny War breaks out.</span> <span id="s1518">It’s a declaration that France is in the war.</span> <span id="s1519">They arrested all -- the idiot France -- all the German refugees, their best friends, they arrested them and put them in camps.</span> <span id="s1520">Paul was again in a camp.</span> <span id="s1521">And other, too.</span> <span id="s1522">They did not arrest the Austrians.</span> <span id="s1523">So I was not in a camp.</span> <span id="s1524">I had no place to go, because Paris was zone “enterdit” which means you are not allowed to stay.</span> <span id="s1525">So was Lyon.</span> <span id="s1526">There was no place to go.</span> <span id="s1527">I said, “ I’ll just go up in the air.”</span> <span id="s1528">But the father of these kids had this little place outside of Paris, and kind of liked it, that somebody was there.</span> <span id="s1529">So he said, “You can stay there.’</span> <span id="s1530">And he was very high nobility.</span> <span id="s1531">“You can stay there and just take care of it.”</span> <span id="s1532">I stayed.</span> <span id="s1533">It was winter.</span> <span id="s1534">It was ice cold.</span> <span id="s1535">There was no heating, but I stayed there.</span> <span id="s1536">In between he would come for weekends with his mistress.</span> <span id="s1537">Sometimes she would stay there, and I learned to know a very poor little French girl who had to be protected, because she felt very bad about the whole thing…But, she was there.</span> <span id="s1538">That’s another story.</span> <span id="s1539">Meanwhile the bombs are beginning to fall.</span> <span id="s1540">Very soon it was impossible to stay there, because the whole village was beginning to talk about that strange woman there.</span> <span id="s1541">And he was getting afraid.</span> <span id="s1542">And he had two mistresses -- that was too much -- you can’t do that.</span> <span id="s1543">The refugee committee in Paris -- it’s both Jewish and non-Jewish refugee committee-- found a place in Jouy en Josas, I still remember.</span> <span id="s1544">It’s not far from Paris.</span> <span id="s1545">There was a young farmer living there who was Jewish -- he was actually a Jewish refugeee, but he was meanwhile settled there a long time -- who had a non-Jewish wife, so they said I could stay in their house.</span> <span id="s1546">And the refugee committee said I could come occasionally to Paris and kind of help them with -- quote -- “investigations”, which was pretty horrible, to check out things.</span> <span id="s1547">I had a place.</span> <span id="s1548">It was under a roof and it was all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">Q: So you were working with the committee then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">A: I was working with the committee.</span> <span id="s1551">It was pretty awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">Q: In other words, you were in a position where you had to make some judgments.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">A: Yeah, and very bad.</span> <span id="s1554">They were doing terrible things.</span> <span id="s1555">I surely would have never liked social work if I had believed that’s social work, I’ll tell you.</span> <span id="s1556">Taking out of somebody who has nothing, taking more out of nothing.</span> <span id="s1557">I won’t go into all this.</span> <span id="s1558">Both Jews and non-Jews -- it didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s1559">It was awful.</span> <span id="s1560">And I saw situations where they checked out a woman -- when I got into her room, she was sitting on the bare floor -- with nothing!</span> <span id="s1561">Literally!</span> <span id="s1562">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1563">And then you check her out.</span> <span id="s1564">I called her, all I could do was put my arms around her, and say, “ This is ridiculous.</span> <span id="s1565">I better get you something to eat.”</span> <span id="s1566">But this is the kind of thing that happened.</span> <span id="s1567">I didn’t do much of that.</span> <span id="s1568">I don’t remember I did much of it.</span> <span id="s1569">I got some support that way.</span> <span id="s1570">I also, in that time once, could visit Paul who had become what they called a “prestataire.”</span> <span id="s1571">The French allowed the refugees that they recognized as definitely anti-Nazi to build kind of an auxiliary column to their army.</span> <span id="s1572">And they were digging trenches and doing these kinds of things.</span> <span id="s1573">So I could visit him once there, They lived in barracks.</span> <span id="s1574">That’s a whole other story.</span> <span id="s1575">I was still there.</span> <span id="s1576">But then one day, I went into Paris and a French teacher whom I knew came and said, “ Gisela, the Germans are approaching Paris, and the worst thing will be the refugees.</span> <span id="s1577">They are just killing them off on the way.</span> <span id="s1578">You better leave.”</span> <span id="s1579">I still remember there was already terrible confusion.</span> <span id="s1580">I got back to the village.</span> <span id="s1581">Again, as usual, you have to leave everything.</span> <span id="s1582">You don’t take anything with you.</span> <span id="s1583">You always accumulate a little bit of something -- some books, usually.</span> <span id="s1584">And we had to leave everything.</span> <span id="s1585">I have to say something.</span> <span id="s1586">There has been a lot of bombing.</span> <span id="s1587">The Belgians had already streamed in, and we saw all the soldiers coming, and all that.</span> <span id="s1588">But we had been used, already, to have in our pockets, one lemon and some nuts, because that’s the way you saved some food.</span> <span id="s1589">And with that, I was supposed to go back to Paris.</span> <span id="s1590">I forgot to tell you that, perhaps, two weeks earlier than that, a telegram still reached me that my sister had been killed in England.</span> <span id="s1591">The one whom I loved very much.</span> <span id="s1592">So that was gone too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">Q: Was her death related to the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">A: Not totally.</span> <span id="s1595">She went to Wales.</span> <span id="s1596">She was a nurse.</span> <span id="s1597">She went to Wales for having a few days vacation -- with her friend -- and a truck ran over her.</span> <span id="s1598">It’s the confusion of the war.</span> <span id="s1599">It isn’t killed by a bullet.</span> <span id="s1600">She was for many years a nurse in that large Jewish hospital in London.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">Q: She had not married or had children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">A: Couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1603">No.</span> <span id="s1604">I went back, the Gar St. Lazaire was completely closed.</span> <span id="s1605">They had put the doors locked so that people couldn’t get on the trains.</span> <span id="s1606">And it was a confusion!</span> <span id="s1607">People were sitting in masses around the station.</span> <span id="s1608">Sitting there, the planes coming over, the smoke pouring through, to hide the city.</span> <span id="s1609">It was bedlam!</span> <span id="s1610">Paris was totally demoralized.</span> <span id="s1611">People were streaming in from all over the country, and the Germans were just coming, coming, coming.</span> <span id="s1612">An so I just felt I couldn’t sit there, and there were some others, I was one of two, we just kind of started walking.</span> <span id="s1613">At one corner there was a little bit of a thing open.</span> <span id="s1614">We were pretty thin at that time.</span> <span id="s1615">So I sneak through.</span> <span id="s1616">There was a train sitting.</span> <span id="s1617">Got into the train, which was full of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">Q: You just squeezed through a narrow door?</span> <span id="s1619">It said, “Closed,” but…</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">A: Yes, but we got in.</span> <span id="s1621">We weren’t many.</span> <span id="s1622">Maybe I was alone, maybe two people.</span> <span id="s1623">Everybody else was just sitting, waiting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">Q: You didn’t know where the train was going to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">A: No, we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1626">But the train was moving south, which was what we wanted.</span> <span id="s1627">Everybody had said, “ If you can, go to Montauban.”</span> <span id="s1628">Montauban was kind of known for the Austrian refugees.</span> <span id="s1629">A refuge.</span> <span id="s1630">The train was going south.</span> <span id="s1631">Didn’t know for sure.</span> <span id="s1632">Every minute it stopped, because there were some bombing, or something.</span> <span id="s1633">It became night.</span> <span id="s1634">We went out, nearby, you had to go to the washroom.</span> <span id="s1635">On the outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">Q: It was in the fields.</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">A: In the fields.</span> <span id="s1638">But suddenly the news comes, the Italians have entered the war.</span> <span id="s1639">So we knew we were kind of between the two.</span> <span id="s1640">But oddly enough, that train went to Montauban!</span> <span id="s1641">Some of us went off in Montauban.</span> <span id="s1642">Suddenly there were a lot of refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">Q: And you were still free.</span> <span id="s1644">And, then you were still in Free France -- technically.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">A: It was still free.</span> <span id="s1646">That was Free France, from then on.</span> <span id="s1647">The mayor of Montauban was a Socialist.</span> <span id="s1648">He had called the whole city to aid any refugees who would come.</span> <span id="s1649">I still think Montauban should get a medal, somehow!</span> <span id="s1650">They all helped.</span> <span id="s1651">Everybody opened their homes.</span> <span id="s1652">I still remember the man was a letter carrier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">Q: Do you recall if Montauban had any significant Protestant population?</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">A: No, I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s1655">It’s not the same as the other place.</span> <span id="s1656">I know about that other place.</span> <span id="s1657">In fact, I hear that the daughter of the man, who is living right here in Minneapolis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1659">Her name is Mrs. Blackwell; teaches at Blake.</span> <span id="s1660">[ Correction: her name was Nelly Blackburn; she has married again, and is now Nelly Hewitt.</span> <span id="s1661">She is the daughter of Pastor Trocme, of Chambon, France.]</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s1663">But it’s not the same place.</span> <span id="s1664">Montauban had both.</span> <span id="s1665">Catholics, Socialists and probably Protestants, but it was mostly the Socialist mayor who was fantastic.</span> <span id="s1666">He gave us false papers.</span> <span id="s1667">He gave us rations.</span> <span id="s1668">He gave us all these things that you needed.</span> <span id="s1669">They streamed in, and they streamed in.</span> <span id="s1670">We had all lost each other.</span> <span id="s1671">We didn’t know what was what.</span> <span id="s1672">I was very sure that I had lost Paul for eternity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">Q: You had to leave him behind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">A: Well, he was in that prestataire camp somewhere.</span> <span id="s1675">Now his story, which is in that book, is unbelievable, because they simply went on the road.</span> <span id="s1676">They told the French that when the Germans came in, they would be killed, and they don’t want to be killed yet, and they went on the road, and they lived.</span> <span id="s1677">He lived on, alone, on sour grapes and stuff.</span> <span id="s1678">By accident, he saw somebody on a bicycle whom he recognized -- and that person knew where I was.</span> <span id="s1679">We always went to the post office to find out whether anything was there, and one day there was a letter I found from Paul.</span> <span id="s1680">He will be here soon.</span> <span id="s1681">So we were reunited!</span> <span id="s1682">In this terrible mess!</span> <span id="s1683">In so-called Free France, where there were constantly German commissions.</span> <span id="s1684">You were ready at that time, you heard the Nazis…And the German refugees didn’t dare to say a word in the street, because they would recognize our accent.</span> <span id="s1685">Very quickly, it didn’t go that everybody could stay in Montauban.</span> <span id="s1686">The city got over-filled.</span> <span id="s1687">But I must say, again, how other people helped.</span> <span id="s1688">The surrounding was open country.</span> <span id="s1689">These are farmers.</span> <span id="s1690">They said, “ We’ll help these people.</span> <span id="s1691">Never mind Jews, non-Jews.”</span> <span id="s1692">And this was really a mixture.</span> <span id="s1693">And so, I still remember, we were delegated to be a couple -- we could still not get married -- but a couple going to Lavitt.</span> <span id="s1694">It’s far out.</span> <span id="s1695">Somebody gave us bicycles.</span> <span id="s1696">We bicycled there.</span> <span id="s1697">The mayor knew who we were.</span> <span id="s1698">The mayor gave us papers that we were Belgian refugees.</span> <span id="s1699">I spoke perfect French, which made it easy.</span> <span id="s1700">Paul can speak what’s called low German, which is like Flemish.</span> <span id="s1701">So we made a very good Belgian couple.</span> <span id="s1702">We lived.</span> <span id="s1703">I can’t tell you how long, in that place, a very strange interlude.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">Q: Were you assigned different names?</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1706">And I forgot what my name was.</span> <span id="s1707">It’s awful, but I forgot.</span> <span id="s1708">We lived in, literally a stable, where you had to crawl in underneath.</span> <span id="s1709">We had practically no food.</span> <span id="s1710">The farmers gave us milk.</span> <span id="s1711">We ate blackberries, mashed and whole, all the time, because that was something to eat.</span> <span id="s1712">I still remember the incredible thing, when the Americans sent to the mayor, he wants some of that white fat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">Q: Oh, suet?</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1715">It was fantastic.</span> <span id="s1716">We thought it was the best thing the world had ever invented.</span> <span id="s1717">And some bread.</span> <span id="s1718">But after a few months, the farmers began to like us.</span> <span id="s1719">Paul -- now if you look at this house, this was all done with his own hands.</span> <span id="s1720">This was a broken-down cottage, this house.</span> <span id="s1721">He can do anything with his hands.</span> <span id="s1722">I’ll show you something later-- other things.</span> <span id="s1723">So he began to look into the garbage things, and found, sometimes, left-overs, and he soled their shoes.</span> <span id="s1724">Then we helped when they had to harvest something.</span> <span id="s1725">So we got a little better to eat.</span> <span id="s1726">It was a very strange interlude.</span> <span id="s1727">Then winter was approaching, and they needed woodcutters.</span> <span id="s1728">And as I say, Paul was strong and could do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">Q: This has to be now, already, 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s1731">It’s 1940.</span> <span id="s1732">It’s war.</span> <span id="s1733">The Frenchmen were almost all prisoners, so they needed woodcutters.</span> <span id="s1734">And I will tell that story, because there was a farmer, a French farmer, who needed a woodcutter.</span> <span id="s1735">We went to him and we said, “Monsieur and Madame,” whatever our name was, and he would like to be a woodcutter.</span> <span id="s1736">And the man said, he’s delighted.</span> <span id="s1737">And then we said, “ But this isn’t our real name, and we are really German in origin.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">Q: You said this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">A: We had to tell him that, because Paul needed papers on his real name if he ever would be able to get a visa to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">Q: You were already thinking of immigrating to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">A: The committee came around.</span> <span id="s1742">Always there were contracts.</span> <span id="s1743">And they said, ‘ There are possibilities, but we don’t know when.</span> <span id="s1744">And you must have some papers.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">Q: Did you think of Israel at all, as an alternative, with your sister being in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">A: It was impossible to go to Israel from France at that time.</span> <span id="s1747">There was no way.</span> <span id="s1748">We didn’t like the United States, especially.</span> <span id="s1749">We didn’t want to go at all.</span> <span id="s1750">We wanted to stay there and fight, but everybody said.</span> <span id="s1751">“There have to be witnesses, and this will be all overrun,” and lots of other things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">Q: Do you recall the name of the committee?</span> <span id="s1753">You call it the committee?</span> <span id="s1754">Did it have any kind of a name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">As: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1756">I cannot tell you which ones were the committee in Paris.</span> <span id="s1757">I will explain that to you.</span> <span id="s1758">But the committee that finally got us out, is the Unitarian Service Committee, and in New York, the Jewish Labor Committee -- it’s the Jewish labor group.</span> <span id="s1759">They were Socialists.</span> <span id="s1760">But they were Jewish -- Jewish Socialist labor unions.</span> <span id="s1761">It was all coming through the labor union.</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">Q: So in a way, you still kept your connections all the way through all of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">A: Oh, yes!</span> <span id="s1764">All the way!</span> <span id="s1765">It was always the labor unions.</span> <span id="s1766">Always!</span> <span id="s1767">That I have to say.</span> <span id="s1768">And that’s why we got out.</span> <span id="s1769">If you have no organization, you don’t get out.</span> <span id="s1770">But what I’m saying, Paul needed that name, and I have to say, we said to the man, “Now you can hand us back to the Germans,; because they’re coming there regularly.</span> <span id="s1771">And this man -- a little farmer in France, who had lost one leg, said, “This leg was shot off by a German bullet in the First World War.</span> <span id="s1772">But I can distinguish between those who are in power and those who are not, and you are against those.”</span> <span id="s1773">He said that.</span> <span id="s1774">And that’s a little French farmer.</span> <span id="s1775">I think we should remember that.</span> <span id="s1776">Anyhow, Paul was working in the woods, very hard, every day, back with bleeding hands, because it was cold.</span> <span id="s1777">No water.</span> <span id="s1778">No soap.</span> <span id="s1779">I cannot tell all these stories; there are lots of stories!</span> <span id="s1780">Then the news came that Roosevelt has appointed a special committee that sifts out people who are in real danger.</span> <span id="s1781">And there were visas given outside of the quota, to come over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1783">We have to explain that the background of this, is that the Evian Conference, and other things, had virtually closed immigration to almost anyone with a Polish or…particularly, there was a larger German quote, but that, obviously, was now closed, also, once the war started.</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1785">So it was all closed.</span> <span id="s1786">But Roosevelt had appointed that committee.</span> <span id="s1787">And meanwhile, there were again, the labor union people and some of the refugees that had gone out earlier, that together collected those lists.</span> <span id="s1788">We were little people, but we were on those lists.</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">Q: You were on the lists.</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">A: We wanted to get married in France, because it would have been easier to go over as a couple.</span> <span id="s1791">The village was delightful.</span> <span id="s1792">They already had the banners out.</span> <span id="s1793">But the man who had the say on that was the district attorney -- something like that.</span> <span id="s1794">He has to make the decision.</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">Q: I don’t know the French name for such an officer, but I know what you’re referring to.</span> <span id="s1796">He would be the Magistrat or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">A: And he was a Croix de feu, that are the French Nazis.</span> <span id="s1798">He was a French Nazi!</span> <span id="s1799">He said, “ I will not think of marrying a Jew and a non-Jew!</span> <span id="s1800">Because the Nazis will be in power, and I have no interest in having my name on their document like that.’</span> <span id="s1801">So we couldn’t even get married in France.</span> <span id="s1802">It’s unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1803">I mean, not even that was possible.</span> <span id="s1804">My visa came first.</span> <span id="s1805">I didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s1806">Paul said I had to go, because somehow the good fight has to be continued wherever we are.</span> <span id="s1807">The farmers did something that I will never forget.</span> <span id="s1808">They said to me, “You are afraid for him.</span> <span id="s1809">Come on, we show you something we haven’t shown anybody!”</span> <span id="s1810">and they took me into the woods, both of us, Paul and me, and we saw for the first time that the village had created an underground shelter -- totally hidden -- which was filled with food.</span> <span id="s1811">They said “ It’s for food for us, but there’s three people we know,” and we didn’t even know that they knew that about us, but we have learned, meanwhile, it’s you, it’s Paul, and…” there was a third one who was an Englishman.</span> <span id="s1812">“ And we’ll hide you there.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">Q: So this was your contingency.</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">A: So they said, “ You go to America!</span> <span id="s1815">Nothing will happen to him.</span> <span id="s1816">After the war he will come out.”</span> <span id="s1817">That kind of thing.</span> <span id="s1818">I didn’t want to, but I had to.</span> <span id="s1819">Very quick.</span> <span id="s1820">I went out in Spring, 1941.</span> <span id="s1821">I had to go over Spain.</span> <span id="s1822">I could still do that by train, which was unusual, but it was still possible.</span> <span id="s1823">We saw the starving children -- literally starving in the streets of Spain.</span> <span id="s1824">Madrid.</span> <span id="s1825">You asked me about my cultural interests.</span> <span id="s1826">We had not had much to eat.</span> <span id="s1827">I had one suit -- one blouse and one skirt --but I tell you one thing, I was in Madrid, and we had an overlay of 16 hours, I think, and I said, ‘ If I’m 16 hours in Madrid, I’m seeing the Prado.’</span> <span id="s1828">So that’s the way I’ve seen the Prado.</span> <span id="s1829">(Laughs) it’s very strange.</span> <span id="s1830">But anyhow, I saw the Prado.</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">Q: I think it’s wonderful now that they’ve actually put the “Guernica” of Picasso there.</span> <span id="s1832">This is an amazing thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">A: I have seen it!</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">Q: And I was lucky enough to have met the King of Spain last spring at the Harvard commencement.</span> <span id="s1835">And I shook his hand, and I said, “ I hope that the Jews will always now be pleased to shake his hand.”</span> <span id="s1836">He said that, yes, that Spain was actually going to come up with a new concordat.</span> <span id="s1837">Very, very attractive person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">A: Yes, I went over to Portugal.</span> <span id="s1839">We were warned by everybody that Portugal is a spy-nest, so you couldn’t talk in the streets.</span> <span id="s1840">We were distributed by the Unitarian Service Committee.</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">Q: They had sponsored you through the trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">A: Yes, through different places.</span> <span id="s1843">I saw several other people, not Paul.</span> <span id="s1844">I stayed with a woman who I still think is incredible.</span> <span id="s1845">She did not know one word of a language that I knew, and I did not know Portuguese.</span> <span id="s1846">But we communicated.</span> <span id="s1847">And she made me a dress -- that’s fantastic -- she could see that I had only that, so she made me a dress.</span> <span id="s1848">I got, in ’41, on a boat, the Nyassa, and I have found there are some other German refugees in social work around here who came on that boat.</span> <span id="s1849">But not at the same day.</span> <span id="s1850">It was a horrible trip, because it took, I think, over two weeks, and had to always zig zag, because there were mines.</span> <span id="s1851">It was filled to the brim, and we were all in the bottom of the boat, and I was sea-sick all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">Q: What was your destination, New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">A: New York, but this is the only place that people go from Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">Q: Who looked after you once you came into the city?</span> <span id="s1855">Was it the labor organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">A: Just a second, I have to say that, because on the boat was again a mixture of Jewish and non-Jewish refugees, I want to say one thing: The Unitarian Committee had got the notice that there was a list of the people who are most in danger -- and they needed that in New York, and they needed somebody to smuggle that out, and I am proud of the fact that they asked me to carry it.</span> <span id="s1857">It was very difficult, but they did a good job of hiding it.</span> <span id="s1858">I just feel good that I did that!</span> <span id="s1859">It’s the one thing I felt good about.</span> <span id="s1860">Now in New York, when we arrived, the people who really took care of us when we arrived, were these Jewish labor union people.</span> <span id="s1861">To me it looked like little old men and they were just so gentle and so kind.</span> <span id="s1862">But on the boat, just when we docked, came a swarm of journalists!</span> <span id="s1863">We were not used to that.</span> <span id="s1864">Most of us were hiding.</span> <span id="s1865">I was literally hiding under benches.</span> <span id="s1866">I didn’t want anybody to see, because there were still people over there.</span> <span id="s1867">They didn’t understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">Q: You didn’t want the publicity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">A: No!</span> <span id="s1870">And there were too many.</span> <span id="s1871">Our faces shouldn’t be shown, nothing.</span> <span id="s1872">That was very odd.</span> <span id="s1873">There were odd little things that I will not go into details, but that’s when I arrived.</span> <span id="s1874">I want to say that Paul had a much more dangerous voyage.</span> <span id="s1875">He got on a last boat, about, that was bound for Martinique and then to the United States.</span> <span id="s1876">But, on that boat were refugees, as well as Nazis, which they did not know first -- a contingent of Nazis.</span> <span id="s1877">And the Vichy government had made an arrangement with those Nazis, that in Martinique all these people would be arrested that were on the boat.</span> <span id="s1878">Nobody knew that.</span> <span id="s1879">They were on that boat.</span> <span id="s1880">Then we, in New York, suddenly heard that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">Q: When did he take this -- do you recall?</span> <span id="s1882">You were in New York about how long before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">A: I was there in spring, and Paul came, I think, in summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">Q: So it was maybe a few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">A: It’s just a few months later.</span> <span id="s1886">But we in New York, suddenly got the news that that particular boat was bombed by a Dutch Free Force that was under English flag.</span> <span id="s1887">That’s all we knew first.</span> <span id="s1888">I should say that Paul later told what we knew.</span> <span id="s1889">The Dutch had bombed the boat, and stopped it.</span> <span id="s1890">At that moment, those who were Nazis, began throwing things into the water.</span> <span id="s1891">Typewriters, all kinds of stuff.</span> <span id="s1892">The Dutch came in board and thought they had captured all Nazis.</span> <span id="s1893">Which doesn’t make it very good for the refugees, either.</span> <span id="s1894">Paul, fortunately, as I say, spoke that strange language that’s close to the Dutch, and explained to them what the situation was.</span> <span id="s1895">They took all of them to the northern part of South America -- I’d have to look it up -- the English had established there German prisoner of war camps.</span> <span id="s1896">They took all these people, and Paul always told me that the worst day of his life was when they got off the boat, because there were black people under the English, you know, who threw stones at them, because they thought they were all Nazis.</span> <span id="s1897">But they took them there, and they wanted to put them all into those camps.</span> <span id="s1898">There was this whole group of German refugees -- anti-Nazis -- and also with women and children, and they said, “ You do that, and it’s very simple.</span> <span id="s1899">Tomorrow morning, there is nobody alive.</span> <span id="s1900">We cut their throats, and they cut ours.</span> <span id="s1901">But we will not spend one night with these people.”</span> <span id="s1902">There was really that kind of desperate hate at that moment.</span> <span id="s1903">And the English separated them.</span> <span id="s1904">Then, at that time, Lord Halifax was the ambassador in New York.</span> <span id="s1905">In New York, again, the committee -- when I say “the committee,” it’s always the labor unions together with the Unitarians --that had all the names.</span> <span id="s1906">They were cabled there, and so after a while, they came to New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">Q: So that was from the list that you also had helped them with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">A: That list and other lists, yeah.</span> <span id="s1909">They came over.</span> <span id="s1910">And Paul and I got married, I think, after a week after he got here.</span> <span id="s1911">(Laughs) In New York.</span> <span id="s1912">There’s a lovely story, if you have a minute, I’ll give it to you.</span> <span id="s1913">You can read it in five minutes.</span> <span id="s1914">I wrote that for him for his 25th wedding anniversary, because it’s a beautiful story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">Q: I want to get a little bit of chronology clear right now.</span> <span id="s1916">After the marriage, you went to do graduate work at Pittsburgh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">A: Well, it’s not that simple.</span> <span id="s1918">There are refugee committees in New York, right?</span> <span id="s1919">You get transferred to refugee committees.</span> <span id="s1920">When I arrived, I was with a refugee committee, because I was Jewish, right?</span> <span id="s1921">I better not say that, but the social worker was impossible, but I don’t want to say that.</span> <span id="s1922">(Laughs) There were very bad experiences, actually.</span> <span id="s1923">When Paul and I got married, we were transferred to the non-Jewish refugee committee.</span> <span id="s1924">It’s ridiculous!</span> <span id="s1925">I had, meanwhile, found some work.</span> <span id="s1926">That means I worked twelve hours a day taking care of some old man.</span> <span id="s1927">It was fine.</span> <span id="s1928">I made a living.</span> <span id="s1929">But that particular refugee committee -- and I would have to look up the papers -- was very good.</span> <span id="s1930">They really sat down with us and discussed what we wanted to do.</span> <span id="s1931">Meanwhile, I had a friend in Cleveland who said, “ You know, you should go into social work.”</span> <span id="s1932">I said, “Heaven, no.</span> <span id="s1933">Not social work.”</span> <span id="s1934">She said, “ Well listen, there’s something new there that is called social group work, and it’s working with young people, and you like that, and you should study.”</span> <span id="s1935">Paul said, “ Gisela, you study, because you’re much farther ahead in university studies.”</span> <span id="s1936">So they arranged for us to go to Pittsburgh, and on a bus with six dollars between us, we went to Pittsburgh.</span> <span id="s1937">Got into a little room.</span> <span id="s1938">And there was -- My God, it was Family Service committee, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">Q: Possibly Jewish Family Service?</span></p> <p><span id="s1940">A: No, the regular one.</span> <span id="s1941">It was the regular city family service committee, but she was Jewish -- the social worker -- wonderful person.</span> <span id="s1942">So she gave me better ideas about social work than the other one.</span> <span id="s1943">Glick was her name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">Q: Did your mother know that you had married now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s1946">That finally went.</span> <span id="s1947">There was no correspondence through all those horrible war years.</span> <span id="s1948">Eight years are cut out of our lives, you know.</span> <span id="s1949">In fact, they got once a letter, and they still saved that, because it said, “Fished out of the channel in…” You know, and that was during that period.</span> <span id="s1950">But yes, mother lived with us.</span> <span id="s1951">She loved Paul, and there was just no question about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">Q: So she came to Pittsburgh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">A: No.</span> <span id="s1954">Mother came to visit us here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">Q: Once you were established in Minneapolis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">A: Pittsburgh is a different story.</span> <span id="s1957">Paul was an iron worker first, then a welder.</span> <span id="s1958">He’s very good at anything!</span> <span id="s1959">He can do anything with his hands!</span> <span id="s1960">Could do anything with his hands.</span> <span id="s1961">And then he went in the American Army for three years.</span> <span id="s1962">In another bombing in London.</span></p> <p><span id="s1963">Q: He was back in Europe during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">A: So we got separated again.</span> <span id="s1965">We were separated for eight years, and then again for three years.</span> <span id="s1966">But we wanted it!</span> <span id="s1967">We wanted to fight the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1968">And I, meanwhile, studied social work, and I gave a lot of speeches during the war about the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1969">Pittsburgh had a lot of Nazis.</span> <span id="s1970">Pittsburgh had Nazis, because there were lots of Germans.</span> <span id="s1971">And also many Yugoslavs were Nazis.</span> <span id="s1972">Very strange.</span> <span id="s1973">But there were also very good experiences in Pittsburgh.</span> <span id="s1974">I was placed my first year of field work at the Jewish Community Center.</span> <span id="s1975">I made it very clear that I don’t want to only work with Jews, but they were wonderful!</span> <span id="s1976">I don’t know whether you know the name of Miriam Ephraim.</span> <span id="s1977">She was one of the greatest, I think, in Jewish work.</span> <span id="s1978">Without question.</span> <span id="s1979">She later was a national -- one of the greatest.</span> <span id="s1980">She was superb!</span> <span id="s1981">She understood what I stood for.</span> <span id="s1982">I have never forgotten that Miriam Ephraim was the first one who gave me to read the Bill of Rights, among all the people.</span> <span id="s1983">And I said, “ My, God!”</span> <span id="s1984">No search, this kind of thing.</span> <span id="s1985">It was just beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">But Paul was very early in the Army, back again.</span> <span id="s1987">Because of that, also, we became very early United States citizens.</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">Q: Were you together sworn in as citizens?</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">A: Oh heavens, no.</span> <span id="s1990">Paul was in the Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">Q: So he, already, was a citizen to be in the Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">A: No, heaven no!</span> <span id="s1993">Americans know better.</span> <span id="s1994">Everybody who’s an immigrant in the United States, regardless whether they are citizens or not, when there is an induction into the Army -- are inducted into the Army -- you can refuse, but you never will be a citizen.</span> <span id="s1995">Anyhow, we wanted to fight those.</span> <span id="s1996">But no, he was not a citizen.</span> <span id="s1997">But before they went overseas, it was the custom to swear them in as citizens.</span> <span id="s1998">It was a much better idea, anyhow, because that way they had American passports.</span> <span id="s1999">I could become a citizen, then, a year later.</span> <span id="s2000">I became a citizen in Pittsburgh.</span> <span id="s2001">But when Paul came back from the Army in 1945 -- this is another long story.</span> <span id="s2002">I was meanwhile working at the J.F. I had spoken in many places, and then in ’47 they called me here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">Q: So this is where your academic appointment came in ’47.</span> <span id="s2004">So that’s how you came out to Minnesota.</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">A: Yes. ’</span> <span id="s2006">47.</span> <span id="s2007">And Paul came along.</span> <span id="s2008">It’s not only since women’s liberation that the husband comes along.</span> <span id="s2009">He said, “ Your father had bad eyes, so you’ll just come along.”</span> <span id="s2010">He has then worked as an engineer at General Mills.</span> <span id="s2011">We had no money when we came here.</span> <span id="s2012">We came to this place here with two suitcases.</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">Q: I’m sure you have speculated about why this happened in Germany rather than another country.</span> <span id="s2014">In a very cultured country.</span> <span id="s2015">People still try to explain, or understand this, why this movement should have grown in a country that had produced Schiller and Beethoven and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">A: And all these fantastic people in the time of the German Republic.</span> <span id="s2017">I think there’s several reasons.</span> <span id="s2018">One is that historically, certainly, there was a lot of anti-Semitism, earlier in Germany.</span> <span id="s2019">And I often think, as Germans, who are always very thorough about things, it was such a -- quote --“thoroughly” grounded philosophical --totally wrong, you understand -- but it was always in the literature.</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">Q: But they had a science that would give it a legitimacy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2021">A: It had the literature.</span> <span id="s2022">I think that’s one part.</span> <span id="s2023">But that doesn’t really explain that well.</span> <span id="s2024">I don’t think there are simple explanations.</span> <span id="s2025">They’re always complex explanations.</span> <span id="s2026">I think there were terrible economic situations.</span> <span id="s2027">There had been this incredible inflation.</span> <span id="s2028">And then this enormously high unemployment.</span> <span id="s2029">And people, I think, who are desperate, can be bought.</span></p> <p><span id="s2030">Q: It often makes me wonder, that if we had a terrible depression here, and a man on a white horse came up and said, “ I’ll give you jobs, it may not be the politics you like… but you’ll have a job.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2031">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s2032">I’ll tell you, that’s one thing that I always tell people, “ I am as afraid of unemployment as I am of war.”</span> <span id="s2033">Literally, when I walked in the street in Hamburg, I heard behind me two young men talk.</span> <span id="s2034">And one said,” I’ve just joined the SR” -- that’s before the Nazis came to power -- and the other one said, “ Yeah.”</span> <span id="s2035">And he said, “ I’m getting three marks a week that way.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">Q: So he sold his soul for three marks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">A: They sold them!</span> <span id="s2038">And then you make good-enough propaganda.</span> <span id="s2039">You make them feel that it’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">Q: Why do you think that if propaganda is thorough enough -- if the lie is big enough -- that people are capable of accepting, where they would know in detail that it’s something illogical, or that it doesn’t smell kosher, that they might be able to reject or resist it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">A: One wants to be comfortable.</span> <span id="s2042">And when one feels very down, which many people felt, it’s wonderful to have somebody to blame.</span> <span id="s2043">So you blame everything on the Jew, right?</span> <span id="s2044">And you blame everything on the intellectual, because it wasn’t only the Jew!</span> <span id="s2045">And you blame everything on the Socialists, and the Communists, and you have somebody to blame!</span> <span id="s2046">Right?</span> <span id="s2047">That’s number one.</span> <span id="s2048">I think, also, you can make propaganda, almost chisel it to a fine point.</span> <span id="s2049">I was sent back by the United States government, several times, after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">Q: And to help in the de-Nazification process.</span></p> <p><span id="s2051">A: Well, in helping a lot with the establishment of social services, youth services.</span> <span id="s2052">I was teaching teachers in schools of social work.</span> <span id="s2053">It was one of the most -- I could talk for hours about that -- a moving type of…</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">Q: And before the war, Germany had good youth services, did it not?</span></p> <p><span id="s2055">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2056">But it was moving experience, because they would come to me at night begging me forgiveness, and so on.</span> <span id="s2057">I remember one woman who said to me, “ I was good Catholic.</span> <span id="s2058">And I was very young…”</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">Q: Where were you when this happened?</span> <span id="s2060">Do you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">A: Near Dusseldorf.</span> <span id="s2062">She said to me -- she was a teacher in social work -- “I was a good Catholic, and I was very young!</span> <span id="s2063">I was maybe nineteen.</span> <span id="s2064">And we didn’t want to really believe everything that the Nazis were saying.</span> <span id="s2065">Then they got us together and they would play the Gregorian chants.</span> <span id="s2066">And they would say to them, “Can you hear that?</span> <span id="s2067">That’s about the same.</span> <span id="s2068">This is what the Jews have done.</span> <span id="s2069">They have brainwashed you!</span> <span id="s2070">It’s their music that they have… With that they have brainwashed you!</span> <span id="s2071">Your music is just Jewish music.</span> <span id="s2072">And you see, this is the way they have done it.</span> <span id="s2073">They insidiously have always lied to you.”</span> <span id="s2074">And she said, “ We began to believe it, it was so incredible!”</span> <span id="s2075">I’m just giving you that as an example.</span> <span id="s2076">I have a book by Masserman that’s very interesting -- it’s written in Germany.</span> <span id="s2077">It’s called Fatsich, “No Justification.”</span> <span id="s2078">It’s unbelievable what they would tell young people -- you know, the lies, and the insidious way.</span> <span id="s2079">I think, one is that people are down, second is everybody wants to have an enemy that makes life so simple.</span></p> <p><span id="s2080">Q: It does make it simpler if you objectify all of your anguish.</span></p> <p><span id="s2081">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s2082">I think that’s the second.</span> <span id="s2083">I think the third is that they called on something that is in many ways quite human, and that is the wish to be very important--strong!</span> <span id="s2084">You know, a strong Germany!</span> <span id="s2085">A very wonderful Germany!</span> <span id="s2086">Better than anything else, you know.</span> <span id="s2087">Then you feel that you are part of that.</span> <span id="s2088">The last thing is, I always say, in any country; If you suddenly give power to the murderers, the sadists, the ones you put in prisons, you have a whole army I’m afraid ready made.</span> <span id="s2089">And this I’m not inventing.</span> <span id="s2090">I’ve seen it.</span> <span id="s2091">They were the people you would have otherwise have behind lock and key.</span> <span id="s2092">But you don’t only let them free!</span> <span id="s2093">You give them the power.</span> <span id="s2094">You say, you are the one who’s right.</span> <span id="s2095">So I think all these things together make it.</span> <span id="s2096">I don’t believe that it would happen only in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">Q: So you don’t feel that there’s a special human nature that applies to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">A: No, I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2099">Q: We’re all capable of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s2100">A: I’ve seen too many Germans who fought them, right?</span> <span id="s2101">I know a lot who fought them.</span> <span id="s2102">And lots of them who died.</span> <span id="s2103">And I have to say, no!</span> <span id="s2104">I don’t say it’s only German.</span> <span id="s2105">I think in their history.</span> <span id="s2106">There have been too many periods, for instance, of overwhelming authority.</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">Q: Americans like to forget, too, that we too, have pro-fascist movements.</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">A: Oh my God, and we still have them!</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">Q: In the ‘30s we had many, many, important big movements.</span> <span id="s2110">The Silver Shirts.</span> <span id="s2111">There was Father Coughlin, and Gerald L.K. Smith.</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">A: The things that have been done to blacks in America is not less sadistic.</span> <span id="s2113">And it was justified by, “These are not people!”</span> <span id="s2114">Jews were not people!</span> <span id="s2115">“They’re just vermin!</span> <span id="s2116">You have to exterminate!”</span> <span id="s2117">That’s what you have to know.</span> <span id="s2118">That’s what they are told, you know.</span> <span id="s2119">It’s horrible.</span> <span id="s2120">I can give you symbols.</span> <span id="s2121">I’m very interested in this.</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">Q: You said your father became more religious as he grew older.</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">A: More practicing, I always say.</span></p> <p><span id="s2124">Q: In other words, he went to shul more frequently.</span></p> <p><span id="s2125">A: Oh, he always did that anyhow.</span> <span id="s2126">He always was observant.</span> <span id="s2127">I always say, “I know all the rules and regulations.”</span> <span id="s2128">(Laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">Q: But you feel he retained his idealism -- his Socialist vision -- to the very end?</span></p> <p><span id="s2130">A: Yes and no.</span> <span id="s2131">How can I say this…Yes, but he was also getting bitter, and bitter, and more bitter.</span> <span id="s2132">Then when the Nazis came, he was just almost wiped out.</span> <span id="s2133">“How can they do this!”</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">Q: How did you and Paul react to the creation of Israel?</span> <span id="s2135">From your Socialist standpoint, I imagine there were some confusions about whether this was a good thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">A: I personally am an internationalist.</span> <span id="s2137">I have always said I was not a Zionist and I will never be.</span> <span id="s2138">I have respect for what, especially, the people in the kibbutzim did, because I think they wanted to create an ideal state.</span> <span id="s2139">I don’t think they succeeded.</span> <span id="s2140">I finally said, “Well, since they did it, they did it.”</span> <span id="s2141">From that moment on, you don’t want to have that little country go to the ground, either, because they’re human beings there, you know.</span> <span id="s2142">But I can’t say that I’m totally identified.</span> <span id="s2143">Interesting enough, Paul has always been much more pro-Israel than I.</span> <span id="s2144">These beautiful statues are all done by Paul.</span></p> <p><span id="s2145">Q: In the living room of Dr. Konopka’s home, there are these beautiful small figures of all kinds.</span> <span id="s2146">I’m looking at a wooden -- looks like teak or something -- a very hard wood.</span> <span id="s2147">Strong hands clasping a column -- two arms.</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">A: Two arms who are really starving.</span> <span id="s2149">Starving to death.</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">Q: With the fingers open.</span> <span id="s2151">In a pleading gesture.</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">A: Yes, starving hands.</span> <span id="s2153">And it is clear when that is done.</span> <span id="s2154">It’s December, 1973.</span> <span id="s2155">Paul did that when Israel got into this horrible war.</span> <span id="s2156">You know that very short war?</span> <span id="s2157">And I said, “ What are you doing?”</span> <span id="s2158">He said, “ Gise, to me that represents that I am so angry that people care more for oil than for human beings.</span> <span id="s2159">That war is fought against Israel because of oil, and nobody cares.</span> <span id="s2160">So I want that as a memory to it.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">Q: That’s a very fine piece, I think.</span> <span id="s2162">It’s about a foot-and-a-half high.</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">A: But this is interesting.</span> <span id="s2164">He felt, in some ways, more identified.</span> <span id="s2165">He has been with me to Israel.</span> <span id="s2166">We have visited quite often.</span> <span id="s2167">And I have to say that my cousins, whom I love, in Israel -- in the kibbutzim -- loved him.</span> <span id="s2168">I had a cousin in Jerusalem, who is not alive anymore, but they were especially fond of Paul.</span> <span id="s2169">Because Paul had a sense of great love, but it was the love of the persecuted.</span> <span id="s2170">Is that clear?</span> <span id="s2171">Not necessarily that it became a new nation, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">Q: Think about this for a minute, if you would.</span> <span id="s2173">Your own Jewish identity.</span> <span id="s2174">After all, you grew up in a tradition.</span> <span id="s2175">You saw the catastrophe.</span> <span id="s2176">You were part of that.</span> <span id="s2177">As you said, eight years, almost of your life.</span> <span id="s2178">Involved in it -- that stopped your growth -- when I say “stopped your growth” it was an interruption, of just surviving from one minute to the next doing things, trying to help.</span> <span id="s2179">How do you feel now about human nature in general?</span> <span id="s2180">After all, I’m asking this of a very well-known social worker and professor -- maybe it’s not a fair question.</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">A: It’s a fair question, but it’s a complicated question.</span> <span id="s2182">I wrote a book on philosophy -- with Lindeman, on Social Work Philosophy --which includes a lot of my philosophy.</span> <span id="s2183">But it was written in 1954, so maybe I have changed.</span> <span id="s2184">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2185">And it’s not easy to say, though many people have asked me.</span> <span id="s2186">First of all -- and I stole that from something I once saw somewhere -- “ I’m a Jew by discrimination.”</span> <span id="s2187">I will always admit loud and clear that I am Jewish, because I will never deny something that has made me, in other eyes, something inferior -- which I’m not.</span> <span id="s2188">That means I feel that very strongly.</span> <span id="s2189">Religiously, it’s much more complex!</span> <span id="s2190">I have a long struggle, since the age of 17, when I struggled that out with my father and the rabbi.</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">Q: So you made your declaration of independence when you were very young.</span></p> <p><span id="s2192">A: Very early.</span> <span id="s2193">I’m not someone who just throws away these things.</span> <span id="s2194">I’ve often said, “I’m religious, but I’m not denominational.”</span> <span id="s2195">Maybe that’s the way to put it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2196">Q: How about the children?</span> <span id="s2197">Your children, and…</span></p> <p><span id="s2198">A: I don’t have children of my own.</span> <span id="s2199">That means I have had lots of children, but not children I have borne.</span> <span id="s2200">I think that if I would have had children, both Paul and I always felt that we are not in disagreement in any of our basic philosophy, so they wouldn’t have had any problems with that.</span> <span id="s2201">We recognized the basic need -- now this sounds sentimental, but I don’t mean it sentimental -- for love and acceptance in the world.</span> <span id="s2202">I think that’s available in all religions, almost.</span></p> <p><span id="s2203">Q: For validation.</span> <span id="s2204">Some kind of validation</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s2206">We both did not believe that rules and regulations make a religion.</span> <span id="s2207">So we probably wouldn’t have raised our children with a lot of traditions.</span> <span id="s2208">I have to say that.</span> <span id="s2209">I find some traditions beautiful, and I would let them know about them.</span> <span id="s2210">I have met many of my young American friends, and I always say -- some of them who are Jewish -- and I say, ‘ It’s a pity you don’t know any of these things!</span> <span id="s2211">You should know them!</span> <span id="s2212">But I think you should also know about the religious things that…” I read a lot about the Hopi religion.</span> <span id="s2213">What I’m saying is I think one should know.</span> <span id="s2214">I do not accept rules and regulations as making a religion.</span> <span id="s2215">I think, to me, there is a basic need to understand the incredible dignity of the human being -- the incredible, amazing creation of something like the human being, that I think can be devilish, and can be wonderful.</span> <span id="s2216">People have often asked me after my experiences, how can I still believe in human beings.</span> <span id="s2217">I’ve seen beautiful things.</span> <span id="s2218">I don’t know whether I have told them all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2219">Q: You’ve mentioned some, even in the midst of horror!</span> <span id="s2220">That people have been decent.</span></p> <p><span id="s2221">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s2222">I was recently in Holland where I was lecturing, and the man who asked me to lecture there.</span> <span id="s2223">I had no idea, was a three-year-old, in a concentration camp and was not a Jew.</span> <span id="s2224">And was separated from his mother!</span> <span id="s2225">Was a child!</span> <span id="s2226">Wandering in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2227">The Dutch.</span> <span id="s2228">Just incredible!</span> <span id="s2229">And he was three and four and five.</span> <span id="s2230">And I said, ‘ This is unbelievable!”</span> <span id="s2231">He says, ‘ I’ll tell you something.</span> <span id="s2232">I remember the horror and the way I was crying, because I saw all these dead people -- saw ‘em on a heap.’</span> <span id="s2233">And he says, “ you know what I also remember?</span> <span id="s2234">Little old faces looking into my eyes and little old hands wiping my bottom.</span> <span id="s2235">They were all Jews.’</span></p> <p><span id="s2236">Q: Looking after him as best they could.</span></p> <p><span id="s2237">A: Then he says, “ They were probably not so old, but to me, these were little old fasces.</span> <span id="s2238">And taking care of me.”</span> <span id="s2239">He happens to be a very practicing Catholic today.</span> <span id="s2240">But he says, “ The religion came to me through that experience.”</span> <span id="s2241">So I don’t see religion as just belonging to one kind.</span> <span id="s2242">But I do know the Jewish tradition.</span> <span id="s2243">As I say, I’m not a Zionist.</span> <span id="s2244">And perhaps what I have to say, when groups say, “ I’m proud!</span> <span id="s2245">I’m proud to be Polish!</span> <span id="s2246">I’m proud to be German!</span> <span id="s2247">I’m proud to be Catholic!</span> <span id="s2248">I’m proud to be Jew!”</span> <span id="s2249">I say, “Nonsense!”</span> <span id="s2250">I wish that people can be proud of their goodness -- or at least that they try to be good.</span> <span id="s2251">That’s all we can do.</span> <span id="s2252">And that’s the way I see it!</span> <span id="s2253">But I will always say, I am a Jew, because that’s the way I am born!</span></p> <p><span id="s2254">Q: Do you think there’s anything that can be learned?</span> <span id="s2255">A lot of people deny that.</span> <span id="s2256">They feel the Holocaust is such an unique event, that the Nazi period, however they define it, as modern totalitarianism and using the machinery of the state to destroy groups that any sane person knew were helpless, that this doesn’t teach us anything, really!</span></p> <p><span id="s2257">A: It does.</span> <span id="s2258">And it also isn’t that unique.</span> <span id="s2259">The only thing that’s unique is we only think of ourselves.</span> <span id="s2260">We have the same kind of horrors being committed against blacks -- and children -- separating them, killing them like little flies.</span> <span id="s2261">Right!</span> <span id="s2262">It has happened!</span> <span id="s2263">I don’t say it happens today, but it has happened.</span> <span id="s2264">I think in modern history, it’s the only one, and maybe the one piece that I, perhaps, think is history, it’s the only one, and maybe the one piece that I, perhaps, think is German, is the orderliness of it.</span> <span id="s2265">Which is terrifying!</span> <span id="s2266">You know, this cleanliness.</span></p> <p><span id="s2267">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2268">Everything has to be cleaned up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2269">A: It’s all orderly.</span> <span id="s2270">And this is terrifying.</span> <span id="s2271">But no, demeaning of people, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s2272">Has happened.</span> <span id="s2273">I think what we can learn…a lot of things we should learn.</span> <span id="s2274">One is to raise children, from the beginning, not in obedience.</span> <span id="s2275">I am a fighter against obedience!</span> <span id="s2276">That sounds strange.</span></p> <p><span id="s2277">Q: In other words, if you see a child that is too rigidly over behaving, you sense something is wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s2278">A: You know that my special interest is in children in institutions?</span> <span id="s2279">When I look at these delinquency institutions, all they do is train them to be obedient!</span></p> <p><span id="s2280">Q: which is just an outward conformity of behavior.</span></p> <p><span id="s2281">A: And they will be obedient to anybody who will sing the Piper’s song one day.</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">Q: So if there would happen to be someone who would be over them in an authoritarian position, they would obey whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s2283">A: If we want to keep a sane--democratic, or whatever we want to call it--society, we must not raise people just being obedient.</span> <span id="s2284">Eichmann, I quote it all the time, said it at his trial, “Until May,” -- whatever he was when he was captured -- “I have always believed that one has to be obedient.”</span> <span id="s2285">They believed that!</span> <span id="s2286">And that’s number one.</span> <span id="s2287">The second thing we have to learn is that you must inform people.</span> <span id="s2288">I still think a free press is, to me, the greatest guarantee of a free society.</span> <span id="s2289">We must keep it alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s2290">Q: So that means we have to tolerate obnoxious opinions.</span></p> <p><span id="s2291">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2292">I have great difficulties with it.</span> <span id="s2293">I think some opinions are terribly obnoxious.</span> <span id="s2294">But I don’t wasn’t only opinion.</span> <span id="s2295">I want facts!</span> <span id="s2296">When people have come to me with very definite opinions, I say, “ Alright, what are the facts that are underlying this?”</span> <span id="s2297">I think the third is you have to raise human beings with a philosophy of ethics -- or whatever we want to call it -- and if it’s Judaism, wonderful, because it has a basic ethic.</span> <span id="s2298">And if it’s Christianity, it has a basic ethic.</span> <span id="s2299">But we have to raise people with a conscience.</span> <span id="s2300">You can’t just say there are no values.</span> <span id="s2301">You don’t press values on them.</span> <span id="s2302">You just let them think.</span> <span id="s2303">I think that’s what helped me!</span> <span id="s2304">My father was fighting me when I said, “ I don’t believe in this and all that.”</span> <span id="s2305">But at least, somehow, it was possible for me to think these things through.</span></p> <p><span id="s2306">Q: Yes, and you felt, maybe, that even in your rebellion, you were rebelling against an authentic person.</span></p> <p><span id="s2307">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s2308">Exactly.</span> <span id="s2309">So I think there are many things that we learn from that.</span> <span id="s2310">And to be very watchful when these things start up again.</span> <span id="s2311">Where was it where I thought I was really kind of pleased.</span> <span id="s2312">It wasn’t very recent.</span> <span id="s2313">I didn’t have time to go, but I think the Anti-Defamation League had a meeting together with the black community.</span> <span id="s2314">It was quite recent.</span> <span id="s2315">I like that.</span> <span id="s2316">I think the bridging of those who are very often discriminated against, is very important.</span> <span id="s2317">The divide and conquer is done to kill off people.</span> <span id="s2318">So, I think we can learn a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2319">Q: Is there anything you want to add at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s2320">A: No, at the end, I’ll probably think half the things I want to say I haven’t said.</span></p> <p><span id="s2321">A: Well, this has been extraordinarily informative for me, I must say…</span></p> <p><span id="s2322">A: And for me, I tell you what, it’s hard, but at the same time, I’m glad I can do it.</span> <span id="s2323">When the 40-years Nazis were, I asked once to speak publicly, and I did.</span> <span id="s2324">‘Cause I felt very strongly that I must let the lies be fought, It wasn’t only the Jews that were…Everybody who had a decent thought.</span> <span id="s2325">The Nazi philosophy – it’s insidious!</span></p> <p><span id="s2326">Q: You mentioned Jehovah’s Witnesses.</span> <span id="s2327">You saw the persecution of others.</span></p> <p><span id="s2328">A: The Socialists.</span> <span id="s2329">The lie that nobody fought, that they all just went to the slaughter.</span> <span id="s2330">It’s not true.</span> <span id="s2331">It’s not one nation.</span> <span id="s2332">There were good Germans, you know.</span> <span id="s2333">We have to fight these things!</span> <span id="s2334">Because otherwise, we will become like they.</span> <span id="s2335">I don’t want us to become like they.</span></p> <p><span id="s2336">Q; So in a way, you’re saying that we’ve got to be careful not to develop our own lies about the past.</span></p> <p><span id="s2337">A: Right!</span> <span id="s2338">I’m very afraid of that.</span> <span id="s2339">I know that we always are that way.</span> <span id="s2340">It hurts me more when a Jew is prejudiced than when anybody else is prejudiced.</span> <span id="s2341">I always say, “ Not you!</span> <span id="s2342">We mustn’t do that.</span> <span id="s2343">We just can’t do that.”</span> <span id="s2344">We can’t become like they.</span> <span id="s2345">I don’t want that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2346">Q: And this has been a common criticism, too, that there are many people who in order to fight and survive, become, in some ways, like their persecutors.</span></p> <p><span id="s2347">A: I know.</span> <span id="s2348">I couldn’t believe it!</span> <span id="s2349">I saw people coming out of the concentration camps -- oh, hating!</span></p> <p><span id="s2350">Q: Well I heard a very interesting response that I’d like your comment on.</span> <span id="s2351">I only heard this second-hand, not first-hand.</span> <span id="s2352">A young man said that he’d asked his father why he’s never told him about these experiences in the war, and the father said, “ Because I don’t want to pass my hates onto you,” he said, “ I was silent for this reason.’</span></p> <p><span id="s2353">A: But silent isn’t enough.</span> <span id="s2354">They should talk.</span> <span id="s2355">I have talked a lot about the Nazi period.</span> <span id="s2356">My sister until today in Israel, will not tell anything .</span> <span id="s2357">Not how she felt.</span> <span id="s2358">Her son has never known anything if I hadn’t told him.</span> <span id="s2359">Many people I saw in Israel who don’t want to talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2360">Q: they feel that they’re trapped, in a way, in an ideology of…</span></p> <p><span id="s2361">A: Part of that had a real hate!</span> <span id="s2362">I talked with somebody in German in the streets of Tel Aviv and somebody was almost spitting at us.</span> <span id="s2363">Certainly we were both Jews (Laughs) who were talking to each other, (Laughs) and I understood it.</span> <span id="s2364">A woman who must have lived through horrors.</span> <span id="s2365">It’s not that I don’t understand it.</span> <span id="s2366">It’s just that I wish it wouldn’t be that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2367">Q; So some of them just have different copying mechanisms.</span> <span id="s2368">Your wish is that they could have come through -- and many have -- with…</span></p> <p><span id="s2369">A: Many have, many have.</span> <span id="s2370">I have known wonderful people.</span> <span id="s2371">And I also want to say, “ I’m not only talking about the ones who have gone through it.</span> <span id="s2372">‘ When you say, “How do you prevent it -- the next one?”</span> <span id="s2373">Let’s not start all that hate against people.</span> <span id="s2374">It’s harmful.</span> <span id="s2375">It’s not good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2376">Q: I want to thank you very much for taking the time with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2377">A: Well, I want to thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2378">PAGE</span></p> <p><span
