Snyderman (This is May Day and we're not celebrating!</span> <span id="s14">Let me begin by asking you what your earliest memories are growing up in Minsk.</span> <span id="s15">Who lived in your home with you?)</span> <span id="s16">From childhood?</span> <span id="s17">I was in the family.</span> <span id="s18">It was really nice, a really friendly family.</span> <span id="s19">I was the second child in my family.</span> <span id="s20">The difference between me and my sister is almost thirteen years.</span> <span id="s21">When I was born my mother was thirty-six and my father was almost forty-two.</span> <span id="s22">Can you imagine!</span> <span id="s23">It was a really special feeling they gave me and probably received from me too.</span> <span id="s24">They were really wonderful, interesting educated people.</span> <span id="s25">Both of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">My mother was a really strong woman and she graduated from two universities.</span> <span id="s27">She graduated from the university as a chemistry teacher, and then she decided that she couldn't live without medicine, and she graduated from medical school.</span> <span id="s28">After this she was a really good, famous doctor in Minsk.</span> <span id="s29">(What kind of medicine?)</span> <span id="s30">She was working on the delivery of babies.</span> <span id="s31">She was not a gynecologist.</span> <span id="s32">She was some special kind of physician.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">It was really interesting about her life and about her work because she was one of the first doctors in Minsk who established the small department, a women's department.</span> <span id="s34">Maybe for America it's really strange.</span> <span id="s35">But in Russia it was not strange; it was painful, because a woman who has a heart problem, they couldn't deliver the baby, and it was really painful for these women.</span> <span id="s36">My mom, she researched a lot of things and she found out that it's possible, and she established a small hospital, maybe for only eight people, and there was a huge line of women with this problem who wanted to have a baby, and my mom followed their health from the first months of pregnancy to their delivery.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">(So these are women who have a history of difficulty in the delivery of babies?)</span> <span id="s38">Not in delivery of babies.</span> <span id="s39">This woman has heart problems.</span> <span id="s40">(So because they had heart problems...) ...they couldn't deliver a baby.</span> <span id="s41">Any time they were pregnant, they should abort their pregnancy, and my mom, she found out...</span></p> <p><span id="s42">She couldn't have a Ph.D. in this field, she was ready to do it, but this was Russia and she was Jewish and she couldn't do it.</span> <span id="s43">It was really difficult for her.</span> <span id="s44">But her boss in this medical office was a really clever woman.</span> <span id="s45">She permitted her to have one room for eight women.</span> <span id="s46">She knew each woman and knew she had a heart problem, and she followed this woman about her health and how she's doing a lot of things.</span> <span id="s47">She decided if it was possible that this woman could be pregnant and deliver a child, or not.</span> <span id="s48">It was really difficult for her, but she did the best.</span> <span id="s49">A lot of women who were able to give birth, their daughters were given my mom's name.</span> <span id="s50">It was really not only interesting for her, it was all her life.</span> <span id="s51">It was a really hard job.</span> <span id="s52">She was unbelievable in this.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">(So I understand that 8 women were her patients?)</span> <span id="s54">I'm sorry, eight beds in this room.</span> <span id="s55">Only eight women could do it at one time.</span> <span id="s56">A lot of women needed it, but she didn't have the place for all the women with heart problem who wanted to have a child.</span> <span id="s57">In one time she can work only with eight women.</span> <span id="s58">Only eight.</span> <span id="s59">It was a very small room.</span> <span id="s60">In Russia it was the most important medical office in Byelorussia and they permitted her to do it.</span> <span id="s61">It was illegal, but she did it because she was really involved in her work and for her it was really important.</span> <span id="s62">And can you imagine that she graduated from medical school when my sister was four years old, and it was during World War II!</span></p> <p><span id="s63">(So who took care of your sister?)</span> <span id="s64">My mother and my grandmother.</span> <span id="s65">My mother had a sister.</span> <span id="s66">She is alive now and is a doctor too.</span> <span id="s67">My aunt is a wonderful woman.</span> <span id="s68">They were really devoted to each other my aunt and my mother.</span> <span id="s69">After the death of my mom, all cared about me.</span> <span id="s70">My mother was truly a wonderful woman too.</span> <span id="s71">They graduated medical school together.</span> <span id="s72">It was really hard, but it was her dream.</span> <span id="s73">She managed with this.</span> <span id="s74">She didn't graduate during World War II, it was maybe two or three years after her medical school.</span> <span id="s75">In Russia medical school was six years.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">(What was your father's occupation?)</span> <span id="s77">He was the chief of a huge engineering building company.</span> <span id="s78">Maybe it's called something else in America.</span> <span id="s79">He was a building engineer.</span> <span id="s80">(A construction engineer?)</span> <span id="s81">Yes.</span> <span id="s82">He was really good in his occupation.</span> <span id="s83">In Russia for a Jewish man to have such a kind of position it was not easy.</span> <span id="s84">It was really his respect and everything.</span> <span id="s85">He was really energetic.</span> <span id="s86">He was older than my mom.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">They had a really interesting story because he dated my mother seven years.</span> <span id="s88">She lived in Gomel and he lived in Minsk.</span> <span id="s89">Every weekend he would go from Minsk to Gomel.</span> <span id="s90">Then my grandmother didn't permit my mother to marry him because it was maybe some kind of reason because,... Maybe in America it's the same way, because my mother's family as I heard, it was a little higher level of education than the level of my father's family.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">My grandfather was a doctor.</span> <span id="s92">He graduated from St. Petersburg University, now Leningrad University.</span> <span id="s93">My grandmother was a chemistry teacher.</span> <span id="s94">They had really high level of education for those times before World War II.</span> <span id="s95">But now my mother has two brothers and one of the brothers died five years ago.</span> <span id="s96">He was a really good lawyer, famous in Minsk.</span> <span id="s97">All their family had a little higher education than the family of my father.</span> <span id="s98">My father had two brothers and a sister.</span> <span id="s99">And his family died in a ghetto during the war.</span> <span id="s100">The Minsk ghetto during World War II.</span> <span id="s101">Minsk was a really anti-semitic city.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">When the fascists came to Minsk, the first thing they did, they took some special place for Jewish people.</span> <span id="s103">(We call them interment camps or concentration camps.)</span> <span id="s104">In Russian it's called the getto.</span> <span id="s105">It was a terrible place and a lot of people were killed in this ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">My father was in World War II.</span> <span id="s107">Two of his brothers were in the war, too.</span> <span id="s108">His younger sister was only sixteen, and his parents and uncles and aunts, all the part of his family lived in Minsk.</span> <span id="s109">And just as almost any Jewish person who lived in Minsk had all this family, they were sent to the ghetto, and one day when my father came to help them to move to the forest.</span> <span id="s110">It was some kind of place when he was going to save them.</span> <span id="s111">They were killed one hour before he came.</span> <span id="s112">In my family it was some kind of... In my family it was some kind of... I don't know how to explain... nobody in my family has red hair, only Helen, my father's sister.</span> <span id="s113">I remember that my father told me it was interesting that only she had red hair, and now my daughter, Helen, has red hair.</span> <span id="s114">Life was not easy for the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">My mother had a really interesting story about her family.</span> <span id="s116">Her father was a doctor.</span> <span id="s117">If you know, in 1937, it was a really hard time, not only for Jewish people, for a lot of educated people.</span> <span id="s118">Stalin sent them to the special concentration camps.</span> <span id="s119">Or they were under arrest and were in the prison.</span> <span id="s120">My grandfather from my mother's side, he was under arrest.</span> <span id="s121">Nobody knew why, nobody knew the reason.</span> <span id="s122">It was without any explanation.</span> <span id="s123">My mother's grandmother she lived with four children alone when my grandfather was in the prison.</span> <span id="s124">I remember the story from my grandmother.</span> <span id="s125">It was a really hard time.</span> <span id="s126">My grandmother died when she was only 47 years old.</span> <span id="s127">My mother was the oldest in their family.</span> <span id="s128">Her sister and two brothers were with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">(Your mother's father never returned from the prison?)</span> <span id="s130">No, my grandfather returned from prison after his wife died.</span> <span id="s131">(They released him from prison after she died?)</span> <span id="s132">They released him after prison, but he was in prison ten years.</span> <span id="s133">My mother told me that it was hard for them because, for example, one day in the month they can give him some kind of food, small mail.</span> <span id="s134">One time, the person said, "We don't know where he is.</span> <span id="s135">We don't know."</span> <span id="s136">Five or six years they didn't know where he was.</span> <span id="s137">And when he came home, he was really sick.</span> <span id="s138">He had two heart attacks in prison.</span> <span id="s139">He was a young man, and a wonderful man.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">I remember my grandfather because when he died I was almost eleven.</span> <span id="s141">He lived with us, with my mother.</span> <span id="s142">He was a really special man.</span> <span id="s143">He knew a lot of things, and he told us about a lot of interesting facts, about museums, and other places of interest.</span> <span id="s144">He had a high level of education.</span> <span id="s145">He was really sick after prison.</span> <span id="s146">He never spoke with his grandchildren about prison.</span> <span id="s147">But after some time, I remember they closed the door and he spoke with my mother, his daughter, and with his sons about it.</span> <span id="s148">It was really painful memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">(So you were spared those stories?)</span> <span id="s150">I didn't know exactly what he felt, but I could take a guess about his feeling because it was really painful for him because it was for nothing.</span> <span id="s151">For nothing.</span> <span id="s152">(So he was released because your grandmother died?)</span> <span id="s153">We don't know.</span> <span id="s154">It was without explanation.</span> <span id="s155">My mother told every time that they are really lucky that he could go home.</span> <span id="s156">A lot of people couldn't do it.</span> <span id="s157">They had really good relationship between each other and between his grandfather, and, for example, I and my sister.</span> <span id="s158">We grew up in a really good, really nice, really Jewish atmosphere.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">My parents were really devoted to their family.</span> <span id="s160">Because my mother was the oldest in the family.</span> <span id="s161">My father was the oldest among his brothers.</span> <span id="s162">Can you imagine, when my father and mother were married, they lived together in one room with mother's sister, two brothers and grandfather.</span> <span id="s163">All of them lived together, because my father couldn't live without his brothers.</span> <span id="s164">He was responsible for their future.</span> <span id="s165">My mother did the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">(How many people?)</span> <span id="s167">My parents, three from mother's side, and two from father's side.</span> <span id="s168">But it's really interesting and only now I can imagine that after my father's and mother's death, my relatives on both sides are really friendly to each other.</span> <span id="s169">They grew up together.</span> <span id="s170">They have all life together, and all our children, their grandchildren.</span> <span id="s171">It was one huge family that celebrated together.</span> <span id="s172">Now, for example, there are some sad days for my mother's and father's deaths.</span> <span id="s173">All the relatives and their children and their grandchildren and their inlaws and everybody, we went to the cemetery, it was memory day.</span> <span id="s174">It was nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">(You observed the Jewish anniversary of their deaths and you went to the cemetery.</span> <span id="s176">What other Jewish traditions were you observing?</span> <span id="s177">You said that you were raised with the feeling of Jewishness?)</span> <span id="s178">We felt Jewishness because my father had a really good position in Russia, and my mother was a really good physician.</span> <span id="s179">My father went to Jewish school before World War II.</span> <span id="s180">He knew Yiddish really well.</span> <span id="s181">My mother didn't know anything, but she understood.</span> <span id="s182">Sometimes when they wanted to hide something from us, my father spoke Yiddish, my mother answered in Russian.</span> <span id="s183">We understood everything!</span> <span id="s184">When I was maybe three or four years old, he said, "We're speaking Chinese."</span> <span id="s185">But the Jewish atmosphere I felt from another side.</span> <span id="s186">My father was really a man of action, not a calm man.</span> <span id="s187">I could never remember him to sit to watch tv never.</span> <span id="s188">All the time he was really involved in doing all kinds of business.</span> <span id="s189">I remember this and maybe five times I talked to my children about it.</span> <span id="s190">Maybe the reason isn't only that his parents were in the ghetto it was maybe another reason from their feeling.</span> <span id="s191">A lot of Jewish people were killed in Minsk.</span> <span id="s192">The Byelorussian government didn't permit them to put a monument in Minsk devoted to the people who were killed in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s193">They told them, "Okay, you can do it, but only with your money and your skills.</span> <span id="s194">We didn't give you any money."</span> <span id="s195">And my father, he was a boss, and he was really impressed after this, and he decided Okay.</span> <span id="s196">We created a committee and collected money from people, and it was probably... I was lucky, because I grew up in a really interesting atmosphere.</span> <span id="s197">A lot of people came from different cities and places in Byelorussia.</span> <span id="s198">They came to our home and brought the money.</span> <span id="s199">If he could bring ten rubles, it was Okay.</span> <span id="s200">If it he could bring 10,000 rubles, it was Okay too.</span> <span id="s201">My father kept track of every person who came, in this book.</span> <span id="s202">He kept a lot of cards and told people about it.</span> <span id="s203">It was really a huge dream of people who came to our house and who brought money.</span> <span id="s204">My uncles and aunts everybody was involved in this.</span> <span id="s205">We children were involved too because we didn't have an answering machine and we didn't have any automatic equipment, and we put down every person who called us and who wanted to bring money or wanted to send money.</span> <span id="s206">It was really a special feeling.</span> <span id="s207">We collected money, and they put a monument.</span> <span id="s208">It was really beautiful.</span> <span id="s209">It was not huge, a small monument.</span> <span id="s210">And these people were killed in, how to explain, not in the plain ground.</span> <span id="s211">It was some kind of lake, but without water.</span> <span id="s212">(Like a river bed?)</span> <span id="s213">Yes, like a river bed.</span> <span id="s214">It was dry, but not in the same level as the ground.</span> <span id="s215">They decided to keep everything as it was here.</span> <span id="s216">They put a monument in this place, exactly in this place where the Minsk ghetto was.</span> <span id="s217">It was really exciting for us, not only for my parents, but it seems to me for all Jewish people were there on this day.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">(What was this monument made of?)</span> <span id="s219">It was made from a special kind of stone.</span> <span id="s220">It was not a really expensive stone, but it was beautiful.</span> <span id="s221">Beautiful words were written on this monument.</span> <span id="s222">There were a lot of flowers.</span> <span id="s223">I remember that it was like a tradition to come to this monument.</span> <span id="s224">It was the day of Victory in Russia, only one or two days where we could hear the Jewish songs and music, and now when we became father and mother, we went every May 9 to this monument.</span> <span id="s225">It was not Jewish music, only Russian songs, but when I was with my father, it was only Jewish music.</span> <span id="s226">I thought that my parents were waiting for this day.</span> <span id="s227">I thought that it was maybe the most important holiday in their life when people in Russia celebrated the seventh of October, the first of May.</span> <span id="s228">My father said that those weren't holidays for us.</span> <span id="s229">We have only one holiday the ninth of May.</span> <span id="s230">Because we couldn't celebrate Passover, Yom Kippur or Rosh Hashona.</span> <span id="s231">No.</span> <span id="s232">I knew a little bit about it, but we didn't celebrate.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">My mother, during Passover, maybe she cooked some special food, but it was not special dishes.</span> <span id="s234">We had matzos at every Passover, but my parents hid it.</span> <span id="s235">They couldn't permit me to bring matzos to school.</span> <span id="s236">One day I did it and my mother was so upset!</span> <span id="s237">[laughs] There were Russian customs, and they adapt to this.</span> <span id="s238">But for this day, I remember that it was really a huge great holiday.</span> <span id="s239">(This holiday was just for your family?)</span> <span id="s240">No, this is a holiday for all Russian people.</span> <span id="s241">The day of Russians mourning World War II.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">(So that was a celebration...) My father told me, "They celebrate one victory.</span> <span id="s243">We celebrate the memory of our Jewish people."</span> <span id="s244">It was maybe the same day, but for us it was really special.</span> <span id="s245">It was the day when the monument was established.</span> <span id="s246">It was the day when at nine o'clock usually there was a meeting at this place and there were special events.</span> <span id="s247">I grew up and was involved with this as a child.</span> <span id="s248">It was a really interesting life I had because my father was very active, and my mother was involved in this part of life and she was really devoted to her job.</span> <span id="s249">A lot of women called her any time of the day or night.</span> <span id="s250">The doors of our house were open at all times for people.</span> <span id="s251">They were really a special kind of people and another point which I should remember about my life they were really close to each other.</span> <span id="s252">Sometimes it was some kind of jealousy for me because... Maybe this is some kind of special feeling because my father was a little simpler than my mother.</span> <span id="s253">He was really kind and nice and open to people.</span> <span id="s254">He could give people a holiday, not only on special occasions, but any day for him was a holiday.</span> <span id="s255">For example, he would go home after his job with a huge bouquet of flowers for my mother, without any reason!</span> <span id="s256">And sometimes if the day was not good.</span> <span id="s257">.</span> <span id="s258">but he took her a lot of flowers.</span> <span id="s259">(He picked them or bought them at a store?)</span> <span id="s260">Not at a store.</span> <span id="s261">He needed to go to the special place where people sold flowers, a flower market.</span> <span id="s262">The price was so high, but it was never a problem for him, because he wanted to do something pleasant for my mom.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">I remember other things, we had vacation with my mom in Riga, Latvia.</span> <span id="s264">On July 22 is the day of their wedding.</span> <span id="s265">And my father sent a really beautiful card to my mother with congratulations, and I kept all of this.</span> <span id="s266">I brought it here.</span> <span id="s267">It was maybe only my memories that I have.</span> <span id="s268">My mom was happy and we celebrated this.</span> <span id="s269">Suddenly we were at the beach it was so hot and I saw my father in the dark suit.</span> <span id="s270">He flew to Riga with some kind of cans.</span> <span id="s271">In these cans were maybe 25 or 30 roses.</span> <span id="s272">He wanted to do something really special for her.</span> <span id="s273">Their whole life they were really good to each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">My father died really suddenly.</span> <span id="s275">My mother was sick.</span> <span id="s276">She had cancer when she was 47 years old.</span> <span id="s277">It was really suddenly for her too.</span> <span id="s278">She was working in the medical office.</span> <span id="s279">She got a test many times during the year.</span> <span id="s280">One day when she got the test, they told her that she had cancer.</span> <span id="s281">She was a really strong woman.</span> <span id="s282">She was operated on.</span> <span id="s283">The operation was really good.</span> <span id="s284">They extracted all the cancer.</span> <span id="s285">(Was it uterine cancer?)</span> <span id="s286">Yes.</span> <span id="s287">It was I don't know now how it was but during this time the doctors explained to my father and my aunt.</span> <span id="s288">Almost everything was okay.</span> <span id="s289">She started to recover and felt good, she had a good mood.</span> <span id="s290">I had never seen her cry.</span> <span id="s291">But during this time when my mother was in the hospital my father got grey hair instead of black.</span> <span id="s292">He was so upset.</span> <span id="s293">He hid it from me and my sister.</span> <span id="s294">It seemed like no one could come.</span> <span id="s295">After her operation, he lived only five months.</span> <span id="s296">During one of his meetings, he [died...?]</span> <span id="s297">He was only 56 years old.</span> <span id="s298">He never had any heart problems ever.</span> <span id="s299">But he had not an easy life too.</span> <span id="s300">Because he lost his parents in such a terrible way.</span> <span id="s301">He went through the whole war as a military officer five years.</span> <span id="s302">After this, he came to Minsk and was involved in some military business.</span> <span id="s303">During this business he was under arrest almost two years too.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">I don't know the reason.</span> <span id="s305">Nobody told me about it.</span> <span id="s306">I knew from my aunt.</span> <span id="s307">It was a terrible time for my parents because one day my father didn't come home.</span> <span id="s308">He wasn't at home almost two years.</span> <span id="s309">Then after two years he was in freedom.</span> <span id="s310">Nobody explained to him why he was in prison two years.</span> <span id="s311">(He didn't have a trial?)</span> <span id="s312">Never a trial.</span> <span id="s313">It was some kind of years.</span> <span id="s314">It was 1949 1952.</span> <span id="s315">It was the deal with the Jewish doctors.</span> <span id="s316">During this time my mother had a really terrible time.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">She explained to me that it was a crazy time.</span> <span id="s318">She was working as a doctor, and she told me, "Can you imagine that people didn't visit me because I was Jewish and they were afraid that if I'm Jewish I might kill or poison them?"</span> <span id="s319">It was really the official way in Russia.</span> <span id="s320">All the newspapers said that Jewish doctors wanted to kill Russian people, to kill Stalin.</span> <span id="s321">The propaganda in Russia was so terrible.</span> <span id="s322">Almost two or three years it was a terrible time for doctors.</span> <span id="s323">She couldn't work.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">(The Doctors' Plot that trial was in 1952.</span> <span id="s325">And your father was already in prison by then?)</span> <span id="s326">He came home in

<span id="s330">It was a really critical time for my parents because my grandfather was sick and my aunt and uncle were in China at this time because my uncle was a military officer, and my mother was really close to her sister.</span> <span id="s331">She was without her sister and without my father and my sister was almost nine years old.</span> <span id="s332">Her father was sick.</span> <span

Now I understand it.</span> <span id="s363">She could probably imagine what her father did in this camp.</span> <span id="s364">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s365">This was my parents' life.</span> <span id="s366">They understood a lot about political things.</span> <span id="s367">During this time it was Solzhenitsyn, Dyakov.</span> <span id="s368">It was some kind stuff that was not permitted to be published.</span> <span id="s369">(Samizdat?)</span> <span id="s370">Yes, samizdat.</span> <span id="s371">(They were typed manuscripts?)</span> <span id="s372">Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s373">My parents read a lot of things and we had at home a lot of things.</span> <span id="s374">In Russia the author Kuznetsov he was the first who wrote about Jewish people who were killed.</span> <span id="s375">It was Yama people killed during World War II close to Kiev.</span> <span id="s376">And Evgeny Yevtushenko wrote some really wonderful poems about it.</span> <span id="s377">It was forbidden to print it too.</span> <span id="s378">My parents kept it at home.</span> <span id="s379">(Baba Yar?)</span> <span id="s380">Yes, you're right.</span> <span id="s381">They were so excited about it.</span> <span id="s382">I remember my father decided to write letters to Yevtushenko to thank him about this poem.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">(Did you ever hear your parents talk about leaving Russia?)</span> <span id="s384">It was some kind of special discussion in my family, too, because some relatives of my father... By the way, I wanted to find them, because every time my uncle wrote me that they are wonderful people.</span> <span id="s385">They left Russia before World War II.</span> <span id="s386">It was then my father's uncle with all his family, sons and daughters.</span> <span id="s387">But my parents I don't know how to explain.</span> <span id="s388">(Did they go to Israel?)</span> <span id="s389">No, to America.</span> <span id="s390">To New York.</span> <span id="s391">I couldn't find them, and I stopped doing it.</span> <span id="s392">Every time my uncle asks me to do it because he wants me to find those connections.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">(Have you run an ad in the newspaper?)</span> <span id="s394">No.</span> <span id="s395">(You could do that.)</span> <span id="s396">They didn't speak about leaving Russia.</span> <span id="s397">Maybe they have a lot of relatives.</span> <span id="s398">For my parents it was impossible to live without their relatives, because both of them were really devoted to their relatives.</span> <span id="s399">All the negative side of Russian life, they spoke about it a lot.</span> <span id="s400">But they understood that some of my relatives would not leave, because my uncle from my mother's side, he was married to a Russian woman.</span> <span id="s401">It was so sad for my parents.</span> <span id="s402">But probably they were some kind of special people.</span> <span id="s403">Maybe I can't take them as guilty because they probably taught me to be really Jewish, both of them.</span> <span id="s404">Maybe they spoke to each other, but never with us, with me or my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">(When you went to school, you weren't thinking you might be able to leave this country?)</span> <span id="s406">I don't know.</span> <span id="s407">I was never "a Russian girl" because I knew from my childhood that I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s408">My parents respect this, they didn't hide it.</span> <span id="s409">A lot of Jewish people should do it, because life for Jewish children was not easy.</span> <span id="s410">They changed nationality, they changed last name.</span> <span id="s411">It was some kind of trick, but they did it.</span> <span id="s412">My parents never did it.</span> <span id="s413">They never spoke about it.</span> <span id="s414">For example, once I came home from school and somebody told me some bad words about Jews and I cried, and my father told me, "You shouldn't cry, you should be proud."</span> <span id="s415">When I was in school, there were maybe seven or eight children from Jewish families in my class.</span> <span id="s416">We were really close to each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">In all my life, nobody told me, but I knew that I should marry only a Jew.</span> <span id="s418">It's probably from the family.</span> <span id="s419">I don't remember if my mom spoke with me about it, but I knew exactly.</span> <span id="s420">I had a lot of Russian children for friends, but all my close friends, people with whom I can discuss everything, they're Jewish.</span> <span id="s421">It was some kind of special community among my parents.</span> <span id="s422">Almost all their friends were Jewish.</span> <span id="s423">Sometimes they sang a lot of Jewish songs at home.</span> <span id="s424">Sometimes a holiday... (Were they Hebrew?)</span> <span id="s425">No, only Yiddish.</span> <span id="s426">They didn't know Hebrew.</span> <span id="s427">They had mixed friends too.</span> <span id="s428">Maybe these were the friends my father had during World War II.</span> <span id="s429">Maybe from this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">But for me, I don't know, when I was in the ninth grade, my mother was alive.</span> <span id="s431">It was maybe the last year or last month of her life.</span> <span id="s432">We spoke with her in the hospital.</span> <span id="s433">I dreamed about being a doctor.</span> <span id="s434">And my mother told me, "You can't do it.</span> <span id="s435">You can't do it because it's impossible now in Russia to enter medical school.</span> <span id="s436">You shouldn't dream about it.</span> <span id="s437">You should go to a technical college."</span> <span id="s438">It's the only way for Jewish children because the technical college has only the written exam.</span> <span id="s439">All the other universities have the oral exam.</span> <span id="s440">And when you have oral exams, they know you are Jewish.</span> <span id="s441">But when you take the written exam, they don't know who you are because you have only the number.</span> <span id="s442">You put the number on this sheet of paper and that's it.</span> <span id="s443">(So it's an anonymous test?)</span> <span id="s444">Yes.</span> <span id="s445">This is the reason why almost all people who came from Russia are engineers or computer scientists.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">(Is this also the reason why we don't hear anything about Jewish lawyers?)</span> <span id="s447">Yes, because if you would like to be a lawyer you have to graduate from the university, the special kind in Russia, and it's only oral exam.</span> <span id="s448">That was the reason.</span> <span id="s449">When I was in school I came to some kind of preparing school for medical school.</span> <span id="s450">I graduated with two years of school.</span> <span id="s451">The whole time my mom spoke with me she said, "I know it's your dream but you should forget about it."</span> <span id="s452">Forget, because as we did in school with this gold medal....</span> <span id="s453">So I went to the polytechnical university.</span> <span id="s454">It was boring for me, but I didn't have another chance to do it.</span> <span id="s455">It's probably sometimes it seems to me that I endured it, it was not close to me, I hate all this engineering stuff.</span> <span id="s456">I started really easy.</span> <span id="s457">(It came easy to you?)</span> <span id="s458">Yes, really easy to me, but I hated this.</span> <span id="s459">And now, with my daughter, she's going to be a doctor.</span> <span id="s460">It's only that which I couldn't do.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">(What was the percentage of Jews in the school when you were growing up?)</span> <span id="s462">Maybe close to 10%.</span> <span id="s463">Not much, but it was not so bad for me because I graduated from a good school.</span> <span id="s464">We lived in a really good district with a lot of Jewish people.</span> <span id="s465">In Russia it was almost the same, the district where almost all Jewish people lived, maybe some bluecollar people lived.</span> <span id="s466">My parents had a really good apartment, not a house.</span> <span id="s467">With this apartment are my really sad memories too, because our apartment was really good for Russia, because my mother had really good taste.</span> <span id="s468">Everything was nice.</span> <span id="s469">They had a good library.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">When both of them died, the second day, after the ceremony, the people from the Soviet government came to my apartment and told me that I should leave this apartment because it's really huge for me.</span> <span id="s471">I am alone, and I need to leave this apartment and they can give me a onebedroom apartment in another district.</span> <span id="s472">(How big was this apartment?)</span> <span id="s473">It was a three room apartment not three bedrooms, one bedroom for my parents, one for me, and library with bedroom, a huge reading room.</span> <span id="s474">It was a cozy apartment.</span> <span id="s475">It was not our own apartment.</span> <span id="s476">We pay, but all apartments in Russia are rented apartments.</span> <span id="s477">But it's not rent like in America.</span> <span id="s478">When the government gives you an apartment, you can live in this apartment how long you want to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">(How long had your family lived there?)</span> <span id="s480">My family lived in this apartment since when I was born.</span> <span id="s481">I was born in another apartment, and after two months, they moved to this apartment.</span> <span id="s482">It was their first apartment in their common life.</span> <span id="s483">All the time they had lived with my mother's or father's side.</span> <span id="s484">It was the first time in their life where they could live with me and my sister.</span> <span id="s485">When my sister was married, she lived with the mother of my brotherinlaw.</span> <span id="s486">It was really a terrible feeling because after my parents died they came into my apartment and rummaged through my rooms.</span> <span id="s487">I was so depressed.</span> <span id="s488">Nobody looked at my face.</span> <span id="s489">They were not interested in what I am doing.</span> <span id="s490">They decided only one thing, because one really huge boss wanted to have our apartment.</span> <span id="s491">For him, it doesn't matter what I think, what my relatives think.</span> <span id="s492">One of my teachers was so impressed after this that she came to this boss and said, "How can you do it?"</span> <span id="s493">And he told her it was none of her business.</span> <span id="s494">They pushed us and called us every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">(Where was your sister?)</span> <span id="s496">With her family.</span> <span id="s497">She had a sixyearold son.</span> <span id="s498">All the time he stayed with us, with my parents.</span> <span id="s499">My mother and father loved their grandson so much that he lived with us.</span> <span id="s500">I grew up with him almost.</span> <span id="s501">My sister lived with her motherinlaw who was really sick.</span> <span id="s502">She was paralyzed and my sister lived with her in their apartment and I lived in this apartment with my parents.</span> <span id="s503">After the death of my parents, it was a terrible time for us because it looked like some kind of [...] and people called and they came to our apartment.</span> <span id="s504">They did such terrible stuff.</span> <span id="s505">My relatives decided that there was only one way to keep this apartment.</span> <span id="s506">It was the memory of my parents.</span> <span id="s507">We decided to take some kind of compromise with the Soviet government.</span> <span id="s508">At this time my sister's motherinlaw died.</span> <span id="s509">My sister went to one of the Soviet offices and she said to give them her apartment, and for her to move into my apartment.</span> <span id="s510">It was the only one way to keep our apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">This man who wanted to live in our apartment, he was our neighbor for ten years.</span> <span id="s512">He knew my father and he shook his hand every morning.</span> <span id="s513">And only when he died, he decided to kick me out.</span> <span id="s514">(Was he Jewish?)</span> <span id="s515">No!</span> <span id="s516">He was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s517">It was a terrible story.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">I lived with my sister.</span> <span id="s519">My aunt wanted to live near us.</span> <span id="s520">My sister is a wonderful woman.</span> <span id="s521">We were close.</span> <span id="s522">I helped her to come here.</span> <span id="s523">But my aunt, she's a special woman, and she decided that probably she can give me much more than my sister.</span> <span id="s524">She has two sons almost my age and we were close to each other growing up.</span> <span id="s525">And I moved to her apartment.</span> <span id="s526">I went back and forth.</span> <span id="s527">My uncle wanted me to live with him, from my father's side.</span> <span id="s528">It was nice, because everybody wanted to participate in my life, to be involved in my life, not to be separate from me.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">(What was going on in your mind through all of this?</span> <span id="s530">You lost both your parents?</span> <span id="s531">You did feel protected to some extent...) For me it was a really terrible feeling because, for example, to lose the parents is for everybody difficult.</span> <span id="s532">It's some kind of emptiness in your life.</span> <span id="s533">But for me it was really special because my parents were unusual people.</span> <span id="s534">Their life was really unusual.</span> <span id="s535">I saw the type of my classmates, and it was different, a really different life.</span> <span id="s536">My parents were really special people.</span> <span id="s537">I remember, for example, at the funeral of my father, and not only his company closed but a lot of companies closed because of his death.</span> <span id="s538">In Russia it was forbidden in America it may be possible, but in Russia it was forbidden and these people came to the funeral.</span> <span id="s539">He was some kind of really unusual man, and my mother was too.</span> <span id="s540">For me it was a really empty part and I was really depressed.</span> <span id="s541">I didn't want to go to school.</span> <span id="s542">I decided to interrupt my education.</span> <span id="s543">I didn't know what to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Probably my aunt, she was really one person who not only was concerned for me everybody was but she had some kind of special influence over me.</span> <span id="s545">She didn't cry to me.</span> <span id="s546">She didn't speak to me with a lot of conversations, "You should go to school.</span> <span id="s547">."</span> <span id="s548">etc., she found some kind of way to my soul.</span> <span id="s549">I love her.</span> <span id="s550">She is an interesting woman too.</span> <span id="s551">She's working in a children's hospital.</span> <span id="s552">She's a pediatrician.</span> <span id="s553">A hospital where children are without parents.</span> <span id="s554">She was working at this place from 1949.</span> <span id="s555">She was the chief of this place.</span> <span id="s556">If you're in Russia and want to live without children you can leave them in at the delivery house, and then the children are in this special kind of place.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">(We would call that an orphanage.)</span> <span id="s558">Yes, but these children are not orphans, because they have parents, just parents who don't want to deal with the children.</span> <span id="s559">Young mothers, mixed things.</span> <span id="s560">It was a terrible place.</span> <span id="s561">But we grew up with this place because all our children's stuff, our clothes, my aunt brought to this place.</span> <span id="s562">Because the government doesn't give a lot of money to these children.</span> <span id="s563">They help them, it's true, but it was not huge help.</span> <span id="s564">I remember how my aunt's pockets were all full of candy.</span> <span id="s565">When she came to the job she brought candy and would give candy to these children.</span> <span id="s566">(How long did the children stay in this place?)</span> <span id="s567">Until three years.</span> <span id="s568">And after three years they go to another special place.</span> <span id="s569">But this place was after they were born until three years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">(How many children lived there?)</span> <span id="s571">It wasn't just one place.</span> <span id="s572">When I was a youngster it was only one place.</span> <span id="s573">Now my aunt wrote my that it was five places.</span> <span id="s574">In this place are three hundred children.</span> <span id="s575">Helen has an essay about it because she was working for this place.</span> <span id="s576">When she was six and seven and eight, this is some kind of special education for me and for Helen too.</span> <span id="s577">My aunt brought us to this place and we were brought to these children.</span> <span id="s578">In the summertime they have a country village where children can spend the summertime, and we were in this place in the summertime.</span> <span id="s579">Probably she had for me, maybe has a really important part of my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">(She's not going to leave is she?)</span> <span id="s581">I don't know.</span> <span id="s582">I applied for her, but it's really hard for me and for her.</span> <span id="s583">We are not in the close relationship on the paper.</span> <span id="s584">She's my aunt.</span> <span id="s585">I was her niece.</span> <span id="s586">But in American embassy is the requirement that we should be mother, sister, brother, daughter, this kind of relationship.</span> <span id="s587">I applied for her and wrote the letter to the American embassy that she may be closer to me than some others to their children.</span> <span id="s588">But now it doesn't work.</span> <span id="s589">On Monday I called Washington, and she doesn't have a case number yet.</span> <span id="s590">(I'm surprised that she would want to leave at her age, but she must feel so close to you...)

it was not the level of education of which I had dreamed.</span> <span id="s717">I had a family, I had other business.</span> <span id="s718">I had really good, close friends.</span> <span id="s719">We had good people around us and some other kind of life, so school didn't impress me.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">(How did you meet G.?)</span> <span id="s721">I met G. at the wedding of my friend.</span> <span id="s722">I was invited from one side.</span> <span id="s723">He was invited from another side.</span> <span id="s724">And we met each other and he was already studying and I had just entered this university.</span> <span id="s725">(You're about nine years apart?)</span> <span id="s726">Yes.</span> <span id="s727">He had his Ph.D. in this time when I met him.</span> <span id="s728">(I don't have that down here.)</span> <span id="s729">Yes, he got his Ph.D. when he was twentyfive.</span> <span id="s730">From the same place.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">(How long did you know each other before you got married?)</span> <span id="s732">Two months.</span> <span id="s733">(Love at first sight?)</span> <span id="s734">Yes, maybe!</span> <span id="s735">[laughs] Maybe it was some kind of special occasion, because I was alone, I don't know exactly.</span> <span id="s736">But it was really quickly.</span> <span id="s737">I continued to study, and Gena continued to work.</span> <span id="s738">It was not really interesting in our inside life, because when we got married we started to think about some kind of Russian's life and probably we had really interesting people, and all our discussions were about negative events in Russian life, about Jewish.</span> <span id="s739">We read a lot of Jewish books.</span> <span id="s740">Gena had a really interesting grandfather.</span> <span id="s741">He knew Hebrew and Yiddish.</span> <span id="s742">While he was alive he spoke with us.</span> <span id="s743">Maybe he was the first man from whom I heard that [he] wanted to leave Russia.</span> <span id="s744">Because we didn't have children at this time.</span> <span id="s745">He was a really clever man.</span> <span id="s746">In our circle of friends, all the time we talked about it.</span> <span id="s747">Maybe our life pushed us to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">(So your marriage, instead of being a period where you could just be romantic and pursue material improvement in your life, this was when you became more politically intense?)</span> <span id="s749">Yes, more politically intense because from my family, from my childhood, school, friends.</span> <span id="s750">All events pushed me to think about it.</span> <span id="s751">Maybe all our life made us do it, because it wasn't an easy life.</span> <span id="s752">Instead of enjoying our life, for example to spend some time on vacation, we never had enough money.</span> <span id="s753">Sometimes we couldn't buy a book that we would like to have because it was really expensive for us.</span> <span id="s754">Small kind of things, but sometimes we feel that we've spent our life standing in line to buy this, to buy this, and we lose something.</span> <span id="s755">We couldn't do what we wanted to do, and Gena had a really serious problem in his job not with the job, but with people.</span> <span id="s756">He understood that he could do a lot of useful things, and he had a lot of articles from interesting research.</span> <span id="s757">For example, he came to his boss and said, "I've invented something."</span> <span id="s758">"Why?</span> <span id="s759">I don't ask you to do it?"</span> <span id="s760">(There was no reward for this energy and intelligence...) Yes.</span> <span id="s761">We explained our feelings, to our closest friends yes, but to people around us, it was not interesting for them.</span> <span id="s762">When we started to think about it, we read a lot of articles, a lot of books.</span> <span id="s763">It was really insulting for us.</span> <span id="s764">It's all lies from our government, from our system.</span> <span id="s765">People were afraid to say something important.</span> <span id="s766">And we understood these people, because that was life in Russia.</span> <span id="s767">Sometimes I felt that not only couldn't they say something truly, they couldn't think about it truly because almost all people were two people.</span> <span id="s768">One person was outside and another person was inside.</span> <span id="s769">It was really difficult for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Another point that really insulted me was that the monument of my parents was ruined.</span> <span id="s771">When the first family from Minsk started to leave Minsk and to go to America or Israel, it was not a Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s772">It was the cemetery where Jewish and nonJewish people were buried.</span> <span id="s773">But it was the Jewish part of this cemetery.</span> <span id="s774">One day I came to this place to put flowers and I was in a state of shock.</span> <span id="s775">The monument of my parents was ruined.</span> <span id="s776">(What did it look like?)</span> <span id="s777">I have a picture.</span> <span id="s778">On this monument was a picture of my mother and father.</span> <span id="s779">The portrait was broken with a huge stone.</span> <span id="s780">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s781">When I came home I was in shock.</span> <span id="s782">I thought never do I want to be in this country never.</span> <span id="s783">(What year was this?)</span> <span id="s784">It was after my marriage 1975, 1976.</span> <span id="s785">When there was a stream of people going to Israel.</span> <span id="s786">Not only my parents', but a lot of monuments around them were broken.</span> <span id="s787">It was terrible to look at.</span> <span id="s788">We had another recent experience with our cemetery because we put some flowers in this monument in the ground.</span> <span id="s789">They were beautiful red flowers.</span> <span id="s790">I remember this.</span> <span id="s791">It cost me all my month's salary.</span> <span id="s792">I bought them in the one farm it was really far from Minsk and we didn't have a car.</span> <span id="s793">I took them by bus.</span> <span id="s794">I was excited and happy.</span> <span id="s795">We went with Gena on a Saturday to put the flowering plants in the ground and I came on Sunday to water them and there were no flowers in the ground.</span> <span id="s796">I don't know who did it.</span> <span id="s797">Nobody knew who did it.</span> <span id="s798">(Was it the only grave that was damaged?)</span> <span id="s799">Not the only one.</span> <span id="s800">(So there was vandalism.</span> <span id="s801">Was it the first time you were aware of vandalism in the Jewish cemetery?)</span> <span id="s802">In my life, yes.</span> <span id="s803">Maybe in my parents' it was not the first.</span> <span id="s804">But in my life it was a big impression for me.</span> <span id="s805">Because I gave it all my life and soul and it was so beautiful.</span> <span id="s806">We spent a whole day putting it in the ground and watering it.</span> <span id="s807">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s808">It was nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">(You're married a short time and expecting your baby?)</span> <span id="s810">Yes.</span> <span id="s811">(So how long after that were you refused?)</span> <span id="s812">We got refused in 1980.</span> <span id="s813">We left Russia in 1989.</span> <span id="s814">It was nine years of difficult experiences.</span> <span id="s815">We married in 1973.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">(What was it like in those days when Helen was born.</span> <span id="s817">Did you go to the hospital?)</span> <span id="s818">Yes.</span> <span id="s819">I went to the hospital, my mother's hospital, and everybody knew me in this hospital from my childhood.</span> <span id="s820">(So you had good care?)</span> <span id="s821">For Russia it was really good care, but for America I understand it's not really good care.</span> <span id="s822">Because in the one room there were seven women.</span> <span id="s823">It was not clean, it was not good.</span> <span id="s824">I lost a lot of blood because no one was in the recovery room.</span> <span id="s825">But my aunt called a lot of people because they grew up with me.</span> <span id="s826">She knew a lot of the doctors.</span> <span id="s827">They came and helped me.</span> <span id="s828">With me everything was Okay.</span> <span id="s829">I had some problems after Helen's birth.</span> <span id="s830">She had some problems with her legs.</span> <span id="s831">Almost one year her legs were in casts.</span> <span id="s832">But with the help of my aunt and husband I could manage with this.</span> <span id="s833">So I didn't interrupt my study and I studied all this time.</span> <span id="s834">It was very interesting.</span> <span id="s835">I delivered Helen on the 7th of December, and on the 2nd of January I was in the institute!</span> <span id="s836">I took the test!</span></p> <p><span id="s837">(Who took care of her?)</span> <span id="s838">We hired one of our neighbors.</span> <span id="s839">She was an old, really kind woman.</span> <span id="s840">We paid her almost half of G.'s salary, and I didn't have any salary I was a student!</span> <span id="s841">On the financial side it was so hard for us.</span> <span id="s842">I didn't want to interrupt my study.</span> <span id="s843">(How long did you go to school after that?)</span> <span id="s844">Three and a half years.</span> <span id="s845">(Did you have to write a thesis for your M.A. degree?)</span> <span id="s846">No.</span> <span id="s847">I did college and my Master's degree together.</span> <span id="s848">I got my diploma.</span> <span id="s849">When Helen was one year old, she went to the [daycare.]</span> <span id="s850">It wasn't expensive, only $12 a month.</span> <span id="s851">It was not good, I understand right now, but for such a time for me it was really useful.</span> <span id="s852">And sometimes Helen was sick, because can you imagine 3540 children together, and they eat, sleep and play together, so none of them are healthy because of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">(I know you went through a lot, the years of refusal.</span> <span id="s854">Who sponsored you?)</span> <span id="s855">We had our friends here and they were our sponsors.</span> <span id="s856">We didn't have any relatives here.</span> <span id="s857">We had some friends, and some live in Pittsburgh, and other close friends live in New York.</span> <span id="s858">It was an interesting fact too, they were not our close friend, but G., I don't know why he wanted to go to Chicago.</span> <span id="s859">It was a choice between New York and Chicago, and he asked me to go to Chicago.</span> <span id="s860">Because I really wanted to go to New York because they were really our close friends.</span> <span id="s861">I continued to write them from Russia.</span> <span id="s862">But G. in Russia went to the library and he found out that a lot of companies... because for him to work it was really important... and he found a lot of companies that were related to his field.</span> <span id="s863">He said we needed to go to Chicago that only in Chicago could he find a job.</span> <span id="s864">So we came to Chicago.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">(Were there surprises here in Chicago?)</span> <span id="s866">Yes.</span> <span id="s867">It was really a shock for us.</span> <span id="s868">There were a lot of impressions, a lot of feelings.</span> <span id="s869">First of all, it was really difficult.</span> <span id="s870">We came here without almost any people we knew here in Chicago.</span> <span id="s871">People helped us a lot, but some kind of life, some kind of people.</span> <span id="s872">Sometimes it seems to me that I lost almost everything my family, my relationship in the family.</span> <span id="s873">A lot of things we need to do find a job, help ourselves, our children, find an apartment.</span> <span id="s874">Everything was new for us.</span> <span id="s875">A new experience to make a social security number, to write a resume.</span> <span id="s876">In Russia we never wrote resumes.</span> <span id="s877">We found a job another way.</span> <span id="s878">For us every day we got a lot of things to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">But maybe our hard life in Russia prepared us for this life, because we knew how to work.</span> <span id="s880">We knew how to feel strong and not be upset on small occasions.</span> <span id="s881">We understand what's really important for us and what's not important.</span> <span id="s882">And people.</span> <span id="s883">I told you I have really good luck with people here.</span> <span id="s884">We met a lot of really wonderful people I don't mean just Russians, but American people who really helped us a lot by advice, really good help.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">(Was this through the various Jewish agencies?)</span> <span id="s886">I appreciate everything given to us.</span> <span id="s887">Because we only came this way.</span> <span id="s888">It's really a big deal, an important part of our life.</span> <span id="s889">But maybe the time when we came, a lot of people came.</span> <span id="s890">They didn't have a lot of money or a lot of time to help us.</span> <span id="s891">They paid for us for six months and it was really important because without this we couldn't find a job, we couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s892">But Jewish American people helped us much more than the Jewish community itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">(How did you meet these people?)</span> <span id="s894">One family, Martha and Bruce Hofstader in Highland Park.</span> <span id="s895">He's a dentist.</span> <span id="s896">And they called us one day and suggested their help.</span> <span id="s897">They're really wonderful people.</span> <span id="s898">And from Jewish Vocational Service they sent us [...] an unbelievable woman.</span> <span id="s899">We met another wonderful woman, [...] she was our teacher of English, Sheryl Coffman.</span> <span id="s900">On one occasion we met an interesting woman, a professor at Northwestern University, Mara Adelman, she's a remarkable woman too.</span> <span id="s901">And until now, all the time I feel that if I need advice to decide something, I can call them any time and I'll get a really good, full answers, without any questions "Why do you do this..." They understand us.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Maybe one year ago I met Elaine Cantor, a member of Hadassah, and she's really friendly to us.</span> <span id="s903">Now that Helen's applying to college she and her husband called and asked and gave advice.</span> <span id="s904">It was really important for us because we don't have any experience in this life.</span> <span id="s905">It's really appreciated for us because maybe in Russia we lived most of our life and we had close friends, but never people who didn't know you to help you only your close friends and relatives.</span> <span id="s906">And when we came here without any kind of connections, people wanted to help us.</span> <span id="s907">Maybe they appreciate our hard life.</span> <span id="s908">R..</span> <span id="s909">.</span> <span id="s910">often told me, "I can't imagine it."</span> <span id="s911">Maybe it's true.</span></p></body></html>
