born in Poland.</span> <span id="s5">The name of the city was Zloczow and I lived in the outskirts.</span> <span id="s6">My father built a house because it was more convenient and better to make a living there.</span> <span id="s7">I had--we were four children, second marriage of my husband [probably means father].</span> <span id="s8">Two sister--two girls and two boys, and we lived a nice living, medium, not rich, but not poor.</span> <span id="s9">And 1939, when Germany occupied Poland, life like ended for us.</span> <span id="s10">It was the hardest time in my life.</span> <span id="s11">Those murderers came in the first time and such bombing that the bigger houses were shaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">CS: In other words the Germans started bombing?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">SR: Yes.</span> <span id="s14">Started bombing…</span></p> <p><span id="s15">CS: During the invasion?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">SR: Yes.</span> <span id="s17">And it was awful.</span> <span id="s18">The second day, they had gone to take people to work and they gathered them in one place, but we found out it was not to work.</span> <span id="s19">They took them into the woods, tortured them and killed and buried them.</span> <span id="s20">Who were those people with the diplomas?</span> <span id="s21">Mostly teachers, doctors.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">CS: They took the educated people.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">SR: Educated people in the woods and they tortured them because the gentile people came later and told us everything what was in the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">CS: Okay, these were only the Jewish educated?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">SR: Only the Jewish educated people.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">CS: What percentage of the town was Jewish and what was gentile?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">SR: We were like 3,000 people, Jewish, Jews.</span> <span id="s28">On the outskirts were mostly gentiles.</span> <span id="s29">In the middle of the city mostly Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">CS: You say the town was primarily a Jewish town?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">SR: Yes, primarily.</span> <span id="s32">Not all.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">CS: A lot of synagogues?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">SR: Yes.</span> <span id="s35">Not a lot but we had synagogues.</span> <span id="s36">The people were very pious those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">CS: Was your family involved in religious life?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">SR: Yes.</span> <span id="s39">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s40">My father even bought a Torah because we lived in the outskirts.</span> <span id="s41">He got the Torah not for money, you know, just for grain or the food.</span> <span id="s42">He had the Torah, he had a lot of s'forim [religious books].</span></p> <p><span id="s43">CS: In your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">SR: In my home.</span> <span id="s45">I came from very religious home.</span> <span id="s46">My father started to become a rabbi, but apparently his parents weren't able to educate him, didn't have the money because they educated the older two brothers.</span> <span id="s47">One became a rabbi and he moved later, left Poland.</span> <span id="s48">He lived in New York in Delancey Street, my uncle.</span> <span id="s49">And but he died, as you know my father was very old and his brother was even older.</span> <span id="s50">And I have cousins, I still have cousins, the second line in New York.</span> <span id="s51">Their name Parille.</span> <span id="s52">And one brother of my husb--my father, was a shochet, a slaughterer, those who slaughtered cows.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">CS: Oh, okay, a shochet.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">SR: Yes.</span> <span id="s55">A shochet, in Hebrew, I think.</span> <span id="s56">As I told you, when Germans then started looting, they were breaking the windows, they came into the Jewish houses, took away whatever was valuable, they took away the jewelry and the Jews didn't have the right to have a fur coat.</span> <span id="s57">It was ordered to bring for them, there was established a place where fur coat even fur collars.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">CS: Well what about your Polish neighbors?</span> <span id="s59">Did you have help from them?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">SR: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s61">Polish neighbors weren't as bad as Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s62">The Ukrainians, even little boys, they went running around and showing the Germans, "Here is a Jude.</span> <span id="s63">Here is a Jude."</span> <span id="s64">They learned this word Jude.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">CS: You lived, it was near the Ukraine, there were Ukrainians living in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">SR: There were Ukrainian people and Poles.</span> <span id="s67">But they both helped the Germans, they helped them.</span> <span id="s68">They were Nazis.</span> <span id="s69">This is why Hitler chose Poland.</span> <span id="s70">Poland was very antisemitic.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">CS: Did anyone in your family serve in the Army?</span> <span id="s72">Any of your brothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">SR: No.</span> <span id="s74">Because of health problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">CS: So in 1939, you started to tell me, the educated people were taken to the woods and shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">SR: And shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">CS: What happened next?</span> <span id="s78">To the Jewish community, were there work camps, were you put into ghettos?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">SR: Next there were work camps and they established ghettos and people were forced to go to the ghetto, like one room, three or four families.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">CS: A ghetto in your town?</span> <span id="s81">Or did you have to move to another town?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">SR: No, no, we were still here in Zloczow.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">CS: You were still in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">SR: We were still in our home, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">CS: Okay, now how about work for your father.</span> <span id="s86">Was he able to continue?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">SR: My father was 90 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">CS: Oh, so he was retired?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">SR: Yes, he was retired.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">CS: How about your brothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">SR: My brother was the one that lived there, and the livelihood making was my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">CS: Did anything happen with him and his work?</span> <span id="s93">Was he able to continue working?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">SR: No, he was taken to a ghetto and later he escaped, he and my sister and my brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s95">They escaped from ghetto.</span> <span id="s96">They had some friends outside, gentile people who took us in somewhere.</span> <span id="s97">But before happened with my leg, this is very important.</span> <span id="s98">When I got shot in 1942 I was taken to the hospital, my leg was amputated, I was taken…</span></p> <p><span id="s99">CS: What was the circumstances that you got shot.</span> <span id="s100">What was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">SR: They were crazy, they were drunk in the middle of the night, they begun to shoot people.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">CS: These were Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">SR: Germans in a working camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">CS: You were in the work camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">SR: Work camp, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">CS: Do you remember the name of that work camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">SR: I don't remember exactly.</span> <span id="s108">Because there were two, we were in two, I was in two, one was Laszczow and the other was Kosice.</span> <span id="s109">I think this was in Kosice.</span> <span id="s110">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">CS: How did you get to the work camp?</span> <span id="s112">Did they…</span></p> <p><span id="s113">SR: No, we have to come there.</span> <span id="s114">There were also two--no, we were walking there.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">CS: How did you get from your home in 1939...</span></p> <p><span id="s116">SR: We were walking there and later we were there established, we slept over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">CS: Was this near your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">SR: No, it was far.</span> <span id="s119">It was few kilometers.</span> <span id="s120">But when you are forced to walk, you walk.</span> <span id="s121">You can walk a thousand miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">CS: Sure.</span> <span id="s123">So they were drunk and crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">SR: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">CS: And so you got shot in the leg.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">SR: Yeah.</span> <span id="s127">The leg was amputated and I got home.</span> <span id="s128">At home I can't just tell you what I saw in the faces of my parents when they saw me come in without a leg.</span> <span id="s129">And now I didn't have a doctor.</span> <span id="s130">Once came a doctor, he was in ghetto, and his name was Silver, and he was from Krakow, and he was very gentle but he promised that he will come the next week but he didn't come, he died.</span> <span id="s131">He got typhus; typhus broke out in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s132">Because, as you know…</span></p> <p><span id="s133">CS: This is the ghetto in your town or in the other ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">SR: In Zloczow all.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">CS: All this was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">SR: All this was there.</span> <span id="s137">He didn't come.</span> <span id="s138">He didn't come.</span> <span id="s139">That's all.</span> <span id="s140">So I wondered why I didn't got an infection again because they didn't have sterile gauze or pads, nothing, but somehow you know when you have to live, you live.</span> <span id="s141">But later on, later on, let me tell you now that's like a miracle involved.</span> <span id="s142">Do you want to hear that?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">CS: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">SR: You know.</span> <span id="s145">It was this one day, ten o'clock in the morning, we heard knocking and we went to the door and came in two Germans and two Ukrainians, and they told us that they want our house next day.</span> <span id="s146">Ten o'clock we have to be out.</span> <span id="s147">I wrote a poem after twenty years about this.</span> <span id="s148">And they slammed the door as they left.</span> <span id="s149">We were shocked.</span> <span id="s150">My father couldn't walk naturally and I couldn't walk.</span> <span id="s151">I didn't have prosthesis yet.</span> <span id="s152">I just came from this hell.</span> <span id="s153">And I turned, as I told you, I was myself very religious.</span> <span id="s154">I knew the psalms; I knew the prayers, all the prayers, you know, without looking into the siddur, and I turned to God.</span> <span id="s155">I spoke to Him, and told Him it is impossible, You have to help.</span> <span id="s156">My father can't walk and I can't walk.</span> <span id="s157">And they will take us out and they will shoot us.</span> <span id="s158">And I am going, I'm not afraid, I told God, of death, if He wants me I will die, but the shame, the humiliation, that the gentiles will go out there and they will laugh and they will say, "Look now they are shooting him, now they are shooting her."</span> <span id="s159">And you know, I found in the psalms, I found such a psalms, by King David and Solomon, they were applying to my condition, and I begged them and I fell asleep.</span> <span id="s160">In the early morning I had a dream, that I am in school and a professor of religion with the name Chitai [phonetic], one who was killed in the second day of German-occupied Zloczow.</span> <span id="s161">That he asked in the class, "Who will translate the sentence "Hine lo yanum velo yishen shomer Yisroel."</span> <span id="s162">And I picked up the fingers and I told him I will translate, and when came to like hine and lo, no doesn't sleep, doesn't dream and doesn't sleep and watches the Israelis.</span> <span id="s163">And when I came to this word, Shomer Yisroel, he said, "Do you know God means Yisroel?"</span> <span id="s164">And I didn't answer but the professor said, "Those who believe.</span> <span id="s165">Why don't you know?"</span> <span id="s166">He said, "Those who believe, you, I see you believe, so don't worry, everything will be okay."</span> <span id="s167">And I woke up in the morning and I felt like I was somewhere very far and I couldn't understand.</span> <span id="s168">I couldn't just make sure from where I was coming.</span> <span id="s169">Then I said, "Ahah!</span> <span id="s170">Professor Chitai at school!"</span> <span id="s171">And then I went to my father and almost hollering, I asked and I was so, so angry, I don't know what and I told him: "Daddy, please translate Hine lo yanum velo yishen shomer Yisroel."</span> <span id="s172">And my father wondered why I asked him and I said, "Daddy, please."</span> <span id="s173">So he translated and when he came to Yisroel he said the same words that the Professor Chitai of blessed memory, because, you know, he died.</span> <span id="s174">"And if you believe, those words means those who believe.</span> <span id="s175">And so don't have to worry, you believe and go to bed, go to sleep, your eyes are swollen."</span> <span id="s176">And I went to bed.</span> <span id="s177">I didn't fall asleep, naturally, because I was afraid.</span> <span id="s178">Ten o'clock exactly those four came in, like two Germans, the same, and two Ukrainians, and they told us in German, in German language, in German they spoke, that they found another house, we can stay for awhile there.</span> <span id="s179">They slammed the doors and they went.</span> <span id="s180">You can imagine, it was a simcha [joyous occasion] but with tears, we cried from joy.</span> <span id="s181">We stayed there a few months, and in the meantime my brother looked for a place, but before he got a place, there were such hours during the day that we have to leave the house because we weren't sure, because they told that they might come and take us out.</span> <span id="s182">So we left for the woods, so I was with my mother.</span> <span id="s183">In the woods, it was thundering, it was raining and I couldn't walk on crutches because you see on a pavement, a pavement, excuse me, you can walk with crutches but in the woods it is very hard.</span> <span id="s184">So it was torture.</span> <span id="s185">Later I was in a barrel, peasants used to bring fish.</span> <span id="s186">They used to have big barrels.</span> <span id="s187">I was there because German soldiers came to look not for Jews but for grain.</span> <span id="s188">And they just went in and moved in here and there.</span> <span id="s189">And later my brother found a place but on the manure in the stable.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">CS: For you all to live?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">SR: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">CS: Which would be safer than the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">SR: Yes, safer than the house.</span> <span id="s194">We had to leave.</span> <span id="s195">In the meantime…</span></p> <p><span id="s196">CS: What year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">SR: Uh huh.</span> <span id="s198">Do you know what?</span> <span id="s199">This was when it came to Judenfrei.</span> <span id="s200">When I told you we were a few months in our house, our house, and later when it became free from Jews, a Jew had to be dead, or hidden, you know, somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">CS: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">SR: So my brother got a place but it was an awful place.</span> <span id="s203">It was under manure in the stable.</span> <span id="s204">Far different the stable, where the peasants used to throw out the manure from the stable.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">CS: A manure pile?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">SR: Yes.</span> <span id="s207">In the earth.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">CS: In what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">SR: This was in 1942, '43 when it was Judenfrei, I just don't remember the year.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">CS: That's close enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">SR: But the condition was unbearable.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">CS: How did you get food?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">SR: Yes, he used to bring the food, twice a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">CS: Your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">SR: Yes.</span> <span id="s216">No, no, not my brother, the peasant, we had a benefactor.</span> <span id="s217">The peasant took us in.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">CS: This was a Polish peasant?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">SR: A Polish peasant.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">CS: Now why do you think he did that?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">SR: He did it for money.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">CS: Oh, for money.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">SR: We promised him the house, we gave him the plan from our house, because my father built the house, so he got this plan and after the war we told him the house and the piece of garden it will be his, and we gave him $200.</span> <span id="s224">This is what we had then and some other Polish money, and my daughter [her sister] gave everything; she had jewelry because she was only married two years, so she had a lot of things to give him.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">CS: This was your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">SR: My sister and my brother, all his suits, everything, his nice clothes and money, and he took us in.</span> <span id="s227">The shelter was done very badly, poorly.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">CS: How did you know you could trust him?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">SR: Yes, we knew him.</span> <span id="s230">We had to trust somebody.</span> <span id="s231">Because it was…</span></p> <p><span id="s232">CS: You had no choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">SR: Yes, it was just horrible for the Jews, so we trusted him and we knew him a little bit.</span> <span id="s234">You know then it was no choice.</span> <span id="s235">The entrance was to the stable, it was like a sliding board to our shelter, and this board and our shelter was covered with a board, and on the board he used to put a lot of the manure from the inside.</span> <span id="s236">And the outside manure he had to cover the holes, because in the manure we made holes because we needed air.</span> <span id="s237">So this was hell.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">CS: What did you do to keep busy?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">SR: Oh, we were like crazy, oh, we were shaking, we were, do you know what fear--fear changes people.</span> <span id="s240">We were different people there, and he took in other people whom he knew.</span> <span id="s241">He took in a father and a son and two other people.</span> <span id="s242">So we came, we were four, and came to--to nine people and the place was like for two or for three people.</span> <span id="s243">Sitting together one touched the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">CS: So you just sat all day.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">SR: Sitting all day.</span> <span id="s246">We couldn't talk we couldn't sneeze, because we were afraid.</span> <span id="s247">Outside, you know, peasants were walking around, children played and this was hell.</span> <span id="s248">It was hell.</span> <span id="s249">The food was miserable.</span> <span id="s250">He was constantly drunk.</span> <span id="s251">And you know the most important fear I forgot to tell you.</span> <span id="s252">Once happened that his father who took in also a young couple with a child.</span> <span id="s253">At his father, was, a shelter was discovered and the people were taken away.</span> <span id="s254">Jewish people they were taken away.</span> <span id="s255">When he found out about, he covered the holes in the manure, the only supply for the, of the air, and…</span></p> <p><span id="s256">CS: How did you get air?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">SR: I am going to tell you.</span> <span id="s258">We were suffocating.</span> <span id="s259">You'll see later, a few minutes later, and you know, excuse me, and the boards he covered also with a lot of manure and he left, telling us he had to go away because this, Pepka Rosen [phonetic] with the family was taken away, and he took away the wife and children, and the animals went in the woods, and he came.</span> <span id="s260">In the meantime, we became suffocated.</span> <span id="s261">Without air, it's impossible, for people, like, I saw like sparkles of fire before my eyes, and my head went on a side.</span> <span id="s262">I was sure that I am dying and all of us the same way.</span> <span id="s263">But there was a young boy with a father, he was very strong, he was like 16 or 17 years old, with his head, he went to the sliding board, with his head, he moved, he lifted the board, and came a little bit of air, and we all revived.</span> <span id="s264">At night when our benefactor came in and whistling in the stable and he saw that the board was moved, oh, he was outraged.</span> <span id="s265">He came in and the father of this youngster told him: "Listen your intentions were to kill us.</span> <span id="s266">You know without air, living things can't exist."</span> <span id="s267">He said, "What do you think, I have to be bad as Hitler?"</span> <span id="s268">This was once.</span> <span id="s269">Another time, he opened the, he came to us and he said that he don't want us anymore.</span> <span id="s270">This was on a Sunday morning, I wrote this, I have it here, and he told us to go out and we are now on our knees really, kissing his hand and we are begging him to let us just during the day to stay there and at night, the darkness will cover us so low, and then we will go.</span> <span id="s271">So he let us to go--eh, to stay there with him.</span> <span id="s272">He drew out a knife to my brother, he said he wanted to kill him.</span> <span id="s273">He said, "I am going to kill you."</span> <span id="s274">He was very often drunk.</span> <span id="s275">He had the reputation of a normal person but during the war, he changed.</span> <span id="s276">My brother found out that during the war, no one--he became influenced by Hitler, by the Germans.</span> <span id="s277">The Jewish people are bad people, they are Satan, they kill Jesus, their God, etc., etc.</span> <span id="s278">Later we got another place because--and this was a better place.</span> <span id="s279">It was a basement where it was very cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">CS: How did you get another place?</span> <span id="s281">Did your brother…</span></p> <p><span id="s282">SR: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">CS: Did your brother go out?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">SR: No, in the middle of the night because he gave us very little food and we were dying from hunger.</span> <span id="s285">My brother, yes, with my sister, they risked their lives in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s286">My brother knew somebody, the name was Mamorsky [phonetic].</span> <span id="s287">He was very gentle peasant and my brother with my sister used to come from time to time and they prepared some food for money.</span> <span id="s288">Like he quick made some pies from the stove or something and then my brother went there once and found out that the commandant's wife, she was a teacher, she had the villa not far from this peasant we were hidden at.</span> <span id="s289">She was looking for us.</span> <span id="s290">She knew us, she knew me very well and she knew about the tragedy with my leg.</span> <span id="s291">And she was looking for us.</span> <span id="s292">This woman, when my brother went in the middle of the night for some supplies because we were dying from hunger, so she told my brother that Mrs. Sczychovska [phonetic], was her name, Elena, she was looking for us and she was like a middle woman and she told my husband to come and that my husband came for some food.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">CS: Your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">SR: Yes, my brother.</span> <span id="s295">Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">CS: That's okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">SR: So Mrs. Sczychovska was there and she took us and the same night we went there.</span> <span id="s298">My brother carrying me on his back because I couldn't walk in the woods.</span> <span id="s299">We had to walk through the woods and without the knowledge of this peasant where we were, because he wouldn't let us go.</span> <span id="s300">He didn't know what to do with us.</span> <span id="s301">He didn't want people to know how badly he treats us.</span> <span id="s302">You see, so he wanted us to stay.</span> <span id="s303">He was like, not to live and not to die.</span> <span id="s304">He was awful.</span> <span id="s305">So we went there and she took us in a shelter.</span> <span id="s306">This was a shelter made for other people.</span> <span id="s307">She had 14 people in her house already that year.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">CS: And also these other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">SR: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">CS: The man and his teenage son.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">SR: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">CR: They all came with you too?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">SR: No, they stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">CS: They stayed with the…</span></p> <p><span id="s315">SR: They stayed there with the first benefactor.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">CS: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">SR: Because we were too many people there.</span> <span id="s318">And they didn't have where to go, only my brother knew somebody and we were connected, and he had some business, good business so, she owed my father [probably means brother] 500 zlotys and now later her conscience woke up, and you know, and she said I am going to do something for him, so she took us in.</span> <span id="s319">But it was very cold.</span> <span id="s320">Naturally the food was better you see, she was--the father, the husband was the commandant of the police and she was the teacher.</span> <span id="s321">She had to be close.</span> <span id="s322">This is why the house, they built the house in the woods, and there we stayed but not very long because it was at the end of the war.</span> <span id="s323">And it was also very bad.</span> <span id="s324">Because the Germans moved from Leningrad, in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">CS: So they were retreating?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">SR: Yes.</span> <span id="s327">Retreating and they were standing not far you know, they were scattered in the village and they were in the stable.</span> <span id="s328">You can imagine, and we had to, we had to do there, we had to clean up our bellies where we were sitting.</span> <span id="s329">I can tell you, and when the spring came, manure used to drip on us.</span> <span id="s330">This was life during the occupation.</span> <span id="s331">Some people who were in those camps called concentration, which were built later, and they hear that somebody was hidden, they think we were on roses, you see, and this was like I am telling you how it was.</span> <span id="s332">The other place was also bad, but at least she cooked better, you see it was clean, and to the end of the war, we was there and later we went home.</span> <span id="s333">We went to our house.</span> <span id="s334">The house was damaged completely and we moved to another house and it was not so very badly damaged and we lived there.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">CS: How were you treated by your neighbors when you came back?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">SR: You know what?</span> <span id="s337">They did not want to talk to us, the gentiles.</span> <span id="s338">One woman said--ah, because the father was so religious--and they saw my father, in the window over there with the talis you see and praying, so they said this is miracle because the father was very religious.</span> <span id="s339">Now I would like to tell you about the pictures and about the pictures that are haunting me.</span> <span id="s340">I can still visualize shocking pictures of our barbaric past--the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s341">They are haunting me, compelling me not to forget.</span> <span id="s342">Among others the following come to mind: young mother with the baby in her arms, pressing it to her heart and revealing desperate and forlornness in [unclear] features, crying "Vos makhst du [unclear]."</span> <span id="s343">[What are you doing…] I heard from her that the husband was stoned to death the night before; he went to seek his brother who after the liberation lived in Kielce, city in Poland, where 200 of our people, the survivors, were stoned to death during a pogrom.</span> <span id="s344">A girl looking for her parents, or someone from her family, age 14 and pregnant.</span> <span id="s345">I cannot put it out of mind her distorted features, the distrust in her eyes.</span> <span id="s346">When searching brought only disillusionment, she committed suicide.</span> <span id="s347">A father forced among others to leave his two children to a place where they were taken to crematorium.</span> <span id="s348">About this, told me the father of the children.</span> <span id="s349">I encountered a young woman whose husband I knew.</span> <span id="s350">She was sitting on the ground twisting her fingers, mourning the death of her child.</span> <span id="s351">If I would be blessed with the capability of painting, it would be a good picture to reveal the suffering of the survivors of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s352">When I approached her, she stretched her arms out and said to me, "I cannot forget my baby.</span> <span id="s353">It was pulled from my hands and choked to death."</span> <span id="s354">I learned from her that this happened in the shelter, with a lot of people.</span> <span id="s355">They got panic stricken that the crying of the baby would lead to their discovery.</span> <span id="s356">What an inhuman pain was reflected in her appearance.</span> <span id="s357">Our test is morbid.</span> <span id="s358">We were all stunned but we will strive forth despite the Professor Butz's book that the Holocaust was a farce, a made-up story to bring support for the Jewish homeland in Palestine.</span> <span id="s359">What an insult, how ridiculous, at the time when Germany recognized its crimes, when Minister Adenauer of Germany went to Israel and asked forgiveness.</span> <span id="s360">President Eisenhower showed the places of destruction.</span> <span id="s361">I am coming to the conclusion that these survivors will not die once when time comes, because most of us have died a thousand times already.</span> <span id="s362">It comes to my mind a quotation from Hamlet, by Shakespeare, "In this world are written a thousand deaths."</span> <span id="s363">We survivors of the Holocaust are alive by miracles.</span> <span id="s364">We have the debt to those who innocently died.</span> <span id="s365">It is our duty that the truth be known to the future generations in order to prevent another genocide.</span> <span id="s366">And books like Professor Butz's...</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Tape 1, Side 2:</span></p> <p><span id="s368">CS: Side 2</span></p> <p><span id="s369">SR: We understand human suffering and we will see to it that future generations should be alert, and this way, with God's help, we will not have to face another Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">CS: During the time you were in hiding…</span></p> <p><span id="s371">SR: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">CS: Did you have any communication with the outside world?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">SR: Only through him, through the benefactor.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">CS: Were you aware of what was going on in the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">SR: We knew everything, yes, because he used to come every night about these things.</span> <span id="s376">He was very happy to tell us.</span> <span id="s377">That they shot this one, they shot yesterday this one.</span> <span id="s378">And he was in the middle of the city, in the middle, in the city and he saw the torture and he smiled when he told us of the atrocities they--they made fun.</span> <span id="s379">It was awful just like devils.</span> <span id="s380">All the men they put in the middle of the city, middle of the street.</span> <span id="s381">They cut their beards but with the flesh.</span> <span id="s382">They opened, I am ashamed to say, the zipper and they made fun of the old men.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">CS: And these were German soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">SR: German soldiers.</span> <span id="s385">And I have books I can show you of what I told.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">CS: And your benefactor, did he enjoy--it sounds like he enjoyed telling you this.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">SR: He enjoyed, because he used to go to the city every day.</span> <span id="s388">Coming home…</span></p> <p><span id="s389">CS: Why do you think he told you these things?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">SR: I don't know, he was drunk and he...</span></p> <p><span id="s391">CS: This is the first benefactor?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">SR: The first benefactor.</span> <span id="s393">The other was very nice.</span> <span id="s394">The other was a cultured lady and she was a teacher.</span> <span id="s395">She didn't make fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">CS: What about the news of the war outside Poland?</span> <span id="s397">The Allied invasion, what was happening in Russia?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">SR: Yah, this we knew that Russia is very bad, that Russia has to go w-…</span></p> <p><span id="s399">CS: Did you have a radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">SR: No, no, no, we didn’t, we were disconnected.</span> <span id="s401">The only communication was the drunk peasant who liked very much to [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s402">CS: At what point did you become aware of the death camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">SR: Oh, we knew everything.</span> <span id="s404">We knew that they are taking away, that they are taking away to Belzec, that there was a concentration called already a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s405">That, we knew they are sent, that there were going to be crematoriums.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">CS: So you knew about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">SR: We knew what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">CS: How did you find out?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">SR: You know, this peasant informed us.</span> <span id="s410">But before we went to the shelter, we knew everything because Germany, Hitler begun in Austria, in Vienna.</span> <span id="s411">My father as [unclear] had the Jewish papers and in the paper was always what the news, what the Germans are doing in Vienna.</span> <span id="s412">So we knew that catastrophe is coming; we knew what they were doing in Germany.</span> <span id="s413">They used to punish the people.</span> <span id="s414">They used to beat them and there was a Kristallnacht, it means that Crystal Night, when they came in and it was awful.</span> <span id="s415">They broke the Jewish homes, the windows, stole everything, they tortured people and glass was thrown everywhere.</span> <span id="s416">You saw only glass.</span> <span id="s417">This is why they named this night Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">CS: Were you aware of any resistance groups fighting against the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">SR: No.</span> <span id="s420">We didn't know.</span> <span id="s421">We didn't know.</span> <span id="s422">Later we found out.</span> <span id="s423">We found out about the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, after we went out.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">CS: Was that the end of the war?</span> <span id="s425">You found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">SR: The end of the war.</span> <span id="s427">Yeah, when we came out, when we came out.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">CS: How did you feel when you heard about the Warsaw Ghetto uprising?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">SR: We were very happy that there was an uprising because you know, it was only way to do something to them and we felt, you know, we lost, you know, we lost everyone.</span> <span id="s430">Our dearest people, among them were educated people, and those little children, the Yankele, the Moishele, the Surele [Yiddish diminutive], you know, the names of the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s431">And we were heartbroken, you know, our life was shattered.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">CS: How about after the war.</span> <span id="s433">And this whole experience did it strengthen your faith, did you become less religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">SR: Many people became less religious, among them my husband, of blessed memory.</span> <span id="s435">He was very religious, just as most people in Europe.</span> <span id="s436">But after this, what he saw because he lost his father, his mother and four brothers, and children, their children, two of them slept with him in this camp, forced camp, I have documents about my brother, my husband's brother, and so after the war he said how could a God allow this?</span> <span id="s437">You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">CS: How about you?</span> <span id="s439">How did you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">SR: I think that was the free--that God gives free will to people and they can do with their lives everything.</span> <span id="s441">They can become Satans and they become normal or pious people, more believers or less but still normal people.</span> <span id="s442">And this was, this was a thing of Satan, if there is a Satan, I don't know.</span> <span id="s443">We felt like something was very bad in this world.</span> <span id="s444">And I am a believer because I lived through few miracles and then recently I lived through a miracle [unclear] and still, I don't know, maybe because I am a believer.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">CS: So you continued to be observant?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">SR: Absolutely, I am connected with God, I speak to Him and I go to the shul.</span> <span id="s447">This is the place where were can communicate and helps me because life here was not in roses in America, who knows.</span> <span id="s448">It was very difficult for my husband because he, he also suffered, the same right leg, same place he was wounded.</span> <span id="s449">[laughter]</span></p> <p><span id="s450">CS: Remarkable.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">SR: Yes, it is remarkable, and life wasn't so easy because he became very nervous and I was also sometimes nervous because of the past.</span> <span id="s452">You know, it was too much, too much to endure.</span> <span id="s453">Those who endured, a lot of them they just are, have the nightmares, even now.</span> <span id="s454">My husband used to scream very often at night.</span> <span id="s455">And I used to scream and always lived like somewhere else, I thought that they were going to come.</span> <span id="s456">My husband, a few years ago, woke up very often at night, "Zei cumin!</span> <span id="s457">Zei cumin!</span> <span id="s458">They are coming, they are coming, oh, they are coming, Zahava, they are coming."</span> <span id="s459">I have the Hebrew name, Zahava, they are coming and then I went to him and woke him up and I said, "Where are you, what are you dreaming about."</span> <span id="s460">"They are coming."</span> <span id="s461">He told me he is in the working camp and they are coming to take away the children.</span> <span id="s462">Because he went to Lvov, [renamed Lemberg by Germans] where he had the brother.</span> <span id="s463">The brother with his wife was taken away, there were left two children.</span> <span id="s464">And somebody came, their friends, gentile people in Lemberg and they came and told my husband the two children are alone.</span> <span id="s465">My husband found the Germans with a truck, that was going to Lemberg; he approached them and he told them there are two children of his brother are alone, and my husband cried.</span> <span id="s466">You know some times can move somebody and they took him there and later I don't know how he got back with the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">CS: What made you decide to come to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">SR: Oh, this was the only place that we dreamt of, we dreamed of.</span> <span id="s469">Because it is a country of freedom.</span> <span id="s470">We went to Paris because my husband, as I mentioned before, had a brother in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">CS: You met your husband in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">SR: In Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">CS: After the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">SR: After the war.</span> <span id="s475">Yes.</span> <span id="s476">I was employed in the dispensary.</span> <span id="s477">And I came.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">CS: And you decided you didn't want to stay in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">SR: In Poland, no.</span> <span id="s480">Poland was no--you know no…</span></p> <p><span id="s481">CS: No future?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">SR: No future.</span> <span id="s483">And it happened that I got married in 1947, and my husband had to get the papers for himself.</span> <span id="s484">The brother promised him papers and then we got married, the brother wrote to him that he has a wife.</span> <span id="s485">So we got papers to Paris.</span> <span id="s486">This was a good part of our, you know, after the war.</span> <span id="s487">Paris, you know, is most beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">CS: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">SR: And we revived gradually, gradually we came to our strength mentally and physically, and then was my daughter born in Paris in 1952.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">CS: And then you--had you been thinking all this time about coming to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">SR: Yes, because my husband and myself, we couldn't make a living there.</span> <span id="s492">In Paris you have to make, my brother was a lawyer and you know, if you have a profession it is okay.</span> <span id="s493">And to make a business you know, we didn't have the language and we weren't up to it, so we came to America.</span> <span id="s494">Through HIAS.</span> <span id="s495">That was open to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">CS: And how did you get to Philadelphia?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">SR: We came to New York.</span> <span id="s498">We were promised to Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s499">But when we came to New York, they said, "No, Los Angeles is filled up with those survivors.</span> <span id="s500">You have to go to Philadelphia."</span> <span id="s501">So we came to Philadelphia.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">CS: So HIAS directed you to Philadelphia?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">SR: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">CS: Were they helpful in finding jobs or…</span></p> <p><span id="s505">SR: Yes.</span> <span id="s506">Absolutely!</span></p> <p><span id="s507">CS: Housing?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">SR: There was a small apartment waiting for us.</span> <span id="s509">A room with a kitchen, a kitchenette, a little one.</span> <span id="s510">And we had help, naturally, from the Jewish Family Service.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">CS: How did they help you?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">SR: They gave us weekly or monthly money to live on and they paid for the apartment.</span> <span id="s513">And later on my husband looked for a job and he got a job and he worked all these years in the one place.</span> <span id="s514">They liked him very much.</span> <span id="s515">He was a precise person.</span> <span id="s516">He worked in a bookbinding company.</span> <span id="s517">And he was not a bookbinder.</span> <span id="s518">He was a teacher, he used to teach Hebrew in Poland, but here he got this job.</span> <span id="s519">Novelty Bookbinding Company which now exists but it was sold, and he worked there and they liked him very much.</span> <span id="s520">My husband was also a talmudist.</span> <span id="s521">And…</span></p> <p><span id="s522">CS: Was a what?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">SR: He knew Talmud very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">CS: Oh, a talmudist.</span> <span id="s525">I am sorry, I didn't understand you.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">SR: I shall show you books from the city my husband was born in.</span> <span id="s527">And some other books from there, from the past, from the lost life, like lost the Jews, the Jews who disappeared and you will see pictures showing, pulling there, all atrocities you would find in these books I have.</span> <span id="s528">My husband used to like to buy books and I have many of them.</span> <span id="s529">And I worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">CS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">SR: After the war, in Poland, I was looking for a job.</span> <span id="s532">And I got in a dispensary a job.</span> <span id="s533">A foreman in a dispensary after World War II gave me the opportunity to meet people afflicted in mind and body during the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s534">Scattered remnants of our people were coming home from concentration camps, lonely and sick, looking for family and friends and waiting for them, brought only despair and disillusionment.</span> <span id="s535">Once a youngster who spent his youth at Auschwitz came to the dispensary and approached me asking me if I would get him to the doctor as soon as possible because he felt he was losing his mind.</span> <span id="s536">While speaking in a loud voice he kept on crying.</span> <span id="s537">His posture was trembling.</span> <span id="s538">His hands were shaking like a real old man and although he was only 18 years old, his face was bruised with wrinkles.</span> <span id="s539">I told the doctor about him and went with him to the office.</span> <span id="s540">The doctor himself was a victim of the war, had been taken away during the Russian occupation to Siberia because Poland was also occupied by Russia.</span> <span id="s541">After returning to Poland he was employed in the dispensary, from there he was sent with other doctors to Auschwitz to witness the horrors.</span> <span id="s542">Upon his return he told us about the piles of human hair, eyeglasses, gloves and shoes he saw there.</span> <span id="s543">When I came with this boy, the doctor's face turned ash-gray.</span> <span id="s544">His eyes filled with tears on seeing the real victim of cruelty and inhumanity.</span> <span id="s545">Doctor stood up and greeted him warmly while the boy kept on crying.</span> <span id="s546">For a moment we was silent.</span> <span id="s547">We realized that we were witnessing a child opening his heart without words, trying to free himself from the tragedy of his life.</span> <span id="s548">He looked around suspiciously not believing that he was completely free.</span> <span id="s549">The doctor did everything he could to help him.</span> <span id="s550">The boy kept on coming and became very much attached to the doctor.</span> <span id="s551">Evidently he saw in him the image of a father he longed for.</span> <span id="s552">He could sense the doctor's affection, response and caring.</span> <span id="s553">So every time he came he told of the atrocities he lived through.</span> <span id="s554">He told us about being humiliated, beaten.</span> <span id="s555">About experiments, they putting cold water on him, forcing him to throw himself on his own father, marches to far away places in winter without shoes, and in worn summer clothes and constant hunger.</span> <span id="s556">Those who lost their strength were left to freeze to death.</span> <span id="s557">He continued to come for injections, vitamins, and food distributed in the dispensary.</span> <span id="s558">The food disagreed with him because of years of constant hunger.</span> <span id="s559">He was completely injured, mentally and physically, and he was looking for comfort and restitution.</span> <span id="s560">We were his only family after years of loneliness, torture, and shame.</span> <span id="s561">He was in need of a warm home where he could become normal again.</span> <span id="s562">I have forgotten his name but he is still so close to my heart.</span> <span id="s563">He wrote poems, revealing cruelty and inhumanity and things and conditions of death.</span> <span id="s564">Who knows how many more years this young man had to suffer to be able to face life, and he was not only one.</span> <span id="s565">There were thousands like him.</span> <span id="s566">Who knows if he ever recovered from the horrors of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s567">He stopped coming.</span> <span id="s568">I am sure he went home to Israel and he was helped there with love and understanding, or was it too late?</span> <span id="s569">I hope not.</span> <span id="s570">You want some poems?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">"We Shall Never Forget," by Sophie Roth.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">[Do I have to say it or not?]</span> <span id="s573">We shall never forget the young and the old Who died from Nazi’s hands in misery and

to me by somebody who lives here in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s652">He is a builder of houses, rental houses.</span> <span id="s653">This was his brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">CS: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">SR: The aunt of this Yankele, the name of the boy written about, told me the story, and when it was told I wrote it down.</span> <span id="s656">And this was published in our Bulletin.</span> <span id="s657">The Bulletin I mean of our survivors...</span></p> <p><span id="s658">CS: Your survivors group.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">SR: Yes.</span> <span id="s660">Do you want to hear it?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">CS: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">SR: Okay.</span> <span id="s663">"The year was 1939 and the month September.</span> <span id="s664">Autumn was already there.</span> <span id="s665">It was calm, beautiful and cold.</span> <span id="s666">One could smell fragrances from the abandoned flowers and trees.</span> <span id="s667">Yankele was then ten years old, and his perception with the world was one of confusion.</span> <span id="s668">For the events were at that time overwhelmed with turmoil, in which daily life patterns changed rapidly.</span> <span id="s669">The war broke out, with frequent German bombing.</span> <span id="s670">The bombing shook buildings like trees before the storm in the wind.</span> <span id="s671">The inhabitants took shelter in basements.</span> <span id="s672">Shortly after the numerous bombings, Russians suddenly marched in, producing feelings of relief and hope.</span> <span id="s673">However, relief and admiration changed to fear.</span> <span id="s674">For in the middle of the night, the police bombarded the homes of the rich, forced them out of that, jamming them into locked cattle cars, heading for Siberia.</span> <span id="s675">It was difficult for Yankele to understand such action and equal difficult the screams of anguish about it.</span> <span id="s676">When Yankele was 12 years old, the Germans attacked again.</span> <span id="s677">Ukrainian and German soldiers invaded Jewish homes, taking fathers away from their families, assuring the crying and pleading children and wives of their safe return.</span> <span id="s678">However, no one was ever seen again.</span> <span id="s679">Later ghettos were formed, which isolated the Jews from the outside world.</span> <span id="s680">That, hunger, hatred, cruel punishment, overwhelmed the people.</span> <span id="s681">Yankele was there with his parents and family.</span> <span id="s682">Soon he lost his father who could not endure the hard labors, constant hunger, and humiliation.</span> <span id="s683">By good fortune was Yankele's family was able to contact a peasant who was eager for money.</span> <span id="s684">He helped them escape, first into the woods and then rented an apartment on the outskirts of the city, moved there himself, and made a shelter for Yankele's family.</span> <span id="s685">Their living conditions improved but their benefactor demanded more money.</span> <span id="s686">Yankele's mother did have money hidden in their house, but to go back there was most dangerous.</span> <span id="s687">Yankele strongly opposed that his mother should carry out this dangerous mission and insisted that he should go in her place accompanied by the peasant, but keeping some distance from him.</span> <span id="s688">Yankele was recognized by a former classmate of his who promptly announced his presence to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s689">Yankele pretended he did not understand the German officer.</span> <span id="s690">A translator was brought in and he interrogated him for three days in the hopes that Yankele would confess and reveal his family hideout.</span> <span id="s691">Yankele endured the harsh questions, the harsh questioning, not betraying his family, insisting that he was not a Jew.</span> <span id="s692">A local doctor was brought in to confirm his ethnic identity.</span> <span id="s693">He stated that Yankele was not a Jew, risking his own life.</span> <span id="s694">The Nazi interrogator then gave his verdict explaining that Yankele would be sent to a labor camp in Germany with other orphans, and that he could put on his hat and leave.</span> <span id="s695">Yankele, understanding German, but forgetting his previous pretense, hastily put on his hat.</span> <span id="s696">Momentarily it was obvious that Yankele had been lying to them, thus Yankele was tortured and shot."</span> <span id="s697">[Machine turned off and then on.]</span></p> <p><span id="s698">SR: After I lost my leg and it was healed, I call it the miracle, or its [unclear].</span> <span id="s699">We have to survive and go on with life something happens.</span> <span id="s700">I myself being very religious, I thought this, I am thinking, this is a miracle.</span> <span id="s701">I was sitting on the porch and my legs were covered with a shawl and it began to rain.</span> <span id="s702">And as I told before, we lived on the outskirts.</span> <span id="s703">A woman from Lvov came to shop some products like eggs, milk etc., and she was in a mourning outfit because her husband was an officer and he died in the army, so she was left with children.</span> <span id="s704">And she came by to shop something.</span> <span id="s705">Chickens and stuff like that...</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Tape 2, Side 1:</span></p> <p><span id="s707">SR: When my stump was healed I was sitting on the porch and it was raining.</span> <span id="s708">A woman dressed in mourning clothes, I found out her husband was an officer and he died, and she came from a bigger city where she could not get anything, any articles to eat, and she came to shop.</span> <span id="s709">While she was standing outside in the rain, my mother called her in and told her, "Why do you stay so far, come into the porch," and she came.</span> <span id="s710">She noticed right away that the one leg was missing, because you know there was an emptiness where the shawl covered, and my mother told her to rest, and she knew a lot, because she saw what went on with the Jews in Lemberg, and she promised she would send me an address to a prosthetist and he does a very good job.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">CS: What year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">SR: What year?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">CS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">SR: I think it was 1943, I think, or 1942, because my leg was healed already.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">CS: So before you went into hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">SR: Before, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">CS: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">SR: Later on I had this prosthesis when I went to--and she kept her promise and she went home, she got the address and they got to me the address to a prosthetist.</span> <span id="s719">And now I had to send somebody.</span> <span id="s720">You see I couldn't go to him.</span> <span id="s721">Back then no one, no Jewish person could travel there.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">CS: It was dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">SR: It was very dangerous, so I had, I know German, and the next farm was a boy maybe 14 or 15 years old, a Pole, and he wanted to know German.</span> <span id="s724">Why?</span> <span id="s725">He thought that, he's going to have a position in the post office or something that he needed German, they thought that Germany would stay there, you know.</span> <span id="s726">He was like thinking of it.</span> <span id="s727">So he came with his sister every second day and I taught him German, and he brought me food.</span> <span id="s728">And I told him, no money, whatever he could get at home.</span> <span id="s729">It was a very big farm.</span> <span id="s730">And when he found out that I need somebody to send for the prosthetist to Lemberg, he volunteered and he said, "I shall go."</span> <span id="s731">His name was Mikasch [phonetic].</span> <span id="s732">He was a very nice boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">CS: A Polish boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">SR: A Polish boy, and he left, and he came with him the same day.</span> <span id="s735">I wondered, the same day, that he came with him?</span> <span id="s736">And when the Polish prosthetist came in--why I underscore Polish, because she was a Ukrainian, and she told me to take the Polish, the Pole.</span> <span id="s737">And then he came in and he said, "I can't understand, you are Jewish.</span> <span id="s738">What is for you, because he really cry before me, he told me that this was such a young person without the leg, and please and please, and he made me, he forced me to go, and I left everything and I came here."</span> <span id="s739">And he took the measurements, and in two weeks I had the prosthesis.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">CS: It's unbelievable that a young boy would care so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">SR: Yes.</span> <span id="s742">One miracle that she was there and, you see, the woman who--you know, we were disconnected with the outside, the Jewish life was so very limited that we couldn't travel, we couldn't go nowhere.</span> <span id="s743">It was curfew at night, you could not walk only until this hour, and then we couldn't walk on the pavement.</span> <span id="s744">A Jew wasn't allowed any such.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">CS: The degradation.</span> <span id="s746">You knowing this.</span> <span id="s747">The humiliation.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">SR: Such degradation and humiliation, awful.</span> <span id="s749">So he came and he brought me the prosthesis, and naturally it is not one I'm now having, you see it looks elegant just almost like a leg.</span> <span id="s750">It was with iron, iron on the one side, a big piece of iron on the one side, and the other side, but I was there helpless.</span> <span id="s751">My father died in the meantime and I took his cane and I said, "Oh, God, Daddy help me, I am taking your cane and let me walk."</span> <span id="s752">And I walked with that cane.</span> <span id="s753">And whenever we had to leave the house, I didn't need the crutches.</span> <span id="s754">Because the crutches were out of working for me.</span> <span id="s755">I couldn't stand it.</span> <span id="s756">For me it was a real miracle.</span> <span id="s757">Then the boy used to come, you see, and I had the prosthesis.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">CS: The second miracle.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">SR: Yah.</span> <span id="s760">And one was when they found another house and they came to us telling us, taking off a load of trouble from our backs, because we thought we were going to be shot.</span> <span id="s761">They found another house.</span> <span id="s762">It was too--I think there was something else, too.</span> <span id="s763">But just finding a place was a miracle, you know, they didn't--no one wanted the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">CS: Well, it was also dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">SR: It was very dangerous.</span> <span id="s766">I understand, I understood them, that they were afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">CS: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">SR: They could even kill.</span> <span id="s769">If somebody was disobedient their rules, their rules for killing.</span> <span id="s770">I have something from my husband.</span> <span id="s771">Do you want to read?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">CS: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">SR: What I am going to read now is from my husband, Chaim Roth, what he told me, and I wrote it.</span> <span id="s774">"With my memories retro I am coming to events that took place during the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s775">I would like to share them.</span> <span id="s776">I see myself after escaping with most horrible difficulties from forced labor camp and due to unendurable situation was forced to return there, to the labor camp.</span> <span id="s777">Here is my other statement.</span> <span id="s778">Alone in the woods and looking for a way home where my father built, with the help of an engineer, a shelter in the open.</span> <span id="s779">The entrance was so concealed that nobody could imagine that people could live there.</span> <span id="s780">I was a few days without food and not knowing which way to turn.</span> <span id="s781">It was Sunday.</span> <span id="s782">The darkness covered the world.</span> <span id="s783">From far I noticed two eyes approaching me.</span> <span id="s784">I knew it was a wolf.</span> <span id="s785">I was sure that the end of my miserable life is very close.</span> <span id="s786">I contemplated my bad luck.</span> <span id="s787">I escaped with extreme difficulties and insecurity, not knowing what lies ahead to me, from the [unclear] established labor camp and here waited me death from a wolf.</span> <span id="s788">This fear enveloped me.</span> <span id="s789">I began to cry and say the Shema Yisroel.</span> <span id="s790">I turned my head back to make sure if the wolf was following me; there was no wolf.</span> <span id="s791">With sweat on my whole body, I was fumbling over broken branches not knowing which way to go.</span> <span id="s792">I walked crying not being able to forget the wolf's eyes.</span> <span id="s793">I was there completely alone, comparing myself to Robinson Crusoe.</span> <span id="s794">Suddenly appeared a young boy telling me that on the bridge that I have to pass is standing a policeman.</span> <span id="s795">He showed me a shorter way to my home.</span> <span id="s796">When I came there an old Ukrainian was living there already.</span> <span id="s797">It was raining and dark.</span> <span id="s798">Knowing where my father of blessed memory kept tools, I went there, and when I almost began to sleep, I heard the door opening.</span> <span id="s799">The peasant ordered me to leave right away.</span> <span id="s800">I pleaded to let me go to the shelter.</span> <span id="s801">He forced me to leave in torrential rain and immediately.</span> <span id="s802">Since the labor camp was not far, I went back because I felt that loneliness would drive me out of my mind.</span> <span id="s803">The head of this part of forced labor camp, seeing my appearance, simulated that he did not notice my absence.</span> <span id="s804">So I was with people again.</span> <span id="s805">The odyssey is not finished.</span> <span id="s806">I had to endure a lot until I was freed.</span> <span id="s807">I cannot forget this so horrible feeling.</span> <span id="s808">We have to hope that peace will come soon to the world."</span></p> <p><span id="s809">CS: And this is, this is your husband's experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">SR: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">CS: During the

back.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">CS: Would have been terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">SR: He went home where he had the shelter the father built with the engineer, and the stove, but there was living already an Ukrainian and he didn't let him in, in torrential rain he told him back, you have to go, and he went back and the head of the concentration--of this camp--saw how he looked, so he made believe like he had not seen and he was with people again.</span> <span id="s817">You see, people can't be alone.</span> <span id="s818">You know about Robinson Crusoe, he found a friend Friday and called him Friday.</span> <span id="s819">He was also was lost.</span> <span id="s820">We can't be without--[Machine off and then on.]</span> <span id="s821">"Reflections: What is dying and how does it affect me?</span> <span id="s822">These questions often come to mind.</span> <span id="s823">It is impossible to forget the horrors of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s824">The memories are so severely real that it seems like it happened yesterday, not forty some years ago.</span> <span id="s825">When we were young, we were eager to forget the atrocities of the past and go on with our lives.</span> <span id="s826">With age, the cruel memories are coming back to haunt us, like a shadow it becomes our constant companion forcing us to think of our loved ones, changed to ashes, of place and mass graves.</span> <span id="s827">Forcing us to think back to a time of insanity when we cried to the heavens to stop the planet and let us get off.</span> <span id="s828">Now we must think of our loved ones in our present, our children and their grandchildren.</span> <span id="s829">Their future freedom and their well-being must be insured.</span> <span id="s830">Thus we must put a stop to the ever-increasing activities of the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi groups."</span> <span id="s831">I have a lot of this.</span> <span id="s832">Small writings.</span> <span id="s833">I think it's okay.</span> <span id="s834">"Reflections" by me.</span> <span id="s835">Do I have to say my name?</span></p> <p><span id="s836">"As we came to face old age, true, not old as yet.</span> <span id="s837">Dependable era of our lives because of the decline of strength.</span> <span id="s838">How true sounds the prayer, "Do not forsake us, oh God, in old age."</span> <span id="s839">So deserved repose gets often disturbed by family troubles, or by sickness, or both.</span> <span id="s840">Before us in the lonely hours unfolds a film from our past.</span> <span id="s841">Our brain recorded our lives from early beginning and now it plays back.</span> <span id="s842">And we learn with a wise wisdom about ourselves.</span> <span id="s843">The errors and misgivings are forcing a deep sigh.</span> <span id="s844">In a new country we were not prepared to the assignments that time would, that time put before us.</span> <span id="s845">We were not ready to face the problems with a change of times set before us.</span> <span id="s846">As remnants from the Holocaust we had to rebuild our broken lives and adjust ourselves to new situations and circumstances.</span> <span id="s847">I hear often saying that friends are here not the same as they were in the old country.</span> <span id="s848">Life is here different.</span> <span id="s849">So our friends are different.</span> <span id="s850">What makes the difference, mostly the tempo.</span> <span id="s851">From my point of view, there is felt a lack of romanticism and fantasy, because this is what adds beauty to life.</span> <span id="s852">I notice that some families do not have time for their children and themselves.</span> <span id="s853">The tempo kills their pleasure and tranquility, so very much needed for a normal life.</span> <span id="s854">And this is happening to children.</span> <span id="s855">They think that we give them everything by giving them material necessities, but often the spirituality is lacking.</span> <span id="s856">Yes, we were, with exceptions, not right enough for the new life that we encountered here.</span> <span id="s857">Our life was shattered because of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s858">The film further unfolds before us pictures of rigor, hope, prayers, and desires that accompanied our young years.</span> <span id="s859">A painful nostalgia envelopes and we feel that, we feel the hardship of old age.</span> <span id="s860">That knowledge means that we will not be able to feel the pleasures and risk walking [phone rings] [unclear].</span>
