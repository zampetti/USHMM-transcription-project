Kacey Bayles on August 8th, 2012 in the museum's northeast regional office in New York City.</span> <span id="s13">Mr. Hamberg, please state your name.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Answer: My name is Eric Hamberg, middle initial J.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: And when and where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: I was born in a town in Germany called Mannheim, M-A-N-N-H-E-I-M.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: But I did not live there.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: Where did you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: I lived across the river in a town called Ludwigshafen, L-U-D-W-I-G-S-H-A-F-E-N.</span> <span id="s21">This means the harbor of Ludwig, on the Rhein River.</span> <span id="s22">It's -- the town is known as Ludwigshafen am Rhein, compared to Ludwigshafen on the Bodensee, which is down by Switzerland.</span> <span id="s23">Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s25">Would you tell me about your family?</span> <span id="s26">Would you describe your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: I was born the second child of my parents.</span> <span id="s28">My father's name was Julius Hamberger.</span> <span id="s29">Our family name at that time was Hamberger.</span> <span id="s30">And my mother was Anne.</span> <span id="s31">Joanne -- actually was Joanna, but she called herself Anne.</span> <span id="s32">And my father when I was born was 39 years old.</span> <span id="s33">My mother was 27.</span> <span id="s34">12 years difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: And what was their business?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: My father owned a fairly large store in Ludwigshafen.</span> <span id="s37">Men's and boys' clothing.</span> <span id="s38">We sold everything except shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: And what languages were spoken at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: At home, we spoke German.</span> <span id="s41">My father spoke five languages, but he didn't teach us the other four.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: And can you describe life at home?</span> <span id="s43">Did they have --</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: -- friends over?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: I have a sister, who is one year and two months older than I am.</span> <span id="s47">She is still alive, thank God.</span> <span id="s48">She lives in California now.</span> <span id="s49">And she came to America before I did.</span> <span id="s50">I also had a little brother who was just about the same amount of time, about a year and six months younger than I was.</span> <span id="s51">He died before he was two years old.</span> <span id="s52">He is buried in a cemetery in Ludwigshafen.</span> <span id="s53">I remember my little brother being very sick and he had the measles.</span> <span id="s54">And according to the doctor at that time, he didn't keep himself warm, he kicked the blankets off and he caught pneumonia and that was the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: And what was -- you know, what was it like in your home?</span> <span id="s56">Did your parents have friends over?</span> <span id="s57">Did they play cards?</span> <span id="s58">What did they do?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: My father owned two buildings.</span> <span id="s60">We lived in one of them.</span> <span id="s61">It was an apartment house building.</span> <span id="s62">There were five floors.</span> <span id="s63">No elevator.</span> <span id="s64">We lived on the second floor.</span> <span id="s65">There was a store on the first floor and an apartment.</span> <span id="s66">And we had a lovely, lovely apartment.</span> <span id="s67">I must say my father was quite wealthy.</span> <span id="s68">And according to my mother, at one time he was worth a half a million marks.</span> <span id="s69">Not dollars, but marks.</span> <span id="s70">Whatever that means at that particular time, it's still a lot of money.</span> <span id="s71">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Did you go to school there?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: Did I what?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Did you go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Did I go to school there?</span> <span id="s76">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s77">I went to first the normal -- what they call it, the -- UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Elementary school.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: -- elementary school for four years.</span> <span id="s79">We were only boys, which was the norm over there.</span> <span id="s80">We were approximately 45 young boys.</span> <span id="s81">And I stayed there for four years.</span> <span id="s82">Now, in Germany, if you don't want to go to high school, you don't have to, but you have to go eight years for public school.</span> <span id="s83">My father and mother thought I should get a better education, so at the fifth grade, which would be here, I started my first year of high school.</span> <span id="s84">High school in Germany was six years.</span> <span id="s85">So when I graduated high school, and I must say I was the only Jewish boy in the whole town who graduated high school because the other ones were all taken out of the high school before because of Hitler.</span> <span id="s86">But I lived on the other side of the track.</span> <span id="s87">Not only that, I might as well get this straight, there's no sense lying about it.</span> <span id="s88">My mother was a converted Jew.</span> <span id="s89">My father went into the war in 1914, '14 to '18, World War I.</span> <span id="s90">He has a business already.</span> <span id="s91">And my mother was his top sales girl and they also fell in love.</span> <span id="s92">When he was in the service, she went to the rabbi -- and I have the papers home -- and took Hebrew lessons and converted Judaism.</span> <span id="s93">Now, this I mention because it -- later on, it comes out that that gave my father and mother a tremendous plus because she was in Hitler's sight an Aryan no matter what the religion was.</span> <span id="s94">Just like the opposite side, if you were Jewish and converted to Christianity and Hitler came, you were a Jew no matter what.</span> <span id="s95">So that's where we were.</span> <span id="s96">And in high school, our high school happened to be the same school that Chancellor Kohl went to, who was the Reich's chancellor.</span> <span id="s97">My claim to fame.</span> <span id="s98">And we were 50 boys.</span> <span id="s99">I was the only Jewish boy in the whole high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: So did you have non-Jewish friends in high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s102">As a matter of fact, if you want to know the truth, in my class we had about 10 or 11 -- I'm not sure anymore, I think it was 10 -- 10 fellows who were like the gang.</span> <span id="s103">When I say gang, it's not like a gang here.</span> <span id="s104">We did all kinds of stupid things like, you know, if it was a real hot day and we wanted to get the afternoon off, we put a fire underneath the baskets in the school yard.</span> <span id="s105">Was made out of metal, you know, so they said, "Get home, alright."</span> <span id="s106">And I was one of them.</span> <span id="s107">I was never called upon to be anything different but a student and a buddy.</span> <span id="s108">In my class of 50 students, I had no enemy but one, if you want to call it an enemy.</span> <span id="s109">There was one fellow in the class, I remember blond hair and glasses, he looked like a real future priest.</span> <span id="s110">I mean, you know, that holiness about him.</span> <span id="s111">And ever so often, he would say, "I hate you, Eric, I hate you."</span> <span id="s112">I says, "Why do you hate me?"</span> <span id="s113">"Because you killed my Jesus."</span> <span id="s114">I said, "Hans, I didn't kill your Jesus.</span> <span id="s115">That happened thousands of years ago."</span> <span id="s116">"Your people killed my Jesus and you're a Jew, so you killed my Jesus."</span> <span id="s117">Naturally, this is all in German.</span> <span id="s118">You want to hear it in German?</span> <span id="s119">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">[Laughter]</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: And I finally got sick and tired of him and I said, "Look, Hans."</span> <span id="s122">I said, "You want to make a fight out of it?</span> <span id="s123">I'll fight you."</span> <span id="s124">I'm a little guy.</span> <span id="s125">I was only about four -- four -- 5'2".</span> <span id="s126">I grew up a little more later on.</span> <span id="s127">And he says, "No, I don't want to fight you, but you killed my Jesus.‚Äù</span> <span id="s128">It came to a point where I asked my Hebrew schoolteacher, who also was the cantor of our organi- -- of our temple, "What am I going to do with this kid?"</span> <span id="s129">He says, "Well, just tell him Jesus Christ was a Jew."</span> <span id="s130">I was floored.</span> <span id="s131">I was stunned.</span> <span id="s132">I had no idea.</span> <span id="s133">And I went to Hebrew school since I was six years old.</span> <span id="s134">I says, "Are you sure?"</span> <span id="s135">He says, "Absolutely."</span> <span id="s136">So the next time I was told, Eric, I hate you because you killed my Jesus, I says, "Do you hate all the Jews?"</span> <span id="s137">He says, "Yes."</span> <span id="s138">I said, "Then you must hate Jesus Christ."</span> <span id="s139">"What are you saying?"</span> <span id="s140">I says, "Jesus Christ was a Jew."</span> <span id="s141">"You're out of your mind.</span> <span id="s142">"I says, "Go and ask your father, your priest or anybody you want."</span> <span id="s143">That was the last time I heard from him.</span> <span id="s144">This was just a little episode that I like to tell because it was, to me, very satisfying to find out that Jesus Christ was a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: Certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: I graduated there in 1937.</span> <span id="s147">Hitler came into power in '33.</span> <span id="s148">And my other friends -- I had a lot of Jewish friends from the temple.</span> <span id="s149">We used to go to temple in the morning.</span> <span id="s150">And then in the afternoon, the children would come and we have like a children's service which I used to lead quite often.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: How -- was your family observant?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: We had a kosher household, but we were not orthodox.</span> <span id="s153">We had milchig and fleishig, pieces of cutlery.</span> <span id="s154">And we had for Pesach special things.</span> <span id="s155">And milchig and fleishig was separate.</span> <span id="s156">As a matter of fact, I always pointed out we had an ice box.</span> <span id="s157">At that time there's no refrigeration.</span> <span id="s158">We had a double ice box for milchig and fleishig.</span> <span id="s159">You understand milchig and fleishig, yes?</span> <span id="s160">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">[Laughter]</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s164">And used to put blocks of ice underneath into, and that kept it cold.</span> <span id="s165">But I don't -- it had -- I don't know anybody else that had the combination of these two different things.</span> <span id="s166">Our -- what shall I say, when -- when you -- when you dry the dishes, your hand -- hand things, blue was for milchig and red was for fleishig.</span> <span id="s167">So, I mean, we kept all this, but we were not orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Let me continue.</span> <span id="s170">The other children, yeah, Jewish children -- Ludwigshafen, my home town, was cut in half by the railroad.</span> <span id="s171">The railroad was only one block of the apartment house where we lived in.</span> <span id="s172">The other apartment house that my father owned had 16 apartments.</span> <span id="s173">They were smaller apartments.</span> <span id="s174">And it was also the apartment where the ground floor, my father's store was located.</span> <span id="s175">It was a big store.</span> <span id="s176">Yeah.</span> <span id="s177">The other part of the children lived on the other side.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: My father supplied a factory, which was located in my home town, and is called -- UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: IG Farben?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: A -- UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: IG Farben?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: No, BASF?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: BASF.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: Badische Anilin- und Soda-Fabrik, BASF.</span> <span id="s186">Have it here in the United States, all over the place.</span> <span id="s187">All right.</span> <span id="s188">Tremendous place.</span> <span id="s189">And what they specialized in was colors, dyes, and any kind of liquid medication.</span> <span id="s190">And my father supplied the uniforms.</span> <span id="s191">This factory is probably half the size of my town of Union where I live.</span> <span id="s192">It was like a city.</span> <span id="s193">We -- I was once there and they took us for a ride around.</span> <span id="s194">Took us four hours.</span> <span id="s195">And so he -- he made good money.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Did your family have non-Jewish friends as well in the area?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Those nine kids in the gang were all my friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: But did your parents have non-Jewish friends?</span> <span id="s199">Family friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: Not many, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s201">Very few.</span> <span id="s202">My father was a very generous man.</span> <span id="s203">We had a lot of people coming from Poland, Jewish people.</span> <span id="s204">And they came to my father and they said, "Can you give us some of your clothes that you sell here and give us a little discount and then we can go and peddle it and charge like three or four marks," you know.</span> <span id="s205">And my father said, "I'll help you."</span> <span id="s206">And he did.</span> <span id="s207">And they paid him slow but sure, but then when Hitler came, he lost thousands and thousands of dollars.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Do you remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: But --</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Sorry.</span> <span id="s211">Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s213">While I was the only one on my side, there was others in the school before me, but not since I went to high school.</span> <span id="s214">Except one time my cousin came to live with us for a year, so he went to the same school.</span> <span id="s215">But otherwise, I was the only Jewish boy.</span> <span id="s216">Talking about non-Jewish friends, when we graduated in the high school, we wore for six years caps with a brim.</span> <span id="s217">Not like here.</span> <span id="s218">They were more like military caps.</span> <span id="s219">And in the first year, they were red.</span> <span id="s220">Red.</span> <span id="s221">And there was a band around it and it was red and green and white.</span> <span id="s222">In the second year, it was the same red cap, but it was red and blue and white.</span> <span id="s223">Okay?</span> <span id="s224">Third and fourth years, the caps became green, also with a change of things.</span> <span id="s225">And in the fifth year, it was blue with it.</span> <span id="s226">When you graduated, for one day only you got a white cap.</span> <span id="s227">Halleluiah.</span> <span id="s228">We made it.</span> <span id="s229">All right?</span> <span id="s230">And what you did on that day that you -- after you had your white hat, you got a cane, you know, like a heavier cane like the men used to do.</span> <span id="s231">And you wore your white cap and you marched through town.</span> <span id="s232">And I marched through town with nine of my gang friends.</span> <span id="s233">And we came to a, what shall I say, like a bar, like a -- well, a drink, drink place, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Pub.</span> <span id="s235">Pub.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: A pub, sort of like it, but you could get food there too.</span> <span id="s237">And on the pub, on the outside, it says Juden nicht erwunscht.</span> <span id="s238">"Jews are not wanted here.</span> <span id="s239">"So they said, "Come on, let's go.</span> <span id="s240">We're going to drink a little bit."</span> <span id="s241">I was never a drinker.</span> <span id="s242">I says, "I don't want to go in there because they don't want me."</span> <span id="s243">"What do you mean?</span> <span id="s244">This?"</span> <span id="s245">They ripped it off the wall.</span> <span id="s246">"You go on."</span> <span id="s247">So I went.</span> <span id="s248">And when we were chugalugging, you know, somebody says, "Eric, come on, you and me."</span> <span id="s249">Well, I was -- I was half soused by the time I got out of there and I never -- never was a drinker.</span> <span id="s250">It was ridiculous.</span> <span id="s251">So then they said, "All right, we'll go to a movie now."</span> <span id="s252">We had a beautiful big movies house.</span> <span id="s253">UFA, I remember.</span> <span id="s254">United -- it wouldn't be united.</span> <span id="s255">Whatever.</span> <span id="s256">And they said, "Okay, we going to see the movie."</span> <span id="s257">I says, "I can't go."</span> <span id="s258">"Why?</span> <span id="s259">It doesn't say anything."</span> <span id="s260">I said, "I don't have money."</span> <span id="s261">So this was in 1937.</span> <span id="s262">So they said, "Okay, okay, so you don't go, it's okay."</span> <span id="s263">I says, "At least go there and buy some tickets."</span> <span id="s264">So they gave me money and they said, "That's just enough for all the tickets.</span> <span id="s265">All right?"</span> <span id="s266">And I get up the money to go there.</span> <span id="s267">She gave me ten tickets.</span> <span id="s268">They paid for me to go with them.</span> <span id="s269">This was my gang.</span> <span id="s270">I can't say anything else.</span> <span id="s271">They were all my friends to the day that I came back to Germany years and years later.</span> <span id="s272">They announced in the local paper that three Jewish people -- one was a woman, myself, and another fellow who happened to be my best friend, but he lived on the other side of the track.</span> <span id="s273">And I have to think.</span> <span id="s274">One second.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: When you went back, these same --</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s277">It was announced in the paper that I was coming.</span> <span id="s278">When we landed there, we were invited by the mayor of the town.</span> <span id="s279">It's a pretty big town.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Now, actually, I want to, if you don't mind, hold this story until later on because I wanted -- I want to hold this story until later in the interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: Because I want to jump back to 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Just so we can stay in chrono- -- in chronological order.</span> <span id="s285">And I want to hear that later on.</span> <span id="s286">But do you remember when Hitler came to power in 1933?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: And what was the mood in your community at that point in --</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Very happy, because if you weren't happy, you could have been dead.</span> <span id="s290">I mean, Hitler came to power by -- I mean, he started really way before that.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: But by that time, you saw practically every day the stormtroopers marching through town with the flags and with their sabers on their side.</span> <span id="s293">Not sabers exactly, only a -- a knife like that.</span> <span id="s294">And we were on one of the main streets in town, so we saw it all.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: And, wait, one minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: And I remember that -- I think it was in 1933 that he used, like the chancellor, we had at that time a man in power in Germany, was an ex-general.</span> <span id="s299">He was still a general, but only by name, Hindenburg, von Hindenburg.</span> <span id="s300">All right.</span> <span id="s301">Von Hindenburg was more or less forced to appoint him, but he had to be put into power by the people.</span> <span id="s302">And everybody knew you better vote for Hitler because if you vote against them, they'll know.</span> <span id="s303">You may think you fold the paper and put it in, they'll know.</span> <span id="s304">Well, he was elected 99 percent of the people.</span> <span id="s305">And after that, things slowly began to change.</span> <span id="s306">They started the Hitler Youth, all with uniforms and the bars across and very nice uniforms.</span> <span id="s307">At the end of my stay in high school, every one of my student friends, including my gang friends, were in the Hitler Youth.</span> <span id="s308">Didn't affect anybody, not even me.</span> <span id="s309">And then the girls started coming along, which was called BDM.</span> <span id="s310">BDM.</span> <span id="s311">Stands for Bund Deutsche Matrone.</span> <span id="s312">Organization of German girls.</span> <span id="s313">And then it came around, you know, like the edict, the boys and the girls, they can go to camp together and they can sleep together because we want to have pure Aryan people coming around and having children.</span> <span id="s314">And then the communists slowly but surely were either killed off or sent to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s315">I remember coming home from school and there was a big sign on one of the walls.</span> <span id="s316">And it must have had about 60 pictures of dead Nazis, only they weren't called Nazis.</span> <span id="s317">All these people were killed by the communists.</span> <span id="s318">It was really -- I mean, you looked at this, and if you weren't German for Hitler, your blood started to boil.</span> <span id="s319">You know, the faces were all smashed in and all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s320">Now, the concentration camp of Dachau, which is in Bavaria, near Munich, at first the only people in there were communists and Jews.</span> <span id="s321">Not Jews because they were Jewish, but Jews because they were also communists or against Hitler.</span> <span id="s322">In 1937 when I graduated high school, Hitler at that time was in a position where I knew and my father knew and every Jewish person knew that there was going to be a war because you had to save everything that had metal.</span> <span id="s323">Like toothpaste came in a metal, you know, thing.</span> <span id="s324">You squeezed it out and you had to put it on the side.</span> <span id="s325">Anything that contained metal you had to save and you had to turn it in.</span> <span id="s326">By '37, my mother sent me to the headquarters.</span> <span id="s327">I had to turn in all the gold and silver we had.</span> <span id="s328">By '37, I realized I'd better get out of Germany fast.</span> <span id="s329">I was 16 years old.</span> <span id="s330">And what am I going to do?</span> <span id="s331">So I was advised by the Jewish people and the offices there to learn a trade.</span> <span id="s332">Naturally, I was supposed to take over my father's store, would have been a wonderful thing, but that was out.</span> <span id="s333">Already the SA men were standing in front of the store.</span> <span id="s334">Don't buy from the Jew.</span> <span id="s335">Nobody was let in.</span> <span id="s336">So my father had to close up.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: When did that happen, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: This was right after I graduated. '</span> <span id="s339">37, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: And -- I'm trying to follow what I was saying here.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: You had to take a --</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: Oh, yeah, Hitler, Hitler.</span> <span id="s344">When I was -- this -- this is -- this is a very cute story.</span> <span id="s345">You have to look at it from a -- from a comic point.</span> <span id="s346">It wasn't funny, but you have to look at it.</span> <span id="s347">My brother was buried in a cemetery in Ludwigshafen.</span> <span id="s348">In the regular cemetery, the Jewish people had a special section.</span> <span id="s349">It had a gate.</span> <span id="s350">You could either get a key to go and see your beloved one who was buried there or you could ask somebody, the office.</span> <span id="s351">And I knew exactly where my brother was buried.</span> <span id="s352">And my mother -- and in Germany, if you go to a cemetery, every grave is a display garden.</span> <span id="s353">If you've never seen it, you just stand there, oh, my God.</span> <span id="s354">Planted -- naturally, it's -- I'm talking about summertime.</span> <span id="s355">Planted with the most gorgeous flowers and little bushes and everything else.</span> <span id="s356">Pictures of -- of beauty, really.</span> <span id="s357">And my mother one day -- and we used to go there like once a month or every other -- every other week or something.</span> <span id="s358">And she says, "I bought some flowers yesterday."</span> <span id="s359">She says, "Eric, please take it to Werner."</span> <span id="s360">My brother was Werner.</span> <span id="s361">"Take it to the cemetery and plant them."</span> <span id="s362">I said, "Okay, Ma."</span> <span id="s363">I took my little package with the flowers over into the cemetery, I planted the flowers and I'm coming back.</span> <span id="s364">Now, the street that I'm usually taking to coming back was full of people.</span> <span id="s365">Wasn't there when I went down there.</span> <span id="s366">I says, "What's going on?"</span> <span id="s367">"Hitler's coming.</span> <span id="s368">Hitler's coming."</span> <span id="s369">I says, "Oh, my God.</span> <span id="s370">What I am going to do?</span> <span id="s371">Am I going to run backwards?</span> <span id="s372">Forwards?"</span> <span id="s373">I always -- and even I show you pictures -- always wear leather pants, short leather pants with the -- UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Suspenders?</span> <span id="s374">Suspenders?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: -- suspenders and this across with an edelweiss on here, you know.</span> <span id="s376">I had blue eyes, I had blond hair.</span> <span id="s377">I was a typical German boy you want to see.</span> <span id="s378">And I'm trying to squeeze there -- this was like six deep, and a motorcade was coming.</span> <span id="s379">I just stood there and I looked around.</span> <span id="s380">Then somebody saw me and somebody said, "Wait a minute, you stay right here."</span> <span id="s381">I says, "Oh, my God.</span> <span id="s382">What they going to do me now?"</span> <span id="s383">And he said, "Hey, send somebody back here for that kid, he'll be able to see Hitler."</span> <span id="s384">An SA man came back and put me on his shoulder, took me to the front line.</span> <span id="s385">And I'm sitting there and everybody's hollering, "Heil Hitler, heil Hitler."</span> <span id="s386">And my father taught me when that happens, anytime at all, say, "Freie leiter, freie leiter."</span> <span id="s387">It sounds almost the same, but it means free leaders, you know.</span> <span id="s388">I'm hollering there, "heil -- freie leiter, freie leiter, freie leiter."</span> <span id="s389">And all I kept thinking is if somebody across the street sees me sitting on top of -- top of that man in his SA uniform, this little Jewish boy, they're going to tear me apart.</span> <span id="s390">But then I said I'm having a good time.</span> <span id="s391">So finally, they let me out.</span> <span id="s392">I went home, I told my mother, she almost died.</span> <span id="s393">But nothing happened.</span> <span id="s394">But it was very funny in the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Now, that's -- was that still --</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Also, while Hitler was getting into power, this was about '36, --</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: -- when I was in fifth grade.</span> <span id="s399">One of the professors -- we had professors in high school -- he took the class on a trip to a certain town where they had a museum.</span> <span id="s400">And he said, "We're going to spend the weekend there, so get your parents' permission," which I got.</span> <span id="s401">And we took a bus and we went out there.</span> <span id="s402">And we were in a youth hostel where we slept, because we stayed there.</span> <span id="s403">We went there Friday afternoon.</span> <span id="s404">Saturday morning, we were around, we were passing the time, some kids had a late breakfast.</span> <span id="s405">And two persons came, two men came in.</span> <span id="s406">They are journalists for the local paper.</span> <span id="s407">And they said to our professor, who by the way spoke very funny.</span> <span id="s408">We always used to imitate him.</span> <span id="s409">They said, "You know, what are you guys doing here?"</span> <span id="s410">So we told them.</span> <span id="s411">He says, I'm professor so-and-so from the realschule in Ludwigshafen and we came here to see the museum and, you know, spend a little time here.</span> <span id="s412">He says, "Wonderful."</span> <span id="s413">He says, "Now, I got a -- I got something for you," he says.</span> <span id="s414">"We are having in our local paper a competition, you might say, the most Aryan looking boy."</span> <span id="s415">Do I have to say any more?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">[Laughter]</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: Oh, my.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: And my professor said, "I don't want to bother the kids with something."</span> <span id="s419">He said, "Why not?</span> <span id="s420">Look that this guy over there.</span> <span id="s421">He could win easily."</span> <span id="s422">Lederhosen.</span> <span id="s423">Everything.</span> <span id="s424">Blond hair, blue eyes.</span> <span id="s425">And my professor smiled.</span> <span id="s426">He says, "I don't think so."</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: [Laughing]</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: It's funny, but it was cute.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: Oh, my.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: All right.</span> <span id="s431">That's part of Hitler's time.</span> <span id="s432">Then he finally came into the full power, like I said, in '37 and we knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s433">I had to learn a trade.</span> <span id="s434">Now, in Mannheim -- like I said, that's across the river, the Rhein River.</span> <span id="s435">Mannheim has about 300,000 people.</span> <span id="s436">Well, almost twice as big as my home town.</span> <span id="s437">And there we had, you know, Jewish organizations.</span> <span id="s438">And they advised me, we had two things in the town where you could learn a trade, all put together by a Jewish -- what do you say?</span> <span id="s439">Not a firm, not a company, but organization like you here, something.</span> <span id="s440">And one was to be a locksmith, which didn't really interest me.</span> <span id="s441">And the other one was furniture making.</span> <span id="s442">Now, that already was something I could have done because even as a child, I was artistic.</span> <span id="s443">I used to draw, I used to paint.</span> <span id="s444">Nothing important, but, I mean, you know, it was usually quite good.</span> <span id="s445">And I said if I make furniture, I could make some fancy things on there and all this sort of thing.</span> <span id="s446">That might work out.</span> <span id="s447">Then I heard that the only Jewish restaurant in town was looking for a cook apprentice.</span> <span id="s448">I always used to watch my mother in the kitchen, and at that time watching meant a lot of things, like pulling the feathers out of chicken.</span> <span id="s449">You don't know from that.</span> <span id="s450">You do?</span> <span id="s451">And then you open up the back and you go in and you take everything out, including the eggs, which are not born yet.</span> <span id="s452">It was fun.</span> <span id="s453">You don't like that?</span> <span id="s454">I loved it.</span> <span id="s455">My mother made cookies, you know, and I used to stamp the different forms out.</span> <span id="s456">When my father caught me, I'd get a smack.</span> <span id="s457">"Boys don't belong in the kitchen."</span> <span id="s458">Okay.</span> <span id="s459">So when that came up, I said to my mother, "I'm going to try for this, you know, the cooking thing."</span> <span id="s460">My father said, "Well, go ahead."</span> <span id="s461">I mean, you know, this could be my life or death.</span> <span id="s462">I went over there and I met the man and the woman.</span> <span id="s463">Their name was Schloss (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Now, sorry, at this point you had planned already to leave Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s466">I didn't know -- I didn't know how yet, but, I mean, I felt if I got out, because at that time already there was a quota system from America for German Jews.</span> <span id="s467">And you had to apply at the consulate in Frankfurt to go to America, but you had to wait till your number was called.</span> <span id="s468">My sister they registered right away, and she left about a year and a -- almost a year before I did.</span> <span id="s469">Now, my number was 13,000 something.</span> <span id="s470">I should know that by heart, but I don't.</span> <span id="s471">And when my -- I had relatives in the -- in America.</span> <span id="s472">They weren't relatives like you might say.</span> <span id="s473">My father had three brothers and one sister.</span> <span id="s474">Four boys.</span> <span id="s475">They were all in the German army.</span> <span id="s476">I got a picture home, the four of them lined up, you should see them.</span> <span id="s477">Mustache every one of them, you know.</span> <span id="s478">And two of the brothers had married two sisters.</span> <span id="s479">And the sisters had brothers.</span> <span id="s480">One was in America quite early.</span> <span id="s481">He was a chemist.</span> <span id="s482">And he got a job here in America.</span> <span id="s483">He was a doctor of chemistry, working for Houten Company.</span> <span id="s484">Does that name mean anything to you?</span> <span id="s485">Is it Houten?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Chocolates, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: Houten, yeah.</span> <span id="s488">Houten made chocolates.</span> <span id="s489">And they usually had peppermint patties covered with chocolate.</span> <span id="s490">Now, at that time if you made that and you put chocolate over it, it would crumble, it wouldn't stay.</span> <span id="s491">He found a chemical process where the chocolate and the peppermint would stay together and keep for God knows how long.</span> <span id="s492">His brother, who was much younger, worked for my father in the store.</span> <span id="s493">My father taught him to -- how to be salesman.</span> <span id="s494">And then he went to America to his brother.</span> <span id="s495">So the relatives they had here after a while were the two other brothers who had married the two sisters of these two boys.</span> <span id="s496">You have to make a family tree.</span> <span id="s497">And my father told them, he says, "I registered Eric."</span> <span id="s498">And they send a telegram, and it says, "Don't be stupid, go get your own number."</span> <span id="s499">And my father wrote back and says, "Oh, by that time," it says, "I'll be gone."</span> <span id="s500">He says, "I was in the German army, I have an IM cross, they won't bother me."</span> <span id="s501">Little did they know.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: So your parents --</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: And they --</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: -- had not --</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: And they sent back -- they sent back a telegram, "Do it today.</span> <span id="s506">We know more than you do."</span> <span id="s507">Something like this.</span> <span id="s508">Okay.</span> <span id="s509">I'm not quoting verbatim.</span> <span id="s510">So he did.</span> <span id="s511">From -- from 13,000, it went out to 22,000.</span> <span id="s512">And America allowed in about at that time 6,000 or something.</span> <span id="s513">It was very -- was minute -- very minute a thing here.</span> <span id="s514">We in Germany thought that Roosevelt was our friend.</span> <span id="s515">Hitler thought he was Jewish because Roosevelt, you know.</span> <span id="s516">And we just couldn't believe that -- that this could happen, but it was, so he couldn't do anything about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Now, what had your parents planned to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: My parents planned to stick it out.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: They thought they --</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: I mean, after all, he was a German soldier and all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Did you try to convince them to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: Not only that, I mean, what could they do?</span> <span id="s523">They had to wait until their number was called.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: Did you try to convince them to --</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: Did I try?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: -- to get out earlier?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: Well, I told them, I says, "I'm going."</span> <span id="s528">I says, "But I know "-- and my father says, "Don't worry about it."</span> <span id="s529">He says, "You're a young person, you'll get out."</span> <span id="s530">So here I was in my second year of cooking apprenticeship and my father thought of writing to a friend of his in England.</span> <span id="s531">Now, they were -- had -- they used to be very, very good friends, but this was years ago.</span> <span id="s532">And I remember the only time they used to be in contact was Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, they used to send a letter, you know, card or something.</span> <span id="s533">So he wrote a letter to his friend and he says here's the situation, I have a son, he's now 16 years old, going on 17, which is almost army age, you know, and he's been working as a cook apprentice.</span> <span id="s534">Is there anything you can do that maybe somebody over there would hire him or something?</span> <span id="s535">Because if you had a job promise by an English company, you had to deposit a hundred pounds with the English government so you wouldn't be a burden to them, and then you would get a German -- from Germany an affidavit.</span> <span id="s536">I have the book right here.</span> <span id="s537">And so he wrote.</span> <span id="s538">He got a letter back from his wife, "Your friend has passed away.</span> <span id="s539">The only thing I can think of," he said -- she says, "We have a magazine here that comes out once a month.</span> <span id="s540">And now before the summer is coming" -- this was probably November the year before, '39 -- "I'm sending you something," like we have a Jewish news in -- in -- in Newark.</span> <span id="s541">And in the back, they had advertising, you know, hotels for the summer here and there.</span> <span id="s542">And there were two pages of hotels.</span> <span id="s543">I wrote to almost 30 of them -- and this was handwriting, there was no copy machine -- that I've had this experience.</span> <span id="s544">And already this was after Kristallnacht --</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: I want --</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: -- which was November --</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: I want --</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: -- '38.</span> <span id="s549">All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: I want to hear about your experiences --</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: -- during Kristallnacht as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: And they -- they realized what was going on.</span> <span id="s554">There were eight people that wrote back we'll take you, so now it was up to me to say, you know, who do I take.</span> <span id="s555">Now, this one was a small hotel right near the beach and I like the beach, and I took them.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: Where exactly?</span> <span id="s557">Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: That was in Cliftonville, Margate, England.</span> <span id="s559">Not far from the bloody cliffs of Dover.</span> <span id="s560">And I wrote to him and says I'm very happy and I'll be there, you know.</span> <span id="s561">So then we said my sister who'll be in America borrowed money from this one uncle who used to be my father's apprentice, and whatever money she may have had, and she sent it to England.</span> <span id="s562">They had the letter from this man in England that he was taking me, so I got a permission to leave Germany in June 1939, which is three months before the war broke out.</span> <span id="s563">My father, I remember, accompanied me on the train all the way up to the Dutch -- to the belt -- to the Holland border.</span> <span id="s564">Then he get off, it was a little teary goodbye on his part.</span> <span id="s565">I thought I was going for an adventure, you know.</span> <span id="s566">And I went to London.</span> <span id="s567">I had a wooden case like this that had to be sent on.</span> <span id="s568">I had packages.</span> <span id="s569">I'm standing there, this -- this place there where all the trains come, the train station, the Englishmen with their bowler hats and umbrella under the arm typically.</span> <span id="s570">And here stands this little German refugee.</span> <span id="s571">And I finally said to somebody, "Can I ask you something?"</span> <span id="s572">And finally I found out I had to do this and this and this.</span> <span id="s573">I had a few dollars left that I had changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: Did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: And I was able to get a train going to Margate.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Did you speak English at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: I had six years of English in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Which means very little.</span> <span id="s580">But at least I could ask questions.</span> <span id="s581">When they answered me, I had to say langsam or slowly, you know, or something like that.</span> <span id="s582">I went down there by train.</span> <span id="s583">First I had to send everything that I had by thing over here.</span> <span id="s584">And I came to Cliftonville, Margate, Cliftonville.</span> <span id="s585">The man met me and he took me to this little hotel, and I was now an English chef.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: I want to pause there for a second.</span> <span id="s587">I want to go back to --</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: -- to Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: To what?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: To Kris- -- to Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: And I want to hear, you know, your experiences and did you witness --</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: My experience Kristallnacht was very strange.</span> <span id="s595">I was still working in the hotel -- I mean, in the restaurant.</span> <span id="s596">All right.</span> <span id="s597">I had gotten sick and I had pneumonia, I guess, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s598">And I had a doctor.</span> <span id="s599">He was coming to the house.</span> <span id="s600">And he said to my mother keep him warm, give him a lot of liquids or something like that.</span> <span id="s601">And I was running like 102 temperature.</span> <span id="s602">And that's the night this boy killed that man in France.</span> <span id="s603">Now, this was actually November 10th.</span> <span id="s604">Little did I know what was going to be the result of this, but then I heard that our synagogue was burning.</span> <span id="s605">And my mother was saying, "Oh, my God, they're burning everything."</span> <span id="s606">I got out of bed, which I shouldn't have, and I went to the balcony.</span> <span id="s607">And we -- across the street from we lived, this was already now in Mannheim because once my father lost the store, we had to give up our two apartment houses.</span> <span id="s608">They paid him bupkis.</span> <span id="s609">And so we moved to Mannheim.</span> <span id="s610">We had a small apartment, but it had three bedrooms and that was good.</span> <span id="s611">My mother and father in one, I was in one, and then we had another one with our relatives coming and going.</span> <span id="s612">I went to the balcony and I see there down on the street a big, big circle.</span> <span id="s613">And in the meantime -- meantime there was a Jewish store.</span> <span id="s614">They broke the glass, everything in there, threw out in the street.</span> <span id="s615">Then they went to the second floor where the people lived and they threw out their beddings and everything and set it on fire.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Who did this?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: The Nazis, the stormtroopers.</span> <span id="s618">Not the SS, the brown -- Brownshirts.</span> <span id="s619">And the people were dancing.</span> <span id="s620">And I said, "What is this?"</span> <span id="s621">And my mother called me, says, "You go back to bed right now and stay there."</span> <span id="s622">And says, "It's very bad.</span> <span id="s623">I don't know what's going to happen us to, but you're not going to be..." I went back to bed, and about a half an hour later, the bell rings.</span> <span id="s624">Two Blackshirts, SS.</span> <span id="s625">And they come in and they say, "We're looking for your son and your husband."</span> <span id="s626">To this day, I don't know where my father was.</span> <span id="s627">He wasn't home.</span> <span id="s628">And I didn't see him for three days.</span> <span id="s629">Apparently somebody, wherever he was, told him don't go home.</span> <span id="s630">I'm there and my mother says, "My husband isn't home.</span> <span id="s631">He went to visit somebody."</span> <span id="s632">I don't know what she said.</span> <span id="s633">And they said, "All right, get him dressed."</span> <span id="s634">She says, "You can't do that."</span> <span id="s635">"What do you mean we can't do that?</span> <span id="s636">We can do anything we want."</span> <span id="s637">She says, "My son has pneumonia.</span> <span id="s638">If you take him out, you know what's going to happen."</span> <span id="s639">He says, "I don't care.</span> <span id="s640">Get him dressed."</span> <span id="s641">She says, "Please do me a favor."</span> <span id="s642">She says, "Let me call the doctor and you speak to the doctor."</span> <span id="s643">The doctor luckily was gentile.</span> <span id="s644">So they called him up and they told him, he says, "We're picking up Eric Hamberger."</span> <span id="s645">He says, "Well, I must tell you the truth.</span> <span id="s646">If you take him out of bed and take him down the street, you might as well shoot him right now because he ain't going to last."</span> <span id="s647">"What are you saying, Doc?"</span> <span id="s648">He says, "Look."</span> <span id="s649">He says, "I belong to the party," which, you know, was a good thing.</span> <span id="s650">And, all right, they left.</span> <span id="s651">That's why I'm here.</span> <span id="s652">But that was my experience on Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s653">It happened to me, as far as I know, on the 10th.</span> <span id="s654">I think they say now it was on the 11th.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Ninth.</span> <span id="s656">Ninth and 10th, they -- they say.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: Oh, 9th and 10th.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: Oh, the one was 9th and the other one was the 10th.</span> <span id="s660">Okay.</span> <span id="s661">And after that, they ruined my -- the restaurant.</span> <span id="s662">They -- everything was ruined.</span> <span id="s663">Couldn't go back to work there.</span> <span id="s664">So I heard about a pension.</span> <span id="s665">Pension is a place where people go to eat for lunch and dinner, but they don't live there or anything like that.</span> <span id="s666">You know, people just want a meal.</span> <span id="s667">So I went there and I asked the woman, "Can you use me?"</span> <span id="s668">She said, "Sure."</span> <span id="s669">So I used to cook in the morning and then I used to be the waiter when the people came to eat.</span> <span id="s670">And finally the day came when I went to England.</span> <span id="s671">So this was that period.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Our synagogue was burned to the ground.</span> <span id="s674">There is now a black sign there, a metal sign, you know, on this place here, this and this happened and all that, you know.</span> <span id="s675">My father and mother did not get out, but they lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: So let's go back -- sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: My father and mother stayed in Germany --</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: -- because, like I said, their number was nowheres near being called.</span> <span id="s680">And they stayed there longer than most people because my mutti, which is what I called her, mutti -- M-U-T-T-I -- was Aryan.</span> <span id="s681">So they had a special privilege, they're not going to kill an Aryan, so the father -- so my father stayed out of the concentration camps until I think 1943.</span> <span id="s682">War ended in '45, right?</span> <span id="s683">Yeah.</span> <span id="s684">Then they picked him up anyway and they took him to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s685">Now, Theresienstadt was the best thing of concentration camps you can think of.</span> <span id="s686">You probably know the story.</span> <span id="s687">My father told me.</span> <span id="s688">He spoke very little about it.</span> <span id="s689">The first two streets he said were very nice.</span> <span id="s690">People lived there.</span> <span id="s691">We had coffee and cake there outside the konditorei.</span> <span id="s692">And we had a band playing, but -- not a band, but musicians, you know, with violins and everything.</span> <span id="s693">Whenever somebody complained about concentration camps, they asked the Red Cross to please come and inspect it.</span> <span id="s694">And that's what they showed him, those two streets.</span> <span id="s695">My father said the third street on, you wouldn't want to go and you didn't go and you weren't allowed to go.</span> <span id="s696">My father stayed alive in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s697">He was -- like I said, he was only a little man, didn't weigh very much.</span> <span id="s698">Was about 120 pounds.</span> <span id="s699">And they put him in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s700">My father at that time was about 64 years old.</span> <span id="s701">And he was peeling potatoes all day long.</span> <span id="s702">Another fellow who was in the same hutch or -- what the word hutch around there?</span> <span id="s703">Well, whatever.</span> <span id="s704">Who was all there in there.</span> <span id="s705">He was peeling onions.</span> <span id="s706">And what they did, my father stuffed his pockets with potato peels.</span> <span id="s707">The other one had onion peels.</span> <span id="s708">And when they finally were able to go to their barracks -- barracks, that's the word I was looking for -- they used to make a potato onion soup.</span> <span id="s709">It was not bad.</span> <span id="s710">They lived.</span> <span id="s711">Even though my father came out, when I finally found him alive and as a United States soldier, which I was, he had special privileges.</span> <span id="s712">I was -- I was a decorated soldier and I got them on the second boat coming here.</span> <span id="s713">My father weighed 86 pounds.</span> <span id="s714">That's a skeleton.</span> <span id="s715">But we got him back to -- to -- to health.</span> <span id="s716">What else?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: Let's go back to 1939 --</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: -- when you were in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: In England.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: So you're in England.</span> <span id="s722">And -- you're in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: And, you know, where did you live and who helped you while you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A:Okay.</span> <span id="s726">Nobody.</span> <span id="s727">I was working there.</span> <span id="s728">The man -- the place was called Ben-Ann House.</span> <span id="s729">B-E-N dash A-N-N.</span> <span id="s730">He was Ben and she was Ann.</span> <span id="s731">Became Ben-Ann House.</span> <span id="s732">All right.</span> <span id="s733">And Ben-Ann House had about 60 rooms to rent, so it wasn't a big hotel.</span> <span id="s734">But the kitchen on the bottom was small, but when the people came for the summertime, everybody got the same meal.</span> <span id="s735">In other words, if liver whatever was on the menu, you better like liver.</span> <span id="s736">And mashed potatoes and vegetables and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s737">He was very good to me.</span> <span id="s738">The man weighed about 300 pounds.</span> <span id="s739">Was a big fellow.</span> <span id="s740">About 6'4", 300 pounds.</span> <span id="s741">It was -- it was orthodox.</span> <span id="s742">The meat had to be koshered with salt and everything else, which I never knew anything before, but he showed me.</span> <span id="s743">And in part of the kitchen, there was a big metal thing where there were shelves, and that's where the food was kept hot until, you know, it was time to serve it.</span> <span id="s744">Then he had some waiters.</span> <span id="s745">A waitress was inside.</span> <span id="s746">She was very nice to me.</span> <span id="s747">She was not a very pretty girl, pretty woman, but she was a good woman.</span> <span id="s748">They had two children, a boy and a girl.</span> <span id="s749">And in back of the hotel, if you went out the back, there was a long, long way where you could play soccer if you wanted to.</span> <span id="s750">I mean, was a really good thing.</span> <span id="s751">But also was a lot of small little huts there.</span> <span id="s752">And at one point when the war broke out in September of '39, he took in all the children from the children transport and he put them in those huts in the back and in every one of the rooms after the people left.</span> <span id="s753">So I can only say he was a good person.</span> <span id="s754">He helped me, he saved my life and these kids.</span> <span id="s755">Well, I mean, they -- at that time they put them with English people.</span> <span id="s756">And I heard so many stories that some of them when they said goodbye to their parents, you know, they knew it was going to be the last time.</span> <span id="s757">Some of them did find their parents.</span> <span id="s758">Was a long story.</span> <span id="s759">And they wind up with English people, and a lot of them stayed with those people.</span> <span id="s760">We lost them as Jewish children.</span> <span id="s761">We lost them completely.</span> <span id="s762">But anyway, I had about 45, 50 boys.</span> <span id="s763">Boys only, boys only.</span> <span id="s764">And I'd -- only I -- did I cook for them, I joined them in putting on plays.</span> <span id="s765">And he would sell tickets to the Jewish people in the town to -- because the dining room had a stage in the back.</span> <span id="s766">And I painted the backdrop.</span> <span id="s767">I had a beautiful painting of the Seven Dwarfs.</span> <span id="s768">Took me quite a long time because I had to do it in between lunch and dinner, you know.</span> <span id="s769">And the kids played.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: Now, where did -- you said he took them in.</span> <span id="s771">And where did they -- where did they stay?</span> <span id="s772">Did he stop taking guests at this point or he put them where there were no guests?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: At that time, they were all in the huts.</span> <span id="s774">He took them in, but not right away.</span> <span id="s775">When I got there, there was no children there.</span> <span id="s776">But when things got back and, you know, we -- we find out that the war's going to start, he put them in those huts.</span> <span id="s777">But at that time, maybe three or four in one of those huts.</span> <span id="s778">And later on, it was maybe two.</span> <span id="s779">But they were there before the war, before the war started, yes.</span> <span id="s780">As a matter of fact, my cousin was one of the Kindertransport, but she wasn't in that group.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: And then after the season, the hotel didn't have guests.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: After the season, the guests left, then he gave the rooms to the boys.</span> <span id="s783">The boys.</span> <span id="s784">No girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: What am I talking about?</span> <span id="s787">Yes, were girls.</span> <span id="s788">Had a girlfriend.</span> <span id="s789">Sorry.</span> <span id="s790">How could I forget her?</span> <span id="s791">Also blond and blue eyes.</span> <span id="s792">We made a good pair.</span> <span id="s793">She was a little stuck up.</span> <span id="s794">But anyway...</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: So you assisted him with -- with over -- with looking after these children?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s797">I became their -- their -- the people who took care of these children was a husband and wife in their 60s, who both were professors.</span> <span id="s798">Now, they were put in charge of them.</span> <span id="s799">And there were -- well, this wasn't exactly their field, but they, you know, kept them in line and I became their second leader.</span> <span id="s800">I mean, I -- I was more in charge of them than they were.</span> <span id="s801">But we had a good time together.</span> <span id="s802">And matter of fact, I formed a little gang there, four fellows and I.</span> <span id="s803">We did all right.</span> <span id="s804">And then later on, a lot of the children went to people in London because this little blond girlfriend was transferred to London.</span> <span id="s805">And my other friend who was part of my little gang there, his girlfriend went to London.</span> <span id="s806">I saw them later on.</span> <span id="s807">When I -- when I got a week vacation, I went there.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: Now, these friends of yours were part -- had they come to England through the Kindertransport or they had also helped to oversee the younger ones?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: Kindertransport.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: But some of them -- I mean, I was at that time 18 years old.</span> <span id="s812">Some of them were 15 and 16.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: One was 17.</span> <span id="s815">So was almost, you know, that -- I was one of them because of age wise.</span> <span id="s816">When I left England the following year, was already the bombings going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: And how did you gain entry into the United States at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: How did I get entry?</span> <span id="s819">Very interesting.</span> <span id="s820">I registered with the American consulate in London with my number, my quota number.</span> <span id="s821">And when that quota come -- number came up, I got a letter that on so and so and so and so date, I should appear to them because my number came up and they will now give me permission to go to America if I'm healthy or whatever the case may be.</span> <span id="s822">That's how I got there.</span> <span id="s823">And I went to Eng- -- I went to America on the way via Canada in May 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: And you had said the war, there were bombings, you saw bombings?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: There was already bombings in London, and they had the balloons up with the iron things.</span> <span id="s826">I don't know if you remember that.</span> <span id="s827">The English put up those balloons, so when the planes -- planes came to bomb it, if they would hit, you know, one of those iron things, it's like a -- a rope but made out of -- out of metal, then the wing would come off, you know.</span> <span id="s828">I landed -- I landed in Canada after being sea sick.</span> <span id="s829">And the fellow who shared my cabin in the boat, very nice fellow.</span> <span id="s830">We got along very well even though he was like 20 years older than I was.</span> <span id="s831">And when we came to Canada, we landed in Montreal.</span> <span id="s832">And we had about a day and a half before we could catch a train going to New York, so we all went and took a lock -- a look at Montreal.</span> <span id="s833">And when I came back to the boat, I noticed that I had been pick-pocketed.</span> <span id="s834">I must have had about 40 or 45 dollars left in my back pocket, and I never carried money in the back since then, it's over here.</span> <span id="s835">And I -- I said, "What am I going to do?"</span> <span id="s836">So he says, "I can loan you 10 dollars."</span> <span id="s837">My -- I'm glad he was still there, you know.</span> <span id="s838">Sometimes people came to pick them up in Montreal.</span> <span id="s839">So I had 10 dollars when I came to New York.</span> <span id="s840">Now, I had to send my -- my -- my wooden box and every other piece of furniture that I had.</span> <span id="s841">And I came to Newark where my so-called uncle lived.</span> <span id="s842">He was the brother of one of the sisters, like I mentioned before.</span> <span id="s843">I hadn't told anybody I was coming.</span> <span id="s844">This is one of the things I do, I like to surprise people.</span> <span id="s845">So I took my two suitcases that I carried.</span> <span id="s846">All the other stuff was going to his house.</span> <span id="s847">And I went outside the train station, I see a taxi.</span> <span id="s848">I asked somebody, "I'm going to Roseville Avenue in Newark.</span> <span id="s849">Do you know where it is?"</span> <span id="s850">He says, "I don't know."</span> <span id="s851">He says, "Why don't you take a taxi."</span> <span id="s852">"Okay."</span> <span id="s853">I got into the taxi and I had a dollar and 48 cents left.</span> <span id="s854">And I said to the guy, "Do you know Roseville Avenue?"</span> <span id="s855">He says, "Sure."</span> <span id="s856">Only I didn't say it like that then.</span> <span id="s857">"Can you tell me, please, where the Roseville Avenue is?"</span> <span id="s858">And he looked at me like I'm from the moon or someplace.</span> <span id="s859">He said, "Sure."</span> <span id="s860">He took me -- I'm sitting in the back.</span> <span id="s861">And you have to see this picture.</span> <span id="s862">There's the man sitting there.</span> <span id="s863">Here's the meter.</span> <span id="s864">20 cents.</span> <span id="s865">Twen- -- 20, yeah, cents, 40 cents, 60 cents, 80 cents, 90 cents.</span> <span id="s866">I said if he goes to a dollar, tell him to stop no matter where it is.</span> <span id="s867">95 cents, we stop.</span> <span id="s868">I made it.</span> <span id="s869">I go out and I give him a dollar and I say, "Keep the change, sir."</span> <span id="s870">And he looked at me and he said, "Well, thank you very much."</span> <span id="s871">And I'm standing there with my two suitcases.</span> <span id="s872">I says, "Why is he so nasty?</span> <span id="s873">I give him a nickel tip and he's telling me thank you very much."</span> <span id="s874">As he pulled away, I see on the back door 35 cents anywhere, any part of the city.</span> <span id="s875">I gave him a nice tip.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: [Laughing]</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: And I went to the house to see my uncle, and he had moved.</span> <span id="s878">He wasn't living there anymore.</span> <span id="s879">That's what I get for not calling ahead.</span> <span id="s880">But luckily it was only four blocks, so I took my full suit- -- my suitcase and I got there and I rang the doorbell.</span> <span id="s881">And this uncle opened up and he said, "Yes?"</span> <span id="s882">I says, "I'm Eric."</span> <span id="s883">"You're Eric?"</span> <span id="s884">"Yeah."</span> <span id="s885">Took me in.</span> <span id="s886">I called my sister.</span> <span id="s887">She dropped dead on the floor.</span> <span id="s888">Not exactly.</span> <span id="s889">But she passed out when she --</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: Where was --</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: -- heard my voice.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: Where was she living at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: She was not living at a specific place.</span> <span id="s894">My sister, because she had her -- better her English, was at that time a nanny.</span> <span id="s895">So she -- I had the telephone number.</span> <span id="s896">I called her up and she came that night.</span> <span id="s897">I says, "When you come, bring me 10 dollars."</span> <span id="s898">I said -- I said -- or 15 dollars, something like that.</span> <span id="s899">And she came and we had a happy reunion.</span> <span id="s900">And she got her money back from England.</span> <span id="s901">And -- but I rang my uncle's bell with 48 cents.</span> <span id="s902">40 or 28, I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: I remember 28, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: 28, 28, well, then, yeah, 28.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: And you lived --</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: And then I said, "What am I going to do now?"</span> <span id="s907">So my uncle said there is a HIAS -- HIAS, was that one of the companies back then?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, HIAS.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s910">It's down in -- in Newark.</span> <span id="s911">I caught a bus down there on the second day.</span> <span id="s912">And I went there and I asked the people there if they could help me find a job.</span> <span id="s913">And they asked me, "What do you do?"</span> <span id="s914">I says, "Well, I've been a cook apprentice now for two years and I'm pretty good at what I do."</span> <span id="s915">So they said, "You're very lucky, we just had a call in this week.</span> <span id="s916">There's a nightclub in Chatham."</span> <span id="s917">I didn't know where Chatham was.</span> <span id="s918">They're looking for a young cook, you know, somebody -- refugee, somebody.</span> <span id="s919">So I took the bus out there, took 35 minutes to get there, and in my best English I applied for the job and I got the job.</span> <span id="s920">The head chef was from Holland.</span> <span id="s921">Spoke very good German.</span> <span id="s922">The second chef in charge was from Germany, he speaks very good German.</span> <span id="s923">And I was there, and then we had a salad chef.</span> <span id="s924">And I had a room, and upstairs it was -- you know Jersey at all?</span> <span id="s925">Well, what we have in New Jersey, near that Chatham place -- as a matter of fact, it was built exactly where the nightclub used to be, which burned down during World War II.</span> <span id="s926">There is now a big, big mall.</span> <span id="s927">What's the name of that mall?</span></p> <p><span id="s928">UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Short Hills Mall.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: Short Hills Mall.</span> <span id="s930">And I lived there up on the top of this hote- -- of this restaurant, I don't know what it was before because it had a -- had a second floor and a third floor.</span> <span id="s931">Second floor had the offices.</span> <span id="s932">I know the office girl was upstairs.</span> <span id="s933">[Coughing] Excuse me.</span> <span id="s934">And I had my food, I had my place to live.</span> <span id="s935">I was working 10 hours a day, six days a week.</span> <span id="s936">Now, the 10 hours a day are not that simple.</span> <span id="s937">I worked from 1:00 to 3:00, that's lunchtime.</span> <span id="s938">I was off from 3:00 to 6:00, up on the third floor.</span> <span id="s939">And then from 6:00 till 1:00, I worked the night and I was the night chef.</span> <span id="s940">There was actually 13 hours of the day that you couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s941">And it was out in -- you know, it was on a hill, this restaurant and this building.</span> <span id="s942">If I wanted my laundry done, I had to walk about four blocks into the town.</span> <span id="s943">But anyway, I stayed there more or less until I was drafted.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: Then when were you drafted?</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: In 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: And tell me about -- you know, tell me about your experiences in the Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: There's too many.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: Well, how long did you serve in the Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: I was in the Army for three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: And where were you --</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: I was drafted, I went to Fort Dix.</span> <span id="s952">What happened to me in Fort -- nothing comes easy, but always is a lot of fun in a way.</span> <span id="s953">I went to Fort Dix and I was wearing a pair of brown and white shoes.</span> <span id="s954">They call them spectators.</span> <span id="s955">You ever hear of them?</span> <span id="s956">You know what spectator shoes are?</span> <span id="s957">From this brown, then comes the part that's white, and then it's brown again and the back has a white stripe.</span> <span id="s958">Fancy.</span> <span id="s959">I got there, they gave me my uniform.</span> <span id="s960">Put it on.</span> <span id="s961">It was rough.</span> <span id="s962">You know what I mean?</span> <span id="s963">The Army uniform is made from not the best material.</span> <span id="s964">And my shoes were killing me, those -- you know, I had high shoes and you had to crisscross and tie them up.</span> <span id="s965">So in the evening, we had -- we had to stand -- not Reveille.</span> <span id="s966">What was -- Reveille was the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Inspection?</span> <span id="s968">Inspection?</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: Well, it was an evening inspection.</span> <span id="s970">And I took those boots off and put on my spectator shoes.</span> <span id="s971">Big mistake.</span> <span id="s972">I'm standing out there with a few hundred people.</span> <span id="s973">Everybody had their Army boots on but Eric.</span> <span id="s974">And the first sergeant came by and he looked.</span> <span id="s975">He said, "Who the... do you think you are?"</span> <span id="s976">"I don't know, sir."</span> <span id="s977">I mean, __+.</span> <span id="s978">He says, "You pimping days are over, buddy."</span> <span id="s979">He says, "You may have been in New York with those shoes, but you don't wear them here.</span> <span id="s980">You have KP for the next nine days."</span> <span id="s981">"What did I do wrong?"</span> <span id="s982">I found out.</span> <span id="s983">So anyway, I got my papers, then I went to Camp Rucker, Alabama, also known as -- excuse the language -- the asshole of the United States.</span> <span id="s984">It was horrible.</span> <span id="s985">It was dry.</span> <span id="s986">Dust swirling all over the place.</span> <span id="s987">90 degrees every day.</span> <span id="s988">And that's where I had my basic training.</span> <span id="s989">Now, I go, you know, when you -- when you go in the Army, they ask you this question and this question and this questions.</span> <span id="s990">You take an IQ test and all these sort of things.</span> <span id="s991">And I come to this one fellow and he says, "I understand you were a cook, a chef."</span> <span id="s992">I says, "That's right."</span> <span id="s993">So he says, "All right, let me ask you a few questions."</span> <span id="s994">He says, "What are the three main meats?"</span> <span id="s995">I says, "Well, there's calf, there's a -- there's cow, there's chicken."</span> <span id="s996">Okay.</span> <span id="s997">He asked me a few more questions.</span> <span id="s998">He says, "What do you call a piece of meat, a thin piece of meat and you put like a cucumber inside and you roll it up?"</span> <span id="s999">And I said, "Rolled beef."</span> <span id="s1000">"No."</span> <span id="s1001">I said, "What do you mean no?"</span> <span id="s1002">"That's nobody says here."</span> <span id="s1003">I said, "That's rolled beef."</span> <span id="s1004">"No."</span> <span id="s1005">Okay.</span> <span id="s1006">I'm not -- I'm wrong, he's right.</span> <span id="s1007">And then to -- to Fort -- to Camp Rucker in Alabama, and naturally I was put into the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1008">I didn't have to do any KP anymore, but I cooked the way I know how.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: And what is KP?</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A: Kitchen patrol.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: Kitchen patrol.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: That's peeling potatoes, washing dishes, all the stuff that nobody else wants to do.</span> <span id="s1013">So I went to the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1014">Now, the kitchen gets every Monday -- or I guess was Monday -- a menu for the week.</span> <span id="s1015">On Monday, it's potatoes and goulash or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s1016">And the next day, it's chicken wings or something.</span> <span id="s1017">All kinds of stuff.</span> <span id="s1018">And you had to follow it because it was sent to you for that day in the proportion of how many people you were feeding.</span> <span id="s1019">Now, in certain things I didn't care, like on the mornings, you know, you have either a cereal or, very famous in the Army -- excuse me -- shit on shingles.</span> <span id="s1020">You ever hear that one?</span> <span id="s1021">No.</span> <span id="s1022">It's shot -- it's ground meat in a -- in a cream sauce.</span> <span id="s1023">Yeck.</span> <span id="s1024">Horrible.</span> <span id="s1025">But that was one of the dish -- dishes.</span> <span id="s1026">But the funny thing was that really gave me a reputation -- I have two reputations -- we get a menu in that on Monday we're having chopped meat.</span> <span id="s1027">And you had to grind it yourself, you know.</span> <span id="s1028">And on Thursday, we're going to have steak.</span> <span id="s1029">Okay.</span> <span id="s1030">I opened the package for the chopped meat.</span> <span id="s1031">It's from the leg, it's from the neck, it's -- I mean, I know my stuff.</span> <span id="s1032">And I said to the head cook there, I says, "I ain't going to make chopped meat out of this."</span> <span id="s1033">I mean, I'm -- no, wait a minute, it was -- I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s1034">It was steak meat.</span> <span id="s1035">Very, very good steak meat.</span> <span id="s1036">Almost filet mignon, it was that great.</span> <span id="s1037">And I said to him, "I'm not going to make chopped meat out of that."</span> <span id="s1038">He says, "We have to do what it says."</span> <span id="s1039">He says, "Look the other way, I'll take the responsibility.</span> <span id="s1040">All right?"</span> <span id="s1041">"Okay.</span> <span id="s1042">Go ahead."</span> <span id="s1043">I served -- instead of chopped meat on Monday, I served steak.</span> <span id="s1044">And the whole place went bananas.</span> <span id="s1045">And the captain who was the captain of my company, he says, "Oh, is that good."</span> <span id="s1046">I said, "It's better than chopped meat, sir?"</span> <span id="s1047">He goes, "What are you talking about?"</span> <span id="s1048">I said, "You were supposed to get chopped meat today."</span> <span id="s1049">"And you did something else?"</span> <span id="s1050">I said, "Sir."</span> <span id="s1051">I says, "I am a trained chef."</span> <span id="s1052">I says, "I wouldn't take that meat and make chopped meat out of it."</span> <span id="s1053">So on Thursday, we had chopped meat.</span> <span id="s1054">No big deal.</span> <span id="s1055">All right.</span> <span id="s1056">That was the good part.</span> <span id="s1057">Gave me a reputation, he really knows what he's doing.</span> <span id="s1058">A guy comes in one day, a sergeant.</span> <span id="s1059">I was a private.</span> <span id="s1060">And he comes back there to where we're cooking there.</span> <span id="s1061">There's the mess hall, and the kitchen is in the back.</span> <span id="s1062">And he says, "What are you eating today, Jew boy?"</span> <span id="s1063">"Say that again."</span> <span id="s1064">"Yeah.</span> <span id="s1065">I said what are you eating today, Jew boy?"</span> <span id="s1066">I said, "Thank you very much."</span> <span id="s1067">I said, "I'm glad everybody heard it."</span> <span id="s1068">I took my apron off.</span> <span id="s1069">I went to the captain's office and I said, "Sir."</span> <span id="s1070">I says, "I just was insulted because of my religion and I will not take it."</span> <span id="s1071">I says, "I will -- I'm from Germany, I suffered under Hitler, I will not suffer under American sergeant."</span> <span id="s1072">Called the guy in.</span> <span id="s1073">He says, "This fellow here complains about you."</span> <span id="s1074">He said, "All I told him, I called him a Jew boy."</span> <span id="s1075">He says, "Take those stripes off."</span> <span id="s1076">He says, "You're a private."</span> <span id="s1077">I swear to God.</span> <span id="s1078">And he never made more than a corporal until the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1079">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1080">And when -- when we finally parted at the end, you know, that we were going home -- at least I was going home.</span> <span id="s1081">The other part of the company didn't have enough points, if you know anything about points.</span> <span id="s1082">He came over to me and he says, "Eric, you had guts."</span> <span id="s1083">I says, "That's right."</span> <span id="s1084">He says, "I respect you."</span> <span id="s1085">And he always tried to be friendly.</span> <span id="s1086">Like if somebody sneezed, he spoke a little German, so he'd say gesundheit, especially (?</span> <span id="s1087">ein kind im liep?)</span> <span id="s1088">which means gesundheit health.</span> <span id="s1089">It's better than carrying a baby.</span> <span id="s1090">Is rhymes, you know.</span> <span id="s1091">But anyway, that was the two things that happened in camp.</span> <span id="s1092">But I got my training, training with a rifle.</span> <span id="s1093">And we had heavy mortars.</span> <span id="s1094">You know what a mortar looks like?</span> <span id="s1095">You do?</span> <span id="s1096">You know what a mortar looks like?</span> <span id="s1097">All right.</span> <span id="s1098">You take a shell and you put it down a barrel and it flies.</span> <span id="s1099">When we came to Africa, Algeria --</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: When -- when were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: -- to a city called Oran --</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: When were you sent overseas?</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">A: In 19- -- May nine -- the same May that I landed in Canada, or in America actually, May -- May -- May 2nd or May 10th, May 10th.</span> <span id="s1104">That's when I landed in Africa, in Oran, which is a big harbor town.</span> <span id="s1105">And I was so happy, I looked at the -- at the harbor and the ships there.</span> <span id="s1106">And I saw a sign here "ne fumez pas."</span> <span id="s1107">I says, "I had two years of French in school, I know what that means.</span> <span id="s1108">You're not allowed to smoke."</span> <span id="s1109">Everybody looked at me.</span> <span id="s1110">"You speak French?"</span> <span id="s1111">I says, "Well, don't ask me," I says, "but I know a few things."</span> <span id="s1112">UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: What was this, '42 or '43?</span> <span id="s1113">You went in in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: '42, '43.</span> <span id="s1115">No, '42 actually.</span> <span id="s1116">Yeah, '42, because I was in for three years.</span> <span id="s1117">And we were sent to a hill outside of Oran, which is a fairly big town where most of the people speak French and Arabic.</span> <span id="s1118">And we -- we had tents there, big tents we put up.</span> <span id="s1119">The ground was almost all rocky, all rocks.</span> <span id="s1120">And they kept us there for a while until they found out what they're going to do with us, because these heavy mortars were not something that had been used before.</span> <span id="s1121">Mor- -- small mortars, yes, but not the heavy one.</span> <span id="s1122">Our mortar was this big.</span> <span id="s1123">Finally, they gave us an order that everybody in the battalion, we were -- bat- -- battalion is a little more than a thousand, a thousand men.</span> <span id="s1124">Everybody that is called or known as an enemy alien, people from Germany, people from Austria, people from Italy, even people from Russia, are to be separated.</span> <span id="s1125">There were 28 of us.</span> <span id="s1126">And we were put in a separate little tent, or two tents, as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s1127">And my company was told -- this is after a couple of months -- was told to go to Tunisia.</span> <span id="s1128">We are talking about the African coastline.</span> <span id="s1129">All right.</span> <span id="s1130">Algeria is here, Tunisia's here.</span> <span id="s1131">My company was told that they're making the invasion of Sicily, which is the little boot on the bottom of Italy.</span> <span id="s1132">In the meantime, we were there, and every day our job was to put rocks around this area where we had the tents.</span> <span id="s1133">You picked up these boulders and you made a -- a thing that high, which was okay except on the most of these rocks were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Scorpions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: Scorpions.</span> <span id="s1136">Sometimes a word -- I miss a word.</span> <span id="s1137">I think -- I think it right.</span> <span id="s1138">Oh, __.</span> <span id="s1139">Underneath those rocks were scorpions, which are not nice.</span> <span id="s1140">If they crawl on you and you make a move when the tail comes up, and you can die depending how much poison they get in there.</span> <span id="s1141">And I also learned how to skill a scorpion without touching him.</span> <span id="s1142">Want to learn?</span> <span id="s1143">Okay.</span> <span id="s1144">Scorpion is here, right?</span> <span id="s1145">You take some newspaper or your booklet, whatever you have, the paper, and you build -- put the paper around it and then put fire on it.</span> <span id="s1146">Now, the scorpion doesn't want to go through the fires, so he kills himself.</span> <span id="s1147">Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: That's interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">A: I'm responsible for a lot of scorpions being dead.</span> <span id="s1150">But anyway, the other thing we had to do is go to the PX there and sell the soldiers whatever they may need; toothpaste, medicine, candy, chocolates, prophylactics, all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s1151">And it was a good job.</span> <span id="s1152">Funny thing happened there one day.</span> <span id="s1153">I don't know if you want to hear these stories because I got a million of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: Well, let's move forward a little bit, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: So did -- UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Move forward.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: We'll move forward.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Move forward.</span> <span id="s1159">Move forward.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: We'll go --</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: Move forwards, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: We'll go ahead.</span> <span id="s1163">So do -- were you involved in the invasion of Sicily?</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: Yes, I was, but my outfit wasn't.</span> <span id="s1165">Very strange, right?</span> <span id="s1166">One day we get the notice, 28 fellows, you're moving out.</span> <span id="s1167">"Where we going?"</span> <span id="s1168">"You're going to make the invasion of Sicily."</span> <span id="s1169">"Where's my outfit?"</span> <span id="s1170">"They're going to meet you there or you're going to meet them there.</span> <span id="s1171">They're ready to embark from Tunisia on a boat going on Sicily."</span> <span id="s1172">Okay.</span> <span id="s1173">So we get on a boat, we land in Sicily.</span> <span id="s1174">And we're sitting there on the waterfront and somebody comes over and says, "What are you doing here?"</span> <span id="s1175">He says, "Well, we're waiting for our outfit."</span> <span id="s1176">"What's the outfit?"</span> <span id="s1177">"84th Chemical Mortar Battalion."</span> <span id="s1178">"I'll find out where they are."</span> <span id="s1179">Comes back.</span> <span id="s1180">He says, "They didn't make it."</span> <span id="s1181">I says, "What do you mean they didn't make it?</span> <span id="s1182">It's a whole battalion."</span> <span id="s1183">They found out -- they were ready to get on the boat, and whoever the general was that was going to Sicily, he says, "I can't use those big things.</span> <span id="s1184">They're completely out of line."</span> <span id="s1185">He says, "When we go into country over there, it's silly.</span> <span id="s1186">Sicily has mountains, Mount Etna is there, which is a volcano."</span> <span id="s1187">He says, "Get those guys off."</span> <span id="s1188">They went off, we were there.</span> <span id="s1189">We saw combat before they did.</span> <span id="s1190">We were not citizens, which is not a good thing to be if you take a chance being captured by Germans.</span> <span id="s1191">And you know when your dog tags says Hebrew, there's an H on there, so, you know, it's very easy to read.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: Now, the other men were also -- were they also German Jewish immigrants with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: No, not all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: Not --</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: Some?</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: They were Italians.</span> <span id="s1198">One was a -- a Russian guy.</span> <span id="s1199">We had a couple from Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: Most of them were Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: But no -- no citizens?</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A: But not citizens.</span> <span id="s1204">And originally from Germany or Austria or Italy.</span> <span id="s1205">So we were in Sicily and they said, "Okay."</span> <span id="s1206">Says, "We'll make some use out of you."</span> <span id="s1207">So they took us to a place where they had donkeys.</span> <span id="s1208">And they loaded the donkeys up with packages on both sides.</span> <span id="s1209">And we got a stick and we led the monkeys up the hill -- the donkeys, not the monkeys.</span> <span id="s1210">The donkeys up the hill.</span> <span id="s1211">And they delivered the goods.</span> <span id="s1212">So whatever they need, ammunition, food, something like that.</span> <span id="s1213">And then we came down again and we took another thing up.</span> <span id="s1214">The second time up, the Germans started shelling.</span> <span id="s1215">I says, "Wait, you know, we -- we don't -- we don't have anything here to dig a foxhole even."</span> <span id="s1216">We had no spade or nothing.</span> <span id="s1217">So we -- we -- I jumped on top of a foxhole with a couple of guys in there.</span> <span id="s1218">Other guys hid behind trees.</span> <span id="s1219">The guys in the foxhole threw me out.</span> <span id="s1220">I ran around, I found a tree about this big, and the bottom part was hollow.</span> <span id="s1221">I've seen that many times on trees.</span> <span id="s1222">I crawled in there and I fell asleep.</span> <span id="s1223">The bombing was going up and I felt very safe, I fell asleep.</span> <span id="s1224">When it stopped, I came out and I looked around.</span> <span id="s1225">One of our boys got hit already, not killed.</span> <span id="s1226">And I said, "This is ridiculous."</span> <span id="s1227">So I asked the captain that was running around with his stick like he was an Englishman, which he wasn't.</span> <span id="s1228">He says, "Okay, fellas."</span> <span id="s1229">Says, "Go ahead."</span> <span id="s1230">He says, "We're in a war here.</span> <span id="s1231">You can't stay in those holes all day."</span> <span id="s1232">Okay.</span> <span id="s1233">And then that's -- I asked him, I says, "What are you going to do with us?"</span> <span id="s1234">I was a PFC, Private First Class.</span> <span id="s1235">And I said, "Sir, I don't know where we're going to go."</span> <span id="s1236">"Well, what is going on," he says.</span> <span id="s1237">"Well," he says, "we don't belong to any company here, not to any battalion, not to any division."</span> <span id="s1238">He says, "Our people are in Africa.</span> <span id="s1239">They didn't make the invasion."</span> <span id="s1240">He says, "You know what."</span> <span id="s1241">He says, "Go down here."</span> <span id="s1242">He says, "There's the medical place, you know, where all the wounded are being brought down.</span> <span id="s1243">See -- go and see if you can help out down there."</span> <span id="s1244">We went down there and we reported, 27 men strong.</span> <span id="s1245">No, we had the other guy too.</span> <span id="s1246">Yeah, I think he wounded his arm.</span> <span id="s1247">And we said to the doctor or the captain in charge there, he says, "Sir, we're supposed to -- supposed to help you with any way we can."</span> <span id="s1248">And he says, "Well, who are you?</span> <span id="s1249">I don't recognize your insignia."</span> <span id="s1250">I says, "We belong to the 84th Chemical Mortar Battalion, but our outfit is not here."</span> <span id="s1251">"Where is it?"</span> <span id="s1252">"In Africa."</span> <span id="s1253">"Then what are you doing here?"</span> <span id="s1254">I says, "I don't know, sir."</span> <span id="s1255">And he says, "Okay."</span> <span id="s1256">He says, "Why are you here?"</span> <span id="s1257">I says, "Because we are enemy aliens, we are not citizens."</span> <span id="s1258">"You are not citizens and you are up here when the shelling is going on?"</span> <span id="s1259">I says, "That's right, sir."</span> <span id="s1260">He says, "Well, get the hell out of here."</span> <span id="s1261">He says, "Take this man" -- he was on a litter, badly wounded -- "and carry him down there, don't come back up."</span> <span id="s1262">So four of us picked up one litter.</span> <span id="s1263">We walked about 200 yards and the shelling started again.</span> <span id="s1264">So we put the litter behind a tree and we were all huddled around and finally it stopped.</span> <span id="s1265">And when we were ready to pick up that litter and I said to them, I says to guys he ain't going nowhere.</span> <span id="s1266">He was dead, not from the shelling, but he was badly wounded.</span> <span id="s1267">So we brought him back to the camp and they says, "You got a live one?"</span> <span id="s1268">I mean, he was trying to be -- you're trying to be funny because, you know, it says -- he says, "Yeah, I got a live one."</span> <span id="s1269">Then we took a guy -- it took us approximately two and a half hours for the mules to go up that hill.</span> <span id="s1270">Took us two days to carry this guy down.</span> <span id="s1271">Was like 200 and some pounds.</span> <span id="s1272">That's a lot, and if you're holding onto that and then you're going around boulders and all kinds of stuff.</span> <span id="s1273">So finally we delivered him to the Red Cross station down there.</span> <span id="s1274">And they said, "That's enough, you're not going up anymore."</span> <span id="s1275">So then Sicily fell.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: I want to pause there for a moment just because I want to jump to the next track on the recorder.</span> <span id="s1277">So....</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">End of File One</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Beginning File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: Okay, this is the continuation of the interview with Eric Hamberg conducted on August 8, 2012.</span> <span id="s1281">Sicily fell.</span> <span id="s1282">Please--</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: You want to know more about Sicily?</span> <span id="s1284">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: Let‚Äôs move forward--</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: No, we‚Äôre leaving Sicily--</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: Yes--</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: Wait a minute, I got to tell you this.</span> <span id="s1289">We‚Äôre leaving Sicily.</span> <span id="s1290">It‚Äôs not that easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: Twenty-eight people including one with an arm wound get on a ship going back to Africa.</span> <span id="s1293">Why?</span> <span id="s1294">Because that‚Äôs where your outfit is.</span> <span id="s1295">Okay?</span> <span id="s1296">But they didn‚Äôt take us to where the outfit is, they took us back to Iran.</span> <span id="s1297">Where we came from with all the rocks and the animals up there.</span> <span id="s1298">Animals.</span> <span id="s1299">Insects.</span> <span id="s1300">And you just couldn‚Äôt understand it.</span> <span id="s1301">Well, we finally found out that in order for you to be a citizen, somebody has to come from America and from the Immigration Department and he has to interrogate you and if he gives the okay, then you are sworn in as a citizen.</span> <span id="s1302">I says, okay.</span> <span id="s1303">They took us back to this hill, but before we got to the hill, we‚Äôre on the boat, right?</span> <span id="s1304">Now I‚Äôm standing on the boat, it‚Äôs early in the morning about 8 o‚Äôclock.</span> <span id="s1305">We had gotten on the ship around 6 o‚Äôclock and I see Sicily, you know, in the distance, very clear, and we got torpedoed.</span> <span id="s1306">Nothing should come easy.</span> <span id="s1307">But we were lucky again; it was a liberty ship.</span> <span id="s1308">You know what a liberty ship is?</span> <span id="s1309">No.</span> <span id="s1310">A liberty ship was built by a fellow whose company was Kaiser.</span> <span id="s1311">He was Kaiser.</span> <span id="s1312">K-A-I-S-E-R.</span> <span id="s1313">And he built ships with the middle separate from the back.</span> <span id="s1314">From the front, I should say.</span> <span id="s1315">If you get hit in the back, the front stays up.</span> <span id="s1316">Very clever idea.</span> <span id="s1317">Saved our lives.</span> <span id="s1318">We made it back to Africa.</span> <span id="s1319">Nobody was killed.</span> <span id="s1320">But we got torpedoed.</span> <span id="s1321">When we were back in Africa, we were back up on the hill, we were selling prophylactics again and everything else, and then one day he says, today is your day.</span> <span id="s1322">They took us all to a big tent and there was a screen in between where you couldn‚Äôt see and hardly hear anything.</span> <span id="s1323">We were sitting on chairs on the open side.</span> <span id="s1324">And now we‚Äôre called Mr. so-and-so, sergeant so, whatever it was, we go in, one guy goes in at a time and we hear talking, but we can‚Äôt understand anything.</span> <span id="s1325">And then we hear loud laughter.</span> <span id="s1326">And this goes on every time somebody goes in.</span> <span id="s1327">When I went in there, I gave him my name, my serial number, everything.</span> <span id="s1328">Thirty-two, 5-6-0-9-6-2.</span> <span id="s1329">Right.</span> <span id="s1330">And he said, well, he said, I have to go over a few questions here, he says, you were born here, this and this and this.</span> <span id="s1331">Yes.</span> <span id="s1332">Do you have any connection with Germany?</span> <span id="s1333">I said no, my parents are still there, I says, I hope they‚Äôre alive.</span> <span id="s1334">And he says now comes the important question.</span> <span id="s1335">What‚Äôs the important question?</span> <span id="s1336">He says, now listen carefully, do you mind fighting against the country of your birth?</span> <span id="s1337">And I got hysterical, I says, are you kidding me.</span> <span id="s1338">I already fought against the country of my birth.</span> <span id="s1339">He says, I know, I know, every time one of you guys comes in, everybody breaks out in laughter.</span> <span id="s1340">I says, yeah, I don‚Äôt mind.</span> <span id="s1341">I don‚Äôt mind at all.</span> <span id="s1342">And then I got my citizen papers.</span> <span id="s1343">My citizen papers say Africa, Iran, everything else.</span> <span id="s1344">And from there on, I was sent back to my outfit.</span> <span id="s1345">My outfit in the meantime had made the invasion of Italy.</span> <span id="s1346">We weren‚Äôt there, but I made the invasion of Anzio.</span> <span id="s1347">Anzio was a very, very long and bitter battle.</span> <span id="s1348">It was flat land, all farmers there.</span> <span id="s1349">They took the farmers away, but luckily they left the animals there.</span> <span id="s1350">And the Germans were sitting on top of the hill.</span> <span id="s1351">So when we got there after the invasion, they gave my particular platoon a farmer‚Äôs house.</span> <span id="s1352">And we were in the back where the cows used to be.</span> <span id="s1353">Other parts of the company were in different houses, we were spread out all over this perimeter, and we did nothing but, you know, make sure -- I used to sleep in the manger where the cows eat the grass from.</span> <span id="s1354">In the meantime, our information, or our officers were such complete idiots, they never even thought about, you made the invasion, now let‚Äôs see how far you can go.</span> <span id="s1355">No, they drew a line.</span> <span id="s1356">We‚Äôre not gonna go further than this because they‚Äôre probably sitting on top.</span> <span id="s1357">But they weren‚Äôt.</span> <span id="s1358">They weren‚Äôt sitting there at all.</span> <span id="s1359">The company, the battalion, or the division actually that made the invasion of Anzio, or a lot of them, they went in, they lost half of their men after a while, because all of a sudden, it started raining.</span> <span id="s1360">Senator Dole was there.</span> <span id="s1361">All right, that‚Äôs where he got that wound there and you know who else was there?</span> <span id="s1362">Audie Murphy, the most decorated American soldier.</span> <span id="s1363">My buddy, because we were supporting the 3rd Division, which they were in.</span> <span id="s1364">But anyway, we spent three-and-a-half months there.</span> <span id="s1365">And the only thing good I can tell you is that my outfit ate pigeons, chickens, rabbits, pigs, calf, veal, and cow meat.</span> <span id="s1366">I killed them one at a time because in the Army, if you‚Äôre in a place like this, all you get is cans of C-rations or boxes of K-rations.</span> <span id="s1367">Either one of them, if you live on them for more than a week, you just feel like, it‚Äôs not worth it.</span> <span id="s1368">So I cooked.</span> <span id="s1369">And my captain, one night, he couldn‚Äôt believe it, I made stuffed breast of veal.</span> <span id="s1370">And I told him, this is a real nice Jewish dish.</span> <span id="s1371">So, but I, when I landed on Anzio, when I met my captain there, I said to the captain, he says, I says, I‚Äôm a citizen now, he says, so you can send me anywhere you want, I want to be at the front.</span> <span id="s1372">He says wait a minute, wait a minute, you‚Äôre not going anywhere, the only one that can cook.</span> <span id="s1373">I says, that‚Äôs right sir, but ______ exactly my background, I want to go to the front.</span> <span id="s1374">And he was a captain whose ancestry comes from Puerto Rico.</span> <span id="s1375">As a matter of fact, his father was a general and he had gone to West Point, but he still talked, still had a very, very heavy accent.</span> <span id="s1376">When he said to me, Hamburg, you want to go the front?</span> <span id="s1377">I said, yes, sir.</span> <span id="s1378">Okay, I went to the front.</span> <span id="s1379">I knew what to do with the mortar and I very good with math and when you have a mortar, you have something sitting on the barrel of the mortar and you have sticks there.</span> <span id="s1380">So you put your mortar side on that one stick in the middle and the man who‚Äôs at the map will tell you, so many clicks over here, or so many clicks over here depending where the enemy is and I was very good at it.</span> <span id="s1381">I was there for four weeks and I got a promotion.</span> <span id="s1382">I never was a corporal.</span> <span id="s1383">I was a sergeant.</span> <span id="s1384">And I stayed as a sergeant until almost the end of the war, then I became a platoon leader, I had 50 men under me, and I became a staff sergeant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">Q: Where?</span> <span id="s1386">Where at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">A: This is now at the Brenner Pass.</span> <span id="s1388">Between Italy and -- was it Switzerland or Austria?</span> <span id="s1389">I think it‚Äôs Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1390">Yeah, Switzerland -- and we, at that time, were supporting to the 10th Mountain Division, which came very, very late, but they had a general in charge who had gotten the Medal of Honor in World War I and he wanted to get as medal, as many medals as possible in the few months that he was there.</span> <span id="s1391">If a guy fell and cut his hand on a can, he got a Purple Heart.</span> <span id="s1392">I mean, we were so mad at them.</span> <span id="s1393">It was horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">Q: And you are a recipient of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">A: Louder.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">Q: -- Bronze, you‚Äôre a recipient of the Bronze Star.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">A: That‚Äôs correct.</span> <span id="s1398">What did I do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: Can you tell me, how did you receive it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1401">This was after we got out of Anzio and we were going towards Rome.</span> <span id="s1402">And at one point, we still were getting some German shells coming in, so we moved the trucks, so we had to stop the truck and find someplace to hide.</span> <span id="s1403">And we found a cave, we were supposed to go over an area that was wide open, but that was like trees and little mountain part here and further down.</span> <span id="s1404">And in that mountain part, there was a hole, a big, big hole like a big cave and that‚Äôs where we all went in.</span> <span id="s1405">My 50 guys.</span> <span id="s1406">And we had our mortar set up in the open, naturally, you can‚Äôt shoot through a mountain, and ever so often we would shoot and then we would run back to the cave and then they would shoot back.</span> <span id="s1407">One of my boys who was also a mortar sergeant got hit.</span> <span id="s1408">And he got hit in the lung.</span> <span id="s1409">And he was lying there, I didn‚Äôt know if he was dead or not, but I said to the medical man, the, what do they call them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">MRS. HAMBURG: Medic?</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">Q: The medic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">A: The medic.</span> <span id="s1413">I says, I‚Äôm going to get him.</span> <span id="s1414">You come with me.</span> <span id="s1415">We ran out to them and my friend, Joe Weiler, I mention the name because he comes up again, he went with me.</span> <span id="s1416">He was also a sergeant.</span> <span id="s1417">And we got to him and we picked him up and he was alive.</span> <span id="s1418">And no matter had we picked him up, the shelling started.</span> <span id="s1419">So ran to the nearest ditch and we all went into the ditch and I put myself on top of this man so he shouldn‚Äôt get hit again.</span> <span id="s1420">And then we brought him back.</span> <span id="s1421">That‚Äôs why I got a Bronze Star.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">Q: And that‚Ä¶</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">A: But Joseph Weiler, Jewish boy from Brooklyn, all right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">MRS. HAMBURG: No, you don‚Äôt have that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">A: You didn‚Äôt bring it, okay.</span> <span id="s1426">It‚Äôs in the Army album.</span> <span id="s1427">Joe Weiler and I became very good friends even in America and Joe, I was at that time, in 1942, I was 21 years old, Joe was 8 years older, so he was 29.</span> <span id="s1428">We became like real close buddies, I called him Uncle Joe.</span> <span id="s1429">Why did I call him Uncle Joe?</span> <span id="s1430">He showed me a picture of his niece.</span> <span id="s1431">She was gorgeous, most gorgeous Jewish girl in America, maybe?</span> <span id="s1432">So I started writing to her and we corresponded for over two years.</span> <span id="s1433">And that‚Äôs how he became Uncle Joe because if I married his niece, he would be my uncle.</span> <span id="s1434">The sad thing is that on the last day of the war, we were near a lake -- there‚Äôs three lakes, I always get them mixed up --</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">MRS. HAMBURG: Garda.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">A: Garda.</span> <span id="s1437">Lake Garda.</span> <span id="s1438">The Germans had bombed out the tunnels that went through the mountains near the lake, so we went through there, but we couldn‚Äôt go far, too far enough, so we had to come back out, we had to take a boat or something, bring our mortars way up there.</span> <span id="s1439">We finally came to the end of the lake there and they said, okay, set your mortars up out there where the grapevines are and all that.</span> <span id="s1440">And I had just come back from the hospital because three of our boys were killed in an accident with a Jeep, not from anybody shooting them, and I came back and the rations just came in and it was my job to make these rations for this guys, no, for this group and this group and this group and this group, so I‚Äôm breaking it up and an order came in for a mission, a shooting mission.</span> <span id="s1441">And it was for my mortar, I say my mortar because this one was already in the position to shoot back.</span> <span id="s1442">I said okay I‚Äôll take it and Joe said no.</span> <span id="s1443">We always did that, you have something to do, I‚Äôll find your mortar, I know where your mortar is.</span> <span id="s1444">And we did that all the time, whoever was available- a mortar is a mortar.</span> <span id="s1445">And he went down and I heard an explosion and I knew what it was.</span> <span id="s1446">He was gone.</span> <span id="s1447">I ran down, one hole here.</span> <span id="s1448">And I held him in my arms for about two hours.</span> <span id="s1449">Uncle Joe.</span> <span id="s1450">And if I had gone there, he took my place.</span> <span id="s1451">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1453">How did you feel as a German-Jewish immigrant serving in the U.S. military, during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">A: Very fulfilled.</span> <span id="s1455">I had a, what shall I say, I had to, I had to get even, let‚Äôs put it that way.</span> <span id="s1456">The word I was looking for, I didn‚Äôt get.</span> <span id="s1457">They stole my youth.</span> <span id="s1458">I mean, when they came in power, like in 1933, when Hitler became in power, what was I, 12 years-old.</span> <span id="s1459">I still had a wonderful time because I was not harassed by anyone in the school.</span> <span id="s1460">As a matter of fact, I remember the day that we graduated, I was 16.</span> <span id="s1461">And when you graduate, the class goes to the director‚Äôs office.</span> <span id="s1462">He‚Äôs the principal of the whole school, high school.</span> <span id="s1463">And he congratulates everyone separately.</span> <span id="s1464">All right?</span> <span id="s1465">You‚Äôre standing there, yeah?</span> <span id="s1466">So-and-so good, good, good, and he came to me and he said, in German, Hamburger, fur Juden, bist es so Schleicht.</span> <span id="s1467">Hamburger, my last name, for a Jew, you‚Äôre not too bad.</span> <span id="s1468">Thank you God, he likes me.</span> <span id="s1469">Idiot.</span> <span id="s1470">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: And where were you at the war‚Äôs conclusion?</span> <span id="s1472">When the war ended, where were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">A: When the war ended, I was at the Brenner Pass, at the top of Italy, going into Austria, no, Switzerland, Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1474">That‚Äôs where I was.</span> <span id="s1475">That‚Äôs where Joe got killed and that‚Äôs where, that was my last mission.</span> <span id="s1476">Then after that, my outfit got together and they said, you‚Äôre now going to go fight in Japan.</span> <span id="s1477">But they say here in the orders, anybody that has more than 85 points does not have to go to Japan, he goes home.</span> <span id="s1478">Now, in order to get 85 points, every month that you serve, that you were in the Army counts as a point, all right?</span> <span id="s1479">Every medal that you have, counts as five points.</span> <span id="s1480">Your rating counts as ten points.</span> <span id="s1481">I had 96 points.</span> <span id="s1482">I wasn‚Äôt going to Japan and so were quite a few other guys, so the last I‚Äôm sitting there somewhere didn‚Äôt make any difference.</span> <span id="s1483">And they took us back down to Naples and finally at the end caught the boat.</span> <span id="s1484">My outfit had left.</span> <span id="s1485">On the way to the United States, Japan surrendered.</span> <span id="s1486">They were home before I was.</span> <span id="s1487">Lucky guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">Q: And where did you, where did you live after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">A: Where did I come when I came home from the war?</span> <span id="s1490">I shouldn‚Äôt even say that.</span> <span id="s1491">I didn‚Äôt go right home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">Q: Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">A: My sister was a, my sister who during the war was living in Michigan, because her husband was in service and he had a job up in Michigan, she was now living in Newark where I was originally landed.</span> <span id="s1494">I had such good friends on the boat.</span> <span id="s1495">It took us nine days to come back and I went home with one of them.</span> <span id="s1496">He was an Italian-American boy.</span> <span id="s1497">And I stayed there a few days.</span> <span id="s1498">My sister didn‚Äôt know I was coming home anyway, and finally one of the fellows there, he got a car and we all went there and we went to Newark and I saw my sister.</span> <span id="s1499">I stayed with my sister.</span> <span id="s1500">I got my job back in the restaurant, but not the same one that was on the hill, but he owned three restaurants, the one on the hill burned down.</span> <span id="s1501">So now I was in Newark.</span> <span id="s1502">He had a very nice big restaurant and I took my job there, but I no longer had any desire to cook.</span> <span id="s1503">So I made up my mind, my sister had come here, sister was a very bright girl, and she first worked as a nanny, she saved up money and she took up beauty culture.</span> <span id="s1504">And she became a hair stylist.</span> <span id="s1505">And she said to me, I says, you‚Äôre very talented in arts, I used to paint, I used to draw, I used to do all kinds of things, she says, why don‚Äôt you take a course under the G.I. Bill of Rights.</span> <span id="s1506">So I says, that‚Äôs an idea.</span> <span id="s1507">So I went down to the place in Newark where they gave the lessons and the lectures, it was a year course.</span> <span id="s1508">And I signed up.</span> <span id="s1509">Then I went back to my restaurant and I said I can only work from five till nine.</span> <span id="s1510">Why?</span> <span id="s1511">I says, because I‚Äôm going to be a hair stylist.</span> <span id="s1512">Guy says, are you sure going to come here?</span> <span id="s1513">I says, absolutely.</span> <span id="s1514">I went to the school from nine till four, and then from five till one o‚Äôclock, I did cooking.</span> <span id="s1515">Until the last man had left.</span> <span id="s1516">And when I graduated there, I got a job as a hairdresser.</span> <span id="s1517">And I worked there for a few months and I said, I said to my boss, it was a Jewish man who used to work for Albert and Carter, which was in, what was that big place?</span> <span id="s1518">Saks Fifth Avenue.</span> <span id="s1519">In a beauty parlor on Saks Fifth Avenue.</span> <span id="s1520">And I said, Walter, I says, I can‚Äôt stay with you.</span> <span id="s1521">He says, why?</span> <span id="s1522">Everybody likes you.</span> <span id="s1523">I says, I know, I says, but some of these women drive me bananas.</span> <span id="s1524">He says why, what did they do.</span> <span id="s1525">Oh, this curl should be this way and this one here should be this way.</span> <span id="s1526">And you know, I‚Äôve been through too much to listen to this garbage here.</span> <span id="s1527">He says you‚Äôll get used to it, you‚Äôll get used to it.</span> <span id="s1528">I says, well, I‚Äôm going to take some months off.</span> <span id="s1529">And I went to a place in Towaco in New Jersey.</span> <span id="s1530">It was a place where, what was the name of the outfit that ran that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">MRS. HAMBURG: Uh, workman‚Äôs circle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">A: Workman‚Äôs circle.</span> <span id="s1533">Workman‚Äôs circle.</span> <span id="s1534">And I had worked there before, one summer.</span> <span id="s1535">No that was the first time, that was the first time, yeah.</span> <span id="s1536">I went up there and I got a job.</span> <span id="s1537">I was the only cook there, the owner was, he knew how to cook, but not much.</span> <span id="s1538">And I worked there for July, August, till September.</span> <span id="s1539">I started in June already.</span> <span id="s1540">In the meantime, the hairdresser guy called me, they want you back, they want you back.</span> <span id="s1541">I says, well I‚Äôm going to finish here.</span> <span id="s1542">It was a good thing it was where I met her.</span> <span id="s1543">This beautiful child here was 16 years old and she came to the camp and the boss‚Äôs wife said, wait until you see what‚Äôs coming in.</span> <span id="s1544">This girl was a counselor last year I says, she‚Äôs 16, and she was a counselor at 15.</span> <span id="s1545">Yes.</span> <span id="s1546">When she came, she was cute, but a little too heavy.</span> <span id="s1547">Can I tell ‚Äòem how much you weighed?</span> <span id="s1548">A hundred and seventy-two pounds and I said to the woman, I says, this is what you want for me?</span> <span id="s1549">I says, wait until you hear how she laughs, she‚Äôs very funny, she‚Äôs very cute, she‚Äôs very smart.</span> <span id="s1550">So I made a mistake one day.</span> <span id="s1551">I was making pancakes for breakfast and everybody came with their plates, you know, three pancakes, three pancakes, everybody was fed, she came up to the counter, can I have more?</span> <span id="s1552">I looked at her and I smiled and I says you can have more, and that‚Äôs when she says she fell in love with me.</span> <span id="s1553">I didn‚Äôt know.</span> <span id="s1554">But all during the time that we were out there, whenever the counselors went out I went along with them and she sort of attached herself to me.</span> <span id="s1555">So when some of us over, her girlfriend came to me and she said, are you gonna take Sunny out?</span> <span id="s1556">That‚Äôs Sunny.</span> <span id="s1557">Going to take Sunny out when the camp is finished?</span> <span id="s1558">I says, no, I‚Äôve no interest in her.</span> <span id="s1559">She‚Äôs cute, she‚Äôs nice, I says, but you know, she‚Äôs much too heavy for me.</span> <span id="s1560">So the girlfriend said what if she lost weight?</span> <span id="s1561">I says, I‚Äôll tell you what, she‚Äôs now 172.</span> <span id="s1562">If she, by her birthday in November is 135, I‚Äôll take her out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">MRS. HAMBURG: I think you might want to tell them the story about the battlefield commission.</span> <span id="s1564">Your battlefield commission.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">A: Oh, that was my father.</span> <span id="s1566">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">MRS. HAMBURG: Well, even the fact that you were recommended.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">A: This is something I should mention.</span> <span id="s1569">When I lived with my sister and I had already started found my parents alive.</span> <span id="s1570">My father, like I said, weighed 86 pounds, my mother looked all right, my mother because she was Aryan was not sent to a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1571">And she managed with her, actually, it was her sister, who lived further away, and her sister introduced her as a girlfriend that she knew from high school or something.</span> <span id="s1572">So, once the war was over, my father was reunited with my mother and I applied right away to bring them to America.</span> <span id="s1573">And being that I had a rank, that I was decorated, she was on the second boat coming here.</span> <span id="s1574">And she also came to my sister, who had an apartment with two bedrooms, yeah, and a living room that had a couch.</span> <span id="s1575">Oh, no, that was a little room attached to a balcony.</span> <span id="s1576">The room was about from the middle of this up to here, but it had a cot in it.</span> <span id="s1577">So if I opened the door, I fell on the cot and fell asleep.</span> <span id="s1578">My parents were in the other bedroom.</span> <span id="s1579">One night we were having dinner together, and I asked my father a few questions about the concentration camp and he says, I really don‚Äôt want to talk about it, I told you about how I kept myself alive with the potatoes and all that, I says, but I really don‚Äôt want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1580">It wasn‚Äôt nice.</span> <span id="s1581">And I said, do you think they kept you alive because you spoke five languages because Theresienstadt was known as the elite where all the doctors and the lawyers, all the educated people.</span> <span id="s1582">He said I don‚Äôt know.</span> <span id="s1583">He says, you know I‚Äôm glad you made it, Papa, he says so am I. I said I want to tell you a story.</span> <span id="s1584">I says, at the end of the war, nine days exactly after the end of the war, which was March 2nd --</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">MRS. HAMBURG: May.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">A: May, May 2nd, in Italy, I was notified that I was getting a battlefield promotion, but because of the war being over, they didn‚Äôt need another second lieutenant, so just let you know, you would have made it if the war had lasted longer, the war didn‚Äôt last longer, okay, you‚Äôre going home.</span> <span id="s1587">And my father looked at me and his eyes started to water and he said, if the war had lasted nine more days, my son, the newest second lieutenant in the American Army would not have had a father.</span> <span id="s1588">He was on the list to go two days after that to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1589">So I looked at him and I said, I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt get it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">Q: That‚Äôs quite a story.</span> <span id="s1591">Now did you, did you remain as a chef or did you go back to being a hair stylist after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">A: I told you when I came back, I went right away back to cooking for one of the restaurants this man owned.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">A: And then I took up going to school for hair stylist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">A: So I was a chef until I actually finished hair-styling school and got a job as a hair stylist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1598">And, so you met at this camp.</span> <span id="s1599">You met your wife at the camp.</span> <span id="s1600">And when did you, when did you marry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">A: Four years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q: Did you have children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1604">Four years later because she was 16 going on 17, there‚Äôs a song like that, right?</span> <span id="s1605">Sixteen going on seventeen?</span> <span id="s1606">And she was going to college the next year.</span> <span id="s1607">Now, here in America going to college at 16, that‚Äôs pretty good.</span> <span id="s1608">Smart girl.</span> <span id="s1609">But she always says the smartest thing she did was marry me, I don‚Äôt know.</span> <span id="s1610">But anyway, we decided that I‚Äôm not going to marry her while she‚Äôs going to college.</span> <span id="s1611">We‚Äôll wait.</span> <span id="s1612">And I was in Newark, New Jersey, she was in Queens, New York.</span> <span id="s1613">My car, after a while, I could close my eyes, you knew the way already.</span> <span id="s1614">And I used to see her on my day off.</span> <span id="s1615">And it was cute, you know, when we used to say good night out in Queens, I knew that my last train going to Newark was at 1 o‚Äôclock and then there was nothing until 2 o‚Äôclock.</span> <span id="s1616">Somehow, she managed to make me late every time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">Q: How did you feel about the war in the first 10-20 years after its conclusion?</span> <span id="s1618">Did you seek out other Jewish-American veterans, other Holocaust survivors, or, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">A: I did not join any veterans group, because I felt that after what I went through, it‚Äôs enough already.</span> <span id="s1620">But then I got a letter from the Disabled American Veterans and I was home about a year when I was getting 20 percent disability.</span> <span id="s1621">Because I was hurt, another time, but it was not a bloody hurt, it was wounded in a way.</span> <span id="s1622">We were told to stop the cars coming out of Anzio, this was right after Anzio, and we were riding along a way that has a big, big wall here of dirt, you know like, ground, the other side was flat.</span> <span id="s1623">And we got some shells coming in, so it was, we were told to dig yourself into the side where the wall is very high so, this way, a shell would have to fall right in front of that hole to hit you.</span> <span id="s1624">And I was stuck in that hole and I was, I can‚Äôt show you because my back what I‚Äôm talking about, had my legs out straight and my legs out straight and I was hammering into the wall because it‚Äôs a very tough wall, and I‚Äôm hammering away and I‚Äôm bent forward and a shell hit on top, and I was buried alive.</span> <span id="s1625">Naturally, everybody that was around there saw that, they were in their holes, and right away came over, they dug me out, I couldn‚Äôt breathe, finally got back my breath back and I went to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1626">I was in the hospital for eight days.</span> <span id="s1627">And then I went back to my outfit and then I got a Purple Heart for that.</span> <span id="s1628">I says, well I guess I didn‚Äôt bleed.</span> <span id="s1629">But then later on, when I was home I once wrote to the Veterans Administration and I asked them you know you have in you have boys in Iraq and you have boys in Afghanistan and you have boys on the, what was the other one before that, and they can be on a truck, you know, and hit a mine or something and get hurt, but not bleed, but they get a Purple Heart.</span> <span id="s1630">Why am I not entitled?</span> <span id="s1631">And they said you are entitled.</span> <span id="s1632">Okay.</span> <span id="s1633">Big deal.</span> <span id="s1634">Now I got two.</span> <span id="s1635">What else did I forget?</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">MRS. HAMBURG: You asked something about refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">Q: I wanted to hear the story when you returned to Germany after the war with two other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">Q: To your town.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">Q: Can you tell me about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">A: Oh, by the way, I joined the Disabled American Veterans.</span> <span id="s1643">After I was as a member for two years, they made me the commander, because I had been the commander for Knights of Pythias and I know exactly what was going on.</span> <span id="s1644">And I‚Äôm still with them.</span> <span id="s1645">I‚Äôm now the treasurer for the last six years.</span> <span id="s1646">Now, what else was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">Q: Going back to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">A: Yeah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">Q: You went back to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">A: I never, ever had the desire to go back to Germany, even though, I must say, I did not have a very bad childhood, because of the fact that in school, the friends that I had, all Gentiles, were all very, very good to me.</span> <span id="s1651">I was part of them.</span> <span id="s1652">Whatever happened, Eric was part of it.</span> <span id="s1653">So I can‚Äôt say that I suffered.</span> <span id="s1654">Naturally, when I go to school and everybody stands there Heil Hitler, I don‚Äôt say Heil Hitler, I was always a little shaky, but I had training in throwing a hand grenade, I had training in rifle shooting.</span> <span id="s1655">Oh, this is another cute one.</span> <span id="s1656">In the last year I was there, this is 1937, we had rifle shooting one day, we did it in our, we did the gymnasium.</span> <span id="s1657">All right?</span> <span id="s1658">And they set up a place in the back where they had a stage, metal pieces so you know and then put these signs up and you had to shoot into the sign like you do when you go to a market or something, not a market.</span> <span id="s1659">And I shot and the fellow next to me, I knew was a very good shot because in the summertime he used to go with his uncle.</span> <span id="s1660">His uncle was a forester, in charge of keeping the forest clean of people stealing animals or something like that and he always had a was a very good shot.</span> <span id="s1661">He won the shooting, but I came in second.</span> <span id="s1662">I was called upstairs to the principal and I had two SS men there, they wanted to know where I learned how to shoot.</span> <span id="s1663">And I belonged at that time in Germany to our equivalent of the Hitler Youth, which was called IPD, Israelitische _______ Deutschland, Israeli Boy Scouts of Germany.</span> <span id="s1664">And they thought maybe I could learn how to shoot, I says, no, no, no, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">MRS. HAMBURG: When we went back to Germany is what she asked and I, when we went back to Germany and the night we were to, well either the night when we first came and you spoke and the night when we, it was the last night, when you spoke.</span> <span id="s1666">I think that answers her question about how you felt being back in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">A: Yes, but before I go there you just reminded me of something.</span> <span id="s1668">I didn‚Äôt tell them about that trip I took did I?</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">A: With the journalists coming around?</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">A: No.</span> <span id="s1673">In our sixth straight‚Ä¶ MRS.

HAMBURG: This was before you had your hip operation, so I would say this was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">A: Did I have my hip operation already?</span> <span id="s1684">No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">MRS. HAMBURG: No.</span> <span id="s1686">In the 80s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">Q: In the 80s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">A: The 80s, you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">A: Somewheres around there, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">MRS. HAMBURG: Late 80s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">A: And she says why don‚Äôt you go, I says I don‚Äôt want to have nothing to do with Germany, she says, look, this is already 50 years ago and she said, you know, the people there are young people who don‚Äôt even know what the war looked like, they don‚Äôt even know what happened.</span> <span id="s1693">Unfortunately, the school in Germany taught them very, very little, she says, go, maybe you can convince some of them what was for real.</span> <span id="s1694">So I said, okay.</span> <span id="s1695">So I brought my wife, we went there.</span> <span id="s1696">We were 3 former refugees.</span> <span id="s1697">One was, no four.</span> <span id="s1698">Four, yeah.</span> <span id="s1699">One was now living in Argentina, one was living in Israel, it was a woman, one was living in Peru and I. And a funny thing was I‚Äôm checking in and I see there the four names of the people, the three names of the people, who are coming besides myself.</span> <span id="s1700">I says, I can‚Äôt believe it.</span> <span id="s1701">One of the names was Eric Kaufmann.</span> <span id="s1702">He was my best friend in Germany.</span> <span id="s1703">I said he‚Äôs still alive, he lives in Peru now and we met and I looked at him, he looked exactly like his father did 50 years ago.</span> <span id="s1704">Bald with a black rim around it.</span> <span id="s1705">I said I would know you if I met you in China.</span> <span id="s1706">So anyway, that was one thing, meeting him again was wonderful.</span> <span id="s1707">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">Q: How did you feel being back there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">A: I felt funny.</span> <span id="s1710">Funny.</span> <span id="s1711">The house where I lived in that my father owned with a beautiful, beautiful apartment we had was now a lake.</span> <span id="s1712">The house had been bombed.</span> <span id="s1713">There was a big open lot next to it, I remember that, and they had torn everything down and made like a big beautiful lake, well I‚Äôm saying lake like a square in America here, and flowers and trees and ducks in the pond.</span> <span id="s1714">That was my then-home.</span> <span id="s1715">And my father‚Äôs business, which I had very vividly in front of my eyes because I have it on a picture, too, was now a pharmacy.</span> <span id="s1716">But more like a CVS, they were selling everything, you know, because in Germany, when I was a kid, a pharmacy only sold things to make you better and most of it was herbs.</span> <span id="s1717">So I felt bad, especially when I saw my father‚Äôs store, the building behind it was still up there, but the part over the store was taken down except behind there the apartments were still there.</span> <span id="s1718">And when I was invited by the mayor the second night we got dressed and the four of us with our spouses went to meet the mayor.</span> <span id="s1719">And I got there...</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">Q: The mayor of Mannheim?</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">A: Ludwigshafen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">Q: Ludwigshafen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">A: Mannheim is only where I was born and where I lived for the year before I went here.</span> <span id="s1724">And I‚Äôm coming in there and there‚Äôs a whole bunch of people there because he was treating us to, that night we only had like coffee and cake right, yeah, it wasn‚Äôt a dinner like later.</span> <span id="s1725">And I see there three fellows standing there and I look at them and I see them.</span> <span id="s1726">I says, I bet you they‚Äôre here for me, and I went over there and one says, Eric Hamburger, I knew it was you, I knew it was you and I knew you were the one with the thirteen.</span> <span id="s1727">What‚Äôs the thirteen?</span> <span id="s1728">Cute story.</span> <span id="s1729">When I was a kid going to school, if we had any kind of things going in school any kind of tests, if it was on the 13th, I knew I would get an A. I mean, I felt so confident, because I was born on the 13th of January, 1921.</span> <span id="s1730">Now how did I come to the 13?</span> <span id="s1731">I was once at my uncle‚Äôs house in a little village and I‚Äôm reading a magazine.</span> <span id="s1732">I was sitting down and I see there a story about Richard Wagner, very famous musician, opera man, very German.</span> <span id="s1733">And it says here, Richard Wager always thought of the number 13 as his lucky number.</span> <span id="s1734">Why?</span> <span id="s1735">Because he was born on the 13th, 18- whatever he was born in.</span> <span id="s1736">The 13th he was born.</span> <span id="s1737">His name had 13 letters.</span> <span id="s1738">The year he was born, if you took the numbers apart made 13.</span> <span id="s1739">I says, very interesting.</span> <span id="s1740">I said, wait a minute, I was born on the 13th.</span> <span id="s1741">My name has 13 letters, Eric Hamburger, and I was born in 1921, one and nine is 10 and two is 12 and one is 13.</span> <span id="s1742">Hey, I got it made, 13, beautiful.</span> <span id="s1743">Then when I told that in school, when I went back to school after vacation time, I says 13 is my number.</span> <span id="s1744">I says I got another one.</span> <span id="s1745">I was born in January, right?</span> <span id="s1746">What‚Äôs the month before that?</span> <span id="s1747">The 12th.</span> <span id="s1748">So, it could be the first or the 13th.</span> <span id="s1749">And they remembered that when I got there, you‚Äôre the one with the 13.</span> <span id="s1750">And they invited me to their house and they took me out for dinner, nice people.</span> <span id="s1751">Except when we went to the house of one guy, there was one fellow there and his wife came, who was very nice to me except she was an idiot.</span> <span id="s1752">She‚Äôs telling me that she was a nurse in a hospital in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1753">That‚Äôs all I needed.</span> <span id="s1754">What else?</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">MRS. HAMBURG: No, I was referring to how you spoke because they asked you to speak, to represent the group.</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">A: Oh, oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">MRS. HAMBURG: How you felt about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">A: Yeah, I opened my big mouth.</span> <span id="s1759">They asked me, the mayor asked me, he asked me, he says, you are welcome, he says, anybody here wants to say anything.</span> <span id="s1760">And I said, yes, I do.</span> <span id="s1761">He says, please, speak.</span> <span id="s1762">And I told them, I says, I want to thank you for inviting me, I says, I never would have come back here if it wasn‚Äôt for the fact that you invited me, would have a chance to maybe straighten some things out that you have misconceptions for.</span> <span id="s1763">I said, I can forgive you of what you did because it‚Äôs so long ago and the people that are my age there‚Äôs not that many around, I says, but I will never, never forget.</span> <span id="s1764">I says, what you did to me and my family, you stole my youth from me.</span> <span id="s1765">I says, this was just the years that a young man has a good time, where he learns a trade, where he learns a business, whatever it may be.</span> <span id="s1766">You took that away from me, I says, and I hope that you realize that this was horrible for me and my family.</span> <span id="s1767">When we left there, we had a dinner and we were seated all around on a like a horseshoe table, was it?</span> <span id="s1768">Or even a square.</span> <span id="s1769">We weren‚Äôt seated next to each other, they split us out.</span> <span id="s1770">She was next to a young man who we had met the same day.</span> <span id="s1771">He was in charge of the--</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">MRS. HAMBURG: Archives.</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">A: Archives, of the town.</span> <span id="s1774">And he found quite a few pictures of me, of my father‚Äôs store, before it was remodeled like it was now, and he was very nice.</span> <span id="s1775">And he was sitting, at night now, sitting next to my wife.</span> <span id="s1776">I was sitting next to another man.</span> <span id="s1777">We talked a bit, but we really had nothing much to say to each other.</span> <span id="s1778">And again, the Burgermeister, which is the mayor, asked if anybody wanted to speak.</span> <span id="s1779">Yes, I do sir.</span> <span id="s1780">Please.</span> <span id="s1781">I said thank you again, I says, this was two very lovely weeks.</span> <span id="s1782">I was able to go to Heidelberg, which I think is the prettiest little place in the world.</span> <span id="s1783">Just gorgeous.</span> <span id="s1784">I spent a lot of my youth there because we went practically every weekend.</span> <span id="s1785">Up, on the car going up to the mountains and all that, you apparently haven‚Äôt been there.</span> <span id="s1786">You?</span> <span id="s1787">No.</span> <span id="s1788">It is just beautiful, it‚Äôs a river going through it and it‚Äôs known as a university town.</span> <span id="s1789">Some of the best doctors and lawyers were educated in Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s1790">They also made an opera out of it called the‚Ä¶ MRS. HAMBURG: Student Prince.</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">A: Student Prince.</span> <span id="s1792">All takes place in this, I mean they don‚Äôt mention Heidelberg there, I don‚Äôt think, but, I mean, that was the.</span> <span id="s1793">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">MRS. HAMBURG: Locale.</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">A: What happened there in Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s1796">And, wait a minute, yeah, all right, I says I saw my Heidelberg again that I‚Äôll always love and there‚Äôs nothing to do with anything that Hitler had to do.</span> <span id="s1797">I says, the river, the Neckar, I says, I can still sing the song Ich hab mein Hertz in Heidelberg verloren, I lost my heart in Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s1798">And I says, but I must tell you, it‚Äôs very hard, very hard for me to look around and see people that haven‚Äôt got the slightest idea of what the Jewish population went through.</span> <span id="s1799">I said I had a funny experience, I says, I saw Hitler with my own eyes.</span> <span id="s1800">I says, when he was here in Ludwigshafen, when he went through there.</span> <span id="s1801">I didn‚Äôt tell them I was sitting on top of _______.</span> <span id="s1802">I said, and you people think you know that he was somebody that you, der Fuhrer.</span> <span id="s1803">I says, he cost you a lot of people.</span> <span id="s1804">I says, I want to tell you one thing and that‚Äôs the end of what I‚Äôm saying.</span> <span id="s1805">I cry.</span> <span id="s1806">I cry for the six million Jews that you killed.</span> <span id="s1807">In the ovens, in any way possibly, you kill them, not only that, you killed five million other people.</span> <span id="s1808">Gypsies.</span> <span id="s1809">Priests.</span> <span id="s1810">Gay people.</span> <span id="s1811">Anybody that was a Communist.</span> <span id="s1812">Five million other people that weren‚Äôt Jews.</span> <span id="s1813">I says, I cry for them.</span> <span id="s1814">And last but not least, I cry for the millions of people that you lost in this war.</span> <span id="s1815">Some of the best people and I know it because they were all my friends.</span> <span id="s1816">So cry for them with me.</span> <span id="s1817">And they said that was beautiful.</span> <span id="s1818">But then the fellow sitting next to her said what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">MRS. HAMBURG: This is an interesting story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">A: Say it louder.</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">Q: We‚Äôre not going to get it recorded, so we should, if you want to come closer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">MRS. HAMBURG: Okay.</span> <span id="s1823">This archives director.</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">A: Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s1825">You want to take over for me?</span> <span id="s1826">Take over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">Q: That‚Äôs okay.</span> <span id="s1828">Do you remember what he said?</span> <span id="s1829">Can you tell me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">A: This fellow sitting next to her, when he heard that I had seen Hitler in person, he was in awe.</span> <span id="s1833">Your husband saw Hitler?</span> <span id="s1834">Do you realize what that means?</span> <span id="s1835">Your husband saw Hitler, really?</span> <span id="s1836">And she looked at him like he was from another planet, he had no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">MRS. HAMBURG: But the important thing, he was telling us his father was pastor.</span> <span id="s1838">And he said that he saw in the books he used for his sermon, where he would underline certain things which subtly criticized the Nazi regime.</span> <span id="s1839">Implying that his father was one of the liberals who tried.</span> <span id="s1840">And he was very respectful to us and very, seemed, very liberal.</span> <span id="s1841">And when he carried on so because Eric saw Hitler, it was such a conflict there that he didn‚Äôt realize.</span> <span id="s1842">It struck me.</span> <span id="s1843">It just struck me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">Q: Certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">A: I want you to know that in my class, my high school class, there were 50 boys.</span> <span id="s1846">Except for myself, another kid who was from Polish immigrants, not Jewish, all were in the army.</span> <span id="s1847">Out of the 50 boys, 28 were killed.</span> <span id="s1848">This is what they have to worry about, that‚Äôs why I said I cry for them, there was nothing wrong with them except what you people made out of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">Q: Well, I think that concludes--</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">A: That‚Äôs enough?</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">Q: Yeah, is there anything else you want to add, just at the end?</span> <span id="s1852">Final thoughts on your life and your experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">A: I have three children.</span> <span id="s1854">Beautiful children.</span> <span id="s1855">I had a daughter, Marcy.</span> <span id="s1856">I had a son David, and a son Michael.</span> <span id="s1857">Marcy is gone.</span> <span id="s1858">She died of cancer at 55 years old.</span> <span id="s1859">She was gorgeous.</span> <span id="s1860">Have you got the picture here of the family?</span> <span id="s1861">I‚Äôll put it in there.</span> <span id="s1862">You have my passport?</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">Q: I‚Äôd like to look at your photos when we‚Äôre done.</span> <span id="s1864">Is that it?</span> <span id="s1865">I guess my final question would be, how and would you, per se, would you have been a different person if this had not happened, if the Holocaust had never happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">A: Different in what sense?</span> <span id="s1867">Different was, number one, I would have been a very rich young man taken over my father‚Äôs business.</span> <span id="s1868">Different that I would have married a German-Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s1869">Different that my whole life was completely different.</span> <span id="s1870">I mean, America is not Germany and Germany certainly is not America.</span> <span id="s1871">The freedom that I have in this country, I didn‚Äôt have over there even before Hitler.</span> <span id="s1872">And I remember my father on Rosh Hashanah going to temple in tails and a high hat.</span> <span id="s1873">This was the common thing for a high holiday.</span> <span id="s1874">I used to go to shul every Saturday morning.</span> <span id="s1875">I haven‚Äôt been to shul now in God knows how long, but that is because my daughter died.</span> <span id="s1876">And on Saturday afternoon after we went home to have lunch or something, we went back and had a youth service.</span> <span id="s1877">We ate strictly kosher.</span> <span id="s1878">I remember one time for Pesach, I was out and I saw a man who was selling ice cream and I bought myself an ice cream cone and I had it half finished and I realized this is not kosher l‚ÄôPesach.</span> <span id="s1879">I threw it away.</span> <span id="s1880">There‚Äôs a lot of things that would have been entirely different.</span> <span id="s1881">Entirely different.</span> <span id="s1882">A little girl that I was going with when I left was killed in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1883">And why was she killed?</span> <span id="s1884">Let me tell you this.</span> <span id="s1885">Her father was in World War I, like my father, he had relatives in America, they sent him an affidavit for him, his wife, and my girlfriend.</span> <span id="s1886">No other children.</span> <span id="s1887">They went to Frankfurt to the consulate and they examine them there and they noticed that this part, this little part was missing on his finger.</span> <span id="s1888">And they said, what‚Äôs this?</span> <span id="s1889">He says, oh, this is a souvenir from World War I, I got my little finger shot off, it‚Äôs nothing.</span> <span id="s1890">You say it‚Äôs nothing, I don‚Äôt see it here on the affidavit that your people here in America know you‚Äôre missing a finger.</span> <span id="s1891">I‚Äôm not missing a finger.</span> <span id="s1892">Well, I can‚Äôt give you the visa.</span> <span id="s1893">He, his wife, and my girlfriend died.</span> <span id="s1894">Because of this idiot at an American consulate.</span> <span id="s1895">It‚Äôs so sad when you think about things.</span> <span id="s1896">I lost my aunt, she was left there because she had diabetes they wouldn‚Äôt give her a visa.</span> <span id="s1897">I lost my cousin there because he had, what the heck was it, epilepsy.</span> <span id="s1898">They wouldn‚Äôt give him a visa.</span> <span id="s1899">And I know how they died.</span> <span id="s1900">I don‚Äôt know if you know that, they used to have these big, like a train thing and that‚Äôs what they put these people in and they gave them something to eat, and there was a car outside and it had a hose attached to the train thing, and then they put in the gas.</span> <span id="s1901">That‚Äôs how these people died, they weren‚Äôt even at a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1902">But I am here and I‚Äôm ready to tell my story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">Q: Well, thank you so much for sharing your story--</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">A: You know I always felt bad because a lot of my friends who never ever saw what I see, who never went to any wars like I did, they were on, what‚Äôs it called?</span> <span id="s1905">What‚Äôs the day that we remember the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">Q: Yom Hashoah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">A: Yom Hashoah.</span> <span id="s1908">They were up on the stage telling their story and they never asked me.</span> <span id="s1909">And then finally, last, two years ago there was an article in the Jewish News because they wanted to straighten it out.</span> <span id="s1910">A lot of people say if you haven‚Äôt been in the concentration camp, you‚Äôre not a Holocaust survivor and I said it is wrong.</span> <span id="s1911">Anybody that survived Kristalnacht is a Holocaust survivor.</span> <span id="s1912">I‚Äôm one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">Q: Well, thank you so much, so much, and let‚Äôs stop here and I would--</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">A: I hope you got something out of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">Q: So much, really.</span> <span id="s1916">So, so much and I would just say for our tape--</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">A: Did you find the picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">Q: This concludes the United States Holocaust memorial interview with Eric Hamburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">End of File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
