DATE: March 20, 1990</span></p> <p><span id="s11">INTERVIEWER: Elaine Snyderman I was born in 1952, in Obuchava, in the vicinity of Moscow.</span> <span id="s12">It is a little town about twenty-five miles from Moscow.</span> <span id="s13">I graduated from the Moscow Institute of Architecture in 1981 with a Masters Degree.</span> <span id="s14">I worked at the State Company for Housing, also worked in the Society of Moscow Architects, this is like your A.I.A. here (The American Institute of Architects).</span> <span id="s15">I organized a congress of architecture, we helped deal with some problems in the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">My father, Arseny, was born in Obuchava in 1927, the same place I was born.</span> <span id="s17">My mother, Nellie, was born in 1929.</span> <span id="s18">I have a brother who is five years younger than I.</span> <span id="s19">He is still in Russia.</span> <span id="s20">Victor and I were married in 1981.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">My life in Russia was much different than my husband's.</span> <span id="s22">As I remember, from my very early childhood, the Soviet government, not like the religious tradition because it was not positive.</span> <span id="s23">My father was born into a quite rich family before the Revolution and in the place where I was born there was a kind of textile factory.</span> <span id="s24">It did not belong to my father's grandfather.</span> <span id="s25">He worked closely with the owner and he had a good house and was the manager.</span> <span id="s26">They were very proud, and he was very strong and relatively wealthy.</span> <span id="s27">When the Revolution came my grandfather was very smart, he gave up everything to survive.</span> <span id="s28">He gave the factory to the new government and they became very, very poor.</span> <span id="s29">My grandmother had five children.</span> <span id="s30">They survived but they were very hungry, my grandmother told me.</span> <span id="s31">And, my mother told me that this happened when she was very young.</span> <span id="s32">And my grandmother committed suicide after that.</span> <span id="s33">This was about the time of the Stalin purges of the 1930's.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">This happened in the Ukraine and her uncle took care of my mother after her parents died.</span> <span id="s35">That is why they felt what they felt and they dropped everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">My father, when he was fourteen years old he went to the army by himself.</span> <span id="s37">He was one of the ones sent to make the trenches for the defense of Moscow.</span> <span id="s38">They would not allow the Fascist army to enter Moscow.</span> <span id="s39">But even young people, eighteen years old, and younger, were sent there.</span> <span id="s40">There was no purpose because there was no way to defend what they had.</span> <span id="s41">And it was true because they were sent a few miles to the West from Moscow.</span> <span id="s42">So there was a risk of being taken prisoner by the Germans.</span> <span id="s43">So he and another little boy decided to get rid of this stupid situation and they walked, just walked, about one hundred twenty miles.</span> <span id="s44">And they came back, somebody informed the local government about this and they were considered deserters.</span> <span id="s45">He was between fourteen and fifteen when this happened.</span> <span id="s46">So my grandmother was required to go to the place and somebody dragged her, someone threatened her and told her they were going to kill him, the young boy.</span> <span id="s47">So, in a couple of years he was able to go by himself to the war and he went into Leningrad (the siege of Leningrad?)</span> <span id="s48">and he went to sea with the military - with the navy.</span> <span id="s49">He was in the Navy for nine years.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">He continued his training but he was wounded from his war service, he had a contusion and other injuries, so he needed to come back home, and he did.</span> <span id="s51">He wanted to be an artist but there was no one to give him studies.</span> <span id="s52">In spite of his desire to be an architect (?)</span> <span id="s53">he wanted.</span> <span id="s54">But he continued to draw and he had some talent.</span> <span id="s55">He taught me to draw.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">All my childhood we had, I remember how he drew!</span></p> <p><span id="s57">What he was doing for work, was a joke.</span> <span id="s58">He worked in a textile factory, (?)</span> <span id="s59">he did some very useful stuff, he made some inventions for this factory.</span> <span id="s60">They appreciated him as much as they could.</span> <span id="s61">He was in charge and then when I was little he was very poor.</span> <span id="s62">We lived in a very poor apartment.</span> <span id="s63">My parents try to live, not even near here.</span> <span id="s64">My father was very sincere with me, even when I was very young.</span> <span id="s65">He explained to me everything about Soviet power, etc.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">My mother worked at the same factory and worked with a group of sixteen other artists.</span> <span id="s67">She was the designer of carpets, ornamental carpets.</span> <span id="s68">She did just the design.</span> <span id="s69">My parents met at the factory and then they got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">I went to public school in Obuchava and I sort of trained to be an artist very early.</span> <span id="s71">Then I decided to go to architectural school and my parents also supported me in this.</span> <span id="s72">I went to architectural school and it was a great time.</span> <span id="s73">I was very happy in this school.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">I got married very young, and I was stupid.</span> <span id="s75">So after five years we were divorced.</span> <span id="s76">I met the man who is my husband now after I went to the Institute in Moscow, after my graduation.</span> <span id="s77">Then I was looking for a new, and more interesting, job.</span> <span id="s78">I worked at my studies, but it came quickly to me.</span> <span id="s79">I had some knowledge of architecture from earlier.</span> <span id="s80">I had very good communications with people and good language so I helped organize people and ideas.</span> <span id="s81">I have very strange feeling, as long as I worked at the Institute of Soviet Architecture in Moscow, I understood how simple ?</span> <span id="s82">the top people, educated, they have money in comparison to other people.</span> <span id="s83">and the Society of Architects in Moscow was invited to go abroad, to make some tours, to make contact with other people at other countries.</span> <span id="s84">So I noticed how people worked together and how the ways they used together.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">----- with membership in Communist Party and we were directed to that department that direct the job like we do because it was a kind of theoretical field in architecture.</span> <span id="s86">Architectural ideas and theories, and new ideas sort of like a "think tank", but they were directed and even the best people were Soviets (?)</span> <span id="s87">and I found it very frustrating.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">It was no big deal to cancel from your idea they could cancel it all at once in front of a lot of people.</span> <span id="s89">The party people could cancel such projects publicly or privately but just knocked out by someone who could get more out of something else.</span> <span id="s90">I was a person who was very committed to the society but it seems to me that the air was full of black lies, everything.</span> <span id="s91">I could not respect these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">As to my childhood, my mother was a Jew, my father was Russian, and my father's family was Christian so they followed Christian traditions, they celebrate some Russian Christian holidays but that was it.</span> <span id="s93">My mother was brought up - she sometimes didn't even mention I did not have the word, Jewish, on my records, only the records of my father, so this did not affect me as a child.</span> <span id="s94">I know that for some people it was a real problem.</span> <span id="s95">My husband was lucky that it was not a real problem.</span> <span id="s96">Some times I think some people exaggerate to get more sympathy - prosecution, or persecution, something like that.</span> <span id="s97">Russians, here, they have a tendency to exaggerate, 'they were persecuted, they were almost killed, etc.,' sometimes this is not true, sometimes it is not comfortable to be a Jew.</span> <span id="s98">I feel that I am Russian, I'm sorry about that, I felt very comfortable as a Russian.</span> <span id="s99">When I felt uncomfortable with the people who lied and did not appreciate the work of others, I was not troubled, I was disgusted.</span> <span id="s100">It was not from the point of being Jewish, but just as a Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Of course, I often thought of leaving Russia, of going to America, it was always a kind of dream when I was young.</span> <span id="s102">I used to draw pictures of America when I was a child - I even dreamed about it.</span> <span id="s103">Probably from reading different things about it, from magazines, or just from my imagination.</span> <span id="s104">But, for as long as I lived I was interested in America.</span> <span id="s105">You know, it is a shame to feel that you are not free.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">//???</span> <span id="s107">You have to stand in long lines for food and for other stupid things.</span> <span id="s108">A lot of time was just wasted.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">When I was working, I was working eight hours a day and I had my son at home.</span> <span id="s110">My son was alone at home after school.</span> <span id="s111">When he came back, sometimes he would spend time with his friends and more simply he was home.</span> <span id="s112">He was in day care until, well when he was born we lived in student housing and they had a kindergarten for the infants, there were about twenty babies to one nurse, sometimes even more.</span> <span id="s113">There was a second person who sort of assisted the teacher.</span> <span id="s114">They really didn't worry too much about changing every child's diaper and things like that.</span> <span id="s115">I didn't worry too much about this, because I was very busy and studying a lot, and this was just the natural way to do things.</span> <span id="s116">He was fine, he turned out well.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">(What did you get there?</span> <span id="s118">did you get it from your father?</span> <span id="s119">your mother?)</span> <span id="s120">It is a carpet (?)</span> <span id="s121">I got it from everybody, from all Russians.</span> <span id="s122">??</span></p> <p><span id="s123">After my work day or classes, then I would go to the store usually every other day to buy food.</span> <span id="s124">Sometimes I would go to the store at lunchtime to get milk and take it home and then sometimes go to another store before you go back to work.</span> <span id="s125">They are trying to adjust this.</span> <span id="s126">Sometimes there is a little deceit in leaving the office to do this.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Sometimes I would leave work - well we both had an opportunity to go to the cooperative at night after work, that's why I sometimes spend many hours working late.</span> <span id="s128">Then Victor would go and sometimes my mother would get the food.</span> <span id="s129">Sometimes, it was a sort of trick to arrange this shopping between my free time, Victor's free time and my mother's free time, it was tricky to do.</span> <span id="s130">We managed, it was really tough.</span> <span id="s131">Women have much more to do over there, than men.</span> <span id="s132">Here there is no trouble getting food, just too many choices.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">So, my childhood dreams of America were sort of filed away because I was so busy with husband, study and family.</span> <span id="s134">It was not until there was a shift in politics that these dreams again became important to me.</span> <span id="s135">I saw people making progress not because of ability but because they schemed and worked to achieve this in devious ways.</span> <span id="s136">I felt this was very unjust.</span> <span id="s137">But this is the way to make your career now.</span> <span id="s138">I was ready to share my ideas and I like to be surrounded by smart people.</span> <span id="s139">I did very well there, probably I could do a kind of career but I felt I had to sell my soul to sell my programs, which I felt were very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">The ideas for Symposia, I developed at the Architectural Society, then I would invite experts in the specific areas to come and make presentations.</span> <span id="s141">I just organized between different people and I was a coordinator.</span> <span id="s142">I felt that my ideas, my creativity, just all went into one big place and it was a real ideological problem in Russia.</span> <span id="s143">Things could always be cancelled by someone farther up the political chain, no matter how good an idea was, if they disliked it - they did not have to give a reason.</span> <span id="s144">This I found very frustrating.</span> <span id="s145">I felt it was a stupid system.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">I was the one in the house who first said "Let's fly."</span> <span id="s147">, but we had talked often in the house.</span> <span id="s148">But, though my husband was concerned about his parents who would be staying, I convinced him it was time to go.</span> <span id="s149">My parents actually were ready to leave with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">ADDENDUM-MILA A.: (Follow-up interview at the home of Victor and Mila A., Elaine Snyderman, interviewer.)</span> <span id="s151">To discuss our expectations and what we actually met here it is not a simple question, life is very complicated.</span> <span id="s152">I met things here that I could not expect.</span> <span id="s153">Some people call it "cultural shock" or just a new style of life.</span> <span id="s154">I would say we made a great step, a very strong step, and it demands from us to review everything that we had before, that we learned before, that we met before, so we have probably had to revise some of the ideas that we had before about America.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">It doesn't mean that it is worse than we expected, I would say it is even better than we expected in some respects because we were lucky, we found jobs and this is not easy for most people who come here and we are trying to do everything to help ourself in a professional way.</span> <span id="s156">That is what I think is most important.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">(Last time I asked you things, but I did not pick up on all the things to get fuller explanations.</span> <span id="s158">You told us about how the Revolution changed your father's life - How?)</span> <span id="s159">Actually, it was my grandfather's life that was changed, not my father's.</span> <span id="s160">My great-grandfather's family.</span> <span id="s161">They had obtained property in the vicinity of Moscow, a sort of textile factory and they had a little store that just served the surrounding community.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">I think they had very good masters, very good owners, and they gave people work and they paid for this.</span> <span id="s163">They were respectable people.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">But when the chaos happened and the terrible things began everything was changed.</span> <span id="s165">I knew, I heard it from my father, that my great-grandfather was very smart man and he predicted for himself that this terror would be for a very long time.</span> <span id="s166">That is why he did not reject giving everything he had and he did give away everything that he had - his house, his property, his money and his belongings.</span> <span id="s167">It was not a huge amount because he was not a millionaire but they were quite comfortable.</span> <span id="s168">The family was big, they had five children and my grandmother told me that after a the terrible years of the Revolution in Russia people were absolutely hungry.</span> <span id="s169">My grandmother then sold some of her jewelry to buy food for the family.</span> <span id="s170">They were terrible years, just worrying about food for your children.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">So, my father had a very poor childhood.</span> <span id="s172">I was told this by him.</span> <span id="s173">This was my father's mother.</span> <span id="s174">When he was sixteen he left his home and went to World War II, because he knew that in one year they would ask him to go to the army anyway.</span> <span id="s175">So he left his home and he went to Leningrad and he took an apartment after World War II and he spent nine years there after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">They were terrible years, he told me.</span> <span id="s177">Because it was under Stalin and everything was very strictly regimented.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">During his years in the Navy my father had a few very dangerous situations with the authorities because he was close to being arrested.</span> <span id="s179">He was very young, he didn't always cover up his feelings, he was very open.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">He and his friends went to prepare defense, in the vicinity of Moscow, from the West Side of Moscow, where Hitler's Army was approaching.</span> <span id="s181">And they had to prepare defence, lines, trenches, etc., it was very terrible because they were close to being captured by Hitler's army and there was no way to survive, even.</span> <span id="s182">Many orders that were provided at that time were very stupid because they were incompetent people giving the orders.</span> <span id="s183">This is why thousands of people were murdered.</span> <span id="s184">They wouldn't send tanks.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Everything was complex and different orders were crossing, and they sent just boys to do this work, they were not trained.</span> <span id="s186">That is why they tried to avoid the situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Actually, only a couple of days after he and his friend left that terrible place, people who had been working with them were captured and shipped away to prison.</span> <span id="s188">Actually, my father was only fourteen when he was sent on this defense detail.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">My grandmother had to go to the place where they were arrested.</span> <span id="s190">They arrested and threatened them with being murdered if they told anyone about where they had been.</span> <span id="s191">They were told this defense was very secret and very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">(You mentioned something about something very bad that happened in your mother's family, and then your grandmother committed suicide, what was that?)</span> <span id="s193">My grandfather was arrested and probably murdered.</span> <span id="s194">This was in the middle of the 30s.</span> <span id="s195">The first arrests under Stalin began in l932-33 but the big terror began in 1937.</span> <span id="s196">My grandfather was a kind of political person but not on the high level, not a big politician or in the Communist Party.</span> <span id="s197">He was like an activitist and there were a lot of people like that, especially after the Revolution and I really don't know whether he had Communist ideas or not but some of them were just deceived and were just followers of these ideas and they were young and idealistic and tried to follow the ideas of Marx, Lenin, and everybody was going to save the country and make it better.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">This grandfather was sort of work activist and he used to work in some of the main cities in the South of Russia, doing propaganda of some sort.</span> <span id="s199">He was a paid organizer of the Communist Party and I really don't know what happened.</span> <span id="s200">Whether he changed his point of view or what.</span> <span id="s201">It is really a sort of dark spot in our family history and I do not know many of the details.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">My mother would never discuss any of this with us.</span> <span id="s203">She was only a little more than six years old when this happened.</span> <span id="s204">Her mother, my grandmother, was very young, she was in her twenties and her life was such a struggle that she could not put up with it and that is why she committed suicide.</span> <span id="s205">My mother was an only child and she was sent to her uncle's come in Karkov, a Ukrainian city.</span> <span id="s206">It is very difficult living with some one else's family.</span> <span id="s207">She was sent several times from family to family.</span> <span id="s208">She was treated very kindly but still felt an outsider.</span> <span id="s209">She never talked much about this, she is a very discreet person.</span> <span id="s210">She did not tell us much about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">She did receive an education eventually.</span> <span id="s212">She came to Moscow to another uncle who took care of her and she graduated a certain college in Moscow.</span> <span id="s213">In order to have her own life, to be independent, to find a job, she had to leave Moscow after her graduation because it was very difficult to keep living in Moscow.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">They assigned the graduates from Moscow to smaller cities.</span> <span id="s215">The same thing happened with Victor's parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">It is really different to live in a province.</span> <span id="s217">Of course, people would like to stay because of the level of living in Moscow.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">She was doing a kind of artist's job in textiles.</span> <span id="s219">She designed things.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">My father had to leave the army because of injuries and contusions received, so he went to visit his parents and they went on vacation together and that is when he met my mother, and decided to stay with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">My father was very artistic and worked in the textile factory.</span> <span id="s222">Since his childhood he tried, he dreamt about being an artist, a painter.</span> <span id="s223">All my childhood I was provided with pictures.</span> <span id="s224">He made copies of the greatest artists.</span> <span id="s225">He like the Dutch artists, like classical, and he only liked Russian artists who were classical in form.</span> <span id="s226">He was very traditional and classical in his tastes.</span> <span id="s227">It was very tough living with him in my youth because of the difference in our tastes.</span> <span id="s228">Of course, I respected his taste.</span> <span id="s229">He regretted that he could not further his education in this way.</span> <span id="s230">He had no opportunity to get any artistic education as we have done.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">My mother had formal training in textile design.</span> <span id="s232">My father graduated from college also, after a few attempts that failed when a scholarship was impossible for him to attain for an art education.</span> <span id="s233">So he began to work in a mechanical field.</span> <span id="s234">He was very talented and everything that he gets in his hands works well.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">He did some great stuff for that factory where he worked.</span> <span id="s236">People there respected him very much.</span> <span id="s237">He is one of the persons whose name is pronounced with respect.</span> <span id="s238">He was technically very skilled and he was also an inventor.</span> <span id="s239">He invented a few machines that actually helped to work in the factory surroundings, because some of the studies say that in the textile factories there are some chemical and other specific dangers for the workers.</span> <span id="s240">To help people he invented a special ventilation system.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">He tried to invent a machine that would go on the Moon.</span> <span id="s242">He was not mad but just very talented in his inventions and his imagination.</span> <span id="s243">Probably it was his creative outlet.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Perhaps the correct translation of the title for the group we formed would be the Institute for Soviet Architects.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">(What caused you to be disenchanted with your work?)</span> <span id="s246">I think it was just a slow process to get disillusioned.</span> <span id="s247">This is sort of actually what gets everybody who --- (So, you got your permission to leave and then they tried to persuade Victor to stay?)</span> <span id="s248">Well, it just happened like a funny story for us.</span> <span id="s249">Like they say, I was nervous.</span> <span id="s250">So in March we got the permission, and on June 28, they call me.</span> <span id="s251">Pretty fast, we started what we had to do before we made this great step in our life.</span> <span id="s252">We had nothing valuable to sell, to save, nothing we could take with us.</span> <span id="s253">We sold some of our art books and mostly presented them to our friends.</span> <span id="s254">When it came to buying our tickets we did not have enough money.</span> <span id="s255">Our parents helped a little, some little we tried to save, I sold my very good coat.</span> <span id="s256">It was a good Canadian leather and very difficult to get it in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">We collected a lot.</span> <span id="s258">Our furniture was left there but without this and that.</span> <span id="s259">Pretty fast we became ready to go and I found some friends, some connections, to get tickets because there were long lines even at that time, two years ago.</span> <span id="s260">We decided to go in September, eventually.</span> <span id="s261">Some friends saw us off, but not many.</span> <span id="s262">Now it is already two years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">I miss my parents, my best friends, a little spirit - it was very strong in Russia between friends.</span> <span id="s264">In the surrounding you create, even in your life, you know.</span> <span id="s265">This is what I don't have here.</span> <span id="s266">Girlfriends who are architects, it was something special for me our conversations and evenings together.</span> <span id="s267">Of course I miss my youth and my student times but that is just part of going away.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">It is an easy question to answer, about my job and what I am doing here because everything I am doing here - it is just too much, too much good and too much bitterness.</span> <span id="s269">Despite a very good situation in how I found the job and I actually have been there more than a year.</span> <span id="s270">All my American experience provides real difficulty, problems with the language, to accept life.</span> <span id="s271">And it is my own ambitions that seem to cause problems because I have ambitions to be treated like a professional, because I had this treatment in Russia.</span> <span id="s272">To be accepted, to be respected, and I know my capabilities just get wasted here.</span> <span id="s273">I know my skills can be expanded, and this I do step by step, every day, but it is a real struggle.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">When I first came here we decided Victor would apply for architectural job and I would just do charts, etc., because it is much easier, it does not take as much time as architecture.</span> <span id="s275">This is a real elite position here and we don't have time for this.</span> <span id="s276">So I do this job and it is Okay, but it is just my way how I feel, my way how I walk, my way how I talk, and the way I need to be treated and accepted.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">When I started in this office, (Oh my God, that was so bitter!)</span> <span id="s278">I did the most stupid thing in my life that I could ever imagine.</span> <span id="s279">Nobody trusted me.</span> <span id="s280">What was my experience in Russia, what did it actually mean?</span> <span id="s281">Nobody could believe the kind of education I had in Russia, so, without the language it troubled me so much because the first weeks just were close to the death of me from the tension, from trying to understand what people are saying!</span> <span id="s282">Particularly in the English languages, you know, slang, your daily kind of language, it is difficult, it is not at all like public radio, every day.</span> <span id="s283">People talk quickly, they didn't pay attention to whether I knew the language or not.</span> <span id="s284">Some kind people tried to do it nicely but not-kind people took no time.</span> <span id="s285">But this is my problem, I know that, I don't blame them.</span> <span id="s286">I am blaming myself because I thought I could have prepared better.</span> <span id="s287">You know I took German in Russia and that is why I took some private classes before immigration and I did it very fast and very quick, I picked up everything quickly.</span> <span id="s288">So I decided that after a few months experience in my office I would put into this all the time and energy I had, all the money, and I would keep talking to get an education.</span> <span id="s289">I went and took the most expensive and probably the better school in the United States, maybe in Chicago, I don't know, the Berlitz School, a private school of learning languages.</span> <span id="s290">It helped me lot particularly in conversation, and even in really reading also.</span> <span id="s291">It helped me in getting a vocabulary and in understanding what others say.</span> <span id="s292">It depends sometimes on pronunciation.</span> <span id="s293">And right now, the tension is gone and, step by step, I was doing my work the best I can do.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">We are now doing office designs, like banks, hospitals, etc.</span> <span id="s295">Right now we are working on one for Weiss Hospital in Chicago, a renovation.</span> <span id="s296">Space planning.</span> <span id="s297">And the big job that I took part in was the new building for Sears.</span> <span id="s298">They are going to move.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">I am very proud of myself because I tried to do a very good job.</span> <span id="s300">It is very complicated to communicate in a new language without being able to express myself as I could in Russian.</span> <span id="s301">So, I am doing Okay, I am doing Okay, and I always believed in my star and when we came here we met a very nice man, he is an architect, and he is president in the "all for one, one for all" (?)</span> <span id="s302">architectural firm in Chicago.</span> <span id="s303">My previous connection in Moscow, he told us, when we met together with Victor, "Guys, you are beginning a new life in a professional field in Chicago and you will go very slow.</span> <span id="s304">It will be very difficult for you and it will seem impossibly slow at first."</span> <span id="s305">And this is true, because my previous experience helped me so much and I feel comfortable working here.</span> <span id="s306">I do the things that some others cannot do: creatively, it is like Europe and the School of Architects - it is different.</span> <span id="s307">I think we were taught to be more creative than here.</span> <span id="s308">They are very pragmatic, they know some catalogues and the things that they were taught but very often they are not able to handle the pencil, the brush, to do the actual art work.</span> <span id="s309">They are very often just not sharp.</span> <span id="s310">And it is very encouraging to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">(And now, your son is in a completely different environ-ment?)</span> <span id="s312">Yes, we sent him to the Jewish Day School and I am sorry but we are actually disappointed in their level of education.</span> <span id="s313">We thought he would get a more serious education there, more control, more discipline.</span> <span id="s314">Maybe a different school might have it.</span> <span id="s315">I think the Jewish schools are better than any others here.</span> <span id="s316">He is in Seventh Grade and we do not know what our plans will be for him.</span> <span id="s317">Right now we are getting a scholarship for him so that we can afford the Day School and if we change I think he would have to go to a public school and I definitely do not think that would be better.</span> <span id="s318">It is a dilemma, it is a very serious question because he is doing all right there but he is a very uneducated type of person.</span> <span id="s319">He did not have the proper type of schooling in Russia that would help him here, he did not have any early Jewish education.</span> <span id="s320">He tries to adjust in his own way.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">In Russia, they teach probably the same subjects in Seventh Grade as they do here but much differently, much more seriously and in greater depth.</span> <span id="s322">They study Literature but they are able to compose, they are doing composition, here it is a kind of play, they don't try.</span> <span id="s323">They don't even have it to do.</span> <span id="s324">And children, especially in Russia - maybe we talk too much about our way but it is a better school in Moscow; a better Architectural School in Russia.</span> <span id="s325">Maybe we will understand the new approach, but to us it seems that the Russian education is more controlled and disciplined.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Of course we would like to send him to a private high school but it is too expensive.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">He hasn't brought home the school discussions about Jewish culture and kashruth, because he knows that I am so busy that I am so involved with work.</span> <span id="s328">We are not really involved with these observances from our childhood and for us it meant something weird, a different way of living.</span> <span id="s329">We think about this, we think about the spiritual and the customs and the way to a Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Of course, he has asked me not to buy ham and something like this, and I do it.</span> <span id="s331">I do it without any difficulty, it is fine with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">(What do you hope for Larry in the future?)</span> <span id="s333">I like that he was able to get a good education, because I think this is very important.</span> <span id="s334">I think human beings who understand this world, who have more knowledge, extend this world with intelligence.</span> <span id="s335">I think it is very important that we keep him reading and I hope he never knows the problems like we had in Russia, the difficulties, and to bring him up in the expectation of doing good for people; to have good taste in everything, to have good taste in creating his surroundings, creating his life, to like and to be close to his roots.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">To create a new life with good friends.</span> <span id="s337">Because he left very good close friends in Russia.</span> <span id="s338">They were special children, some of them.</span> <span id="s339">One of them was the grandchild of a very famous composer, and they were so smart, so good.</span> <span id="s340">They arranged everything very interestingly in their own life, their children's life.</span> <span id="s341">I think he misses them very much and he tries to keep this to himself, inside himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">I think that maybe we review the tape and what is written and maybe you will have questions, that maybe something is not clear for you and we can talk more.</span> <span id="s343">It is very difficult for me to explain briefly what I felt when I started working, and if it important for this conversation, maybe we should do more of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">I told you this was the last step, why I am here doing this, because in comparison with other Russians I have good position, a good life, a good salary and I have people who are envious of me.</span> <span id="s345">The society of Moscow and what I did.</span> <span id="s346">I have feelings and I am really not completely satisfied with what I have said.</span> <span id="s347">Maybe next time when you will come, maybe I can even write for myself what I want to explain to you because right now I am trying to use and to find those meanings.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">CONCLUDING STATEMENT FROM MILA A.: (We are talking about the possessions that were sold to be able to come on this trip.</span> <span id="s349">Mila, how did you feel about selling all those things?)</span> <span id="s350">I never tried to collect things, and I guess I just felt so much freedom facing the new future in America.</span> <span id="s351">I was prepared for this emotionally, physically and I felt free and it didn't bother me that I didn't have valuable things to bring with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">(Now, you are here and from what I have learned, you have acquired more things here than you had there.</span> <span id="s353">[Yeah, right!]</span> <span id="s354">These things include - what?)</span> <span id="s355">Okay, it is really funny to say that the things that you can see around us right now, we didn't have them in Russia.</span> <span id="s356">I mean, the stereo system, some appliances in my kitchen, but it doesn't mean so much for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Of course, you know we can go and buy stereo systems, new TV and new coat and stuff like this, but the most important thing is the way I feel in myself.</span> <span id="s358">I feel free, I feel interest in my life, in my future.</span> <span id="s359">Even if I meet difficulties, even if I meet them again, I keep the curiosity and interest in life and it helps me.</span> <span id="s360">It helps me because it seems to me that since I am here, I have a new life.</span> <span id="s361">My previous life just happened, it is over, I feel enthusiastic about it.</span> <span id="s362">In spite of many, many difficulties, psychological difficulties, language difficulties and things like that.</span> <span id="s363">I see it as a new beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">(Now, you said that you just saw friends, after two years, who have just come from the Soviet Union, and there was such a big difference between you.</span> <span id="s365">What were the differences?</span> <span id="s366">How do you explain them?</span> <span id="s367">Who changed?)</span> <span id="s368">I changed and this let me have a look, a new look at people and their values and their lives.</span> <span id="s369">The thing is, if people have a problem, like buying shoes, or a piece of meat for their children, they have problems behind - a root problem.</span> <span id="s370">Because, it seems to me, I have a root problem.</span> <span id="s371">Tomorrow I might be fired.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">I work at the Epstein International Engineering and Architectural Company.</span> <span id="s373">I work for the Interior Department and, it seems to me that we are facing the real problem.</span> <span id="s374">The problem is to buy shoes and soap, that gets strange.</span> <span id="s375">And people are involved in this.</span> <span id="s376">It means they like to think (?</span> <span id="s377">the man is ?)</span> <span id="s378">, not stupid, but beyond human imagination, I mean civilization.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">(In other words, let me see if I understand, your friends were saying, "We couldn't get soap or shoes", you are saying "I'm worried about my job."</span> <span id="s380">She doesn't have to worry about her job, she will have a job.</span> <span id="s381">Okay.</span> <span id="s382">So you feel - again, correct me - what she was worried about was little stuff.)</span> <span id="s383">This little stuff is very important for her, but not for me.</span> <span id="s384">That is why our values and some meaning doesn't cross each other.</span> <span id="s385">They are, like, on different surfaces.</span> <span id="s386">For her it is very difficult to understand our problems because we have this stuff, that stuff, you know, in comparison with what they have in Russia.</span> <span id="s387">(This is a Jewish friend?)</span> <span id="s388">She is half-Jewish.</span> <span id="s389">(Is she here on a visit?)</span> <span id="s390">Yes.</span> <span id="s391">(Does she want to come here?)</span> <span id="s392">Maybe, but she hasn't decided yet.</span> <span id="s393">Because, for me, I would say, it was plain in Russia - emigrate or not emigrate.</span> <span id="s394">I felt that, and we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">She came here to look around to see if it was better or not better, and she can see a lot of very strange things are happening, in comparison with Russia.</span> <span id="s396">Things that she knows, like she knows Kiev, she always compares her life with the life of her relatives life here.</span> <span id="s397">She has relatives in Washington.</span> <span id="s398">How they save money - how they spend money - how they live, and she tries to find mistakes, where they are at fault.</span> <span id="s399">She criticizes everything because, she is misunderstanding why they do this, or not that.</span> <span id="s400">Like all Russians, they just trying to force, to push, you know, it is not true; it is not right; you have to do it this way.</span> <span id="s401">It is a particularly Russian attitude.</span> <span id="s402">[The Russian way is the right way, to direct somebody, and to explain to somebody else, that this is good, this is Okay with you.</span> <span id="s403">- Victor] (I would like to go back because there were some questions I didn't ask you before.</span> <span id="s404">Did you ever go to a Jewish wedding, a Jewish funeral, a Jewish circumcision, in the Soviet Union?)</span> <span id="s405">No, never.</span> <span id="s406">I didn't know even one experience like this.</span> <span id="s407">(Have you been to anything like that since you have been here in the United States?)</span> <span id="s408">Our son's circumcision; and we have been one time in our friend's family.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">(What was it like to be at your son's circumcision?)</span> <span id="s410">Ha!</span> <span id="s411">Okay, I think it is absolutely a different point, starting point, for our son.</span> <span id="s412">He wanted to do it by himself, after he came back from summer camp.</span> <span id="s413">He probably wanted to be the same as the other boys.</span> <span id="s414">I think this is the more important part of it.</span> <span id="s415">He asked us and we decided to do it, no problem.</span> <span id="s416">(Were you upset while it was being done?)</span> <span id="s417">No.</span> <span id="s418">Absolutely!</span> <span id="s419">(And a mohel did it?</span> <span id="s420">Where was this done?)</span> <span id="s421">It was done in the hospital but we asked the synagogue to help us, the Free Synagogue on California, so we went through the synagogue thing and prepared for this.</span> <span id="s422">They helped us to make the arrangements.</span> <span id="s423">And they provided everything, the mohel and all, and they paid for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Perhaps we didn't put a great meaning on this.</span> <span id="s425">The case that I saw in our friend's family is different because this is their life, the boy was born and they should do this to be involved in the spirit of something, you know.</span> <span id="s426">(Which came first, that brit or Larry's?)</span> <span id="s427">Our son's came first.</span> <span id="s428">(What were your feelings about the second one?)</span> <span id="s429">I felt a little sorry for this little child and his mother.</span> <span id="s430">Solemn, because many friends and grown up people get together and celebrate this event.</span> <span id="s431">It was something for them and I felt that it meant something.</span> <span id="s432">(Did any of that relate to the feelings you had, or was it strange?)</span> <span id="s433">Not strange, because I am a person who can accept strange things.</span> <span id="s434">I would say it was a new experience, and that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">(I asked your husband this too and it is a very hard question to ask, I have trouble phrasing it.</span> <span id="s436">Now that you are part of this Jewish community, you recognize something from your past, something that you share with these people, whether it is some rituals or some way of looking at life, or something.</span> <span id="s437">What is this identification with the Jewish community that you have?)</span> <span id="s438">It is really a tough question.</span> <span id="s439">I would like to discover it and find out (?)</span> <span id="s440">.</span> <span id="s441">We came into the Jewish community, I don't know, maybe I would have had another experience in another community.</span> <span id="s442">We came here people were very kind to us, including our neighbors and people around us.</span> <span id="s443">They keep trying to help, to give advice, but they did not push.</span> <span id="s444">That is what I like very much.</span> <span id="s445">I don't feel that I am really involved in serious religious procedures and rituals.</span> <span id="s446">Maybe it is too late for this, for me, I don't know.</span> <span id="s447">But, it is really interesting to see that part of the contemporary life that includes even the part of strange community.</span> <span id="s448">Like the Jewish Orthodox, for example, in the contemporary life you can see a lot of people who have a right to be what they want to be and to live like they want to live and nobody cares.</span> <span id="s449">It is phenomenal!</span> <span id="s450">I think it is great, because people have rights to be what they want to be.</span> <span id="s451">It was, I would say, the strongest feeling that I felt about the Jewish community here.</span> <span id="s452">It can exist and I can see it!</span></p> <p><span id="s453">(It was alien for you, but it affected you emotionally?</span> <span id="s454">Maybe you would feel this way if you saw American Indians?)</span> <span id="s455">Exactly right.</span> <span id="s456">It was like a fact of the new style in the contemporary life as different from our old style.</span> <span id="s457">It was the freedom of choice - they want to live like this, so they live this way.</span> <span id="s458">I don't feel that I would follow their examples, probably not.</span> <span id="s459">In fact, we met a few quite young religious Jewish families here.</span> <span id="s460">They invited us for their Friday night, and we spent a few times in their houses and apartments here.</span> <span id="s461">It was fun and - we recognized some of the Jewish foods, we had eaten them in Russia.</span> <span id="s462">Foods like stuffed fish, and it was great!</span> <span id="s463">very tasty, and very delicious.</span> <span id="s464">It was like a tradition that people expected.</span> <span id="s465">It was ground up fish, like gefilte fish.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">In Russia, ethnic food, was like a lot of Asian food, the middle-Asian food.</span> <span id="s467">Not much Jewish ethnic food.</span> <span id="s468">Matzo was very hard to get, but most good synagogues let people buy it.</span> <span id="s469">(How old were you the first time you tasted matzo?)</span> <span id="s470">Maybe fifteen; it was in the family of my uncle.</span> <span id="s471">But it was not something special.</span> <span id="s472">People mentioned it, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">(One of the things I didn't realize was that Larry's natural father was Jewish.)</span> <span id="s474">Hmmm - half-Jewish.</span> <span id="s475">This was not something I considered when I married him, it was just a coincidence.</span> <span id="s476">He was an architect, we were students when we met and married each other, when I entered the architectural school.</span> <span id="s477">(Did it matter to you that Victor was Jewish, or half-Jewish, when you met him?)</span> <span id="s478">For him, I think it was important that I was Jewish or not.</span> <span id="s479">For me, all my life I spent in a circle of Jewish people, Jewish friends in Architectural School.</span> <span id="s480">It was just natural to be among Jews.</span> <span id="s481">Nobody paid attention that it said Russian on my passport.</span> <span id="s482">I would say that Russians always accepted me like a Jew, Jewish always accepted me like a Russian.</span> <span id="s483">Ha!</span></p> <p><span id="s484">(So you lived to both worlds.</span> <span id="s485">Comfortably?)</span> <span id="s486">Comfortably?</span> <span id="s487">You know my point of view about Russia and the regimentation.</span> <span id="s488">It is terrible.</span> <span id="s489">(Do you think that is a Jewish thing?</span> <span id="s490">To be against regimentation?</span> <span id="s491">To be against the idea of government handing down rules about how people should think?)</span> <span id="s492">No, I would say that this applies to all people in Russia.</span> <span id="s493">I don't see that it applies more to Jews.</span> <span id="s494">I think that all the people I knew felt this way.</span> <span id="s495">It is not just a Jewish perception.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">(To wind this up, I wondered if there were any questions that I didn't ask that you would like to talk about, any summary you would like to make at this point?</span> <span id="s497">Anything you feel we should have talked about?)</span> <span id="s498">I think if everything works for you and is clear for you.</span> <span id="s499">If you don't think something is clear, just feel free and call me and we can do this again.</span> <span id="s500">I really enjoyed this.</span> <span id="s501">I'm sorry that we delayed this.</span></p></body></html>
