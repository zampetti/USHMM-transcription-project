id="s11">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">I want you to first describe for me how your everyday life changed when the Germans came into Poland, and, especially when they came to your area.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">You mean 1939?</span> <span id="s14">In 1939, the Germans came into our town.</span> <span id="s15">For a few weeks, it was not bad, was normal.</span> <span id="s16">Then, they began harassing the Jews.</span> <span id="s17">Taking us to all kind of a labor, hard labor, in the area, and things like that.</span> <span id="s18">And then it became every day, life became harder for the Jews.</span> <span id="s19">We're not allowed to do, to do any business.</span> <span id="s20">My parents, my father could not make any business anymore, and I got involved to help out my family.</span> <span id="s21">So I used to go on my bicycle to the villages to buy food, to help out the families.</span> <span id="s22">And then there were a lot, many atrocities that later on used to command the gendarmes, once, twice a week, and killing some people when they found bread in the house, or fresh milk, or similar things like that, they shot them right on the spot.</span> <span id="s23">And they were making raids, capturing mostly intellectuals, at first, and taking them away to the camps.</span> <span id="s24">I remember they took away my Uncle Levin, he was a Hebrew teacher.</span> <span id="s25">Took him away 1940, and never came back.</span> <span id="s26">Then they killed my uncle, they found fresh meat in the house.</span> <span id="s27">They killed my cousin, and they found fresh bread in the house.</span> <span id="s28">And those things were going on, you know, from uh, let's see 1939 to 1942.</span> <span id="s29">And the worst part was, the Loisia (?)</span> <span id="s30">was in 1942 when we heard rumors that the Germans were deporting Jewish communities daily to the death camps.</span> <span id="s31">At that time in the summer of 1942, I was a young man then, and I realized I understood the fate awaiting me, that someday, we are next in line.</span> <span id="s32">So, I made up my mind that I will not go to any of those camps if I cannot, uh, can escape.</span> <span id="s33">And in October of 1942, when we heard rumors that our ghetto will be deported to another ghetto, so I managed to run away the night before.</span> <span id="s34">It's a protection.</span> <span id="s35">I run away, and I run to a uh, friendly, gentle farmer, who had promised me to help me hide.</span> <span id="s36">I was uh, by this farmer two days.</span> <span id="s37">They treated me very nice, couldn't be any better, they treated me like I would be, I lost my ----------- family.</span> <span id="s38">On the second day, I found out that there were some Jews hiding in a forest nearby.</span> <span id="s39">So, I went to the forest, and I met some people like me, same age, older, younger, and after a few days, we saw what was happening, we were on the run all, all the time, they were hunting us, the German, Polish police and the Polish collaborators.</span> <span id="s40">So we, so there's no other way out, not too organized.</span> <span id="s41">One tried to acquire firearms and to fight back.</span> <span id="s42">So, after a week or so of being in the forest, when we heard our woman, Jewish woman, when they went to villages to buy food, they were intercepted from the Polish hoodlums, collaborators, some were killed.</span> <span id="s43">They were robbed, beaten, and called all kind of dirty, antisemitic names.</span> <span id="s44">When we heard this we organized into a defense unit to defend ourselves against those Polish hoodlums.</span> <span id="s45">The only thing what we possessed at that time when we organized was the will and the courage.</span> <span id="s46">We had no firearms.</span> <span id="s47">It was very hard to get firearms at that time.</span> <span id="s48">So we began to look for firearms.</span> <span id="s49">Every day we were prowling by foot in different villages.</span> <span id="s50">Many miles were spent and it was no, no success.</span> <span id="s51">In meantime several weeks after, we were raided from the Germans with the help of the Polish collaborators, and 80% of our population was murdered.</span> <span id="s52">We were about 100 people there in this camp in the forest living in bunkers under very primitive conditions.</span> <span id="s53">There were no water, no lights, no sanitary facilities.</span> <span id="s54">But, we could, uh, survive, this way, in the forest if they would let us.</span> <span id="s55">We were raided, and after the raid, we managed to escape unharmed because when we organized every 2 of us, every day, went to fetch water on the edge of the forest.</span> <span id="s56">There was a guardhouse, one day, there went, two of us went to get water, and they overheard German-speaking voices.</span> <span id="s57">They came running back, woke us up, and we quickly got dressed because we always slipping in the --------, and, uh, we sent from our group a messenger to the campsite where the other people were living--we were separated ourselves to live near the edge of the forest in order to be able to see what's going on, if any undesirables coming into the forest.</span> <span id="s58">In the meantime shooting had erupted.</span> <span id="s59">They came running back with empty pails, they were hitting the pails on the trees, was still dawn, dark in the outside, and they came back, I said , "Follow me."</span> <span id="s60">I knew the area very well.</span> <span id="s61">And we began to run in the opposite direction.</span> <span id="s62">When we came to a crossing where was the road was cutting through the forest, we stopped, slowed down.</span> <span id="s63">We came luckily behind a German machine gun, 3 Germans were mounting a machine gun.</span> <span id="s64">We were behind them, and luckily the noises from the trees and the birds disguised our footsteps, so we managed to go around them, quietly, in uh, on our bellies, crawled over the main road, and we escaped unharmed.</span> <span id="s65">In the evening we came back, made it quietly during the midnight, and the whole campsite was quiet because all of them were dead.</span> <span id="s66">We just found many bodies scattered on the ground.</span> <span id="s67">All bunkers were blown up.</span> <span id="s68">We presumed that many were buried alive.</span> <span id="s69">The only thing what we could do then is to pick up those bodies, and bury them.</span> <span id="s70">After the burial, we said -----------.</span> <span id="s71">We swore that we will revenge for those murderous acts.</span> <span id="s72">Everybody, of us, each one looked around, looked each other’s grimly, uh, very, you know, uh grimly faces.</span> <span id="s73">And we understood that someday, the same fate awaiting us, they're going to catch up with us.</span> <span id="s74">We were, we were unable to get firearms.</span> <span id="s75">So we left the campsite and began to wander around other part of the forest.</span> <span id="s76">After that, we next day we, we uh, found some more survivors who managed to escape--two girls with a few other men.</span> <span id="s77">And we were counting about 20 people that time.</span> <span id="s78">We wandered around the forest and this took us another 3 to 4 weeks.</span> <span id="s79">Struggling through.</span> <span id="s80">There was nowhere to go because (clears throat) we were hunted from all the sides every day.</span> <span id="s81">Finally one day in December of 1942, we managed to acquire firearms.</span> <span id="s82">And after we acquired firearms, we learned first how to use them.</span> <span id="s83">And about 10 days after, we were raided again from the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">I want you to go back and tell me how did you get the firearms.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Oh, all right.</span> <span id="s86">In Dec of 1942, we were standing and warming ourselves around the circle, in in a fire in the forest.</span> <span id="s87">We were baking potatoes, and I don't know from where they get, the, uh one man came, you know, the name Chaim, I knew him from before.</span> <span id="s88">He came, he just was among the, us there.</span> <span id="s89">He came, says hello to me, and he start telling me, you know, he saw the situation we're in the first time I met him.</span> <span id="s90">He was from the neighbor town Mirof.</span> <span id="s91">And he says to me, "You know what?</span> <span id="s92">I was, uh, working as a carpenter in a village so and so, and the man's name is LeMergac, and he told me that he has hidden guns, that he can arm our company."</span> <span id="s93">When he told me that, a chill went through me overhead to the my knees.</span> <span id="s94">Mine ---------.</span> <span id="s95">I said, "Chaim, slowly, tell me again, how this, what, what about, who man ----."</span> <span id="s96">So he explained quietly, he says, "The colony was Michaloska Colona, the man has a new house built on the left side, so many houses in, and uh, that's it."</span> <span id="s97">So I went over to my group, and I says, you know, I told them the story, and we all felt that time, that tonight is the night we're going to get firearms.</span> <span id="s98">We were disappointed many times similar things, but somehow we all had a feeling.</span> <span id="s99">Came at nightfall, we took 2 slates, ------- slate because snow was underground, and we had to travel about 10 kilometers to the village.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">We have to reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Let's back up to how, having Chaim come into the camp, and meeting him for the first, and do the firearms story again.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Which one?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">The firearms story, start with Chaim at camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">How we got the firearms?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Well, you have the parts, you have the part where we travelling on, not yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">No, just start it again.</span> <span id="s108">Just start that little story again.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Okay, good, uh huh, Oh God.</span> <span id="s110">All right.</span> <span id="s111">In Dec of 1942, we were standing in the forest, around warming up in a, around a fire.</span> <span id="s112">We were baking potatoes there, and all of the sudden there is a man, like from heaven came down, a friend of mine, which I didn't see him since 1939.</span> <span id="s113">He was from the neighbor, neighboring town Mirof.</span> <span id="s114">And he saw what's happening, that we are chase around like dogs, without firearms, and, and uh, he says to me, "You know what?</span> <span id="s115">I was working by a farmer, as a carpenter.</span> <span id="s116">In Poland, a carpenter used to work by a farm, by a, in a place 3 or 4 months, you know, making windows, doors, something like that.</span> <span id="s117">And he said a man bragged to him that he has hidden harms, arms from the 39 war that he can arm whole company.</span> <span id="s118">When he told me that, my, the chill, my, a chill went through my head, forehead to my toes.</span> <span id="s119">I said, "Chaim, slowly please, tell me again, exactly what you know, what you're telling me."</span> <span id="s120">He says "Look, the man's name is Le Mergac.</span> <span id="s121">He lives on Mikaloske Cologna," he described to me the house exactly how it looks on each side (clears throat).</span> <span id="s122">After I heard this, and I felt, I had a feeling that tonight we're going to get firearms.</span> <span id="s123">I went over to my friends, and told them the same thing, and somehow we all had a feeling that tonight is the night.</span> <span id="s124">We had previous had many leads like that, but nothing materialized.</span> <span id="s125">So, came nightfall, we went and arranged us to transportation, transportation to sleighs with horses, and we went to this village.</span> <span id="s126">On the way going to the village, I was sitting with my commander on the same sleigh, and talking who is going to go into this farmer, and asking for firearms.</span> <span id="s127">And they picked me, that I should go in.</span> <span id="s128">And there was a name, by, a man by the name Shapsa, he was from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s129">He was a husky guy with a mu, mustache, had a dark complexion, he looked like a Russian.</span> <span id="s130">And they told me that he should go with Shapsa in.</span> <span id="s131">And I didn't know from here to there what I'm going to tell him, I go there.</span> <span id="s132">But on the way travelling, I had no choice, I couldn't say no, I was uh, speaking very fluent Polish, I also had a mustache, and I wore a uh, policeman, Polish policeman's overcoat, and I had also a badge on my lapel, I don't know where I got it from, was in a ski hat, called a ski hat.</span> <span id="s133">I said yes, so we went, came to the village, I found the house.</span> <span id="s134">I was armed with a flashlight and uh, a small caliber pistol with no bullets.</span> <span id="s135">The handle was falling apart off, we had a rubber band to put it on it.</span> <span id="s136">Was an old one.</span> <span id="s137">I knocked on the door.</span> <span id="s138">A man opened the door with his warm underwear, it was December, was cold, and I ask him, "Are you Mr. DeMergac?"</span> <span id="s139">He says, "Yes.</span> <span id="s140">Please come in."</span> <span id="s141">I came in, I had my flashlight illuminated on his face, and uh, when we came in there was one room and in the middle of the room was the bed, and near the bed he has his boots, he has his jacket, and to the right was a kitchen, you know, it's uh, has the uh, you know, built kitchen from the bricks or something like that.</span> <span id="s142">And he sat down, and I told him, "Mr. Lemergac, we are paratroopers from Russia.</span> <span id="s143">We came here to organize the -------------- fighting unit against the Germans.</span> <span id="s144">We heard that you have firearms, and would like you should give us you free, of you free will.</span> <span id="s145">If you don't we have to use force.</span> <span id="s146">I don't know where I got this uh, uh speech from, but somehow this came to my mind.</span> <span id="s147">He didn't say nothing.</span> <span id="s148">He didn't say yes, he didn't say no.</span> <span id="s149">He just pulled up his pants, and he got dressed, put his boots on and his jacket, he says, "Come on."</span> <span id="s150">So we went, walked out with him.</span> <span id="s151">Our men, other men were around the house.</span> <span id="s152">The only firearms at that time we had is make believe we organized ourselves pitchforks.</span> <span id="s153">We broke off all the teeth, one tooth left on, and put a strap on the handle, and over shoulder--from far away it looked like a rifle.</span> <span id="s154">So he walked out with us to the barn.</span> <span id="s155">In the barn, he opened the door.</span> <span id="s156">He put his hand around a bundle of straw, was a bundle of straw standing there.</span> <span id="s157">He picked up a rifle, gave it to me.</span> <span id="s158">Then he walked up the ladder, and they had a thatch, thatch roof, those straw roofs, walked up, put his hand in, picked up a gun, a handgun, with a bottle of ammunition and gave it to me.</span> <span id="s159">And then he said, "He has buried somewhere a gun, what was cold, wintertime, so I made up a ------------, then when I illuminated the, the my flashlight, he would say, "Shto, shto" that's all he could knew, talk in Russian.</span> <span id="s160">So I said, "Listen, if you want to kill you, you have to find this rifle.</span> <span id="s161">I scared him off.</span> <span id="s162">So he made few steps, he took an ax with a shovel, made a few steps to the right, then to the left, he says, "Here it is."</span> <span id="s163">We started digging, we found it.</span> <span id="s164">Then he took us to the next door neighbor.</span> <span id="s165">His neighbor was Peter.</span> <span id="s166">He knocked at the door, and he said the speech for me.</span> <span id="s167">He said, "Peter, here are the paratroopers from Russia.</span> <span id="s168">They came to organize a ----------- over here.</span> <span id="s169">Give him the gun."</span> <span id="s170">So he went also to the barn, picked up the same way, in the, in the thatch roof, picked up a gun and gave it to us.</span> <span id="s171">So to make it short, in the same night, we got from there, 6 firearms.</span> <span id="s172">Few rifles, few pistols, ammunition, everything.</span> <span id="s173">We went back fast to the forest because we couldn't afford to stay too long, we were afraid to travel during the day.</span> <span id="s174">We came, we test them out, we tried them out, we had some people, our men knew how to use those firearms, they were serving the polish army before the war.</span> <span id="s175">And a week after, a week later we went back again to the same village.</span> <span id="s176">We had already addresses to others.</span> <span id="s177">We came into a farmer, a rich farmer, his name was Dunik.</span> <span id="s178">I already had the courage, you know, uh after succeeded once, you know, and I told him the same speech.</span> <span id="s179">And Mr. Dunik says to me, "You know what, if you really, you are what you are, you should know me.</span> <span id="s180">My name is Dunik, and my brother is a communist, he is in Moscow now.</span> <span id="s181">And you're coming to me to get firearms?</span> <span id="s182">All of the sudden, I don't know from where, I had an answer for him, I said, "Look, we're not supposed to know who you are, and you're not supposed to know who we are.</span> <span id="s183">The only thing we know that you have firearms, please give those to us, and especially when you say you are communist, we are fighting the same cause."</span> <span id="s184">So he bought the story, went out, and picked up a new rifle, had a uh many those uh storage places, was a rich man, a new ---------- with ammunition and everything else.</span> <span id="s185">And we got those firearms through this village, all we needed, and then we got more far-, addresses, whoever has guns.</span> <span id="s186">We went back, we were happy as could be.</span> <span id="s187">At that time a gun and a million dollars, a gun was worth more than a million dollars, because you could at least you could defend yourself with something.</span> <span id="s188">We came back, it took us about 2 weeks, we learned very quickly, how to operate, how to fight, you know, and everything else, and then about 10 days later, we were raided again from the Germans, and there were 3 Polish collaborators spearheading the raid.</span> <span id="s189">They were walking first with baskets, and make believe that they are looking for mushrooms or things like that in the forest, and looking for Partisans.</span> <span id="s190">They didn't know that we have firearms.</span> <span id="s191">And the Germans were several hundred yards behind them.</span> <span id="s192">There would be contact with them, then they would go and surround us, or circle us around.</span> <span id="s193">AT that time, we had already our guard, armed, and we captured 2 out of 3, one escaped.</span> <span id="s194">He was running back and he was screaming "Jews!</span> <span id="s195">Jews!"</span> <span id="s196">In the back, the Germans opened fire, so we returned fire, and we captured those 2, tied them up, and we ran out, run away, we sneaked through some ravines there, terrain, we knew the area very well.</span> <span id="s197">We were luckily we took those 2 with us, we escaped.</span> <span id="s198">By the time they organized themselves, the Germans, they didn't know what's happening because they didn't expect that somebody going to shooting at them, them.</span> <span id="s199">And we escaped.</span> <span id="s200">At night we began to interrogate those guys, and we uncovered from them a gold mine of information.</span> <span id="s201">They told us everything what we wanted to know, what there was the truth.</span> <span id="s202">Those guys were recruited by the Germans, and put in place before prior to the deportations, and they were supposed to report to the Germans who is helping a Jew first, and then who is selling off illegal farm products from the Ger, the, the eh, Poles, the Peasants, and then, who's a communist.</span> <span id="s203">They were involved in everything.</span> <span id="s204">So they went undercover, they were walking around every day to the villages, and threatening people that anybody who will help a jew will be killed on the spot with whole family.</span> <span id="s205">They also gave us addresses for others who were working with them together.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">(Sandy says something in background, cannot hear).</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Beep Well, why don't you tell me how as a partisan group, people helped you and didn't help you?</span> <span id="s208">Explain to me how much...</span></p> <p><span id="s209">I would like to finish this part, now that we get into it.</span> <span id="s210">Okay?</span> <span id="s211">So after those 2 revealed to us what they're involved in, and gave us the names, they were very tired at that time, but we didn't, couldn't wait, we went the same night, and captured those others.</span> <span id="s212">In 2 places when we came in, they had passwords to those people, in the villages who worked with them together.</span> <span id="s213">And we said the passwords, they fainted on the spot.</span> <span id="s214">They saw that we know what's going on.</span> <span id="s215">And we captured that time as many as 8.</span> <span id="s216">6 plus those 2.</span> <span id="s217">And we interrogate them, and we found that they all were involved in those raids, and capturing Jews, and killing Jews, and we punished them, accordingly.</span> <span id="s218">And from that day on, the whole, changed, the whole neighborhood had changed, the whole area.</span> <span id="s219">We got a, we sent a message to those uh killers, that they cannot escape without being punished what they were doing.</span> <span id="s220">There was a mixed reaction among the people because the Poles knew exactly who those guys were.</span> <span id="s221">But they were handicapped, they couldn't do nothing.</span> <span id="s222">They were afraid for German reprisals and things like that.</span> <span id="s223">We had no choice.</span> <span id="s224">We had to do what we had to do in order to stay alive.</span> <span id="s225">And then we learned from this here, what's truly happening among the population.</span> <span id="s226">Before, when we, after we escaped, our escape, and we were in the forest, we really couldn't understand what happening.</span> <span id="s227">The people were chasing us away like dogs.</span> <span id="s228">We went to buy food in the villages, they sounded an alarm, with pots and pans, screaming with axes and ------------- pitchforks, whatever they could grab at.</span> <span id="s229">And we were running, then uh, then we understood why these things happening because those people were threatening all the time, from those collaborators, and that's why they were afraid.</span> <span id="s230">After that, they opened up, people started to talk, start to be open more, and helping us.</span> <span id="s231">Now who helped us was, the first who helped us were the Pep-, the Polish Workers Party.</span> <span id="s232">After our successful mission, they got in touch with us and congratulate us, what we did, because we helped them as well.</span> <span id="s233">Because the same guys, the same collaborators, were against them, they were against the whole population.</span> <span id="s234">They were reporting to the police, to the Germans, everything what's there going on, what's going on in the villages.</span> <span id="s235">Like anybody sold some illegal products, farm products, or helped a Jew, whatever, and they start breathing easily.</span> <span id="s236">What we did, whoever we caught, arrest, went in hiding, and they were underground.</span> <span id="s237">So we also disrupted the German spy ring.</span> <span id="s238">The Germans could only know where we are hiding and who's a Jew because they were told from those collaborators.</span> <span id="s239">The Germans would never know, they could never recognize a Jew, except if he would be dressed like a Jew, or act like a Jew.</span> <span id="s240">Otherwise, a Pole could recognize a Jew among thousand gentiles.</span> <span id="s241">And this was the biggest uh problem.</span> <span id="s242">And from that day on, our lives had changed, and everything had changed in the area.</span> <span id="s243">When the Polish eh Worker's Party got in touch with us, they told us that they would like to, we should join their ranks, we should work together.</span> <span id="s244">Uh we tempted for their help, for the offer, and we told them that we are, have other obligations to our own people, which are in hiding.</span> <span id="s245">First we didn't trust them.</span> <span id="s246">We didn't accept to join the ranks.</span> <span id="s247">We told them we want to work together.</span> <span id="s248">We sit down, we start working together with them, and they supplied us with all kinds of information about movements of the Germans and things like that, and they also assigned to us loyal members of their party, who were used for reconnaissance or for messenger service and so on.</span> <span id="s249">And from this, uh, from this day on, we uh, contact other Jewish groups which were organized nearby, like from Makushu, and so on, and we began to work together, and that's how things had developed.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">So, explain to me, this was all Jewish Partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">All Jewish, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">And explain to me what the whole group was like and how big it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">You see, my ----------- group was 12.</span> <span id="s254">Other groups were 30, 40, and then we joined together.</span> <span id="s255">My first group must have been got killed around the beginning of 43.</span> <span id="s256">And the, all those things happened by, because, we did, had no experience, how to operate, how to behave, how to uh, secure ourselves by travelling and things like that.</span> <span id="s257">All happened by mistakes which we learned later on.</span> <span id="s258">And then we joined with other uh, groups with a ------------- group, and there were about over 50, something like that, and then we joined with the Gruler's Group, which, they were POWs from Lublin who had escaped, and in general we later grouped together, not one group, just we worked together because it was impossible to make a huge group in our area to stay together.</span> <span id="s259">We were in contact, we performed all kinds of missions together, uh, plans and things like that, and we were separate, we're not, we're not too far away like 15, 20 miles away from each other.</span> <span id="s260">And we got stronger every day.</span> <span id="s261">We had, con, later on we, we uh, got into fight with the German gendarmes, and uh, 1943 we began already, start making sabotage acts.</span> <span id="s262">Uh, we went uh, to disarm a group of Germans in a estate.</span> <span id="s263">They were staying about 2 dozen Germans, and we went to disarm them.</span> <span id="s264">We did not succeed, but we went there, and we had a shootout with them for several hours, and we had to pull away because we could not get reinforcements they could get.</span> <span id="s265">And this was, I mean uh, we did not sit hiding but we look for action.</span> <span id="s266">And then we had a lot of fights with the fascist groups.</span> <span id="s267">After, later on, what happened when we got our firearms, established our bases, we found we had another enemy.</span> <span id="s268">This was the Polish fascist groups.</span> <span id="s269">They in the beginning were thinking that the Germans and their collaborators will do the job, which they did mostly, they killed about 90% of our population.</span> <span id="s270">But once we got firearms, they had a hard time to, to kill us anymore because, number one, we changed our way of living.</span> <span id="s271">We saw the for-our forest was not big enough to stay in the forest.</span> <span id="s272">We ran out of fighting places.</span> <span id="s273">So we moved in into the villages, and stayed with the farmers, and uh, they couldn't do nothing about it.</span> <span id="s274">First of all, we, uh, while we did that we accomplished 2 things, first of all, this was a, like public relations, good public relations.</span> <span id="s275">We were labeled from the public fascist groups that we a bunch of bandits, robbers, killers, nothing just whatever, is alive.</span> <span id="s276">So when we start to go out to the villages to stay there, we went to the, the biggest enemies like, the fascist groups--came in, stayed there, ate and drank, behaved like gentlemen, and they, they saw, later on they saw, they're not the same Jews or the same people they're labeling as, they're nice guys, and they began to understand.</span> <span id="s277">With the leadership worked very hard to destroy us, so they ambushed us once or twice, we captured some of them, killed some of them, and uh, we got from them the names of the leaders.</span> <span id="s278">We went up to the leaders.</span> <span id="s279">They already were, were notified that we looking for them.</span> <span id="s280">So they understood, we told them, "Look, we know where you live.</span> <span id="s281">If you want to go after us, you want to kill us, we kill you.</span> <span id="s282">As simple as that."</span> <span id="s283">And they had no choice, and stopped making ambushes, they stopped killing Jews because they saw that we are there to take reprisal for it, and the whole thing, one thing with the other, lead to the other, we gain more courage, get stronger, more people came in, firearms we had no problem to get, and we organized ourselves, soph, sophisticated system where we could live.</span> <span id="s284">First of all, we kept tight security.</span> <span id="s285">Every day we were stationed in another place.</span> <span id="s286">20 km.</span> <span id="s287">this way, 20 km.</span> <span id="s288">south, north.</span> <span id="s289">Never stayed longer than one day in one place.</span> <span id="s290">And we came into a farmhouse, we didn't trap nobody, we didn't have to.</span> <span id="s291">Said, "Good evening," We were as gentlemen, "How can we help you?"</span> <span id="s292">Of course, we said we wanted food.</span> <span id="s293">"What can we prepare?"</span> <span id="s294">I said "What do you have?"</span> <span id="s295">I mean we couldn't demand something they didn't have.</span> <span id="s296">And those farmers, they had plenty of food, the potatoes, they have enough, bread, whatever they could do it, made us dinner, we stayed over with there, o-over day, over the day, night and day, and whoever came in there had to stay with us until we left.</span> <span id="s297">This was our policy.</span> <span id="s298">And later on they got accustomed to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">We have to reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Can you just summarize for me the complexity of how it was, the situation without choices for the peasants who were threatened and who, maybe they wanted help, maybe some couldn't help.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Okay (clears throat).</span> <span id="s304">After, uh, our first mission against those collaborators, things had changed.</span> <span id="s305">People were less afraid to talk to us.</span> <span id="s306">There were some who were helping us, risking their lives, keeping our wounded and disabled people in bunkers for the 2 years that we existed.</span> <span id="s307">They risked their lives for not, not paid, get paid for, a penny for it.</span> <span id="s308">And other people who were really against us were not any more open to be against us.</span> <span id="s309">The reason what happened before, why the situations created such was that there was no laws against harassing or killing Jews.</span> <span id="s310">Everything was free.</span> <span id="s311">Those hoodlums collaborators, jumped on the bandwagon, everyone wanted to be in the act.</span> <span id="s312">What happened, -----, they became heroes to their people against unarmed Jewish people.</span> <span id="s313">You understand?</span> <span id="s314">And they were getting rewards for it.</span> <span id="s315">There was no threat.</span> <span id="s316">They were getting rewards, became heroes, and that's why everything was, when we came into being, and they saw that somebody is there to defend Jewish life, became too expensive for them to go on and do those things.</span> <span id="s317">So this was there to pay a price for their own life.</span> <span id="s318">There was no questions asked.</span> <span id="s319">If somebody killed a Jew, he was killed.</span> <span id="s320">No question about it.</span> <span id="s321">And that's why the whole situation changed.</span> <span id="s322">Even those who were at heart antisemitic, which mostly were, they didn't show because it's funny, let's say several weeks prior we got firearms, we used to go to a village, we were chased like dogs.</span> <span id="s323">Show them money, we want to buy food, well, we came into some isolated places, uh, the peasants had colonies, so they sold us food, some of them didn't want to take money.</span> <span id="s324">There were all kind of people.</span> <span id="s325">No question about it.</span> <span id="s326">Without their help, we could not succeed, let me tell you.</span> <span id="s327">So what happened, even we came into the biggest enemy, we knew who the enemy is now.</span> <span id="s328">The only way why we succeeded in doing all those things, and protecting ourselves, is we knew exactly who is what.</span> <span id="s329">Understand?</span> <span id="s330">We did our homework.</span> <span id="s331">So we came into the biggest antisemite.</span> <span id="s332">Said "Good evening."</span> <span id="s333">They took us in and gave us royalty.</span> <span id="s334">Everything we wanted.</span> <span id="s335">They asked us.</span> <span id="s336">And they gave us food, they gave us shelter.</span> <span id="s337">And later on they, what they did, they saw a way how not to give their quarters, or you know, the contribution to the Germans because every farmer had to give some percentage of their farm products to the Germans.</span> <span id="s338">So we gave them receipts.</span> <span id="s339">That we took so and so, and they showed to the Germans they were killing themselves pigs, cows, and selling things on the like, market.</span> <span id="s340">They gained on that.</span> <span id="s341">We really did not eat their food.</span> <span id="s342">We ate the food from the, what belongs to the Germans.</span> <span id="s343">And that's how things got organized that even those fascists got used to it, they didn't want to listen anymore to their leaders because their leaders had mind to kill everyone, Jew, not to stay alive, not to be able to testify, like I have to say testimony today.</span> <span id="s344">They got orders from London, from their uh, or, from their government in exile, because when we caught some of them, they told us the truth, what happened.</span> <span id="s345">So later on they saw they can do nothing.</span> <span id="s346">They tried to liquidate us, but they couldn't.</span> <span id="s347">They wanted to us, to get us in a one place, where they could, they had the means, we had outgunned, we were outgunned and outnumbered.</span> <span id="s348">Every peasant had arms, and they knew how to use it.</span> <span id="s349">And let me tell you a story once in a, in a June, May or June 1943, I went with a friend of mine, we went to a uh, a estate, named Lukov, and this estate there, one of the estates, uh, what do you call, the baron, they call it, we call it Fabia, he was give us, he used to give us money every month for the wounded, to pay, buy medicine things like that.</span> <span id="s350">And we came in, we announced who we are, and my friend of mine who I went, he was a commander from another Jewish group, from uh, Kushov, his name was Izzy, Issa Eisenberg, no, Rosenberg.</span> <span id="s351">And uh, there was a, uh, what do you call it, doorman, you know uh, locka, we called it, he went to announce us to the uh Fabia.</span> <span id="s352">He asked who we are, he came in, he knew him, he said, "Hey, hello," and he clapped him on his hand, "Come on in," he says, "I have a surprise for you."</span> <span id="s353">And we came in, and there about 24 from the AK group.</span> <span id="s354">3 were officers dressed in uniform, Polish uniform.</span> <span id="s355">They were sitting at a nice dining room table, and they invited us, "Oh, hello, how are you boys?</span> <span id="s356">We were looking for you, we want to help you, we heard that you're good fighters, you're doing a good job.</span> <span id="s357">So we had a few drinks with them, they tried to make contacts, make us believe that they're friend of ours, and tried to take us in one time when they could liquidate us, they would do it.</span> <span id="s358">But the way we had a plan worked out to protect ourselves, we never went to the whole group in one place, one time.</span> <span id="s359">We split it up.</span> <span id="s360">And they knew that the group who stayed behind knows where we're going, and will take revenge.</span> <span id="s361">And this was all about.</span> <span id="s362">And they, what's the name, the uh, owner the Fabia gave us money in front of them, 100,000 flotas, that was, we were not afraid of that because we needed the money.</span> <span id="s363">And later on they tried very hard to try to get us in somehow, to make peace.</span> <span id="s364">And we knew a place was called Borof, was south of Lublin, in 1943, where were Jewish groups, ---------- some group, 26 Jewish boys, were in contact with the AK, and they were naive, they trusted them, so they were good, in good conditions with them.</span> <span id="s365">One day, they came throwing grenades to their bunkers and killed them all.</span> <span id="s366">There was even a song that time that the ar, the uh, uh el, the People's Army made a song in Polish about this story.</span> <span id="s367">If he really, the way we operated is luckily that we did not trust nobody--to us they were all enemies, even the French.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">We have to reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Holocaust, -----------------, 60 cycle sync, 2/10/92, CR-4 is up, Sync tape 5 is up, Lloyd Harbor, NY.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">I want you to pick it up again by starting to talk about how the way you were successful was by not trusting anyone.</span> <span id="s372">And then I want you to tell me some of the things that your group accomplished in the big picture.</span> <span id="s373">How much of a difference did your group make?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">What do mean difference?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">What did you accomplish?</span> <span id="s376">---------------- Oh okay.</span> <span id="s377">In Jan 1943, we ran into in a roadblock of gendarmes, a group of gendarmes in Kusluvka, a village Kusluvka.</span> <span id="s378">They were searching peasants, horse and wagon, they were going searching for, I don't know for what.</span> <span id="s379">And we had to make a turn to cross a main road, which was leading ------------------.</span> <span id="s380">And we just came behind about 2-300 yds and we could not turn around.</span> <span id="s381">We saw the Germans, and uh, the road was situated on both sides, they had ditches.</span> <span id="s382">They dug, the ditches were serving as a run of water, -----------.</span> <span id="s383">So we made the driver to go close to the ditches, we slided off first into the ditches, and we were waiting.</span> <span id="s384">And many times towards that, you know, they're making raids, checking, and go away.</span> <span id="s385">In meantime, we're saying, saying, we said to the driver, "Turn around, slowly, we'll see what happens."</span> <span id="s386">While he was trying to turn around, the Germans, 2 Germans start to coming towards us and screaming, "Come here Schwein----," things like that.</span> <span id="s387">So we were laying in the ditches, and one German was, had a, had machine gun in his hand, high up in the air, the other had a rifle, they didn't expect that something like this will happen, but they came close enough to our range, we opened fire, and we shot them both.</span> <span id="s388">One with the machine gun, he just fell and the machine gun flew out his hand, and the other one we shot, and then others from there opened fire again on us.</span> <span id="s389">We returned fire, and they, they shooting about 10-15 minutes, then they quiet down.</span> <span id="s390">They had a, a car, and the other 2 disappeared.</span> <span id="s391">We grabbed the machine gun, with a rifle, and we got 2 pistols, with ammunition, and we turned around and we made it fast to, to our forest, which was about 5 kilometers away, and then they came with reinforcements and we were gone.</span> <span id="s392">The next time was (clears throat) we, around May, 1943, they came into our house, staying overnight like it was normal.</span> <span id="s393">They came around 9 PM.</span> <span id="s394">We had dinner, we had a few drinks too.</span> <span id="s395">And about 8 o clock in the morning, my cousin, Froim Levin, got me up.</span> <span id="s396">We were sleeping in the house, on straw, on the floor, and there was like here, you see, the windows around, there was a driveway come in in from the main road into the around the house.</span> <span id="s397">He say, "Germans are here."</span> <span id="s398">I had to, only had a chance to grab my rifle, and my pistol because it was everything nearby.</span> <span id="s399">And when I got up, and I saw the Germans walking, one window, the other window, I went behind the door, our men were going up the ladder to the attic, and a German came in, he was not prepared.</span> <span id="s400">He had his rifle upside down, I remember he had his uh finger against this here strap, you know, from the rifle.</span> <span id="s401">He was uh, redheaded, sergeant, and he walked in, he said, "Gendobra," in Polish.</span> <span id="s402">"Good Morning."</span> <span id="s403">I was behind the door.</span> <span id="s404">I had the uh, gun with the uh, you know with the barrel.</span> <span id="s405">I pulled up the 3 of them, and I shot them right in the head.</span> <span id="s406">He fell out.</span> <span id="s407">When he fell out the other guy officer had a sub machine gun.</span> <span id="s408">He start shooting.</span> <span id="s409">And one of our men on top, and the other got wounded.</span> <span id="s410">Uh, Shlome Eisenberg.</span> <span id="s411">At this, that moment, we all ran out on a ---------- outside, and one of our men was, the name was uh, Dobresi, Micola we called him, a young fella.</span> <span id="s412">And he came right next to the officer, and the officer grabbed him by the neck, start to choke him.</span> <span id="s413">And my cousin came around with his rifle, point at him, he raised his hands, he said in Polish, "Brother, don't shoot."</span> <span id="s414">So he gave him one bullet, he got him right into the clasp of the belt.</span> <span id="s415">He collapsed like a tree.</span> <span id="s416">The other who I shoot, run out somehow back, back uh, back out, and we couldn't find him, he was somewhere in the weeds to hide himself, this commotion.</span> <span id="s417">We took away, his, their, their what you call, the ammunition they had, they had a car O-Olympia, nobody of us could drive.</span> <span id="s418">We broke it into pieces with axes and we left.</span> <span id="s419">Later on, the Germans came, about an hour later, this was near Scrobof.</span> <span id="s420">Scrobof had a uh, POW camp for Russian Soldiers, and one of our bullets from our rifle hit one of the ----------- accidentally, and got killed there.</span> <span id="s421">So again we moved out fast to the forest because in the area where we were, we were about 5-6 kilometers close to the forest.</span> <span id="s422">They came later on with tanks and so on, but, the neighbors were saying the, that some of our men were speaking Russian.</span> <span id="s423">They didn't do nothing to the villages.</span> <span id="s424">You see, what happened later on, we discouraged them of coming to the villages.</span> <span id="s425">In the beginning there were gendarmes when, oh for food or for anything, went to make searches, and then they saw it's too risky.</span> <span id="s426">So for the people itself, we gained, made, we gained the prestige.</span> <span id="s427">They saw that we are really fighting the war for them.</span> <span id="s428">If they didn't come, they didn't collect their, you know, their quarters from them.</span> <span id="s429">A lot of people didn't want to give.</span> <span id="s430">So later on, near the end of 1943, no Germans there to come to the villages to collect their uh, whatever reason, they had to come with force.</span> <span id="s431">In April, 1943, they made a huge raid in our area.</span> <span id="s432">Well, we were tipped off at that time already.</span> <span id="s433">How we were tipped off?</span> <span id="s434">From the Poles.</span> <span id="s435">They saw that they have to protect us somehow.</span> <span id="s436">They couldn't liquidate us, they had to live with us.</span> <span id="s437">So what happened, if they came ex, unexpected, into a village, we many times had a shootout with them, so some of them, people accidentally got killed, or houses were burned down.</span> <span id="s438">They want to avoid that, so if from Lublin or Lubertof, big cities, Germans came to our area, we were notified.</span> <span id="s439">So if they came a few, we made an ambush on them.</span> <span id="s440">If we know there are more than that, we packed up and went away.</span> <span id="s441">We, we run away to the uh forest, make ----------.</span> <span id="s442">We always were combat-ready.</span> <span id="s443">In seconds we were ready to start a fight.</span> <span id="s444">And that's how, later on in uh, uh excuse me, 19, end of 1943, the Polish Partisans learned from us, they came in, came up in groups into the forest.</span> <span id="s445">In the beginning they were afraid, we showed them the example.</span> <span id="s446">They saw the Jews can do, why can't we do it.</span> <span id="s447">And we were uh, really connected under the umbrella of the Polish People's Army.</span> <span id="s448">In all the time, they gave us moral support, military support, everything what's needed.</span> <span id="s449">And later on, we got through them, firearms which came from Russia, and dropped from the planes.</span> <span id="s450">We got submachine guns, machine guns, ammunition, explosive, everything what we needed.</span> <span id="s451">And that's how we developed, we developed a relationship with them, that they even said to the AK group, or the fascist groups, "If you start doing against the Jewish groups, you, means, you're starting against us."</span> <span id="s452">They threatened them.</span> <span id="s453">And they uh, start to behave, and that's how we managed to stay, and later on in the end, let's say the beginning of 1944, things were different because there, in the area became many Russian Partisan units, and the Polish Partisan units, and we were, we were just walking around for weeks, staying in one village.</span> <span id="s454">And they didn't dare to come to us.</span> <span id="s455">Now, the next battle we had with, we had skirmishes like uh, with gendarmes many times.</span> <span id="s456">In uh May of uh 1944, no was June 1944, 43, we went into to our town Kumunka.</span> <span id="s457">We staying there about an hour.</span> <span id="s458">There were Polish police, there were the Germans, we also had an observation post on top of the school.</span> <span id="s459">No shot was fired.</span> <span id="s460">One shot was fired, we returned fire in the end, and they quiet down.</span> <span id="s461">We burned down the synagogue.</span> <span id="s462">They made, you know, from the synagogue they made an office for themselves, the Germans, and we were walking around in the town, in the middle of the town for almost an hour, and there was one collaborator, we were looking all the time.</span> <span id="s463">He ran into us accidentally.</span> <span id="s464">He was running , he was saying, "Jews!</span> <span id="s465">Jews!</span> <span id="s466">Jews!"</span> <span id="s467">He thought that some of his men are there.</span> <span id="s468">He fell into our hands.</span> <span id="s469">Then we also, we went, went to many times to the neighborhood uh town, town halls, which we consecrated, confiscated you know, the labor dept books, got orders to take away the labor dept books because from that they could know who was what, who was collaborating with the Germans.</span> <span id="s470">Then in 1943, we had Wait.</span> <span id="s471">Have to reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Quiet guys.</span> <span id="s474">You were starting with another thing...</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Yes, in the end of 1943, August, September, we were involved with blowing up trains.</span> <span id="s476">Warsaw, Lublin and Lobowtov, Lukov.</span> <span id="s477">And in Dec of 1943, we were involved in Yami, it was a village where the Germans came, about almost 60 of them, and they were raiding, cleaning the area from Partisans.</span> <span id="s478">It so happened that we had a convention in a village named Buki.</span> <span id="s479">There were Russian Partisans, Polish Partisans, all officers there.</span> <span id="s480">And I happened to be there with some of my group and 2 peasants came in from the village, Yame, in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s481">At that time, we had a good time, we were drinking, eating, talking strategy, and they say that the Germans moved in to treehouses, took up quarters, and it's like they were instigating us to take care of them.</span> <span id="s482">So one many happened to be a Lietenant Korkel, he was Ukrainian, and he came from this village, he was born in this village.</span> <span id="s483">In the afternoon when it got a little dark, he took me and a friend of mine, Severumstan, and another man, and we went to this village to investigate reconnaissance to see where exactly they are.</span> <span id="s484">And we came back at midnight, took about 40 men all good armed with sub machine guns and so on, and we went to do, disarm them, and take them away.</span> <span id="s485">So, it was a, the moon was shining, it was a beautiful night, and we were walking alongside the back of the village.</span> <span id="s486">When we came, in the, about in the middle of the village, we heard a signal, "Haslo," a uh, pass, that we shoot a flare.</span> <span id="s487">Everyone knew exactly in groups where to attack, which, which house.</span> <span id="s488">And uh, the guards, what they had, in the edge of the village, they notice something, they opened fire.</span> <span id="s489">When they opened fire, the flare came up and took us maybe 5, 6 minutes, all the houses were surrounded.</span> <span id="s490">Those guys from the guards, run away, left their machine guns.</span> <span id="s491">They all had the Russian machine guns with the round disks.</span> <span id="s492">We knew the house, we surrounded the houses, and we told them to give up.</span> <span id="s493">Some of them who were guarding the houses, they killed right on the spot.</span> <span id="s494">It took, went, went, went so fast, was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s495">And they jumped out from the windows with their hands up, because we told them we're going to burn them alive.</span> <span id="s496">And one of our men got killed, a bullet in the head right when he walked into the machine gun in the window.</span> <span id="s497">And accidentally one man got killed.</span> <span id="s498">And we did, killed as many, maybe 20 or 30, some of them run away, and the officers we took with us.</span> <span id="s499">You know, in a place like this, when it's time to turn around was too late.</span> <span id="s500">We took the officers with us and we went, walked, went away from this village.</span> <span id="s501">They had maps and they showed us on the maps that they were a day before in another place.</span> <span id="s502">So we went to the place that they were yesterday.</span> <span id="s503">They came into, was a forest, a couple of houses near the forest, took up quarters, and around uh, nine o clock in the morning, we looked through our binoculars, and we saw that the Germans were about a few miles away surrounding the village of Yame.</span> <span id="s504">They came in with force, and uh, no shots were fired.</span> <span id="s505">They picked up all the bodies what we left, and those five, we had five, I think, five officers, took them out from the woods, and with silencers, we killed, because we couldn't wait any longer.</span> <span id="s506">They gave us all the information we needed.</span> <span id="s507">This was a big operation there.</span> <span id="s508">Then the other big operation, then we had skirmishes, like, every week.</span> <span id="s509">We had contacts with Germans here and there.</span> <span id="s510">They were making huge raids, uh, I got to go back in uh, July, 1943, there were 2,000 men involved, Germans, -------, gendarmes, Polish Police, and regular army soldiers.</span> <span id="s511">What we were notified, like tipped off before, we slipped away.</span> <span id="s512">We could not afford to get into battles with them like that because we didn't have the equipment, and uh, then we could not get reinforcements.</span> <span id="s513">We, uh, our main objectives were to make hit and run attacks, to mine roads, bridges, and ambush ------- many times on the road from Warsaw, Lublin, or other places we, we got information, this was my, our main objective.</span> <span id="s514">And then in May of, yeah, in Ap-, in March of 1943, I was involved with a group with a Polish, with the RL Partisans, there was a special group formed, and we gave safe passage to the Polish government, first Polish government who came to Lublin after the area was liberated.</span> <span id="s515">We had to take them over to the East bank of the river, of the Buch River, and from there they took him to Moscow.</span> <span id="s516">And then later in July of 43, 1944, they came back and they became the first Polish govt.</span> <span id="s517">So I was involved in that, and this is a long story how I was ---------.</span> <span id="s518">And in May of 1944, Gen. Rolojemerski, he was the head of the Polish Partisan Support.</span> <span id="s519">He came to pay, pay us a visit in a village named Burki.</span> <span id="s520">Burki was a village near the Pasha Forest.</span> <span id="s521">I was at that meeting.</span> <span id="s522">The meeting lasted 3 days, and he gave us that time instructions.</span> <span id="s523">That we should remain for any cost in the Lublin area.</span> <span id="s524">He told us that the offensive crossing the Buch is coming, and we should do everything possible to stay in the area.</span> <span id="s525">At that time we were nominated some of our men to officer ranks.</span> <span id="s526">There was a Hilgresban was became also lieutenant.</span> <span id="s527">Sam Gruber was assistant to Grehengresban, also lieutenant.</span> <span id="s528">Marian Voretsky was platoon commander and I became platoon commander at that time also, the rank of a lieutenant.</span> <span id="s529">After he left the, the area, they start moving big units of the SS, --------SS, in the area of --------.</span> <span id="s530">And we received orders to move out from the area to go South of Lublin to Yanov Forest.</span> <span id="s531">And my platoon was under the command of uh, Hoolot Batallion, which was the com-under the command of Zempster, Captain Zempster, his original name was Scrinitsky.</span> <span id="s532">And there were a group of Russian partisans, under the name Shapiga, and then Wandervaselevky's group, and the I, People's Army Group.</span> <span id="s533">We all marched up in March, in May, and going to uh, the area of Yanov, where we were about a thousand man force that time.</span> <span id="s534">We had about a hundred, over ahundred horses, a horse and wagon--the horse and wagon were carrying the heavy equipment like sub, big machine guns, ammunition, explosives and so forth.</span> <span id="s535">And we were in two places were interrupted, uh from uh, intercepted from the Germans, they tried to dislodge us and they couldn't.</span> <span id="s536">The last stop we had was May 11 or May 14 I think in a village named Romrof.</span> <span id="s537">And there, when we got into the village was around 4 AM in the morning, and we found no male at that time, no men, very few old men.</span> <span id="s538">And we got suspicious right there at what's happening, but, we had no choice, we had to go through the village to go to Yanov, but during the day we didn't travel, so we took up quarters there, all the horses and the wagons we put near the uh, there was a wooded area, small wooded area right near the village, and some of our, the officers took quarters in the village.</span> <span id="s539">I had my quarter there.</span> <span id="s540">Around 10 AM, I got a message uh, on a horseback, by the name Lonkafefakorum.</span> <span id="s541">He came with a message from Captain Zempster, and I was sleeping on the floor on straw, and I was set up, he came in, he gave me an order that I should take from my platoon, send a, an ambush in a close road just, described where they should take him there because Germans are approaching our area.</span> <span id="s542">While I was sitting reading this uh, message, a small plane, German plane, dived down, he saw the horse, white horse, and put a savo, a machine gun through the roof.</span> <span id="s543">He came about 2, 3 feet away, in the floor, almost, almost got killed, hit there.</span> <span id="s544">We ran out fast for the, to the outside, and he was closing around again, and uh, that's why they were following him all the time because it was a big group.</span> <span id="s545">And uh, I sent out the ambush, they were a group of 6, and then around 10, 11 o clock, we saw the Germans coming closer and closer from all the sides, from Lublin from the South.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Around 10:30 AM, we, there, were about 3 or 4 German planes cruising around the wooded area, make observations, and we decided to pull back all the road blocks back to our positions in the wooded area, we took our positions dug-in, and we prepared ourselves for a battle there, we had nowhere to run.</span> <span id="s548">And they start bombarding, shooting down with the they were guns although they, they always hit the trees like, and from the trees, falling trees, they bombed, light bombs, not heavy bombs, and machine gun fire, some of our people got wounded and killed.</span> <span id="s549">And this lasted about until 11:30.</span> <span id="s550">11:30 from our headquarters were shooting 3 flares.</span> <span id="s551">One blue, one red, one white.</span> <span id="s552">And somehow, they got misled, they disappeared, the airplanes disappeared, and they began to attack us.</span> <span id="s553">We were in good positions.</span> <span id="s554">You only heard you know, music, the machine gun fire was just rolling continuously.</span> <span id="s555">And they began to attack.</span> <span id="s556">We were in good positions and killed many of them.</span> <span id="s557">Over there we killed over 300 Germans.</span> <span id="s558">We suffered about 20, over 20 killed, and there were 30 wounded.</span> <span id="s559">The battle lasted until about 12 PM.</span> <span id="s560">And then they decided to pull back.</span> <span id="s561">They pulled back and quiet down, and the night we found a weak spot, and we pulled out from there.</span> <span id="s562">The next day they came with armor, we were gone.</span> <span id="s563">And that time, from there, we dispersed, we could not, not all of us made it to, to the Yame Forest because we always had orders, something has happened, should go, wherever you can to get away from them.</span> <span id="s564">So, I went with my group back to the area where I come from which I knew the best, and we were travelling during the day, we came to the crossing, the railroad crossing, Lublin/Warsaw.</span> <span id="s565">There was a full train of Germans with tanks passing by.</span> <span id="s566">We jumped off the wagon into the weeds, and then we made it back to our area.</span> <span id="s567">In our area, we took a rest for 2, 3 days, and then went back to our destination, Pasha Forest, and then, I don't know how ------------------.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Let me ask you something else.</span> <span id="s569">What happened to your ghetto?</span> <span id="s570">What happened to the ghetto in your town?</span> <span id="s571">Do you know what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">The ghetto they, the Germans came with the help of the Polish police, they chased all people out from the ghetto, who cannot run fast enough was killed on the spot, and they transported them to the Lobartov.</span> <span id="s573">In Lobartov, they're supposed to make a huge ghetto for all the Jewish in the area, which did never materialize.</span> <span id="s574">They put all those people on trains, and put destination unknown, sent it destination unknown.</span> <span id="s575">That's what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">So you...</span></p> <p><span id="s577">You want to go back to the beginning a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Yeah, what happened to your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Oh.</span> <span id="s580">My family got to, went with this uh, the deportation.</span> <span id="s581">So what happened, when I ran away, I went to a place nearby the main road, a wooded area to find out what will happen to this deportation.</span> <span id="s582">Around 12 Noon, was on Friday, we learned what I just said, where they, the deportation went on.</span> <span id="s583">And matter fact, I was not alone there.</span> <span id="s584">There were many others, who'd run away and did the same thing.</span> <span id="s585">So we sat down in a circle, and when we heard that, what happened to the deportation, and start, they think what to do.</span> <span id="s586">I had my mind made up that I had some place to go, that a farmer promised me to hide.</span> <span id="s587">The name Klaus in a village named Koskufko.</span> <span id="s588">And I had another man with me, he was from Warsaw, a friend of mine, a neighbor.</span> <span id="s589">He wanted to go with me.</span> <span id="s590">When they were sitting and talking about it, and they all decided to go back to Lobartov, well some of them were the Polish ------------------Police.</span> <span id="s591">And they ask me, they said, "You sitting here, don't say nothing.</span> <span id="s592">Where you going?"</span> <span id="s593">I said, "Listen, I know one thing.</span> <span id="s594">If there's going to be a ghetto in Lobartov, I always have time to go in--have a chance to run in.</span> <span id="s595">But to run away, I'm afraid it's going to be too late.</span> <span id="s596">So I decided I have a place where to go, and I'm going to go there where they promised to hide me."</span> <span id="s597">And they start to talk us out of it, and took only 2 minutes, and they changed Yentl's mind, and I was left alone.</span> <span id="s598">So about 3 PM, they all got up to walk to Lobartov.</span> <span id="s599">I was alone.</span> <span id="s600">What I'm going to do?</span> <span id="s601">I got up too.</span> <span id="s602">We start walking, and from far away, I saw the church, the spire of the church, and I said to myself, "What did I promise myself?</span> <span id="s603">I'm not going to go freely.</span> <span id="s604">I said to Yentl, "Yentl, you want to come with me?"</span> <span id="s605">He says, "No."</span> <span id="s606">So I said to, goodbye to all of them, I said, eh, "Be healthy." "</span> <span id="s607">----------------," in Yiddish, and I turned, turned around and I went back.</span> <span id="s608">And I went back to this farmer, he took me in very warmly, and treated me really couldn't be any nicer, and I was staying 2 days there, and then when I learned about the some Jews hiding in a forest, I went to the forest, I couldn't be in hiding to sit alone and just, you know, and I had a good place.</span> <span id="s609">Somebody they told me later on, "You were crazy.</span> <span id="s610">Why couldn't you, didn't want to stay?"</span> <span id="s611">I said, "This is not me.</span> <span id="s612">I want to do something.</span> <span id="s613">To be first on the free fresh air," and I felt if I got, want to get killed, I wanted to ---------- first, to do something about it.</span> <span id="s614">So I went to the forest, and I got used to it, and that's how we organized and did our own things.</span> <span id="s615">But there were about over 20 people which went to Lobartov...because they were, the thought was because the Germans made propaganda in the beginning that they gonna be just resettled to another ghetto, and I didn't trust them.</span> <span id="s616">I believed them what they were saying that they are to kill all the Jews.</span> <span id="s617">And I didn't take it for granted.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Did most Jews take it for granted?</span> <span id="s619">Can you talk about how difficult it was for most Jews to believe the Germans were going to kill everyone?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">You see, most Jews, the majority were, let's say , people, older people, with families.</span> <span id="s621">Take a family man, it was not hard to decide what to do.</span> <span id="s622">Even he had the mind to do something, mostly were religious, they believed in God.</span> <span id="s623">Many times we talked about it, it was very hard for me to say, to argue with them.</span> <span id="s624">They say, "God will help.</span> <span id="s625">We will overcome things."</span> <span id="s626">And I saw what's happening, that maybe were hearing, not news, no newspapers, but rumors from the Poles who were travelling by trains or, you know, were telling us what's happening.</span> <span id="s627">That they're deporting Jewish communities, things like that.</span> <span id="s628">So, it's very hard to say, it was not hard, easy for them to leave the family or run away.</span> <span id="s629">With small children you could do nothing.</span> <span id="s630">My family were religious people, mannered people.</span> <span id="s631">Were, the, I had brothers and sisters were small, my family consisted of 9, my parents, were 3 brothers and 4 sisters.</span> <span id="s632">I'm the only one survivor.</span> <span id="s633">I took on my own that I am not responsible for nobody, just for myself.</span> <span id="s634">Prior to the deportation, I never wore any those, the armbands.</span> <span id="s635">I always travelling, was travelling with a bicycle to the cities.</span> <span id="s636">I once went to Warsaw, 1941, then to Lublin, I was travelling to Lobartov, almost daily, to buy food to help, you know, to do something.</span> <span id="s637">And I risked my life because I saw one think and I knew very well that if I get caught, I'm going to be killed.</span> <span id="s638">I accepted that.</span> <span id="s639">I didn't uh, I wasn't prepared to go through suffering.</span> <span id="s640">But I had the mind all the time, if I get killed like that, I have no choice, but to go to take you on a concentration camp, then, torture you, you know, abuse you, like we heard things, it didn't register to me, and I took all those risks.</span> <span id="s641">What I did, and luckily...I made it.</span> <span id="s642">And after I got into the Partisans, I don't know from where and how, I was just new things came to my mind, I don't know from where, like, uh, you put on a switch, and I knew the answer.</span> <span id="s643">And I was the youngest in my group.</span> <span id="s644">But, you know, I never tried to make somebody else do for me the work.</span> <span id="s645">I volunteered whatever I could do.</span> <span id="s646">I knew the area very well, which was very important at that time.</span> <span id="s647">And then I, somehow, my, I, my whole thinking changed.</span> <span id="s648">I was a different person.</span> <span id="s649">Like overnight I became an orphan, and I knew that I have to protect myself.</span> <span id="s650">Nobody will do anything for me.</span> <span id="s651">And as a matter of fact, the way I became a partisan fighter in our old group, first, nobody did anything for us.</span> <span id="s652">We had to do it ourselves.</span> <span id="s653">That's, like I said, to get the, the uh, uh, firearms really was not hard.</span> <span id="s654">The way we got it was very easy, but you had to know how.</span> <span id="s655">In the beginning to buy, we want to buy for money, was no way we can get it, and we were chased like animals all the time.</span> <span id="s656">And all of the sudden the started to call us, the same people, and we were the same Jews, "Gentlemen, how can we help you?"</span> <span id="s657">And the...</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Okay, we have to reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Okay, do you want to finish that off, that you were talking about.</span> <span id="s661">You were talking about how at one time the peasants chased you away like dogs, and then you came in and they said, "Gentlemen..." Yeah.</span> <span id="s662">So it was like uh, we were chased around, want to buy food or get food, and later on, we came in , and they saying "Gentlemen, how can we help you?"</span> <span id="s663">We didn't threaten anybody.</span> <span id="s664">It's just, the gun, was the power.</span> <span id="s665">We didn't point it at anybody.</span> <span id="s666">Was carrying, you know, normal.</span> <span id="s667">And that's how, I, we, was very hard for us to understand what really happened because, you know uh, the atmosphere, the change of heart, nothing was there, that they really liked us, and want to help us, but the way we organized ourselves, situated ourselves, we know what we're dealing with, and that's how we have to go about it.</span> <span id="s668">We were nice to them, and they were nice to us.</span> <span id="s669">They helped us a lot later on because without their help, we could not exist.</span> <span id="s670">And matter of fact, after the area was liberated, I was working in Lobartov, which was nearby in the same area.</span> <span id="s671">They used to come, and you know, every week they had a market, they used to bring us presents, food, all kinds of things, we'd get a, we developed with some of them, a very good relationship.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Did you, in all these years, did you see the trains that were on their way to the concentration camps, and did you know what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">To a certain extent.</span> <span id="s674">We did not know everything, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Well, describe what you thought, what you...</span></p> <p><span id="s676">We're seeing, we didn't see it, you know, uh, we only heard through rumors because we were the last towns, the last ghettos to be deported in 1942.</span> <span id="s677">We heard from others the way they were deporting them and the Poles were saying they were deporting them to the death camps.</span> <span id="s678">Like Treblinka, Midonis, Sobibór, and things like that.</span> <span id="s679">But, we exactly didn't know the truth, or didn't see those things.</span> <span id="s680">I never, myself, imagined that something like this could happen.</span> <span id="s681">So you didn't, none of you knew that it was happening.</span> <span id="s682">No, there were some of them who escaped from Sobibór, there were 2 men escaped, who escaped came to our Partisans.</span> <span id="s683">One was Leo Lerner.</span> <span id="s684">He lives in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s685">And there's another one, I forgot his name, can't recall it, there were 2 escaped from Sobibór, and they told us what's really happened there.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Do you feel that the Germans that you saw operating had, were just following orders or did they act on their own?</span> <span id="s687">How did you feel about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">It's hard to really to say, of course, they can say they're following orders, but it depends how they want to follow the orders too.</span> <span id="s689">They just were killing Jews in random, they were brutally murdered them.</span> <span id="s690">Follow the orders, let's say they could arrest people, and take them away to a camp, or they shoot them just on the spot, so I don't think that it just was following</span></p> <p><span id="s691">orders.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Do you feel that the Jews had a lot of choices?</span> <span id="s693">How do you feel that people made choices in those years?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">You see, it's very hard to say about choices.</span> <span id="s695">If I'm going to compare to myself, there were many others who had choices, they could do just the same thing as I did.</span> <span id="s696">I'm not talking about families.</span> <span id="s697">Families was very hard.</span> <span id="s698">Young boys, young people, if they would just take, and think about, the way I was thinking, I said, "I'm going to die, anyway.</span> <span id="s699">So why just die like that, like a coward, or be drag me, and torture me, abuse me, then put me to death."</span> <span id="s700">So I was thinking one way.</span> <span id="s701">I didn't expect that I'm going to survive, and I didn't know what I'm getting into it.</span> <span id="s702">Had no specific plan.</span> <span id="s703">But I made up my mind, when I can run away, I will run away, and look for another way, and I found the other way, when I saw the opportunity with the men there, and we organized, I was to a certain extent, a big, big instigator, you know, certain things, but my mission, my way was, "Let's take revenge if we can."</span> <span id="s704">Because we had also now, met people, some of them were a little passive, I would say.</span> <span id="s705">Like, when we heard that some Jews were killed, and at that time there was no secret, because they didn't hide, the Poles didn't hide that they were killing Jews because they were proud of it.</span> <span id="s706">So, I said, there were some other young guys there, "Let's go and do it today because tomorrow may be, could be too late.</span> <span id="s707">Others were saying, "You know what, they didn't bother us.</span> <span id="s708">Why should we go after them?"</span> <span id="s709">I said, "Look, we are Jews.</span> <span id="s710">They didn't kill the people because they did something to them, they killed them because they're Jews.</span> <span id="s711">Tomorrow they know where we are, they're going to come after us.</span> <span id="s712">And this paid off later on.</span> <span id="s713">And there was another thing, you see, when we were looking for some killers, we came into a house, looking for son or father, whatever, we did not touch any innocent people.</span> <span id="s714">If he wasn't home, we said, "Okay, we come back," so we went.</span> <span id="s715">You understand?</span> <span id="s716">And this was a great thing people respected later on because they saw we had only those who were involved of killing Jews.</span> <span id="s717">And they stopped to a certain extent.</span> <span id="s718">You understand?</span> <span id="s719">Now, for the others, I would say the same group who were with me after the deportation ran away.</span> <span id="s720">They went to Lobartov, if they would think the same way, I wouldn't say all of them would survive, but some of them would survive.</span> <span id="s721">This way, they all went, and this was the end of it.</span> <span id="s722">So it's very hard for me to say because everyone, the same man, which I was saying, Yentl, he was from Warsaw, he was a refugee in our town, he ran away before, and he was living around the neighbors there, and he saw that I was driving around with a bicycle without a, a, you know, a armband, and I knew farmers, they used to come, he approached me, he said, "Look, what do you do when the --------, if you're going to hear about the deportation?"</span> <span id="s723">I said, "Listen, the only thing I can tell you I'm going to do, I'm not going to go freely to a deportation, I'm going to run away.</span> <span id="s724">He said, "I want to go with you."</span> <span id="s725">He made, he begs me.</span> <span id="s726">And then, he backed out.</span> <span id="s727">What happened to him, I don't know.</span> <span id="s728">So it's very hard to say, see, the problem was, what I think today, there was no organization.</span> <span id="s729">If there would be an organization to organize people, say, "Look, you're going to be killed regardless, so why don't you take a chance?"</span> <span id="s730">When I went into, when we got firearms, and I became a Partisan fighter, I was not afraid for anything.</span> <span id="s731">It didn't come into my mind to hide.</span> <span id="s732">Bullets were flying through my head right and left.</span> <span id="s733">I was lucky, I wasn't hit.</span> <span id="s734">But, you know, it never...came, came to my mind, they go, they hide, because hiding wasn't good, always the safest place.</span> <span id="s735">Let me tell you what happened.</span> <span id="s736">In 1943 we were like went into a farmer and had dinner, so we, we developed a relationship already, so he said to me, "You know, here, here this guy is by my neighbor, hiding," Leibish, was.</span> <span id="s737">This Leibish was a man, a Jew, who was almost 6 foot high, and he was serving the Polish army in the Cavalry.</span> <span id="s738">He had to be tall.</span> <span id="s739">I said, "Bring him over here."</span> <span id="s740">He went to brought him over here, sit down, we ate, we had Schnapps, we had vodka, were drinking, very good, no problem with food, he looked at us, and saw what's happening, and I told him what we do, and that we live like normal people, like normal soldiers, the way it is.</span> <span id="s741">I said, "Come with us."</span> <span id="s742">He says, "Oh no, you're going to get killed."</span> <span id="s743">I said, "Listen, the same way you're going to get killed too.</span> <span id="s744">There's no guarantee here."</span> <span id="s745">He didn't want to come with us.</span> <span id="s746">And a week later we heard he was burned alive.</span> <span id="s747">He was sleeping in a haystack, you know, the farmers had haystacks on the fields, for the winter, you know, so, Germans came, somebody tipped them off because he probably had money.</span> <span id="s748">The money ran out, so they, somebody, one of the men who helped him, could, tipped off the Germans, they came, they put the things on fire, and he burned alive and that's it.</span> <span id="s749">So, it wasn't uh, not, I'm still alive.</span> <span id="s750">And others with me.</span> <span id="s751">And he was afraid to go with me, so, it's very hard to figure out.</span> <span id="s752">See, once you're in it, it's different.</span> <span id="s753">We changed completely.</span> <span id="s754">Before, if let's say, if somebody would give us a lesson, of what we're getting into it, maybe some of us would think, oh, how is it possible, it's really what I'm telling you here, if you would be a military man, you would say, "It's impossible," what I'm saying, but it was possible.</span> <span id="s755">Because we created, we learned from experience.</span> <span id="s756">Common sense.</span> <span id="s757">Instinct.</span> <span id="s758">How to stay alive.</span> <span id="s759">And everything worked out fine, to a point.</span> <span id="s760">Of course, many of us got killed, no question about it.</span> <span id="s761">Oh, but they got killed for a reason.</span> <span id="s762">They were not killed, be tortured, you know, for nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Do you have anything that you particularly want to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">What do you want me, I can add a lot of things, but you know, I suppose it depends, what do you want to know more about, you know?</span> <span id="s765">You want to know about after the liberation or things like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Or no?</span> <span id="s768">Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">The liberation is important.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Now, we were involved in many fights with the Germans, with the Polish police, and with the collaborators all the time, so, you see, uh, I mean, uh, it's very hard to describe everything in detail because it will take a lot, long time, you know, but in general, the population later on helped us a lot, no question about it, because, they, without that, we could not survive.</span> <span id="s771">Because they saw the reality.</span> <span id="s772">Because before, they were, you know, the propaganda was so hard, you know, the Germans and those right wing groups, that we are really has to be extinct because not worthy of living or things like that, and they saw themselves, here we came with arms, we didn't harm nobody.</span> <span id="s773">What we ate, we drank, and we slept over, and we said goodbye in a nice way, and then some of them later on were begging, "Why don't you come often to us?"</span> <span id="s774">This is the truth.</span> <span id="s775">And whatever we did, you see, the uh, --------- People's Army, they had to have, be responsible for us too, you understand, and they were not afraid to stand up whatever we did, you understand, there is nothing there that we did which was inhumane.</span> <span id="s776">We tried to protect us, and people in hiding, we had many people who were hiding in the forest, and many who, the people, the Polish people helped us to help, to keep them there with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">We just ran out.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">The end of that was ----, about the last minute of that was --------, the film ran out.</span> <span id="s779">All the, all the ones that were</span></p> <p><span id="s780">beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">hiding in the forest, they didn't go with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">All right.</span> <span id="s783">We're rolling again, so why don't you talk a little bit about, if you want, either, the not harming anybody or the helping people hiding in the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Okay.</span> <span id="s785">Now, what I would like to add is this.</span> <span id="s786">In the beginning that retreated, we lay there, when we got the power, and we acquired firearms, we were justified to go out and mostly kill anyone because the way they, we thought, that everybody's against us.</span> <span id="s787">When we caught those 2 collaborators, and we, they revealed to us why people were behaving the way they did, we couldn't see to harm anyone.</span> <span id="s788">Even we went to a village where they sounded an alarm and chased us with picks and shovels, and we, way down, we went into the same house, armed, said, "Good evening," and they says right away, "How can we help you?"</span> <span id="s789">We had dinner and then we asked him, "Why did you do those things before?"</span> <span id="s790">He says, "You must understand.</span> <span id="s791">Our lives were threatened because those guys were running around every day and threatening us if we gonna help Jews, we're going to be killed or from the Germans or from them.</span> <span id="s792">Now, the way we helped the uh, our people, some of them were in the forest, were healthy, and we helped them with food and so on, they helped themselves too, and our protection, the other groups didn't bother them, for one thing.</span> <span id="s793">And then we had those, we had wounded, and we had those who were disabled, woman or some children, so we found placed in the villages, people who willingly made bunkers, in their barns, and kept them all the time.</span> <span id="s794">We'd just provide them with food.</span> <span id="s795">So the food, sometimes, we brought is mostly from the estates, we had big estates in our area.</span> <span id="s796">So we went there, and took whatever we needed, and some of them, we gave it to some uh, peasants who could not affort, and then we used to pass by and use the food and so on.</span> <span id="s797">And so in general, we created the atmosphere that was suitable for partisan operations.</span> <span id="s798">People understood more what's going on.</span> <span id="s799">And they saw themselves because every day for 2 years almost, we had to live in some of the places, we used a lot of places up, so this alone gave people an education.</span> <span id="s800">Because many were saying that our party has teaching us to uh, do everything possible to reveal you and things like that.</span> <span id="s801">They didn't listen because they felt that their lives are in danger, or the neighbors or some of their families, and they try, tried hard to avoid to report to the Germans.</span> <span id="s802">So, that's how we managed to, to operate in a nice way and uh really it was like a cat and mouse for the Germans.</span> <span id="s803">Many times somebody revealed, they came, we were gone.</span> <span id="s804">And many times they were disappointed.</span> <span id="s805">They felt that they didn't get the right information because overnight we made sure when we went into a place, nobody is following us, nobody sees us.</span> <span id="s806">And the next day, we're gone.</span> <span id="s807">If somebody, let's say from the family member, said to somebody, and the somebody was reporting to police, they came, we are gone.</span> <span id="s808">So, they couldn't do nothing to the people because they claimed we came with in force.</span> <span id="s809">We came with guns, they had no choice.</span> <span id="s810">They could not say no.</span> <span id="s811">Even we didn't threaten them, but they were saying, what they had to say, that we came with force, and what can they do?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Can you talk to me a little bit about what you think happened to most of the Jewish men who were, and women who were, say from 35 and older.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">You see, what happened to them, I cannot say, those would say who went to the concentration camps or so far, those who were in the area, first of all, in our area, in Brachnik Forest, when I, when we first organized, the most of them got killed in the first raid.</span> <span id="s814">And uh, in the other forest, in the Parshif area, there were many who survived.</span> <span id="s815">Together when the Ger, Russian army joined up with our troops on July 23, 1944, and they were also liberated in the forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Some other partisans that I've talked to who were Jews who were in route of non Jews were threatened by the non Jews and had to conceal their Jewish identity.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Okay, yeah, let's we talk about it.</span> <span id="s818">You see, there were many partisans, Jewish partisans, in Poland and elsewhere.</span> <span id="s819">There were many Polish partisans and Russian Partisans, and they were groups like we were.</span> <span id="s820">Independent Jewish groups.</span> <span id="s821">The Polish, the Jewish who would find themselves Polish Partisans, they were many times abused or so on, they didn't feel comfortable.</span> <span id="s822">The ones who were in the AK, in the Fascist groups, they weren't a few, who didn't look like Jews, they were hiding their identity.</span> <span id="s823">The others in the Russian partisans, they were not discriminated.</span> <span id="s824">We, as an independent Jewish Partisan fighting unit, and, under the umbrella of the Polish partisans, we didn't feel any discrimination against us.</span> <span id="s825">They were treating us very well, all the time, they, we were treated with respect and honor and so on.</span> <span id="s826">There was one antisemite, you know, was Ukrainian, he showed his uh, the way he was uh feeling bad, but, it didn't mean anything to them, they were just being...So in general speaking, I mean uh, that's the way the set-up was.</span> <span id="s827">We did not want to be together, infiltrated with them together because we had our obligations, and we felt what we're going to do, we're going to get credit for, and otherwise we would be sweeping floors or shining shoes with them.</span> <span id="s828">We showed them that we could fight as good or sometimes as better than they are.</span> <span id="s829">And the reason was that we had nowhere to go.</span> <span id="s830">Our direction was to fight.</span> <span id="s831">Or to kill or be killed.</span> <span id="s832">They had homes intact, they had families, they had somewhere to go back to.</span> <span id="s833">We did not have that.</span> <span id="s834">So our, we could not even surrender.</span> <span id="s835">You see, the beginning what we thought why they trusting us, they were trusting us, the people's army, people, you know, the Polocks, Polish Partisans, better than their own because they knew that we cannot surrender, because surrender meant dead by torture.</span> <span id="s836">We had nowhere to go, just that one direction, fight.</span> <span id="s837">Fight.</span> <span id="s838">Everybody who was in our path, our enemy, we didn't care, we had to defend ourselves.</span> <span id="s839">And that's the way we remained, they let us because not in all the areas, some areas SE of the uh Buch River, they didn't let uh, Jewish, uh Partisans to be independent.</span> <span id="s840">They tried right away to disperse them, you know around among them.</span> <span id="s841">So we tried hard and we showed them that we can do our job.</span> <span id="s842">When they gave us missions, we fulfilled, and we remained like this.</span> <span id="s843">And they later on, you know, through the ranks, they tried to uh, reward us for it because they saw during the times what we did, and everything else.</span> <span id="s844">We got, you know, nominated some of us to officer ranks, and we were uh, happy altogether now.</span> <span id="s845">After the liberation, all of us, the Jewish Partisans, the Polish Partisans were integrated into Polish govt.</span> <span id="s846">Everyone received a job according to his ability, so we were treated very fairly, I couldn't say that we had any discrimination whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Okay, thank you.</span> <span id="s848">That's all my questions.</span> <span id="s849">So we have to just sit here for 30 seconds.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">30 seconds of room tone from previous interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">End of room tone.</span> <span id="s852">End of Sound Roll.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">USHMM Archives
