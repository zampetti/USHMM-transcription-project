1988</span></p> <p><span id="s3">Bradenton, Florida Wednesday, the 27th of January, 1988.</span> <span id="s4">I am Harry Rosenberg, the interviewer for the National Council of Jewish Women, Education and Social Action Service.</span> <span id="s5">I am at the home of Leah Mayer and Mrs. Mayer will tell us of her experiences during World War II in Yugoslavia.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Q: Mrs. Mayer, you just feel at ease and tell us, perhaps, how your earlier youth was spent, about your life, your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">A: Well they, um--I was born in a small town near Zagreb, but we lived in Zagreb.</span> <span id="s8">And there was a --I don’t really didn’t know how many Jews…</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Q: Speak slow if you can, not too fast please.</span> <span id="s10">Okay, we’re ready.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: Um, it was an outside Jewish community--Zagreb.</span> <span id="s12">Most of the Jewish were, ah, Austrian or Hungarian, origin because Yugoslavia was part of the Austria-Hungarian Empire until the First World War.</span> <span id="s13">And, the Jews were all, ah, integrated into the life--like they got considered as Yugoslavs, not Jews.</span> <span id="s14">There was just their religion and being Yugoslavia consist of many, many religions, especially Zagreb, the city where I lived.</span> <span id="s15">And even in the high school where I went--in my class we had Greek Orthodox and Protestants and Moslems and, uh, Unitarian and Jewish--I think about five religions mixed in one class.</span> <span id="s16">And there was no difference.</span> <span id="s17">Absolutely, we never felt anything to be ostracized because of religion.</span> <span id="s18">We, ah, had even--religion was part of the education--public schools.</span> <span id="s19">We had once or twice a week religion.</span> <span id="s20">Each one of the class would go part because they respected--religious teachers were coming and from several classes they would put together the same religion.</span> <span id="s21">I think twice a week we had religion.</span> <span id="s22">And, ah, I never felt any anti-Semitism from my classmates or friends or anywhere that--we did not feel that.</span> <span id="s23">My father was a merchant.</span> <span id="s24">My father was in textile business and he had two stores together with a, with a cousin of his--they were partners--retail silks.</span> <span id="s25">And he was traveling twice a year to France to bring silks.</span> <span id="s26">We had an excellent education at home.</span> <span id="s27">I had private French, ah, ah, classes--conversational.</span> <span id="s28">I had a governess, ah, from Germany--Austrian German language up till fourteen years of age.</span> <span id="s29">And in the school we, in--and the high school we also--we had German and French, and later Latin.</span> <span id="s30">So, we had a real good education.</span> <span id="s31">There was nothing, ah, what we would feel if some different from anybody else.</span> <span id="s32">We celebrated our holidays.</span> <span id="s33">We were not.</span> <span id="s34">We were not obliged to go to school on our Jewish New Year or anything—holidays.</span> <span id="s35">And that was--oh, Yugoslavia at that time was a Kingdom…a Kingdom, and um, every big Jewish holiday--New Year, Rosh Hashanah--and representative of the King would assist in the services of the synagogue because all those big cities had very big synagogues--like Zagreb—was a very beautiful synagogue, Zagreb, Sarajevo.</span> <span id="s36">And, I know that the representative of the King was always present on those big holidays.</span> <span id="s37">They respected the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s38">There were never any, anything.</span> <span id="s39">The chief Rabbi, ah, was received by the King.</span> <span id="s40">So we enjoyed a very good relationship among all the, ah, religions until the, um.</span> <span id="s41">politics of the pre-war--pre-war--not second--how do you say that…</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Prior to World War II.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Prior to World War II--when, um, Hitler’s Germany tried to pressure Yugoslavia into signing a treaty with them.</span> <span id="s44">And, um, the Nationalist Croatian, the Separatists, started to plot against the Kingdom, against the Serbian--and the whole thing started to boil little by little.</span> <span id="s45">And, um, those Croatian Separatists were known anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s46">But the, ah, heads in exile and that’s--Antipovlish (?)</span> <span id="s47">.</span> <span id="s48">And he’s the same that, ah, Tookovich (?)</span> <span id="s49">who just died now in jail in Belgrade-in Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s50">He and some other big shots were in Italy, exiled, and they were also responsible for killing the King Alexander in 1936 in France and we had a Regent since then.</span> <span id="s51">That was the King’s pavel because the, the young king was minor.</span> <span id="s52">And then was a coup d’etat and the king took over, Peter.</span> <span id="s53">That was in 1942, just before the Germans invaded Yugoslavia because they, the, the government, the, the king didn’t want to sign a pact with Germany.</span> <span id="s54">And in the meantime the Jews--we were feeling so secure--we just couldn’t believe that a--nothing could happen to us.</span> <span id="s55">And we couldn’t believe that Hitler would be able to conquer Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s56">I had an uncle who was an officer in the Yugoslav Army and he said the army is so well equipped that they, the Germans would never be able to, to conquer, ah, Yugoslavia--and eight days later they were right in the middle of Zagreb.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Could I ask you just…how old were you then?</span> <span id="s58">Did you graduate school, high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: I was, um, what we called it “matura” in our language.</span> <span id="s60">It doesn’t exist here.</span> <span id="s61">It was some kind of…it was the eighth year of (words missing in original transcript)--of the high school, and you couldn’t go to university if you didn’t have that, ah, graduation.</span> <span id="s62">And, um, the times were so bad I wanted to go to study to France and I couldn’t because the times were already very bad.</span> <span id="s63">So, I remained and my father, ah, asked me to get--to learn some, ah, office work--like typing and, ah, German stenography, and to help him in his office.</span> <span id="s64">And so, ah, because I couldn’t--it, it was already very difficult, um, to go to any foreign country--dangerous.</span> <span id="s65">So, um, when the, ah--in nineteen--in April, 1941, the Germans came into Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s66">And right away those, ah, exiles Separatists, ah, Ustersha (?)</span> <span id="s67">were back already--and they right away collaborated with the German invaders--with the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s68">They set up offices against Jews.</span> <span id="s69">They took over the Jewish community--they got a list of all the Jews who resided in the city.</span> <span id="s70">They--right away--they were so preoccupied with getting all--a hold of all the, ah, material goods about the Jews, per se.</span> <span id="s71">And they decreed that the Jews have to wear, um, the Star of David on a yellow ground with, a--that Juito (?)</span> <span id="s72">--it means Jew in Yugoslavian, in Croatian.</span> <span id="s73">And, um, every Jewish family had to give so much money, ah, like--it was really not ransom, it was like a tribute.</span> <span id="s74">It helped to give them--I don’t even know to whom it went--but I knew the Jewish community was in charge to collect all that.</span> <span id="s75">And, um, then they--everywhere certain restriction of times when you were not allowed--the Jewish were not allowed to be in the street.</span> <span id="s76">They had to wear the signs, but they were not allowed to be after seven in the evening or before nine in the morning, or ten.</span> <span id="s77">They were not allowed to go to the markets, ah, ah, prior to a certain time.</span> <span id="s78">They were not allowed to go to public places like theaters or movies or, um, or, um, entertainment--cafes and…All the Jewish stores immediately got commissars…a…how do you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: You mean commissars?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Ah, how you say, um, yeah…</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Someone took them over--ran them for the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Yes, there were, ah…if there was nobody amongst the employees who was in that Nazi Party or, or part of that Separatist movement, then they would send somebody who they deemed…</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Able to run them.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Who, will run that, ah, that place.</span> <span id="s85">And the Jewish owner had, had to go out and they had nothing to do--they couldn’t do anything more with the store.</span> <span id="s86">It was just like--just taken away from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: And they, of course, didn’t pay you anything for those businesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: Oh, of course not!</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: They just took them away from you.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: They just took them away.</span> <span id="s91">They--first they said--under the pretext that they should have a. um, like a commissar who takes it.</span> <span id="s92">But then they, the owner was absolutely not allowed to do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Now could I ask you just one question before you go on, please, and that is: prior, did the Jews see any danger of Hitler coming?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: I don’t know--but we didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: They felt that they were at home there?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: We were so…we felt we were part of everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: We never, we never felt ostracized.</span> <span id="s99">We never felt anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: That is true of many Jews in Europe who didn’t leave, just because of that.</span> <span id="s101">Well, please continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Then, um, they started to round up prominent people in the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s103">The presidents of the B’nai Brith and, ah, ah, acted very--lawyers, doctors.</span> <span id="s104">No, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s105">Not doctors.</span> <span id="s106">No, no.</span> <span id="s107">They needed the doctors.</span> <span id="s108">And no--they--there were mostly lawyers and big industrialists.</span> <span id="s109">They imprisoned them.</span> <span id="s110">They made like a--like some kind of camp in a, in some kind of old (words missing in original transcript) somewhere outside Zagreb.</span> <span id="s111">And, um, then they didn’t know at first what they’re going to do with them.</span> <span id="s112">In the meantime--we didn’t--we didn’t--nobody knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s113">They said they, ah, interrogations, or a--or, or some kind of work…Then they started to round up young men, um, those who finished high school or were in, in university.</span> <span id="s114">Ah, most of my contemporaries, and my brother’s contemporaries, were killed because they rounded them up.</span> <span id="s115">They said first they need them for some kind of work, whatever.</span> <span id="s116">We believed all kinds of stupid things.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: Forced labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: We just forced labor.</span> <span id="s119">And they even made a list what they have to take with them.</span> <span id="s120">A, a backpack and then, and vitamins, and, ah, and, and then so many and, two or three shirts and this and that, you know.</span> <span id="s121">They just were making believe things--in the meantime they were just all killed.</span> <span id="s122">Of this, my class, practically, they all were killed.</span> <span id="s123">Those boys who were, who went to the ((words missing in original transcript)</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: Were they taken to concentration camps, or killed in Yugoslavia?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: You--there was not even concentration camps.</span> <span id="s126">They took them somewhere into the south of Zagreb, in the mountains between Dalmatia and Zagreb--into some mountains.</span> <span id="s127">They just dumped them from the, from the mountains.</span> <span id="s128">The Belepe (?)</span> <span id="s129">called it--the mountains.</span> <span id="s130">They just killed them right there.</span> <span id="s131">We, we only found that out later.</span> <span id="s132">We didn’t--they just disappeared and nobody knew what happened to them.</span> <span id="s133">Then--that was before the organized concentration camps.</span> <span id="s134">Well, then, then they had already, a few months later, organized the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s135">Then they started to round up everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Can I just go back one step when you said that they arrested, or the industrialists and the prominent people--that was the move to confiscate their wealth, was it not?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: That was the reason?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: That was the reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: They forced them to give up all their wealth?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: To the Nazis.</span> <span id="s143">I see.</span> <span id="s144">Well you go back to your time…</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Um, in the meantime they, um,--Yugoslav, Yugoslav, Yugoslavs started to--who were not anti-Semite, and who were not for the Separatists--they started to organize--like Partisans.</span> <span id="s146">.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Resistance.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: …in the mountains.</span> <span id="s149">(words missing in original transcript) movement.</span> <span id="s150">Partisan movement.</span> <span id="s151">So, then those who were not, those Jewish people who are not rounded up yet and who were able-bodied, wanted to join the Partisans--run away into the mountains because somehow a connection--also, some women went.</span> <span id="s152">Little by little people started to disappear.</span> <span id="s153">You didn’t know if they, ah, went into the mountains or if they were caught by the Jews.</span> <span id="s154">And if they, ah, went…</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: The Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: The Gestapo.</span> <span id="s157">They really--what happened first was it’s a small towns where they were much easier to get up all those Jews together--like in the town called (words missing in original transcript) I was born where my grandparents resided and were born because my grandparents were--my grandmother was second-generation already born in that little town and my father’s mother and my, my mother’s parents have been since two or three generations already--from those towns.</span> <span id="s158">So, they rounded up all the young people and they brought them into the city of Zagreb and they put them in a--like a fairground place--and nobody knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s159">People didn’t know that we…they already had a concentration camp prepared for women and for men, separate.</span> <span id="s160">They even had two.</span> <span id="s161">So then they started to ship them and, ah, select them.</span> <span id="s162">And they sent the women to one and men to one.</span> <span id="s163">And then they sent some to an island where salt mines were, where they, where many people died there because they didn’t give them to eat anything.</span> <span id="s164">And, um, I really know two survivors from that who were, who run away when they--after those which still survived in those salt mines--they moved them--they wanted to send them to those other concentration camps which were built in the meantime.</span> <span id="s165">And when they transported them by train, they run away from some station where the train stopped.</span> <span id="s166">Two ladies who were later with me (in Clerund (?)</span> <span id="s167">.</span> <span id="s168">and, um, from all those small towns they right away picked Jews and send them to Zagreb, which was--I talk about Croatia now…</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: To Zagreb, and then from there they put them into all different concentration camps--men and women.</span> <span id="s171">They had already one north of Zagreb, one east of Zagreb for men and one for women.</span> <span id="s172">And, then slowly, little by little, they cleaned them all out.</span> <span id="s173">There was nobody remained alive from that concern…from those women’s concentration camps.</span> <span id="s174">Nobody remained alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Ahhh.</span> <span id="s176">But did they…</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: As far as I know, I lost a lot of my family.</span> <span id="s178">My grandparent mother and, and, and, my grandmother, my mother’s sister, and, ah, cousins and, ah, friends and…</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: These people that were—that you lost, this was done in Yugoslavia or were they shipped to the…</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: No, that, that was…</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: …infamous concentration…</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: They did not ship.</span> <span id="s183">They…</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: …or right in Yugoslavia?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: …took care of them right in Yugoslavia.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: They were so cruel, those young--those were mostly just youngsters, those, um, Croatians--kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: The Germans really…</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: The Germans didn’t even have to, move a finger.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s191">Well, that’s what I wanted you to bring up.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Those were not the Germans.</span> <span id="s193">They were just the Croatian, ah, the Separatists at Usterstar (?)</span> <span id="s194">.</span> <span id="s195">The collaborators.</span> <span id="s196">Well, we were not the only one--the Jews affected--they, they was after the Serbians also, because there were plenty of Serbians living in Croatia.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: What religious…</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: Greek Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Greek Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: But it, it wasn’t really their religion, it was the Serbians’, because the Croatians--it was not the Germans--it was the Croatians went against the Serbians because they said that during the Kingdom of Yugoslavia they, the Serbians, were always those who were getting the best out of the whole country--that all the tributes, all the, um,…</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Taxes?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: …taxes and everything wound up in Belgrade, and um, that, ah, the government was formed mostly of Serbian politicians that, um, they were subject to persecution because they have been just Croatian Separatists were exiled--they, they head to Italy.</span> <span id="s203">And, um, now they had their revenge.</span> <span id="s204">So the Serbians had to work--red bands over the arm, like the Jews had to wear those, ah, those patches, the yellow one.</span> <span id="s205">They said the Jews have to wear yellow because they were, um, gold bearing.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Well, the gold diggers.</span> <span id="s207">Or were they interested in money, or gold?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Greedy for gold, and the Serbians were blood…</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Bloodthirsty?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Bloodthirsty.</span> <span id="s211">So the Serbians…</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: Had to wear the red band.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Had to wear red bands.</span> <span id="s214">That in Croatia, while the Germans occupied Serbia and Bosnia with the Moslems.</span> <span id="s215">The Moslems were more--99.99 for the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Moslems.</span> <span id="s217">Oh, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: And the Serbs were all against the Germans.</span> <span id="s219">They found maybe one or who would collaborate with them.</span> <span id="s220">But the Germans they did in Serbia what the Croatians did in Croatia against the Jews--because the Serb--they couldn’t find any Serb who would kill a Jew in Serbia.</span> <span id="s221">And in Bosnia the, the Moslems themselves would also--they were really part of Croatia.</span> <span id="s222">They were all against--were a lot of them against the Jews, or 99% against the Jews.</span> <span id="s223">But in--Serbia—the, the Germans were not really persecuting the Serbians as Serbians.</span> <span id="s224">They, the most of the Serbians then organized into two different guerrilla.</span> <span id="s225">One were the Czechnics (?)</span> <span id="s226">which were fighting the Croatians.</span> <span id="s227">And one with the partisans, which were fighting the Germans.</span> <span id="s228">Now, of course, they raid villages and whatever that they did--the Germans against those who were against them and Jews and took them away.</span> <span id="s229">But no Serbian collaborated inasmuch as I know.</span> <span id="s230">That the Germans did themselves--while in Croatia they didn’t even have construction parties.</span> <span id="s231">The Croatians were doing it all by themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: That was the difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: Well, that’s an age-old, age-old battles of the Balkans between Croatians and the…</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s236">Now the Germans tried to help some prominent Serbian in Croatia.</span> <span id="s237">I had a very dear friend who was Serbian and her father was arrested by the Ostershuss (?)</span> <span id="s238">.</span> <span id="s239">Then she went to a--ah, to the German bishop who, through his intervention, got her father out of jail and he was hiding and then he went…I helped her in the--he got a, a special permit that he can leave Zagreb on the train for Belgrade and the Ostershuss couldn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s240">And they moved to Belgrade.</span> <span id="s241">But those which is--the German couldn’t help too many of the Serbs.</span> <span id="s242">A lot of Serbs are—that, that put by those, um, Croatians into cattle cars and just simply into sealed trains, thrown into the Sava river and drowned.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: So they did their own killing.</span> <span id="s244">At that time…</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: And the Jews were sent to the concentration camps and they were all exterminated right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: In the concentration camps created by the Croatians?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: In Croatia.</span> <span id="s248">In Croatia they were all exterminated right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: So you’re saying that the Serbians were really favorable to the Jews but were powerless against the Croatians?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: They were…</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Now what happened to that young king?</span> <span id="s252">He wasn’t quite of age then.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: He run away.</span> <span id="s254">He wound up in, in United States and he lived sometime in Chicago and he died there many years ago.</span> <span id="s255">And they say he was an alcoholic.</span> <span id="s256">So…</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: They didn’t--couldn’t help themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: They couldn’t help.</span> <span id="s259">They couldn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s260">They had to run away themselves.</span> <span id="s261">So…</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: What was your situation during that period?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: So, I--my own situation was that my father was born in that little town next to Zagreb and went to school there with, with, with--the schools were mixed--all religions, as I told you before--and one of his comrades become one of the Separatists.</span> <span id="s264">And he became the chief of the Jewish Police in Zagreb.</span> <span id="s265">Now, there are those which say my friends who were Jews are good Jews.</span> <span id="s266">For the others, I don’t care.</span> <span id="s267">So, he took--the people who--to those--the family of those who went, who went to school--that was my father and some other people from that town went to school with him--he gave papers that they can go away.</span> <span id="s268">Like, they called it like a, a Lasapasada (?)</span> <span id="s269">in Italian.</span> <span id="s270">It means “let them go.”</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Exit.</span> <span id="s272">Visa.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: Ex…well, exit—but we didn’t get entries to nowhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: That’s what I wanted to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: We just could get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: That’s right.</span> <span id="s277">But not in.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: But nowhere in.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: I see what you mean.</span> <span id="s280">That’s real interesting.</span> <span id="s281">Why don’t you complete…</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: You know.</span> <span id="s283">So, at least we got papers that we knew that will help us if nobody would touch us.</span> <span id="s284">My father got, ah, out from that--about I told you like that fairground--when they came from the town, the people, it was his brother-in-law and his nephews and his own brother and, ah, some other people from the town--he got them all out of there.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: So now they all got out.</span> <span id="s287">So then my--we, for instance, also my brother and I, we were hiding.</span> <span id="s288">We never opened the door for anybody when they were ringing because those Ostershuss were going--they had lists of the Jews who were living in all the districts.</span> <span id="s289">And every district they had ah, those young kids--those Ostershuss had like an office and they, they would go to all those Jewish homes and, um, take away whatever---carpets or things--but they wouldn’t take them themselves.</span> <span id="s290">For instance, they came once to my father’s--to our store, our apartment--they said--I want tomorrow, we want this carpet and this, and this, and this, and this, and indicated things--into that headquarters there and there.</span> <span id="s291">My father never bothered to send anything.</span> <span id="s292">We never sent anything there.</span> <span id="s293">And no, and then we never opened the door anymore.</span> <span id="s294">We had, but you could see, we were walking with--without shoes in the, in the house and we, we were very careful and we had a Serbian janitor.</span> <span id="s295">They were very nice people.</span> <span id="s296">They later, I understand, they were taken away and nobody knows what happened to them.</span> <span id="s297">And, um, when they started to round up young people, like my age, my brother’s age, then I went away.</span> <span id="s298">I went--I had an uncle in a village.</span> <span id="s299">He was the only Jew in, Jew in that village.</span> <span id="s300">And they had a, like a tavern, a restaurant, he and his wife.</span> <span id="s301">And they were very friendly with the priest and with all the village people.</span> <span id="s302">And I stayed for about a week until the whole, ah, roundup finished.</span> <span id="s303">And then I came back.</span> <span id="s304">And I traveled without the Jewish sign, without anything, you know, the…and, um, then we were told that we can go to part of Yugoslavia which is annexed by Italy because when the Germans invaded they traveled from the north.</span> <span id="s305">The Italians invaded from the south and right away annexed some town in Dalmatia, and, um, along the Adriatic Sea, they annexed.</span> <span id="s306">They made it like Italy.</span> <span id="s307">They had their own, ah, like--it could have been Italy.</span> <span id="s308">Then they occupied military--well, a lot of other towns.</span> <span id="s309">But the civil--the civilian government was Croatian, but the military command--commander has--what he had to say was….</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: Law.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: Was law.</span> <span id="s312">So we were told that we can get into those annexed territory.</span> <span id="s313">It—and from there into Italy itself, eventually.</span> <span id="s314">But you needed people who would smuggle you into there because, see, you couldn’t get from them the permit to go in, but we had at least from the Croatians that we can leave.</span> <span id="s315">My mother--my father still remained because he had a--his father was still alive, who was an old man and, um, (words missing in original transcript) little town and he was always going to visit them and he figured that he can, in the last moment, always get away.</span> <span id="s316">So, my mother and my brother and an aunt of mine, and I, we left with one of the smugglers.</span> <span id="s317">I don’t know how, it was some kind of a grapevine where you got, eh, somebody--or somebody in--you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: I understand.</span> <span id="s319">You paid for it too, I presume?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: So we got to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s321">We had to work in silence because there was this young Ostershuss.</span> <span id="s322">You were allowed to have a, a little suitcase--something like those Cubans when they were leaving Cuba, you know.</span> <span id="s323">Then when we got there, then they looked into everything and we only--that cost maybe ten dinars or something, to have a (words missing in original transcript) that time because it was not even the dinar anymore.</span> <span id="s324">They changed.</span> <span id="s325">They had their own, eh…</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Currency?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: Currency--those Croatians then.</span> <span id="s328">And then, um, we were allowed to go on the train.</span> <span id="s329">But we had to get at the border out.</span> <span id="s330">And that woman who was taking us, she was with us, without--you--we made like we don’t know who she is.</span> <span id="s331">But we followed her and we got into the train, which was going towards (words missing in original transcript), south--and before we got there--because out.</span> <span id="s332">And there were again this Ostershuss.</span> <span id="s333">Again they looked us all up and--but those in Zagreb still didn’t take away, they still took away.</span> <span id="s334">By the time the--we, we finished with it practically--they had maybe one change of clothes or something for us.</span> <span id="s335">And they looked even in the shoes if that—they couldn’t have, um, any money with us, or anything.</span> <span id="s336">I really don’t know how or--I think that woman had some money, our money or something.</span> <span id="s337">Then we had to walk.</span> <span id="s338">We had to walk over the border what was Croatia into that part which was annexed territory of Italy.</span> <span id="s339">We had to walk up and down and down and up.</span> <span id="s340">And we got…</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: How old were you at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">As: Mmm—about twenty.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: And my brother was a year and a half younger.</span> <span id="s345">And then we wound up in Soucha (?)</span> <span id="s346">Then when we got to Souchok there were already a lot of our people there and, eh, there was a café where everybody was--and then you went right to the cristoura (?)</span> <span id="s347">and you got this permit for eight days and, eh, food stamps from the Italians.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: So, in other words, the Italians helped the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: The Italians helped a lots of Jews.</span> <span id="s350">But they gave you only for eight days, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: I see,</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: After eight days you were supposed to get appeal from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: Well after eight days we went underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: You know.</span> <span id="s357">So, um, we couldn’t--yeah, my brother--for my brother and, two cousins of mine--somehow they arranged--they went to Ljubljana, which was Slovenia, but that was also next by Ita--Italy.</span> <span id="s358">And somehow, from Ljubljana--it was not like from Souchok.</span> <span id="s359">Ljubljana--all the Jews were taken into Italy automatically, into a con-confino libero (?)</span> <span id="s360">.</span> <span id="s361">If they had money, they were taken to little towns.</span> <span id="s362">My brothers went--wound up with my cousins in Italy, and my uncle into some (words missing in original transcript) little town.</span> <span id="s363">Dianova (?)</span> <span id="s364">.</span> <span id="s365">And, um, but in Souchok, somehow it was impossible to get into it--I mean, until you really had a lot of money.</span> <span id="s366">It’s a--there was a bridge between the, the Croatian part of--and the old Italian, which was always Italy, which was Fiume and Souchok.</span> <span id="s367">And that bridge was like something--you just couldn’t get over that bridge.</span> <span id="s368">It was like a fortress.</span> <span id="s369">You just couldn’t get over it.</span> <span id="s370">It was very, very difficult.</span> <span id="s371">I know very few people who, who, who got over it.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: But did lots of money--could buy you…?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: It--it was a lot of money, a, a lot of fre--friends, or connection, or those who have tickets to take a boat from there for, eh, Spain or for, eh, America, or for Canada.</span> <span id="s374">I had some part of family and friends who went that way.</span> <span id="s375">So we went underground.</span> <span id="s376">And then one day, whatever happened, they started to round up people and they arrested me.</span> <span id="s377">I have my maiden name of Heutchler (?)</span> <span id="s378">and I had a cousin who was in the Partisan, Eric Heutchler (?)</span> <span id="s379">.</span> <span id="s380">and he was working somewhere around there and they had a warrant for him.</span> <span id="s381">And when they saw my name, they put me to jail right away and interrogated me--I know anything.</span> <span id="s382">I said--didn’t--I didn’t even know at the time any relative--any relation to that Heutchler (?)</span> <span id="s383">- -that he was my third cousin, and we went to school together.</span> <span id="s384">But I said I never--I don’t know who he was, or where he was, whatever.</span> <span id="s385">And then they repatriated me back.</span> <span id="s386">And I was with my aunt, with my mother’s sister, because they took both of--but I stayed with her, in her apar--room what we rented.</span> <span id="s387">My mother was in a different place.</span> <span id="s388">We, we all separated.</span> <span id="s389">So, ah, my aunt and I, we had to spend one night in the jail.</span> <span id="s390">The next day They put us in the (words missing in original transcript) They put us--they took us over to what was occupied--military occupied zone by the Italian--which was not annexed.</span> <span id="s391">So after a few days, my mother realized that we are not going to come back so she went alone to--she went herself to the Italians--then said she wants to be sent there too.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: After us.</span> <span id="s394">When my father was still up in Zagreb and after his father passed away, who was an old man--who maybe died from a heart attack-and, uh, he came down on that famous paper, eh, from his friend--and he got to, to (words missing in original transcript) which was really Croatia, but was occ--military, uh, Italian occupied--and he remained there.</span> <span id="s395">So, we stayed there very happily.</span> <span id="s396">We were--we could live--we could live privately.</span> <span id="s397">We had nothing to do with the Croatians and the Italians, eh, were protecting us.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Well, what did you live on?</span> <span id="s399">What did you have…how could you survive without funds?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Well we had money.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: We had money and--so we, we lived there.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Did this woman that smuggled you out give you the money?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: Oh, that--yes--I don’t know who.</span> <span id="s405">I don’t, I don’t know that my fa ther arranged that, my mother arranged it--I didn’t know how it was.</span> <span id="s406">It’s it’s--this I don’t know.</span> <span id="s407">This--we were at that time, you know, when you were twenty years old, you were really like a child--if your parents arranged everything for you--that is--that’s how we were at, at that time.</span> <span id="s408">And that was in--over--we left in August ’41.</span> <span id="s409">In, ah, Sept--in September, in September we were--I was already in that place called ((words missing in original transcript) which was Croatia military occupied.</span> <span id="s410">And my mother and my aunt, my brother was already in Ljubljana and already in Italy from--Ljubljana.</span> <span id="s411">And the other part of the family was to save themselves .</span> <span id="s412">And, um, my father came down already at the end of that year.</span> <span id="s413">In ’41--he was already with us, and remained.</span> <span id="s414">And then there were no Jews left anymore.</span> <span id="s415">My mother’s mother-- and my mother’s sister was the secretary of the Jewish community in Zagreb.</span> <span id="s416">And she was the one who always said that they organized everything--you know--the (words missing in original transcript) they were so stupid, everybody say that they didn’t, didn’t believe that something could--they really, they really thought that just resettle them, or they send them--who knows where or what.</span> <span id="s417">And my aunt had immunity and her mother, which was my grandmother.</span> <span id="s418">But when the last Jew left they took them too.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: Yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: And they were both killed.</span> <span id="s421">Right in Croatia.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Oh, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: …and, um, so then there were no--practically no Jews.</span> <span id="s424">And there--not practical--there were no Jews, uh, no Jews in--living as, as--in Zagreb.</span> <span id="s425">There was nobody anymore.</span> <span id="s426">And, um, so my father didn’t go back anymore.</span> <span id="s427">And from that little town where his father still lived, where he would go and visit him always--they took also everybody away.</span> <span id="s428">First, all the old Jews were together under one roof in my grandfather’s apartment.</span> <span id="s429">And then they, they took them away--they killed them all.</span> <span id="s430">And drove which were taken--the, the man from the town-the Jews that were taken to--that man, that very, very miserable concentration camp, (words missing in original transcript) which--where everybody was killed.</span> <span id="s431">And the women were taken to another one.</span> <span id="s432">They were also killed.</span> <span id="s433">They were all killed still in, in Yugoslavia--in Croatia.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: And this killing was done by the Croatians?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: By the Croatians.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Germans only in…</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: The Germans were not even near there.</span> <span id="s438">They, they didn’t need it.</span> <span id="s439">They didn’t need them.</span> <span id="s440">They did all themselves.</span> <span id="s441">There were from some towns, from Serbia and from some other towns near Serbia, they would take them to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: Poland.</span> <span id="s444">I mean to Auschwitz, to Poland--to those concentration camps--and killed there.</span> <span id="s445">Now, um…</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: In ’41, of course, the war was still being won by the Germans, so to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s448">That was already ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: The Italians, in ’42, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: In ’42 we were still in Italy.</span> <span id="s451">In, in that, uh, town--that little town.</span> <span id="s452">And, um, the Italian--no, the Croatian just couldn’t do any…we had nothing to do with the Croatians and nobody could do anything.</span> <span id="s453">But then, one morning, just like out of the blue skies, a carabiniere came.</span> <span id="s454">That was in, ah…</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: The police, carabiniere…</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: In November ’42--and we were, we were a year already there.</span> <span id="s457">In November ’42 there came the carabiniere with big trucks and stsrted to gather all the Jews and take them to another town nearby where there was like a concentration camp, was a Partisan (words missing in original transcript) They had the Partisans.</span> <span id="s458">They had like barracks with like--military barracks</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: And we were so terrified, we didn’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s461">And in that villa where we lived--that woman was renting several rooms--we had one room and a kitchen.</span> <span id="s462">And there was a--another small, uh, little apartment--and there were the--an Italian high officer and his wife and a little boy and we were friendly with him.</span> <span id="s463">So I run over to his office, which was the (words missing in original transcript) headquarters, was Italian, and asked him what happened--what--that they are rounding up the Jews.</span> <span id="s464">So, he didn’t know.</span> <span id="s465">So he called and he left and drive, and finally he said to me--you don’t have to worry--and--the Germans want you to be ex--extradited to Germany- -take us to, what--whatever.</span> <span id="s466">We didn’t know it yet about Polan- -Poland—that it’s a concentration camp, and that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s467">The Germans have sent word that they want us extradited.</span> <span id="s468">The Croatians have been asking if we should be sent away.</span> <span id="s469">And they wanted to save us, so they are sending us to this, ah, their own (words missing in original transcript), their barracks where they evacuated overnight all the Partisans which they have --I don’t know where they took them to annihilate them somewhere.</span> <span id="s470">Because every fighting it- -eh, the Partisans--the Partisans were fighting the Italian as allies of the Germans, you see, and (words missing in original transcript).</span> <span id="s471">So they had a lot of Italians there.</span> <span id="s472">So they put us --they said we are going to be 100% under their jurisdiction and nobody can do anything against us.</span> <span id="s473">We’re going to be behind barbed wire.</span> <span id="s474">But they are going to do everything for us to have to make our life complicated and, and secure, and we should be, be --we don’t have to worry --we can take all our belongings with us, whatever we possess, whatever we have.</span> <span id="s475">We didn’t have, eh, but some clothes and some money, but…</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: These are the Italians doing that?</span> <span id="s477">They are…they helped.</span> <span id="s478">They’re saying they’re helping?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: They did that.</span> <span id="s480">So then, when we got those barracks everything was in very decent... now I want to add to this that after the war we found out the following.</span> <span id="s481">The little book came out with--was telling the story of us-that we were about thousand two hundred Jews there.</span> <span id="s482">Those which were repatriated from Souchok who couldn’t get into Italy, who were in those little towns of Croatia under the military occupation of Italy.</span> <span id="s483">They were all taken into that, uh, into those barracks.</span> <span id="s484">Now, after the war we found out the following -- that the sec--secretaries, the personal secretary of Mussolini in Rome, put away that he--that, that an order came that we should be extradited.</span> <span id="s485">The Germans wanted us extradited, that trains were already in Fiume ready to take us to Poland, where ever to--Auschwitz or so.</span> <span id="s486">He kept that in his drawer, never gave to the Duce to sign it.</span> <span id="s487">The Duce probably wouldn’t have signed it anyhow.</span> <span id="s488">And they give order to those generals, it was the--whatever--General Domato (?)</span> <span id="s489">was his name who had that territory under his, his, eh, jurisdiction.</span> <span id="s490">That they should do everything in their, in, in their, um, power to save us, to take us away from the Croatians and from the Germans.</span> <span id="s491">A year after we were in that, eh, concentration camp, what we called--they took us to an island which was annexed to Italy.</span> <span id="s492">It was a Yugoslav island which is today back Yugoslavia (words missing in original transcript) where they had big, they had housings for those Partisans which were taken away and those Partisans built for us, eh, like rooms for families, you know, that--it--everything was very primitive but we had everything.</span> <span id="s493">And before they moved us, during this--during--it was less than a year--we stayed from November until about August, September next year--’43--no, we were not even- -and, ah, before the armistitio (?)</span> <span id="s494">shortly before the armistitio--before the--September ’43--we were moved to that island.</span> <span id="s495">So we were almost a year on the mainland and they organized so--the kitchen and everything with this, ah, the delegates from the Jewish community--from this twelve hundred people--we had our religious, uh,--like a temple, you know--Fridays and Saturday.</span> <span id="s496">Those who were children had like a school that they can learn.</span> <span id="s497">There was a special kitchen for sick people and um, the kitchen for the children, and, ah, they put up.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">END OF SIDE A would go with, um, Italian officers to Fiume to get the provisions what the army was getting because the Croatians, they didn’t get it --they didn’t have all that food--that everything was rationed--so we were getting everything like the army, like the Italian army.</span> <span id="s499">We paid for it but we got it.</span> <span id="s500">We got everything.</span> <span id="s501">We, we were not hungry.</span> <span id="s502">We could--we, we had a kitchen which was like a military kitchen and we could even do something on little stoves on our own.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Did the people who went into this group--they--somebody must have had money to…</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: No, we--they all had money.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: They all had some money…</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: They all had--because they were all consignalibras (?)</span> <span id="s507">, they were all wealthy—I mean like middle-class, or, or, or…</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s509">And they were bringing them--they got that money out of Yugoslavia?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Everybody had money.</span> <span id="s511">They all got money out.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: That’s very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: So, um, then we, then there came the orders that they want to send us to an island and after the war we found out why it was--because the Germans and the Croatians are really putting their fists down that they had to--they said--why do you keep them here, give them to us, we will keep them the same way, but we want them in, in, in--away from here.</span> <span id="s514">And they wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s515">So they took us to that island.</span> <span id="s516">It’s--the general himself came to the camp and told us he wants--if he could hide us somewhere.</span> <span id="s517">He said--his words were… Pause while Mrs. Mayer regains her composure.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: …he said--he would hide us somewhere where nobody could see us and produce us safe--and alive-with the whole worries over--that’s how he, he hold a speech and told us that.</span> <span id="s519">And he said--but that’s all what he can do is to move us away from the coast, to put us away from this miserable--(words missing in original transcript) the people there where we were…they just couldn’t us if we, we were (words missing in original transcript) Croatians.</span> <span id="s520">But he really also said that the--all the Croatian population there--they were miserable.</span> <span id="s521">And, uh, so we, we got to that island.</span> <span id="s522">That was in, ah, in about July ’43.</span> <span id="s523">And, ah, in September, 8th of September, come the armis--armistice.</span> <span id="s524">But all your--the armistice was they--they lied.</span> <span id="s525">The Italian invaded, ah, Italy and--but already made the armistice.</span> <span id="s526">So the Italians threw- -they were only waiting for that- -they hated the Germans.</span> <span id="s527">They never wanted to be- -to, to fight, really.</span> <span id="s528">They, they started to throw away their arms and they only wanted to go back home.</span> <span id="s529">And, um, the Partisans started to organize.</span> <span id="s530">They liberated the camps.</span> <span id="s531">But we- - we had nowhere to go.</span> <span id="s532">We were - -we were on an island.</span> <span id="s533">So the Partisans started to organize everybody to go up to the mountains.</span> <span id="s534">The Partisans, they- -under Tito- - have been already, ah, doing a lot.</span> <span id="s535">And, um, but I was, after all, not too patriotic anymore.</span> <span id="s536">So I decided I have kept my head down from 1941 to 1943, I’m not going to do that up in the mountains.</span> <span id="s537">I knew two, two girls who were together in camp with me and they were engaged to some of those Italians.</span> <span id="s538">And they arranged for us to mix with them when they were repatriated back to Italy.</span> <span id="s539">So we had something to let us go and they said that we were Italian teachers.</span> <span id="s540">And we mingled among the Italians who took the --the Partisans let them all go because the Partisans took over the island.</span> <span id="s541">The Italians threw away their arms, gave everything over…</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: These are Yugoslavian Partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: The Yugoslavian Partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: Tito’s group?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: They’re Tito’s people.</span> <span id="s546">So they--the Italians were glad to get away and we mingled among them and we went over to--I got over to Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Ohh.</span> <span id="s548">You went to Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: And, um, it was two girls, and um, their fiancés--and their good marriage in Italia…</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: So the war is ended and you were going with the Italians to Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: On a boat.</span> <span id="s552">We wound up in Italy.</span> <span id="s553">In Chadvia (?)</span> <span id="s554">Italy, ah, and a day and a night after.</span> <span id="s555">And when we got there the whole population was at the port waiting for us, shouting that the Germans are coming, that the Italian capitulated--the Germans took over--and that they are taking every Italian whom they find in uniform and who didn’t want to fight--they take them all to Germany.</span> <span id="s556">So, here I come into other troubles.</span> <span id="s557">And, um, ah, on the same boat with us was the--an Italian carabiniere colonel who was the commander of our camps.</span> <span id="s558">And he had money.</span> <span id="s559">He had the, the military cash, cash with him--he had it with him--and I have 1,000 lira with me.</span> <span id="s560">And I had my matura papers and I had some pictures and I had an Italian dictionary with me.</span> <span id="s561">By that time I was already speaking perfect Italian.</span> <span id="s562">So when we got to that town called Chervia (?)</span> <span id="s563">which is north of--next to Rimini--it--it’s on the Adriatic--and the Italian right away--the--all the doors opened from those homes and all those Italian soldiers disappeared and came out civilians in pajamas or whatever they had.</span> <span id="s564">And, eh, that colonel provided for me and for the two girls who had those, ah, Italian fiancés--were with them.</span> <span id="s565">He took us to the carabiniere station and said that we were Italians, that we have no papers, and we invented names.</span> <span id="s566">They gave us right away, papers.</span> <span id="s567">So we had real papers with false names and we, we said we were born in Trieste there because we had--all of us had a little accent.</span> <span id="s568">We were of Italian fathers and Yugoslav mothers, Istria and things like this.</span> <span id="s569">Nobody could trace it there at that, in that, at that, in that (words missing in original transcript) there.</span> <span id="s570">But we got our food rations, we got everything they give because we had legal papers and we were really free now and we, we were on our own.</span> <span id="s571">What we found out later that this, that particular colonel, he was from Naples.</span> <span id="s572">He was caught by the Germans on the train to Avignon (?)</span> <span id="s573">to Naples and he was sent to Germany and he was--he died there in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s574">And there were many Italians who were taken away by the Germans because they were going there--but patrolling--the Germans were patrolling all the trains and asking identifications.</span> <span id="s575">And those poor Italians who just, just ran away from the army--they, they didn’t have anything.</span> <span id="s576">And most of them were taken to concentration camps--to Germany--or to labor forces--they started to treat them like occupational forces treat an enemy contras (?)</span> <span id="s577">--that’s how the Germans then treated the Italians.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s579">I see.</span> <span id="s580">And what…this is ’43?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: That was September ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: And what did you go…?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: I remember that I had an aunt whose husband was the president of the B’nai Brith in Zagreb.</span> <span id="s584">She ran away with her two daughters and she was, and he remained captive with the Germans and they killed him then in Zagreb.</span> <span id="s585">The day when the Partisans entered Zagreb, they killed him.</span> <span id="s586">He was alive until that day in jail because he was a big lawyer and he worked for a big company which was a lumber company.</span> <span id="s587">They needed him every day in the office.</span> <span id="s588">Those were the Germans…</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: Umm.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: …who took over the company.</span> <span id="s591">The owners escaped.</span> <span id="s592">They were alive.</span> <span id="s593">They went to South America--and it was with the London--then to South America.</span> <span id="s594">But he, somehow he got caught right away--he was one of those prominent Jews, Doctor…(words missing in original transcript) And um, the day when the Partisans entered--he had--the day when the Partisans entered Zagreb they killed him because he was kept alive in the jail, he had to--every morning they took him to the office and in the evenings they brought him back to the jail--and he was not allowed to sit in the office, he had to work standing,</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: Umm.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: And, this aunt of mine--then her brother, who was also a lawyer who escaped in the last minute from Zagreb--um, they lived in a liberaconcerno (?)</span> <span id="s597">in a town called Piacenza--that’s near Verona in Italy--and I knew that they were there and I knew the address because we were in, in touch.</span> <span id="s598">So when I got there they were very happy to have me.</span> <span id="s599">But then the Germans came and they, um, the town mayor, the mayor call my uncle and, uh, and his sister--my aunt--and gave them identification in blank--they should put whatever they want their names--and he put his stamp on it.</span> <span id="s600">But they have to go out of the shelter because the Germans are going to come and maybe it--even just the population were--the people were nice--and they will be--never know if they cannot get into trouble--somebody would say, those are Jews, foreigners.</span> <span id="s601">So he gave them Italian papers and they filled out--they became Rossi from Rosenberg, and, eh, whatever--and their, and their daughter was very sick.</span> <span id="s602">She had leukemia--tamar.</span> <span id="s603">She was fourteen years old and they moved over to Bologna and she died there.</span> <span id="s604">And, from there they went, they went to Switzerland--my aunt and my uncle and their older daughter, Naomi.</span> <span id="s605">And they, they saved their life.</span> <span id="s606">And I, then, ran--I went--I had my Italian papers.</span> <span id="s607">Anyhow--so I went to Milano.</span> <span id="s608">I knew somebody in Milano--and I even got a job.</span> <span id="s609">And I worked for the Prefectura de Milano, which is like the government office.</span> <span id="s610">I was doing translating from German to the Italian, from Italian to German.</span> <span id="s611">And they were paying very little money and I couldn’t live on that.</span> <span id="s612">And, um, I met--through some Italian friends which I met--I got into contact with the Italian Partisans--and, um, they told me that if I can get a job with some of the German organ--German, ah, military organizations and get into one of the--to work there--and give them some information.</span> <span id="s613">So I got a job with something called Rouohstaub (?)</span> <span id="s614">--something like this--they have been--that was a ministry, a German ministry which took over all the industry--all the ministries of--Italian ministries, and all the factories--the whole war machine--everything was under their juris- -jurisdiction.</span> <span id="s615">And they had exactly the same department like the Italian ministries had.</span> <span id="s616">Um, I wound up in the panzer division.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Well you could speak German--so they hired you.</span> <span id="s618">They didn’t check you out too closely?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: I had the papers from the…</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Italian papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: …from the Italian…</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: Yeah, right, okay…</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: ….</span> <span id="s624">prefectura.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: So I was--I got all the, ah, I knew what--where ever they were putting together the panzers, the tanks--in Bologna and in (words missing in original transcript) near (words missing in original transcript).</span> <span id="s627">And I was passing over everything to the, to my friends, the Partisans.</span> <span id="s628">And they were bombing here and they were bombing there.</span> <span id="s629">And it seems that somehow they must have smelled something and I was arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: I was arrested but they really couldn’t pin anything to me.</span> <span id="s632">They couldn’t discover anything.</span> <span id="s633">They interrogated me and they couldn’t—they--Gestapo--even the Gestapo interrogated me.</span> <span id="s634">There was a famous--un-famous hotel, Regina, in Milano--which was Gestapo headquarters.</span> <span id="s635">And, um, being that I had the papers that I was Trieste and my mother was, eh, Yugoslav--my father was Italian--they, they were digging out if I had something that--with the Croatian-Yugoslav’s Partisans.</span> <span id="s636">They just couldn’t find there.</span> <span id="s637">They went where I stayed, where I lived.</span> <span id="s638">They looked into all the papers--they couldn’t.</span> <span id="s639">They let me go.</span> <span id="s640">The next day I went--through this connection of my friends--into Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: Next day, I was gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: The Partisans got you out?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: The next day I was gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s646">You went to Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: The next day I was gone,</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: So you spent the end of the war years in Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: And the end of the war in Switzerland and I got--and this part of this, um, ah, branch what I was working for was part of the British passport control offices.</span> <span id="s650">I didn’t know that I got a name to whom to go in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s651">It was a man, a Swiss man, who was the owner of the perfume factory near the border, near the Italian border.</span> <span id="s652">And after the war I contacted him because we were supposed to be repatriated by the nationality--all those which were Yugoslavs had to go back to Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s653">But my parents were in South Italy, in Bari.</span> <span id="s654">They wound up in Bari.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: And I wanted to go--I met my aunt, the one from Vicenza, and my uncle in, in a, in Switzerland…</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Where did you live in Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: And I was interned in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s659">But they would let me go to visit them, I could--like the money.</span> <span id="s660">And I went to the (words missing in original transcript).</span> <span id="s661">And then I got in touch with this man, with that Swiss man who was the agent in Switzerland, and he sent me to the British Passport Control Office in Geneva.</span> <span id="s662">I got some money.</span> <span id="s663">I got a letter, and I got a pass of their live forces to go back to Italy--that I don’t--that I didn’t have to go to Yugoslavia,</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s665">I see.</span> <span id="s666">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: So.</span> <span id="s668">.</span> <span id="s669">and I was with a relative of mine who went with me from Switzerland.</span> <span id="s670">I was living with her--from Italy we went together to, to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s671">And she was with me all the time so she got--and me--and we wound up in Milano and I got even some--we got some money from them and papers and (words missing in

id="s675">Q: The war was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: The war was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: The war was over.</span> <span id="s678">I see.</span> <span id="s679">And you were saved.</span> <span id="s680">Really, the Italians were good to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: It has been said by people--I have had relatives in Italy--that the Italians really didn’t treat the Jews all that badly.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: I will tell you another thing.</span> <span id="s684">Not that they didn’t treat the Jews that badly, they were helping them and they tried to do the best they could to save their lives and to make them, a, that we shouldn’t be in the eyes of, of, of the world--of that world there.</span> <span id="s685">I, I have somewhere, I should--I didn’t think of it--I have a paper from Israel—the--those Jews, Yugoslav Jews who were in camp in Italy, and who were in--there were many Jews in camp in Italy--in Consino Libero (?)</span> <span id="s686">, In Contrmonti (?)</span> <span id="s687">camp--or like we, in their occupied part of Italy--we all contributed to it, and they made, um, like a…</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: A memorial, like Yad Vashem A memorial built like a…</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: No, no, no, not like Yad Vashem.</span> <span id="s690">A very nice book that, that a delegation went to Rome, to the President, and presented their thanks and we all signed where ever they collected--all over the world--wherever they knew somebody’s living who you--whom the Italians saved their life.</span> <span id="s691">They signed the book.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: Oh, that’s very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: And I got a paper.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: …of that--about that--and some pictures from that.</span> <span id="s696">And as much as I know, I was told that there was also the Channasuppena (?)</span> <span id="s697">Program--but not here in New York--about us.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: That…</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: And somebody wrote about this group of Yugoslav Jews who was saved by, by Italy.</span> <span id="s700">About a few months ago, somebody called me up and told me but--here we—they--it was not on the program--it was only in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: That’s very interesting.</span> <span id="s702">So, that’s how you survived the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: And then, how did you come to the United States?</span> <span id="s705">That was later on?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: Oh, I worked for the American Joint in Milano.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p>
