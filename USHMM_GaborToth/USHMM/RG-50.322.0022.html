Berry, Wright State University, Dept. of History Date of Interviews: August 15, 1978</span></p> <p><span id="s2">Q: Dr. Liebermann, how old are you?</span></p> <p><span id="s3">A: I will be 78 next month.</span></p> <p><span id="s4">Q: And you were born -- what month and date?</span></p> <p><span id="s5">A: On the 9th of September, 1900.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Q: That’s coincidental because I am a September 7th boy and you’re September 9th.</span> <span id="s7">Where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: In middle sized town for European standards.</span> <span id="s9">In Beuthen, Upper Silesia.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">Q: And did you grow up there?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: I grew up there.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: What size town was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: About, at the time, 50,000 to 60,000 thousand population.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: Was it industrial, mining?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: Industrial, agricultural district in Upper Silesia.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Do you know when your family came to that area, your parents or grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: My grandparents lived in Upper Silesia for the previous 100--150 years, and I have been on the cemetery where the entire row of Liebermanns were buried.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: Was your family very large?</span> <span id="s19">Did you have many brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: I had one brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: What was the occupation of your parents?</span> <span id="s22">Your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: My father had a small hardware store.</span> <span id="s24">And my father and my mother -- it was a “poppa, momma” business, and they made a very decent living so that they could support the family.</span> <span id="s25">There were no luxuries.</span> <span id="s26">We were rather lower middle class income people.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Was the hardware business traditional within your family?</span> <span id="s28">Had your grandparents also been in the hardware business?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: No.</span> <span id="s30">My grandfather, on my father’s side had a farm and a little hotel and country store.</span> <span id="s31">He died at a very early age, in 1874, of an accident.</span> <span id="s32">And this grandmother died in childbirth when my father was born, in 1869.</span> <span id="s33">On the side of my mother, the grandparents on my mother’s side, the father was a furrier.</span> <span id="s34">He lived in a small town in Silesia, also.</span> <span id="s35">They were married in 1899.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Is your brother younger than you?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: I had a younger brother, who, after he left Germany for South Africa, served in the British army there, in order not to be a prisoner of war since he was an enemy alien.</span> <span id="s38">I brought him to this country and he died here of a heart attack shortly after coming here,</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: What level of education did your parents have?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Both of my parents never saw a high school.</span> <span id="s41">We loved them just the same.</span> <span id="s42">What they had was common sense and that was best expressed in their respect for education.</span> <span id="s43">When we were small kids, eight years, nine years, ten years old, all we heard ‘the more you learn the better you will be off.”</span> <span id="s44">My father would say, “I don’t want you to stand here behind a counter and wait for customers to come to buy something.</span> <span id="s45">I think you should be more.</span> <span id="s46">And I also remember that he said, “Actually, I cannot even advise you what to do for I don’t know.</span> <span id="s47">I have to rely on what you will do and the only thing you have to promise me is that you will do the best you can.”</span> <span id="s48">You know, it is traditional among Jewish people, the respect for learning.</span> <span id="s49">And, that was in our family always, although my father and my mother never had a chance to do anything on their own.</span> <span id="s50">My father was an orphan.</span> <span id="s51">He was in an orphanage, and when he was fourteen he was sent as an apprentice to a hardware store from where he learned his apprenticeship, and afterwards, he started his own little hardware store.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Did you work much in the hardware store?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Yes, as a kid, we all helped, it was a family business.</span> <span id="s54">Everybody had to sweep the floors, and all these things, and we did all these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: In this small city where you grew up, was there much of your family there other than your immediate family?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Did other members of your family live in nearby towns, villages and cites, or were you rather isolated as a family from the rest of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: There was the sister of my mother living in the town about 30 miles away, and in another direction, about 35 miles away, a brother of my father who had a hardware store also.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: Did you have much contact with these aunts, uncles and cousins?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: We visited.</span> <span id="s61">Maybe we saw them every month, every six weeks.</span> <span id="s62">They came over to see us, or we visited them.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: Let me ask you about the religious practices in your home.</span> <span id="s64">Would you characterize your home as being very religious, moderately religious, casually religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: Moderately religious.</span> <span id="s66">My father would go to services every Friday night, and even when I was established as a physician in another city about 40 miles away, for Friday night, whenever I could do it practicing medicine, we would take the train over to this city, to Beuthen, for Friday night supper, you know, which was celebrated in the traditional ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Did you keep Kosher?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: I tell you.</span> <span id="s69">I remember the time when my mother kept a Kosher household.</span> <span id="s70">I was maybe ten, twelve years old, and one day she said to me, “Hans, you know dad has trouble with his gall bladder, and I was told I had to cook everything with pure lard,” and she said to me, “I think we should not cook extra for your father and I think the Lord will not mind if for the sake of being together as a family, we will not observe this Kashrus.”</span> <span id="s71">I remember when my mother said it.</span> <span id="s72">But you know, it was customary there that for the High Holy Days, New Year’s and the Day of Atonement, my father’s and everybody’s store was closed on these days.</span> <span id="s73">And, there is something you might be interested in, you know, German Jews with all the emancipation, and all the achievements, were actually handicapped, insofar as so many lines of professions and trades were closed to the Jews.</span> <span id="s74">For instance, agriculture was closed.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: By official practice?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Not by official practice, but you could not be a member of all these organizations.</span> <span id="s77">The trade unions, the guilds, were closed.</span> <span id="s78">You could not get apprenticeships for Jewish youngsters.</span> <span id="s79">Heavy industry was closed for Jews.</span> <span id="s80">You could not get into the chemical industry.</span> <span id="s81">The academic world was closed as far as institutions were concerned.</span> <span id="s82">In order to get an appointment in the academic world, you had to convert, and there were quite a number of formerly Jewish professors on the faculty.</span> <span id="s83">At the time, this racial thing was not very prominent in it’s importance.</span> <span id="s84">It was so, for instance, in the medical faculty when I went to the University of Breslau, there were four or five former Jews who converted, and became Professors and Chairmen of their departments, but, what I wanted to say is that the professional structure of the German Jews was the retail trade.</span> <span id="s85">In the city where I come from, there were maybe 1,500, 1,800 Jews.</span> <span id="s86">Jewish souls.</span> <span id="s87">During the holidays, the stores were closed.</span> <span id="s88">You thought it was a public holiday, for sixty, seventy percent of the retail stores were in the hands of the Jews, for there was no other outlet.</span> <span id="s89">The second outlet in the academic world was medicine and jurisprudence.</span> <span id="s90">Why?</span> <span id="s91">With these professions you had not to be connected with institutions who would not accept Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: Did you engage in private practice?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Right.</span> <span id="s94">You know, the entire population of Germany, there were 70,000,000 people, and there were 550,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s95">It was less than half percent, and there were fourteen percent of the physicians were Jews, and twenty-six percent of the attorneys were Jews.</span> <span id="s96">There was one more thing which I forgot to mention.</span> <span id="s97">I don’t know, are you interested in this topic?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Yes, please keep on.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: The press was also open for Jews.</span> <span id="s100">You had very prominent Jewish editors and publishers.</span> <span id="s101">But, the great majority of the Jewish lower and financially lower and middle class Jews were engaged in the retail business, for that was one of the few outlets where they could work.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: So then, in essence, you came from a very typical family, because your parents were in the retail trade?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: You say that there were 1,500 to 1,800 Jews living in Beuthen.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Was it a close knit Jewish community?</span> <span id="s107">I guess, what I’m asking is was there, I know it is a Germany in which there is emancipation and assimilation, but was there much of a ghetto attitude in Beuthen among the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Number one.</span> <span id="s109">In Germany, synagogues were not as the synagogues and churches here are more or less social institutions.</span> <span id="s110">People went to church to pray and they went to the synagogue to pray.</span> <span id="s111">But, there was no Men’s Club and there was no Sisterhood, and there were no social events, maybe there were one or two social events during the season for money raising.</span> <span id="s112">That was all.</span> <span id="s113">The social contacts were primarily with Jews.</span> <span id="s114">There was always anti-Semitism around.</span> <span id="s115">You did not want to offend and the German Jews were very reluctant to “stick out of the crowd.”</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Yes, I understand exactly what you are saying.</span> <span id="s117">What language did your family speak?</span> <span id="s118">Was it German?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Yes, German.</span> <span id="s120">German Jews did not speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s121">They spoke German.</span> <span id="s122">Do you know why?</span> <span id="s123">What is Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: It is a mixture of German and Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: No.</span> <span id="s126">Oh, excuse me.</span> <span id="s127">I don’t mean to say no.</span> <span id="s128">Yiddish is the XIV century idiom of the German language.</span> <span id="s129">You know when the Polish and the Russian Jews were driven out of Germany during the period of the Black Death, 1338, and when they came into Poland and Russia where they were invited at that time to stimulate the still feudal economy there, they were not allowed to live in the cities and they lived in Ghettos.</span> <span id="s130">They never had an opportunity of integrating in the Polish and Russian environment.</span> <span id="s131">They continued to speak this German idiom without participating in the evolution of the German language even since then, and of course, this German idiom of the time was mixed up with Polish, Russian, Hebrew expressions.</span> <span id="s132">The result is Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Did you not know Yiddish at all?</span> <span id="s134">Did you not speak it?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: I did not!</span> <span id="s136">I did not!</span> <span id="s137">As a matter of fact, my parents didn’t either.</span> <span id="s138">This is the family tree of my wife’s family which goes back to 1600 something.</span> <span id="s139">And I can trace my family back to 1700.</span> <span id="s140">You know the funny thing, that in spite of all this, we were so assimilated that we did not realize at that time fully all the restrictions we were living under.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: The restrictions of professions, economics, social?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Right.</span> <span id="s143">For instance, I remember that there was a big celebration in this hometown of mine.</span> <span id="s144">The Kaiser was coming down.</span> <span id="s145">There was a monument to Frederick the Great, the Prussian king, which was dedicated on the public square and all the religious functionaries were invited.</span> <span id="s146">The Burgomeister, the mayor, introduced to His Majesty all the functionaries, but he did not introduce the Rabbi who was standing there.</span> <span id="s147">You see, there were these very subtle things, he was invited, but not recognized.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: Present, but not recognized.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">In this matter of language, you come from an area which I could describe as a no man’s land in Europe, fought over by Czechs and Austrians, Poles.</span> <span id="s150">There was a heavy German, a heavy Polish population in your region too, wasn’t there?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: There was a Polish population there too; but, in 1900, after the last war in Upper Silesia, there was a vote.</span> <span id="s152">Part of it went to Poland but the Jewish minority was strictly German.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: There is a dialect spoken in the region.</span> <span id="s154">I think it is called “Wasser Polish” (washed down Polish).</span> <span id="s155">(HL helps find the word).</span> <span id="s156">Did you speak that?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: No, I never.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Did you understand it?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: I understand it…understood and learned some words.</span> <span id="s160">My father had to know Polish, my mother didn’t, in order to carry n his business with Polish customers.</span> <span id="s161">But the great majority, especially in the city were German, and spoke German.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: You characterize your family as being lower middle class.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: Income wise?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Did that enable you to take vacations?</span> <span id="s167">Did you travel much as a boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: No, we did not travel at all.</span> <span id="s169">Our vacation was that you got two slices of bread and some cherries or apples, and we went to the river and went swimming, with a book and so on.</span> <span id="s170">I really did not, we never traveled, that was beyond our budget.</span> <span id="s171">Of courses there were some rather wealthy Jewish people who did travel and went to resorts.</span> <span id="s172">The only time that I remember when my mother went to a spa was when she had heart trouble and it was considered essential and so for three or four weeks she went to this spa in order to take the baths and the mud packing and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: You said a while ago that most of your contact was within the Jewish Community.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Did you have any close contacts with the gentile community, or were they just casual?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: My parents had certain contacts over the years, with customers, and they would bring them some food or flowers for the Jewish holy days, but, intimate contacts we didn’t have with non-Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: What sort of activities, or associations, was your family a member of?</span> <span id="s178">Was there a Hardware Dealer’s Association, for example?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Was there a Chamber of Commerce?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Yes, there was a Chamber of Commerce which consisted of paying the dues.</span> <span id="s182">You know, theirs was a small business and my parents hardly earned a livelihood.</span> <span id="s183">As a matter of fact, in 28 years they had never been on a vacation, and after I was through with my studies and my residency and started practicing, and got along very well, I saw to it, and they did it reluctantly, I sent them on a vacation to the mountains for two weeks.</span> <span id="s184">I threatened them that I would not be able to go on a vacation if they didn’t go first.</span> <span id="s185">You know, it was a different world.</span> <span id="s186">I don’t know if you still have that today.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: I suspect less so!</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Given this level of income which your family had, how would you describe the culture, or the appreciation of culture?</span> <span id="s189">For example, could you go to the theater?</span> <span id="s190">Did you have the income?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s192">My parents always went to the theater.</span> <span id="s193">They were not concertgoers, but they had the subscription for the winter season.</span> <span id="s194">They went to the theater once every couple of weeks.</span> <span id="s195">Movies were just then beginning.</span> <span id="s196">For five cents you went to a movie.</span> <span id="s197">There were these short movies which lasted five minutes with an interpreter accompanying it.</span> <span id="s198">There were no sound movies.</span> <span id="s199">I remember on Saturday afternoon, and it was Sabbath afternoon, we each got five pennies and we could go to the movies.</span> <span id="s200">At that time, you got a ticket with the letter “A” so that you would not see these movies for a second time on the same ticket, all the “A’s” had to go out.</span> <span id="s201">They were checking, so that others could go in.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Was your father politically inclined?</span> <span id="s203">Did he participate in politics?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Not at all?</span> <span id="s206">Not on any level?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: No!</span> <span id="s208">No!</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Could I pursue that?</span> <span id="s210">Was that typical of the Jewish community in Beuthen?</span> <span id="s211">Were they non-political?</span> <span id="s212">Or were there a few who were politically active?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: I tell you that Beuthen, as well as the remainder of Upper Silesia, was 98% Catholic and politics were a matter of the Catholics.</span> <span id="s214">1.7% were Protestant and the rest included the few Jews.</span> <span id="s215">The Catholic Church in this portion of Upper Silesia, at that time was the entrenched party.</span> <span id="s216">Whenever you have such a majority, there just is no politicking.</span> <span id="s217">You know that in Germany, even today, the Christian Social Party is a Catholic party which is today particularly strong in Rheinland Baden Wurttenberg and they are united around the Catholic faith, a rather conservative party against the social democratic party.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Did your father vote even?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Oh, yes!</span> <span id="s220">They voted.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: They did not belong to a party, they did not go to meetings?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: You know, the voting, I don’t know if you are familiar with this.</span> <span id="s223">In Prussia there was a three class voting.</span> <span id="s224">That means that your voting strength was according to your income.</span> <span id="s225">There were three classes, and it was so that in the upper class there were, maybe, sixty people who had as much influence as, maybe, three thousand people in the second class, and maybe, one hundred thousand in the third class.</span> <span id="s226">I don’t know if you had ever heard that?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: No, I had never heard that.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: You were listed according to your federal income.</span> <span id="s229">Those people with property and wealth had more to say than the poor people.</span> <span id="s230">It was called “Drei Klassen Wahlrecht” (the right to vote along three classes) or three class elections.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Mentioning property reminds me to ask you whether where you lived was connected to the store.</span> <span id="s232">Did you live above the store?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: Above the store.</span> <span id="s234">But my parents rented the store, and the apartment.</span> <span id="s235">They did not have any real estate.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Do you remember the address?</span> <span id="s237">The Street and the number?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: What was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Beuthen, Oberschlesien, Rink 8.</span> <span id="s241">Rink is the Market Square.</span> <span id="s242">As a matter of fact, I don’t want to deviate too much, but across the square from the store there was a Catholic Church which was built in 1245.</span> <span id="s243">The corner stone said Anno Domine 1245.</span> <span id="s244">You know, you lived with history.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Now can we talk about your education?</span> <span id="s246">What kind of school did you go to?</span> <span id="s247">Was it public, was Jewish, was it private or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: No, it was all public school!</span> <span id="s249">All public schools were Catholic schools.</span> <span id="s250">I went to grade school for three years.</span> <span id="s251">If you wanted to have a better education, or had in mind an academic career, or something like that, you went to the Gymnasium, and you continued there until you got your mature.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: So this is what you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Yes, this is what I did.</span> <span id="s254">I got up to the last grade in 1917.</span> <span id="s255">I was drafted into the German army in March 1917.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Yes, there are a lot of questions I want to ask you about that, but let me stay with education for just a minute.</span> <span id="s257">Was this Gymnasium a Jewish Gymnasium?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Catholic?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: How many Jews would you estimate?</span> <span id="s262">What percentage of the student body of this Gymnasium was Jewish, would you estimate?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: In a class of forty there may have been three or four Jewish students.</span> <span id="s264">You know, there were only fifteen hundred Jews among sixty thousand people.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: Was there discrimination?</span> <span id="s266">Subtle?</span> <span id="s267">Blatant?</span> <span id="s268">Open?</span> <span id="s269">Hidden?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: I will tell you!</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: For example, did the Catholic boys tease you or scorn your religion or anything like that?</span> <span id="s272">Were they cruel?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: I will tell you.</span> <span id="s274">There were occasions where that was the case.</span> <span id="s275">There were occasions where you hit them for this, and so on; but, as a rule, Catholics having been a minority in Germany, were not at that time so aggressively anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s276">But, of course, the Catholic Church at that time was hostile to any other faith.</span> <span id="s277">You know, at that time, the Catholic Church was not as liberal as it is today.</span> <span id="s278">As a matter of fact, in Germany, there was a crucifix in our classrooms.</span> <span id="s279">There was also a picture of Christ.</span> <span id="s280">What do you think Christ looked like, blue eyes and blond hair.</span> <span id="s281">You know that was a German Christ.</span> <span id="s282">It was so nationalistic, a thing which came to our mind only later, the contradiction, but, when you look back at it today, it is unbelievable.</span> <span id="s283">The Old Testament hardly played any role in Catholic teaching.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: It was all the New Testament, the Life of Christ?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: Yes, and the Jews killed Christ1</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: Was that constantly brought out?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: Yes, certainly!</span> <span id="s288">That was actually the basis of the anti-Semitism in Germany.</span> <span id="s289">The Jews don’t deserve any better because they killed Christ.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: Were the teachers in the Gymnasium all Catholic, I suppose?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: No!</span> <span id="s292">No!</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Were there prayers?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: No!</span> <span id="s295">The Rabbi came to the school while the other kids had their religious instruction which was three times a week.</span> <span id="s296">We, all the Jewish kids were in one room and we had our religious instruction, besides the religious instruction which was furnished at the Hebrew school, outside of official school hours, in the afternoon,</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Did you go to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: Would you characterize your school days as happy?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s301">You know, we didn’t know any better, at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Yes, it is only with reflections and comparisons that other realizations can come to compare.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Yes, we didn’t know any better!</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Now, when you left, at what point did you make the determination to become a doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: I tell you, I always felt that I wanted to study medicine.</span> <span id="s306">As I told you, my father told me, “I can’t advise you.</span> <span id="s307">I don’t know how much I will be able to help you.</span> <span id="s308">I will do the best I can.’</span> <span id="s309">And in 1917, I was drafted into the German Army.</span> <span id="s310">Can you read German?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: I have here a draft notice.</span> <span id="s313">Oh, it so happened in “1918.”</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: 1918!</span> <span id="s315">(This is at variance with the 1917 figure HL had been giving).</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Yes, 1918.</span> <span id="s317">March, that I had to come for the medical examination, cleanly washed, yes, cleanly washed.</span> <span id="s318">Do you know what that is?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: That is a fee schedule dictated by Friedrich Wilhelm, King of Prussia.</span> <span id="s321">You have the schedule of everything here.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: What date is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: 1725.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: That is fascinating!</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: It is an odd thing.</span> <span id="s326">You know, we lived history.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s328">This is something which we here in the U.S. don’t have a sense of!</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: Yes, this is a young country, a young country.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: We don’t have the old buildings which are constant reminders.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A; Yes, as I told you, across the street was a Catholic Church, Anno Domine 1245.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: So, are you saying that you had not decided on any career at the point where you were drafted into the Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Oh, yes!</span> <span id="s334">I always wanted to be a doctor, and our parents did encourage us not to stay in the retail trade.</span> <span id="s335">My brother, who was two years younger, he also studied.</span> <span id="s336">He had a PH.D. in economics.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: How long were you in the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: I was in the army from March to December.</span> <span id="s339">Then the war was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Right, the war was over in November.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: I was discharged in December.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: Those war years, there, in Upper Silesia, was there much fighting in the area?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: No.</span> <span id="s344">That was all, the armistice in the East, with Russia, Poland was part of Russia at the time, was concluded in Best-Litovsk which is far east of Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: So you are not aware, or are you aware, of any hardships from 1914 through 1918?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: We didn’t have anything to eat!</span> <span id="s347">That’s all.</span> <span id="s348">I had rickets.</span> <span id="s349">Look at my wrists.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: Other than a short supply of food do you recall any hardships?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: Hardships!</span> <span id="s352">You know when the war went sour, it was blamed on the Jews, and the Ministry of war decreed that there should be an inquest how many Jews were in the army, in the armed forces, compared with the general population.</span> <span id="s353">And so on, and so on!</span> <span id="s354">And since it proved that it was absolutely as should have been, according to the population, the report was never published.</span> <span id="s355">But, it was done and it was announced that there will be an investigation whether the Jews, that is the percentage of Jews was according to the population.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Was there then growing anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: About 1915, 1916.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: That was 1917, and 1918.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: That was just about the time that you were ending up your schooling.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Yes, and I was given my Matura.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: From the Gymnasium.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: My Matura, you know the certificate, when I left the school and I could enroll in the university.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Yes!</span> <span id="s365">Was there open anti-Semitism?</span> <span id="s366">For example, were you aware of signs saying, “Jews are not wanted here”…”Jews do not enter”…in 1917, 1918?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: No, no!</span> <span id="s368">Actually the number of Jews was so small and in that time, most of the Jews were still in the retail trade, and in the lower income groups, although, there were very wealthy Jews too.</span> <span id="s369">But, they also did not “stick out.”</span> <span id="s370">That came later, when the entire professional and trade balance was different.</span> <span id="s371">When there was prominence in the medical field, when there was prominence of the Jews in the press, when there was prominence in jurisprudence, then it came out!</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: This tape is just ending.</span> <span id="s373">Could we terminate the interview and then next week we can talk about your experiences in the army and your training in the University?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: All right, I will be glad to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: This is Tuesday, August 22, 1978, and I am in the living room of Dr. Hans Liebermann on Cumberland Avenue, for the second of a series of interviews.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Dr. Liebermann, I think that today we should probably cover the period of your life in the army and in medical school, and perhaps we will get as far as establishing your practice after you graduated from medical school.</span> <span id="s377">However, before we start, let me ask you if there is anything which came to your mind after the first interview that you would like to make a comment on, concerning your earlier life in Beuthen, your school days, your family, your family’s business, your social ambience, or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: No.</span> <span id="s379">Actually we had a very happy, close family relationship.</span> <span id="s380">As I told you, neither of my parents ever saw high school, but they had common sense, and, as I told you, they had great respect for learning, and that guided us through the grade school and high school years.</span> <span id="s381">We did not go on fancy vacations.</span> <span id="s382">The budget was so that it was just enough to be comfortable, we did not go out to hotels and restaurants to eat.</span> <span id="s383">We lived a very harmonious, but simple, good family life.</span> <span id="s384">My father was a rather pious man, although he was not orthodox, he was not an orthodox Jew, but, he went to the Synagogue regularly; so did we, we went to Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s385">As I said, we had a happy childhood, and it never occurred to us that there were people around who went to the seaside, to the mountains for vacations!</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Would you say that it was natural your becoming a teenager, and your finishing the Gymnasium and your getting ready to leave home, that brought an end to this; or would you say that WWI had anything of a major impact on it?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: You know WWI broke out when I was 14 years old and after the war was dragging on for a couple of years, we did not have anything to eat and to do because of the isolation and blockade of Germany, which was very effective in WW!</span> <span id="s388">It was tough!</span> <span id="s389">I remember that the peasants from around town came into my father’s store and brought eggs and butter in exchange for hardware items which were to be sold.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: A barter economy?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: Right!</span> <span id="s392">I was in the second highest grade when in March 1918 I was drafted into the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Then you didn’t actually graduate from the Gymnasium?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: I graduated!</span> <span id="s395">I graduated!</span> <span id="s396">When you were only one year away from graduation, you took the examination at that time and you were given your Matura -- Abiturium in German.</span> <span id="s397">That is what I got, I remember it was on a Friday afternoon, when I came home from school, that the notice, which you saw, was there.</span> <span id="s398">The notice that I had to appear for induction on that, or that day.</span> <span id="s399">I got it about ten days ahead of time, and I went right back to school and showed it to the principal.</span> <span id="s400">He said, “All right!</span> <span id="s401">Monday morning you come in and we will start the written examination, and then with the final oral examination.”</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Did you ever finish that last year after you got out of the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: No!</span> <span id="s404">No!</span> <span id="s405">I got credit for that because I was in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: Did your induction catch you by surprise, or did you expect it?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: I tell you, I was 17 years old.</span> <span id="s408">I did not think that it would be so imminent, but at that time German human resources were so low that they took us kids.</span> <span id="s409">We were all undernourished.</span> <span id="s410">My height was five feet and I weighed 101 lbs., and we were still taken in the army!</span> <span id="s411">I served in the heavy artillery unit and we were lodged in a schoolhouse, forty kids in one big room, in three tiered beds!</span> <span id="s412">Then we started a new life!</span> <span id="s413">At that time, armies were not mechanized and specialized!</span> <span id="s414">Most of the training was marching, running and obstacle jumping and things like these.</span> <span id="s415">The technical was just that you had to familiarize yourself with the revolvers and the handguns, take them apart, clean them and that was all.</span> <span id="s416">The same thing applied, of course, to the heavy howitzer artillery pieces, etc.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: Were you stationed near Beuthen?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: No!</span> <span id="s419">No!</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: How far away did you have to move?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: About three hours away by train, in a rather large city.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: What was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Breslau, which is today Polish, it is Wroclaw!</span> <span id="s424">Of course, the school building in which we were lodged was outside of the city.</span> <span id="s425">The most enjoyable thing was, three times a week -- two hours of hospital duty.</span> <span id="s426">That was the most enjoyable of the whole thing.</span> <span id="s427">That I really liked.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Was Breslau threatened militarily?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: No!</span> <span id="s430">Never!</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: So you never saw active duty, combat duty, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: I did not see combat.</span> <span id="s433">No.</span> <span id="s434">But we were sent to the occupied territories.</span> <span id="s435">You know, I believe that we touched on that the last time, due to the Russian revolution in 1917, there was no active fighting on the East front anymore.</span> <span id="s436">But, Germany at that time, had vast occupied territories, and there we were ordered to watch or secure ammunition and supply depots.</span> <span id="s437">That was right in the country, after the basic training, which took about four months, we were on this duty.</span> <span id="s438">As a matter of fact, we were sent out there to what was Poland, even then, so that all men who were ready for combat could be sent to France and Belgium, in order to re-supply, and make up for the German losses.</span> <span id="s439">You know at 101 lbs.</span> <span id="s440">as a little boy, you know I grew afterwards, when we had things to eat, they could not possibly send us to combat.</span> <span id="s441">You know when you’re a sixteen or seventeen year old kid in America, or anywhere, I had rickets, you probably see how thin my wrists are, and that was the only thing they could do.</span> <span id="s442">They sent us to Poland for guard duty.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Do you remember attitudes which were expressed in the last phase of the war?</span> <span id="s444">Were the German people caught by surprise?</span> <span id="s445">Were they prepared for the defeat?</span> <span id="s446">Were they resentful?</span> <span id="s447">Were they pleased that it was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: I think that we discussed what was called in Germany “Judenzalung,” counting of the Jews in the army and comparing that to the percentage of Jews in the general population.</span> <span id="s449">The result was that when the war was being lost, it was the fault of the Jews, as the result is very often.</span> <span id="s450">You know, that has been through history, again and again, that it has been blamed on this insignificant percentage of people, about half to three quarters of one, of the population, which at that time was underprivileged anyway.</span> <span id="s451">We didn’t see it that way, but as far as choice of profession and influence in the general public, dealings are concerned.</span> <span id="s452">But that was the way to find a scapegoat and that was the Jewish population.</span> <span id="s453">The Jews and the Socialists were blamed.</span> <span id="s454">The Communists, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: Did you feel much discrimination while you were in the army?</span> <span id="s456">Were you aware of much discrimination?</span> <span id="s457">You told me something that your sergeant said -- could you repeat it, because that was not on the tape.</span> <span id="s458">You told me that the other day.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: He thought that he was funny when he said that.</span> <span id="s460">During the assembly on Sunday morning that was 8:30 after we had breakfast.</span> <span id="s461">The breakfast consisted of bread with turnip marmalade and coffee, which was made of roasted rye grains.</span> <span id="s462">We never saw milk.</span> <span id="s463">There was an assembly of two tiers.</span> <span id="s464">After the orders for the day, the top sergeant ordered “the Protestants in a line on the left and the Catholics in a line on the right.</span> <span id="s465">Jews, gypsies and others, get out of here.’</span> <span id="s466">And that was not done in a malicious way, do you understand, he thought that was funny.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Were there many Jews in your detachment?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: I think there were three Jews amongst one hundred.</span> <span id="s469">Three or four.</span> <span id="s470">You have to realize that the population was less than one percent.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Were there other evidences of this kind happening while you were in the service?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: I was even in a special course for officer’s training.</span> <span id="s473">After the basic training was over, I was in a course for officer’s training.</span> <span id="s474">That means for training as a commissioned officer.</span> <span id="s475">I don’t know why or how, but that never amounted to anything.</span> <span id="s476">It was broken off the moment we were transferred to guard duty in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: So, in effect, when were you mustered out?</span> <span id="s478">You went in March of 1918, when did you go out?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: That was the end of November, at the end of the war.</span> <span id="s480">The war was over on the 9th, 10th, 11th of November.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: So you saw about six or seven months of service.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: You had not been home since you were inducted and left home, in effect you had not been home since you left for Breslau, to the time you were discharged.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: I was home once and that was for the Jewish holidays, Rosh Hashanah, you know, the New Year’s holiday.</span> <span id="s485">The Jewish soldiers got two days or three days of leave, and I was home in uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Again, back to attitudes and impressions.</span> <span id="s487">Are you aware of any keen disappointments on the part of the Jewish population with whom you associated during the war that Germany had been defeated?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: No.</span> <span id="s489">We were so assimilated.</span> <span id="s490">The concept of the Jewish community was that we were Germans first who happened to be Jewish, that was the concept of the German Jew.</span> <span id="s491">You know, labor was not privileged either.</span> <span id="s492">The entire Socialist movement was considered anti-national, not international, but anti-national in contrast to the national goals of the German empire.</span> <span id="s493">You know it was not.</span> <span id="s494">The Jews at that time thought that we all lived a rather happy time, a rather good life without the restrictions of which we were not aware.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Yes, I understand what you are saying.</span> <span id="s496">In effect, what you are saying is that you shared the disappointment, the drain of defeat with the general population.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Certainly, oh yes, certainly.</span> <span id="s498">We were not happy about it.</span> <span id="s499">That was our defeat.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: One other question before we leave this topic.</span> <span id="s501">There was a lot of propaganda in the allied countries against the Germans, talking about German atrocities in Belgium and so forth, the mistreatment of children in Belgium after the invasion.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: That is not true.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: It has been proven that it was not true, but what I am asking is, do you recall any similar type of propaganda in Germany against the allies?</span> <span id="s504">About atrocities?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: Against the Russians.</span> <span id="s506">Against the Russians.</span> <span id="s507">That the Russians burned whole families in houses, that was a similar thing.</span> <span id="s508">There was a fear of the Russians.</span> <span id="s509">It was never against the French or the British, or the Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: Now, what happened when you were out in late November of 1918?</span> <span id="s511">You returned home, I suppose?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A; I returned home for about one week, and then I went to Breslau to matriculate, and I started my studies.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: Can you recall when that decision had been made that that was the next step to go to Breslau or at least to go to a university, and where you committed?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: As a matter of fact, I registered (inscribed) while I was in the army already, while I was in Breslau.</span> <span id="s515">I could not attend courses, you know, but I was already a student at Breslau University while I was in uniform, after the basic training.</span> <span id="s516">When the winter semester started in August, I registered and after I came home, maybe four or five days later, I went to Breslau and started at that time.</span> <span id="s517">These were not normal times.</span> <span id="s518">There were courses beginning again on the first of November, and on the first of December, and so on, and there were accelerated courses and you could, at that time, in Europe (learn at your own speed).</span> <span id="s519">Medical school in Europe was a six year course, you didn’t go to college.</span> <span id="s520">I think I explained the system to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: No, you didn’t and I wish you would go into some detail about medical training and how courses were structured and so forth.</span> <span id="s522">I think that would be very valuable.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: But, I think I told you that in the third or fourth grade you took an entrance examination for the Gymnasium toward a college preparatory course.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: Yes, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: And, I believe I told you that only ten or twelve percent of all the starters graduated.</span> <span id="s526">For that reason, you had no difficulty.</span> <span id="s527">Once you had your diploma you could go to any university and be admitted.</span> <span id="s528">It was not as it is here, it is questionable what is the better system, the tension; “Will you be admitted to school and so on.”</span> <span id="s529">I think that the training in the German high school was much deeper and much more intense and especially in the humanities, with Greek Philosophy, and generally humanities and history, was much more intense than it is here.</span> <span id="s530">Here you can practically graduate with arithmetic and home economics and automobile driving, etc., but you had a much more classical background when you graduated from the Gymnasium, and you could start right at that time with anatomy, physiology, botany, zoology, embryology.</span> <span id="s531">It was a course of two and a half years.</span> <span id="s532">You know, German education at the universities was and is still entirely different.</span> <span id="s533">There is no roll call.</span> <span id="s534">If you attended, it was all right, if you didn’t attend general lectures it did not matter.</span> <span id="s535">It mattered whether you passed the written and the oral examinations.</span> <span id="s536">It was not, as I said there was no roll call, (the attendance which mattered).</span> <span id="s537">Of course it was to your advantage to attend, but there was no strict enforcement of attendance.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: So you say it took six years to get a medical degree.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: Yes, after two and a half years you took, what is called Physicum, that is the first examination of basic sciences subjects, botany, embryology, zoology, etc.</span> <span id="s540">Then you came into the clinic for three and a half years, and, of course, clinics you had to attend, and you were called on to present cases for general discussion, and so on, but, for formal lectures, there never has been an attendance record.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: How much of the three and a half clinical class was actual clinical experience as opposed to classroom?</span> <span id="s542">Clinical experience on the floor, that is?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: I will tell you, there was a lot of clinical experiences.</span> <span id="s544">We all attended clinics.</span> <span id="s545">At that time there were no films, at that time you had to bring the patient in and show the symptoms and when it was a rather serious case, the patient was rolled out and the discussion was not held in the presence of the patient.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: What about the faculty at Breslau?</span> <span id="s547">Was it outstanding or average?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: It was an excellent facility.</span> <span id="s549">I don’t know whether we talked about it.</span> <span id="s550">In Breslau, among the faculty, there were quite a number of converted Jews.</span> <span id="s551">You know, if you wanted, to teach you had to convert.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: Yes, you mentioned that, if one wanted a university post one had to convert.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: Right.</span> <span id="s554">I think that Breslau was one of the outstanding universities, on the same level.</span> <span id="s555">Now, I did not study in Breslau all the time.</span> <span id="s556">After the first two and a half years, I went to Freiburg.</span> <span id="s557">You know, in the Black Forest.</span> <span id="s558">You went to certain universities where there were outstanding scholars and lecturers in particular subjects.</span> <span id="s559">In Freiburg there was a man who had a very excellent reputation and who was a very good lecturer.</span> <span id="s560">Ashoff, in pathology, and I stayed for a year in Freiburg.</span> <span id="s561">Then I went for another year, two semesters, to Berlin.</span> <span id="s562">That was the center of German science.</span> <span id="s563">Then I went back to Breslau in order to graduate, after another year.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Did you specialize?</span> <span id="s565">Did one decide to specialize in this period of six years, or did specialization come later?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: I never practiced general medicine.</span> <span id="s567">When I was in my ninth semester, I felt that my special interest was ear, nose and throat.</span> <span id="s568">As a matter of fact, I recall that I was never interested in gynecology and obstetrics.</span> <span id="s569">I remember when I was in my oral examination with the professor of gynecology and obstetrics.</span> <span id="s570">He examined me for about twenty minutes, I was the only one present, and said to me, “Herr Liebermann, Sie haben alle fragen beautworket und ich gebe (unable to translate) ein good -- one is excellent and two is good.</span> <span id="s571">(Mr. Liebermann, you have answered all the questions and I give you a grade of good, “but you have no knowledge, no practical knowledge of gynecology and obstetrics.”</span> <span id="s572">And I said, “Professor, what makes you think, or what makes you tell me that?”</span> <span id="s573">and he said you just reconstruct things as they have to occur without any positive knowledge.</span> <span id="s574">So I said to him, “After you told me that I get a grade not only passing, but a grade of good, I tell you that I have never been interested in the field of gynecology and obstetrics, and I promise you that I will never deliver a woman in my life anymore.</span> <span id="s575">I will practice ear, nose and throat.</span> <span id="s576">I consider your remarks as a great compliment that I can reconstruct the cases.”</span> <span id="s577">That was one of the funny things which happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Where did you do your ear, nose and throat work, in Berlin or in Freiburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: In Breslau.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: In Breslau?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: First I had my internship.</span> <span id="s582">I had that at the university hospital in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s583">And then I finished five years of residency in Breslau.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: That is after the six years of university?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: Right, I had five years of residency in Breslau.</span> <span id="s586">That was very pleasant, you know, I was very happy at that time doing what I wanted to do and having the opportunity of doing it.</span> <span id="s587">These were very happy years.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: That is interesting that you say that, because one of the questions I wanted to ask you was about life in Germany in the 1920’s.</span> <span id="s589">You knew there is this image of German student life, here in the United States, that perhaps comes from the Student Prince.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: Drinking, dueling, enjoying?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Having a generally good time and not concentrating very much on academics.</span> <span id="s592">Is that true?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: I will tell you there were students whom it took five to six years until they took the examination which was due after five semesters, that is after two and a half years.</span> <span id="s594">You could stay at the university and work or not work, and so on.</span> <span id="s595">It was what they called academic freedom.</span> <span id="s596">Really, and there were, especially in those fraternities, which were dueling and drinking fraternities.</span> <span id="s597">There were, of course, ambitious and studious personalities, too; but, the average was a similar situation here, what did qualify, before the first Sputnik went up, the successful American.</span> <span id="s598">To have been a newspaper boy, to have been born on a farm, preferably in a log cabin, a newspaper boy, a letter man in college.</span> <span id="s599">These were the qualifications.</span> <span id="s600">If you were studious, if you went studying, you were a square.</span> <span id="s601">You know that changed after the first Sputnik.</span> <span id="s602">At that time, how many Jews did you have in academic circles at universities?</span> <span id="s603">At that time I believe it dawned on the American people that they could not go on, just the way they were.</span> <span id="s604">They could not go on in this present age and we had a similar situation.</span> <span id="s605">You know, in order to, as a Jew, hold a position, you had to have a background not as good, but maybe better, as the other fellow, and some of it, of course, manifested itself in being pushy and so on.</span> <span id="s606">You know the attributes which are given to Jews in general, but it comes out of a not an inferiority feeling, but out of a feeling that if there is a choice between two, the Jew has a chance only if he has to offer something more.</span> <span id="s607">I hope you understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: That I don’t mean that in any way of pretending that the Jews are better, you understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s611">There is so much I want to ask you about these years which you describe as being happy, these years of the 1920’s, and yet it was a very sad time for Germany.</span> <span id="s612">Were you personally happy?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: I was involved in my studies and my research and so on.</span> <span id="s614">That was a very happy time.</span> <span id="s615">You know, of course, that you could see the growing anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s616">I remember when I was in Berlin in the charity hospital, and I came out of a course in dermatology.</span> <span id="s617">I think that it was in June 1923, no 21 or 22, and there were extras (in the paper) that Radenau was killed.</span> <span id="s618">You know, he was a Jewish foreign minister.</span> <span id="s619">That was one of the first signs of the aggressiveness of what was going to come.</span> <span id="s620">And, of course, when I say that I was happy, you more or less abstracted yourself as a way of going ahead with your own accomplishments.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: Accomplishing your goals, etc.</span> <span id="s622">But, for example, were you aware of any anti-Semitic feelings on the part of your professors?</span> <span id="s623">Did any of that ever come out in the 20’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: They were, most of them were rather collegiate to non-Jews, very formal and rather reserved towards Jews.</span> <span id="s625">The same thing was the case when I had my internship and my first year of residency.</span> <span id="s626">That was a very formal, you know it was so formal that when you talked to your professors, you almost stood at attention.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Did that bother you?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: Pardon!</span> <span id="s629">I will tell you at that time you felt that is the way it is supposed to be.</span> <span id="s630">Although you were aware that the majority of your professors and your clients, later on, were very formal towards Jews, and more relaxed towards the others.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: I am curious, you may not want to talk about this.</span> <span id="s632">Please feel free to say no, but you described yourself as coming from a lower middle class background.</span> <span id="s633">How was this university education financed?</span> <span id="s634">Did your family finance it?</span> <span id="s635">Was there an arrangement in Germany that the state financed the education?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: I want to tell you one thing, in Europe, to this very day, higher education is free.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: That is what I wondered, if it was all free.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: Higher education was free, but you had to pay certain lab fees, course fees, etc.</span> <span id="s639">But education was free.</span> <span id="s640">I subsidized myself, and so did my brother later.</span> <span id="s641">He took over from me.</span> <span id="s642">I developed, in Breslau, a reputation that I tutored high school students in mathematics, physics and chemistry.</span> <span id="s643">I could have had more students, but I needed time for myself to study.</span> <span id="s644">I always had a long, busy day.</span> <span id="s645">I studied sometimes until 11:00 o’clock at night, since in the afternoon I gave these tutorial lessons.</span> <span id="s646">So, I got through.</span> <span id="s647">I lived in a furnished room.</span> <span id="s648">There were no dormitories.</span> <span id="s649">I lived in a furnished room in the house of a physician.</span> <span id="s650">Well, a simple, a very simple life.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: Most of your fellow students, those you associated with, were they Jews?</span> <span id="s652">A mixture of gentiles and Jews?</span> <span id="s653">Or mostly gentiles?</span> <span id="s654">Or did these distinctions make no difference?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: Oh, yes, there was a difference.</span> <span id="s656">I belonged to a Jewish fraternity.</span> <span id="s657">That already made you Jewish.</span> <span id="s658">There were practically no fraternities where there were Jews and gentiles together.</span> <span id="s659">The gentile fraternities were the hotbeds of anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s660">So, I can say that nine out of ten contacts were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: Do you recall any hateful, bitter incidents in medical school?</span> <span id="s662">Things said, action taken that harmed you in any way?</span> <span id="s663">You may wonder why I am probing in this area, but what I am trying to establish is how free a Jewish student was in medical school in Germany in the 1920’s, or how restricted he was?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: He was restricted, and we really did not feel this way, since we were, today I might say too, assimilated.</span> <span id="s665">We felt that is the way Jews lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Did you Jewish Germans keep up with politics at all while you were a student, did you have no time for this?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: When you were 21 you could exercise your right to vote.</span> <span id="s668">I always voted for the middle of the way, maybe bourgeois Democratic Party.</span> <span id="s669">“Demokratische Partei.”</span> <span id="s670">That was a rather small group.</span> <span id="s671">Out of an assembly of about four hundred, they had maybe, sixty to seventy seats.</span> <span id="s672">Besides the Jews, there were a certain quantity of people who were liberal.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: That’s all right that noise won’t bother.</span> <span id="s674">Were you at all concerned about such people as Rosa Luxemburg and this party, this revolt?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s676">They were embarrassing!</span> <span id="s677">The German Jews did not want, did not appreciate the exposure of the undesirable elements.</span> <span id="s678">They did not appreciate it, they were embarrassed by it.</span> <span id="s679">You know Rosa Luxemburg, on the other hand there were politicians who were first class such as Ludwig Frank.</span> <span id="s680">Frank and Hirsch who were Socialists, that is Social-Democrats.</span> <span id="s681">However, this Frank, who was a prominent man in the Social-Democrat party, was an attorney and died during WWI on the battlefield.</span> <span id="s682">There were men of prominence you could be proud of, but Rosa Luxemburg, Eisener -- I don’t know if you had heard of him -- they were radicals and played a role in the revolution, they were radicals and radicals embarrassed the Jews who were a middle class society.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: My tape is about to run out and I think that I will not ask you another leading question.</span> <span id="s684">Let’s stop today and we will resume later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: This is the third session with Dr. Liebermann.</span> <span id="s687">It is Monday, August 28, 1978 and we are in the living room of his house.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Dr. Liebermann, last time, toward the end of the conversation, we were discussing your medical education, your stay in Berlin and your studies at the University of Breslau.</span> <span id="s689">I was beginning to question you a little bit about the growing troubles of Germany in the 1920’s, the economic difficulties, the inflation of 1923.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: Yes, 1923 was the high point of the inflation.</span> <span id="s691">It stopped in November 1923 when the new currency was introduced, and that was four and a half million marks to one new mark.</span> <span id="s692">Imagine the enormity of the inflation.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: Did that effect, in the period of the early 20’s, your way of life very much while you were a student?</span> <span id="s694">Were you an extremely poverty stricken student, or were you able to manage?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: I will tell you that with few exceptions, all the students were in the same boat.</span> <span id="s696">It was extremely hard to find a job, part-time job, and a lot of time I needed for myself.</span> <span id="s697">I believe that I told you previously that I was tutoring high school students in Math, chemistry and physics, that gave me some income and some I got from my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Also, 1923 was a very important year insofar as the history of the Nazi party was concerned.</span> <span id="s699">That was the year of the Beerhall Putch.</span> <span id="s700">Do you recall being aware of the appearance of the Nazi party?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: But, of course.</span> <span id="s702">Although, where I lived in Silesia, it was not so acute as it was in Berlin or in Munich or in Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s703">But you saw the shadows already and it took until two or three years later, until 1927 or 28 until there was the first Nazi newspaper in Silesia.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: Do you recall exactly where you were?</span> <span id="s705">Were you in Berlin or Breslau?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: When?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: In 1923.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: On a Saturday afternoon, coming out of a clinic, attending a lecture on Dermatology, when there were extras in the street which reported the assassination of Radenauer.</span> <span id="s709">That was in June.</span> <span id="s710">Yes.</span> <span id="s711">And all these things were not very encouraging.</span> <span id="s712">It was unpleasant, as a matter of fact, it contributed to the fact that Jews and the small Jewish sector of the population reacted more or less.</span> <span id="s713">There were a lot of gentiles who did not want openly any close communication with Jews at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: When did you finish your medical school, was it 1928 or 1929?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: 1923!</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: When did you establish a practice?</span> <span id="s717">When did you open a practice?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: 1928.</span> <span id="s719">Until the beginning of 1924, I was an intern.</span> <span id="s720">I served my internship.</span> <span id="s721">Then I served five years as a resident in ear, nose and throat.</span> <span id="s722">After that I established the practice of my own.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: Now, where did you choose to open your practice?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: I came from Upper Silesia and I went to a city of Upper Silesia where I could get an appointment at the city hospital.</span> <span id="s725">In the German cities of the size of 50,000, 60,000, 80,000, there was only one hospital and there was not the open staff system.</span> <span id="s726">You had to go to a city where you could get a staff appointment.</span> <span id="s727">In this city, I was the ear nose and throat man, although there were six other ones in this town who had privileges in the hospital.</span> <span id="s728">There was only one other one who had privileges in the hospital (this is an apparent contradiction -- probably one of syntax about the six “other ones in this town.”</span> <span id="s729">And those who did not have hospital privileges had to make do with rather primitive substitutes, which they called clinics.</span> <span id="s730">There In started.</span> <span id="s731">I opened my office in the middle of December 1928, after five years of residency, and there I got along very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: What town was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: Leibitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: How far is that from Beuthen?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: From Beuthen?</span> <span id="s736">Oh, about 30 miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: To get this position in the hospital, was it just the matter of making an application and supporting it with recommendations, or did you have to sit for some kind of examination?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A; Oh, I had to have the recommendations.</span> <span id="s739">My boss was influential and recommended me; so I got an appointment.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: When did you meet Mrs. Liebermann?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A; I met her in 1923, just when I graduated medical school.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: Is she a native of Breslau?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: No.</span> <span id="s744">She was born in Opeln, which is about an hour’s train ride from Breslau, and one hour’s train ride from Leibitz.</span> <span id="s745">We met at a social occasion in my fraternity.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: At the University of Breslau?</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: When were you married?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: I got married in February, 1928.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: The same year you opened up your practice?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: Now, would you mind describing Leibitz to me?</span> <span id="s753">What size town was it?</span> <span id="s754">What size Jewish population?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: It was a city of about 90,000, a very old city.</span> <span id="s756">As old as Silesian cities were, which until the seven year war, under Frederick the Great, you are a historian, belonged to the German-Austrian-Roman Empire.</span> <span id="s757">It was conquered by Frederick the Great, and belonged to Prussia ever since -- in 1756, or something like that.</span> <span id="s758">It was an industrial city with coal mines and steel mills and with a vast agricultural population supporting it as a region.</span> <span id="s759">It was very comfortable to live there.</span> <span id="s760">We lived in an apartment as was the custom in Europe and I had my office with a separate entrance.</span> <span id="s761">The office was on one side and the apartment on the other side on the same floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: Was the population of Leibitz mainly German or was there a sizeable Polish population?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: The population in the city was maybe eighty percent German, but the surrounding country was only fifty percent German.</span> <span id="s764">The rest was Polish.</span> <span id="s765">But, in the germanization process, which had been going on sine Frederick the Great had conquered it, a lot of the Poles had to learn to speak German and the schools were German.</span> <span id="s766">Thus, the kids, even if they spoke Polish at home, had to learn German in class for the official language.</span> <span id="s767">That was not a bilingual section of the country.</span> <span id="s768">The official language was German, the same as now the Quebecois wanted to make and actually already made that the official language for the administration and the public schools, and so on, should be French.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: What was the Jewish population of Leibitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: The Jewish population was between 1,000 and 1,100 souls.</span> <span id="s771">But, as I told you, since there was this restriction in the profession, and occupations and business, it was mostly in retail business that they were active with some professional men.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: How many doctors were in Leibitz at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: There were about 100-110 and there were maybe fifteen Jewish doctors, which was very high in comparison to a little over half percent of the general population.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: Was there a medical association to which you belonged in Leibitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: Did you hold any position of leadership in that organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: No, that was not done, you know, nobody cared for that.</span> <span id="s778">Jews never had a career in the medical societies, or never had a chance.</span> <span id="s779">And, as I told you before, we were not particularly bothered by it.</span> <span id="s780">On the other hand, we were so assimilated, that we didn’t resent that.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: You accepted that as normal?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: Right.</span> <span id="s783">As a matter of fact, in this medical society they were all Catholics, and the Protestant doctor did not hold any office either.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q; Do you recall the appearance of the first manifestation of the Nazi movement in the region?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: They had marches, but that came in 1931-32.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: Not in the late 20’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: In the late 20’s and in the 30’s.</span> <span id="s788">As I explained to you, they liked to come to Jewish doctors.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: What sort of a sensation did that give you?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A; What?</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: Knowing what the Nazi party stood for and yet having a Nazi party member appear in your office for treatment?</span> <span id="s792">Were you resentful?</span> <span id="s793">Fearful?</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: I was not fearful.</span> <span id="s795">I was just hurt that this fellow came to me in spite of the fact that he was a Nazi.</span> <span id="s796">He did not come to me to please me, he came in spite of the fact that he was a Nazi.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: When did you begin to become concerned?</span> <span id="s798">Can you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: Did you ever hear of the American Jewish Congress?</span> <span id="s800">The American Jewish Committee?</span> <span id="s801">These are the organizations which are concerned with rights of American citizenship.</span> <span id="s802">And we had a similar, and I believe I mentioned it, organization in Germany; “den Zentraverein Deutcher Staht Burger Judischen Glaubens.”</span> <span id="s803">That means the “Central Organization of German Citizens of the Jewish Faith.”</span> <span id="s804">As the name tells you, that shows how assimilated the German Jews were.</span> <span id="s805">And during the first years -- in the 20’s and in 30 and 31 -- you really thought, and we erroneously thought, that this was a thing which would blow over and the people would come to their senses.</span> <span id="s806">And you know that this organization, of which I was a member, and where I was active, felt that there was nothing to fear.</span> <span id="s807">There was another organization called “Verein zur Abwehr des Antisemitimus” (Association in Defense against anti-Semitism.)</span> <span id="s808">that means it was an organization primarily to fight anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s809">You know, being so assimilated and believing what the authorities said, who had knowledge and had studied these questions.</span> <span id="s810">I don’t mean government authorities, I mean those people who really were sociologists and had a deep knowledge of the psychology of the movement, they all felt that this was nothing really so damaging, that it would actually lead to an exodus or to the point where Jews would perish in Germany.</span> <span id="s811">We did not believe that until Hitler actually came to power.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: On January 30, 1932?</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: Right!</span> <span id="s814">I remember, I remember, that was on a Saturday afternoon.</span> <span id="s815">We were with friends, a doctor friend, who was an obstetrician, and we were sitting and listening to the radio, when we heard what was going on in Berlin.</span> <span id="s816">The government had resigned and Hitler had taken over, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: And you were aware from that moment?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A; That, the thing was that our organization said; “Don’t give up any position you are holding!</span> <span id="s819">Since we still believe that this is a passing event.”</span> <span id="s820">And now we lived in a region of Germany, in Upper Silesia, which was protected by the Geneva Treaty.</span> <span id="s821">You know part of it had become Polish, and part of it was German.</span> <span id="s822">For fifteen years, I believe, until 1937, that was protected and they could not do a thing officially against the Jews.</span> <span id="s823">And we thought, all right, even if they take over during the next few years, we will be protected, which was a false security feeling.</span> <span id="s824">And I must say, insofar, as my practice was concerned, everything was going all right.</span> <span id="s825">We did not, at that time, spend our vacations in Germany, we went to Czechoslovakia, to Austria, to Switzerland, to Italy, you know there are no distances there.</span> <span id="s826">You have been to Europe?</span> <span id="s827">You have traveled in Europe?</span> <span id="s828">There are really no distances in Europe.</span> <span id="s829">The moment this treaty lapsed, then it was as it was in the rest of Germany.</span> <span id="s830">I think that was in October that this treaty lapsed.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Of 1937?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s833">In the beginning of 1938, one of the first things was that we could not lead enterprises.</span> <span id="s834">That was all over Germany, but in the Germany proper it was earlier, that Jewish businessmen could not give expert opinions on health conditions of what they called Germans, since they were not Germans, and then they told us that our membership in the medical society was terminated, and that we could not attend any meetings anymore.</span> <span id="s835">And things like these.</span> <span id="s836">The last thing which was in March of 1938 was that they told me that my license would be revoked as of July 1, 1938, so that I would not be able to practice medicine anymore.</span> <span id="s837">But fortunately, I did not wait until that time when I saw how things were and when I detected, I don’t know if we talked about this, that people recognized my car when I made a house call.</span> <span id="s838">We didn’t talk about that?</span> <span id="s839">You know, people continued to come to my office, but as the pressure on them grew, a father who came with a child, and I said, “this child needs an operation.”</span> <span id="s840">The father would say, “I am a teacher and I cannot afford to take my child to a hospital employing a Jewish doctor.</span> <span id="s841">As long as I can come to the office here, it’s all right, but that I cannot do, otherwise I lose my job.”</span> <span id="s842">Or, I remember very clearly one case where I was called out at eleven o’clock at night by parents who had a very sick child.</span> <span id="s843">It was about two years old, it was screaming, and I went there.</span> <span id="s844">This kid had an ear infection, a middle ear infection, with bulging eardrums and a temperature of 105 degrees F.</span> <span id="s845">At that time, what did you do?</span> <span id="s846">You rolled the kid in a blanket, gave the kid a few drops of a mild anesthetic and with indirect light lanced both eardrums and relieved the pressure -- the pain was gone and the child would wake up within a couple of minutes.</span> <span id="s847">This child was dehydrated, it was very sick, as a matter of fact, I gave this child something to stimulate the heart action because this child had a pulse rate of over 160.</span> <span id="s848">I stayed there for about one hour and a half and then I left and went home.</span> <span id="s849">I said, “I am going to see this kid tomorrow sometime, if there is anything critical, you call me.”</span> <span id="s850">At 6:30 in the morning, these people called me, “The child is fine, he is walking around, he had a big breakfast and so on.”</span> <span id="s851">This was all wrong for there could not have been any such recovery, but apparently my car was detected there, and they had gotten hell.</span> <span id="s852">I never heard anything from these people anymore since they were intimidated, and so on.</span> <span id="s853">After more of these things, I realized that it was no longer possible to practice medicine.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: Could we back up a little bit and let me ask you some details about this kind of thing which was beginning to happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: What was your reaction, for example, to the men, the school teacher who said that he could not afford to, politically, for fear of losing his job, to have his son treated by you.</span> <span id="s857">Did you wither?</span> <span id="s858">I know you would not display anger, but were you angry?</span> <span id="s859">Resentful?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: I can only say that I felt that this man was scared to death, and justifiably so.</span> <span id="s861">I said, “Then you go to another physician and when you have a chance, tell him that I feel that this child needs an operation badly.</span> <span id="s862">See to it that this child is being seen in two days.”</span> <span id="s863">This man said to me, “Maybe you think that I am a coward, but I still have to eat.”</span> <span id="s864">You know, to a Jew, they could say that, they could not say that in public.</span> <span id="s865">No, I was not resentful against this man.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: You say that after the protection was removed in 1937, after the agreement lapsed, The Geneva Treaty, that you were informed of certain things, that you had to withdraw from the Medical Society, that eventually your license would be taken away from you.</span> <span id="s867">How were you informed?</span> <span id="s868">Was it by letter?</span> <span id="s869">By mail?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: By letter, stating, “Heil Hitler, you are herewith informed that your membership in the Medical Society has been revoked and you will not be allowed to attend any meetings of the Society in the future.”</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: Did you ever have any direct contact with Gestapo?</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: (Note: GESTAPO stands for Geheime Stats Polizei, i.e., Secret State Police).</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: When did that occur?</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: That was in 1938, when I had direct contact with the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s876">In 1938, that is a long affair, but you can only understand it, if I give you the background of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: Do you mind?</span> <span id="s878">I wish you would.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: In Berlin (Note that this is probably in error and HL means Leibitz).</span> <span id="s880">Where I had my office in 1930, when my lease was expiring, my landlord said to me, “If you want to stay here I have to have a second mortgage on this house.</span> <span id="s881">I have to have a mortgage of $10,000, a second mortgage.”</span> <span id="s882">I said, “And what are you giving me?”</span> <span id="s883">And he said, “As long as you have the money here in the house, I am not going to raise the rent.”</span> <span id="s884">That was alright, and there was a contractual agreement which allowed me, when I terminated, which at that time was nor foreseeable that I would ever terminate that, that I have to give them three months notice for the repayment.</span> <span id="s885">And after I was here, in the U.S. on a visitor’s visa for information since I did not have any contact.</span> <span id="s886">I had no relatives, etc.</span> <span id="s887">So I came over here -- and we will talk about that later, -- and I decided that I would give up, or be forced to give up, my office, my practice in April 1938.</span> <span id="s888">I gave notice so that I would get the money back in three months.</span> <span id="s889">Within about six weeks, the attorney of the owner called me that he would send over a receipt which I should sign and then he would transfer the money to my bank.</span> <span id="s890">He asked me to which bank do you want to have that check deposited?</span> <span id="s891">I said, “send it to the City Bank,’ that was across the street from my office.</span> <span id="s892">I signed the receipt and the next day two Gestapo men identified themselves and came to my office in the midst of office hours, and said to me, ‘You withdrew 10,000 Marks from the Dresdner Bank yesterday.”</span> <span id="s893">Jews were suspect of swindling money away and hoarding, which was not allowed.</span> <span id="s894">I said, ‘I did not.”</span> <span id="s895">“I know that the $20,000 were deposited in the Dresdner Bank, but you withdrew them right away.”</span> <span id="s896">“I did not.”</span> <span id="s897">“You liar” and so on.</span> <span id="s898">“Dirty Jew, liar.”</span> <span id="s899">And I said, “I would like to make one telephone call,” And I called the President of the City Bank across the street.</span> <span id="s900">They were patients of mine, or had been, at least.</span> <span id="s901">I said to him, “Mr. Oshovsky, I am in danger of my life right now, and I have to ask you for a favor.</span> <span id="s902">I want you to come up with my credit statement to my office, it is just across the street, and you can save my life.”</span> <span id="s903">For I knew what had happened.</span> <span id="s904">They had sent, as I understood afterwards, the money which had been originally in the Dresdner Bank, which was a different bank, where I had an account.</span> <span id="s905">They put it in and for pure chicanery, they put it in and put it out, sent it to the City Bank and informed the Gestapo that $10,000 was withdrawn.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: Who are they?</span> <span id="s907">The lawyer?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: No!</span> <span id="s909">The bank!</span> <span id="s910">And after they saw that, that man came over.</span> <span id="s911">Fortunately, that (the deposit), I guess) was already in.</span> <span id="s912">So they (the Gestapo agents) left.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: They cleared off?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s915">But, you know what you go through when you have two Gestapo men with revolvers next to you and they tell you that you are lying and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s916">I don’t know what would have happened if this fellow would have been out of the office.</span> <span id="s917">He was nice enough and these were people who were always very nice.</span> <span id="s918">In order to show us they were decent, they sent us flowers from their garden every week.</span> <span id="s919">You know, there were more people who did things like this in order to show us that it was not their cup of tea.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: Was there censorship of the Silesia newspapers about what was going on in the rest of Germany during the period of this agreement?</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: No!</span> <span id="s922">No!</span> <span id="s923">In Germany proper, it was much worse than it was (in Silesia) at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: And you knew it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: Yes, I knew it was.</span> <span id="s926">Unfortunately, the first few years, this citizenship organization misled their Jewish membership with the intention probably to hold their jobs, etc.</span> <span id="s927">About the actual outlook it was always, “Don’t give up anything, hold any position you still have and don’t go away.”</span> <span id="s928">They discourage emigration.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: No, I didn’t know that it was discouraged.</span> <span id="s930">I didn’t have any idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: In the first few years, they actually discouraged emigration when they said, “This is something which will blow over, don’t give up anything you still hold.”</span> <span id="s932">That was a mistake.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: When Hitler came to power on January 30, 1933, I have a list here of the chronology of events from 1933 on into the forties.</span> <span id="s934">Could I just read you some items?</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: Let me see if you can recall them and remember your impressions or reaction.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: Yes1</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: For example the Reichstag Fire in February 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: Definitely.</span> <span id="s940">That was an affair which was staged by the Nazis in order to have reason for existing and fighting communism!</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Did that frighten you?</span> <span id="s942">Did you begin to feel personally threatened?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: Certainly it frightened you, but the basic thing was that the majority of the German Jews, myself included, felt that a thing like that would actually not be possible and lasting.</span> <span id="s944">You know we were so assimilated that we did not think that was lasting.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q; Did you know about the concentration camps?</span> <span id="s946">Or, when did you first learn of the concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: That we learned in 1933-34.</span> <span id="s948">It was primarily for Communists and Socialists in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s949">That was a frightening thing.</span> <span id="s950">Primarily, it was that there were so many concentration camps -- there were not enough Jews for them.</span> <span id="s951">There were Jews among the people in the beginning who were put into the concentration camps, but, it was primarily in the beginning, for Socialists and Communists.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: In other words, you are saying that the Jews who were put in concentration camps in 33 and 34 were not there because they were Jews, but because they were Socialists and Communists?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: They were Jews who may have broken the law and they would have gotten, maybe, three months, but they gave them the three months and put them into concentration camps afterwards.</span> <span id="s954">Do you see what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: Yes!</span> <span id="s956">Yes!</span> <span id="s957">January of 34?</span> <span id="s958">The sterilization laws for the unfit?</span> <span id="s959">Doctors?</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: You know, there was not one outcry of anyone of the non-Jewish physicians!</span> <span id="s961">The way the medical profession accepted all that was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s962">There was no question of ethics, etc.</span> <span id="s963">It was just so, as a matter of fact, I had, for instance two of us ear, nose throat men in Leibitz.</span> <span id="s964">For years we had both a subscription to the journals, to the professional journals in otolaryngology, ear, nose and throat, and we did that together and we always exchanged them and after that was through we gave it to the Medical Society, to the library of the Medical Society.</span> <span id="s965">But we were with this couple, they were Catholics, Dr. Bayer, I don’t know if he still lives, we were on such terms that we visited, oh, every couple or three months, mutually, in our homes, for dinner, and we were on good terms.</span> <span id="s966">After January 30th, this fellow cancelled the subscription and put it under his own name only.</span> <span id="s967">Not only that, when Jewish physicians were not allowed to do any work anymore for insurance companies, I remember that a patient came to me and told me, “Doctor, didn’t you tell me that you were always on good terms with Dr. Bayer?”</span> <span id="s968">I said, “Yes, we were.”</span> <span id="s969">And he said, ‘You know, when I came to his office,’ for he had to for reinstatement to work, he had to go to him, I could not sign that.</span> <span id="s970">He said, “You are still going to this Jew?”</span> <span id="s971">You know, it was so that no one, from this moment on, and that had nothing to do with this treaty, you know, the treaty, the treaty protection.</span> <span id="s972">I remember that on the 31st of March 1933, I was in the hospital in the afternoon and the Chief of Staff, a surgeon saw me leave and he said to me, “Liebermann,” you know that in Europe you don’t call yourself by first names, you call yourself by the last name, but not with Herr etc.</span> <span id="s973">He said to me, “Liebermann, are you going home now?”</span> <span id="s974">and it was within walking distance, maybe ten minutes.</span> <span id="s975">And I said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s976">And he says, “Wait a minute, I am going with you.”</span> <span id="s977">He wanted to demonstrate that he was an old German, exclusive, conservative, that he did not like that and he walked along the main street and brought me to my house.</span> <span id="s978">He wanted to show me that he does not approve of it; but, while I was already here in the U.S. and Lotte and our son was still in Germany -- we will come to that later, my son broke his arm and she called him and he said, “I don’t take care of Jews anymore.”</span> <span id="s979">That was about five years later.</span> <span id="s980">At that time, my wife had to call a Catholic physician, an orthopedic physician, in Beuthen whom she knew and I knew very well, and asked him if he would take care of him.</span> <span id="s981">He said that he would.</span> <span id="s982">She had to, at that time, you were not allowed to drive a car anymore.</span> <span id="s983">She had to rent a taxi, drive with this kid with the broken arm to Beuthen.</span> <span id="s984">He arrived here in the U.S; with a cast.</span> <span id="s985">You know he wanted to show “I am class’ and then later!</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q; After five years of intimidation he gave in?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: Right.</span> <span id="s988">Although I believe that he could have done that without recrimination, but he said, “I don’t care, why should I?</span> <span id="s989">Why should I take any chances,” and so on.</span> <span id="s990">In the beginning he wanted to show that he was a man of class.</span> <span id="s991">But that was the situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">This is the fourth interview with Dr. Hans Liebermann in his home.</span> <span id="s993">It is Wednesday 20, 1978--5: PM.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: It has been three weeks since we last talked, and, at the end of the last interview we were talking about the beginning repression.</span> <span id="s995">You made one statement that I would like to get you to elaborate on a little bit, and that was that Upper Silesia was protected by a treaty.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: The Treaty of Geneva.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: By the Treaty of Geneva and that the anti-Semitic laws, the Nuremberg laws….</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: Were not enforced until 1937, when this treaty had lapsed.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: Now, was there any attempt to enforce it before the treaty ended.</span> <span id="s1000">In the realm of higher politics, were you aware of any Nazi attempt to try to do away with the treaty before 1937?</span> <span id="s1001">Did it come to a natural death, or did Hitler just simply start not observing the terms of the treaty?</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: I will tell you that Upper Silesia was such a small territory that it really did not matter and the Nazis, knowing that this treaty was to expire in a year or two or three, they let it go.</span> <span id="s1003">But, unofficially you know, you could not go to a picture show, you could not go to a restaurant, after 1935.</span> <span id="s1004">If you did not meet at one’s home, if there were any cultural or other events, it had to be in the synagogue of the city.</span> <span id="s1005">In Europe, each city had one congregation and one synagogue, that is every Jewish congregation had one synagogue and there were cultural events.</span> <span id="s1006">There were, you know, a lot of Jewish artists who were cut out, and as long as they still stayed in Germany, in order to survive they played, or offered their services to Jewish audiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: So, for all practical purposes, although the treaty was in effect, most of the anti-Semitic actions were taking place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1009">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: You know, it is rather unknown, I never read much about this interim period.</span> <span id="s1011">That is after Hitler came to power and the period of, say, 1937 or 38.</span> <span id="s1012">You are talking about the cultural life that comes to be centered around the synagogues.</span> <span id="s1013">Could you recall some of the types of events you attended, some of the artists whom you heard?</span> <span id="s1014">What kind of programs there were?</span> <span id="s1015">What kind of audiences they had?</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: There were such philosophers, like Martin Buber, who were speaking to the community.</span> <span id="s1017">There were, also, the Rabbis who were prominent, who would speak to a community of literary and philosophical questions.</span> <span id="s1018">You paid an entrance fee as you did when you went to a concert.</span> <span id="s1019">But, gradually, that subsided also, and there was more repressions, there was more emigration.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: Were these operated on a subscription basis?</span> <span id="s1021">Did you buy a season ticket to a cultural series?</span> <span id="s1022">Or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: No!</span> <span id="s1024">That was not, that could not be done.</span> <span id="s1025">You were notified that next week there would be this event.</span> <span id="s1026">You know, in a community under stress, you cannot plan for six months because you did not know what would be in two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: How was the publicity handled?</span> <span id="s1028">By word of mouth?</span> <span id="s1029">By mail?</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: By mail, word of mouth, telephone, etc.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: Was there a congregational newspaper?</span> <span id="s1032">A bulletin or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: That was a small congregation in which we lived.</span> <span id="s1034">I told you that there were 1,000 or so Jewish souls only.</span> <span id="s1035">There was one Jewish newspaper in Germany.</span> <span id="s1036">That was the Hamburger Judische Familienblatt.”</span> <span id="s1037">The Hamburg Jewish Family Newspaper, which I think was published as long as I was there.</span> <span id="s1038">It was just reporting rather innocently certain things which were not offensive, which did not criticize, because otherwise, as you know, newspapers were suppressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: What about religious life within the Jewish community?</span> <span id="s1040">In this period after 1933, would you say that it intensified?</span> <span id="s1041">Or did you not see a change?</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: I come from rather a liberal background.</span> <span id="s1043">We have never been Temple goers every week.</span> <span id="s1044">We usually went to the Synagogue on the High Holy Days, in the evenings and the morning services on Tom Kippur, you know what it is, in the evening and the daylight services.</span> <span id="s1045">But during the year, we were not regular Temple goers.</span> <span id="s1046">And the amazing thing was when Jews could not go anymore to a restaurant or a movie or to a concert or to the theater, the Synagogues were filled on a regular Friday night and for regular Shabbat Services.</span> <span id="s1047">I remember one instance when I came here to Dayton, and Dayton has a rather middle class Jewish community.</span> <span id="s1048">You know, the structure is middle class.</span> <span id="s1049">You have a rather small amount of blue collar workers, there are white collar workers, professionals and business people, and I remember, at that time, I was here for about a year, I was asked to serve on the Religious Committee.</span> <span id="s1050">I want to tell you that I remember the Rabbi who chaired this meeting, said, “You know something has to be done to increase the attendance for Friday night services.</span> <span id="s1051">Since we have just too few congregants who attend services.”</span> <span id="s1052">Then there were different proposals made which I didn’t agree.</span> <span id="s1053">Then the Rabbi said to me, “Hans, what do you have to say?”</span> <span id="s1054">I said, “Actually, I don’t have anything positive to say.</span> <span id="s1055">But I would want to make an observation.</span> <span id="s1056">For years, in Germany the Rabbis were speaking from the pulpit and criticizing the congregation for not attending services, and the Synagogues are empty except on the High Holy Days.</span> <span id="s1057">He castigated the congregation, and so on.</span> <span id="s1058">I went through all that.</span> <span id="s1059">Rabbi, then came a time when on a regular Friday night, the Synagogue was filled so that people were standing in the aisles, and the Rabbis were not happy about that, for that was the time when the Jews could not go to a concert and could not congregate anywhere else but in the Synagogue.</span> <span id="s1060">The Rabbis were not happy about it.</span> <span id="s1061">I hope that this never happens here, in this country.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: So there was a complete intensification of religious life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: I tell you, you cannot call it intensification.</span> <span id="s1064">It was despair.</span> <span id="s1065">It was, for a lot of people, they were thrown out of jobs, they did not know where to go out of the house.</span> <span id="s1066">They could not go to the city parks.</span> <span id="s1067">You could not go for a walk, etc. there were signs, “Jews are not Permitted.”</span> <span id="s1068">So they went to the Synagogue.</span> <span id="s1069">It was not the resurgence of Jewish life, it was just our opportunity to go somewhere.</span> <span id="s1070">You know, it was not a rebirth of the faith.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: Was there a community council in Leibitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: There was a Synagogue and in Europe you went to the Synagogue to pray.</span> <span id="s1073">There was no men’s club, there was no sisterhood.</span> <span id="s1074">There were no social events, it was just to go and pray and that was it.</span> <span id="s1075">There was no community council.</span> <span id="s1076">As I explained to you, the Jewish community in Germany was a middle class, upper middle class, community.</span> <span id="s1077">Whenever there was any need for support for somebody who due to illness, or due to misfortune, could not meet his responsibilities, or did not have enough finds -- that was done privately.</span> <span id="s1078">There was no organization.</span> <span id="s1079">The Rabbi, or some representative, or council of the congregation would come to me and to others, and tell me, “Give me that and that sum, we need it” and that was all!</span> <span id="s1080">They would come to people who could afford it.</span> <span id="s1081">There was no organized charity!</span> <span id="s1082">It may have been in Berlin.</span> <span id="s1083">There it existed, and in the larger communities like Breslau or Frankfurt, but in the small communities, there was no need for organized welfare or charity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: I was wondering, one thing which prompted me to ask this question, in many, perhaps not all, but in many communities with significant Jewish population, after Hitler imposed his will on the people, Judenrats were organized.</span> <span id="s1085">Now was that an organization which Hitler devised and imposed, or was it an organization which had long existed but which he simply tried to control?</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A: Judenrat is something which was organized very late, after the Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s1087">You know, when there was real need, when people were thrown out of their apartments, when two or three families had to live together, each in one room, and three or four families had to share one kitchen, and they had to live in non-desirable parts of town since their apartments were requisitioned by the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: So it is under the force of this kind of circumstances that the community organizations then began?</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: And began!</span> <span id="s1090">Yes, in the smaller communities!</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: Now, what about your family?</span> <span id="s1092">What about your parents in Beuthen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: My mother died of a heart attack in 1936, and was buried there.</span> <span id="s1094">My father, I hoped to bring him over here, I went first, had my wife and son come later, I told you that, about four months later.</span> <span id="s1095">I had arranged a visit to Cuba, you know, at that time the U.S. closed its doors.</span> <span id="s1096">You know, with these quota arrangements, and there were no quotas in 1939, 40 and so on.</span> <span id="s1097">My father, I got a visa for him to Cuba.</span> <span id="s1098">I had borrowed the money to pay for the visa which was $300,00.</span> <span id="s1099">After I paid for that, and paid for the transportation -- these boats, at that time, left from Portugal to Cuba -- my father was on the train from Upper Silesia via Berlin, Switzerland, Italy, Spain to Portugal.</span> <span id="s1100">It was to leave from there.</span> <span id="s1101">He got sick on the train on the way to Berlin, was taken off the train to the Jewish hospital, apparently with pneumonia, and was there for two days.</span> <span id="s1102">The Jewish hospital was requisitioned by the Nazis and all the patients were put on the train to Theresesienstadt.</span> <span id="s1103">He arrived alive in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1104">I heard through communications via Switzerland, that when he arrived he saw there not his parents, who were deported there already, (parents probably meant relatives rather than parents which is the German meaning) and they told friends in Switzerland by mail, that he died there on the day after he had arrived, which was Yom Kippur day in 1942 or 43, I cannot recall right now, it was in 42, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: What about your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: My brother who had a PH.D degree and was an executive in a big department store, lost his job and went to Austria, where he got an adequate job, and where I went to see him.</span> <span id="s1107">When Hitler came, in order not to be caught there, as an émigré he and his family went across the border to Italy.</span> <span id="s1108">He telephoned with me and I arranged that he could get tickets, he did not want to go to the U.S. I don’t know whether it would have been possible due to the quota system, anyway.</span> <span id="s1109">His wife had relatives in South Africa and he decided to go to South Africa.</span> <span id="s1110">When he got to South Africa, while he was on the boat, they closed the borders against new immigrants1</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: Into South Africa?</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1113">He had only ten days to stay there, and the only alternative for him was to go to Rhodesia, which is north of there.</span> <span id="s1114">He arrived there in the beginning of 1939.</span> <span id="s1115">When the war broke out, he had a German passport, in order not to be put in a prisoner-of-war camp with his family, he volunteered into the army.</span> <span id="s1116">He served in the army, he was 35 or 36.</span> <span id="s1117">Finally, after two years, he became an executive sergeant, a top sergeant, in charge of a prisoner-of-war camp of Italian prisoners.</span> <span id="s1118">One day, he wrote -- you know communications were very poor at that time – that he had been sick in bed for six weeks and he is so annoyed since they all thought that he was malingering when he said that he cannot walk.</span> <span id="s1119">Finally, after seven or eight weeks, he got up and he was again on duty.</span> <span id="s1120">When the war was over, non-British did not get a working permit there.</span> <span id="s1121">After he was in the army for the British, he could not get a working permit there, he wrote me that.</span> <span id="s1122">And, through a friend who had contacts with a Jewish friend here, he managed at that time, there were no regular passenger communications then.</span> <span id="s1123">I could manage to bring him over here and he came over here.</span> <span id="s1124">He was a broken man!</span> <span id="s1125">I sent him to a friend of mine, who is an internist here, and he called me to say, “Did you know, I did not talk to your brother, purposely I did not want to shock him, but he looks terrible.”</span> <span id="s1126">And what he had was a coronary.</span> <span id="s1127">That was not recognized, at that time there were no electrocardiograms and so on.</span> <span id="s1128">They really thought that since they could not hear anything, find anything, he was actually malingering.</span> <span id="s1129">That ate him up and he died here two years later of another coronary.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: What about his family?</span> <span id="s1131">His wife and children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: His wife died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: In Rhodesia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: No, here!</span> <span id="s1135">She died over here of cancer of the uterus.</span> <span id="s1136">As a matter of fact, she was working and called me Sunday afternoon that she is vomiting all day and so on.</span> <span id="s1137">She had been working until Saturday.</span> <span id="s1138">She was a pharmacist.</span> <span id="s1139">So I went over and I admitted her to the hospital and called in a surgeon.</span> <span id="s1140">He said that he had to do an exploratory.</span> <span id="s1141">It was a cancer beyond repair.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: Then she died?</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: And then their children?</span> <span id="s1145">Or child?</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: There were two children.</span> <span id="s1147">That is a confidential affair, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">Q: Now you made statements here and there about your coming to the States and I believe that it is time, in this conversation, that we begin to explore this in some details.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">A: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">Q: How you got here?</span> <span id="s1151">How your family got here?</span> <span id="s1152">Part of this might be a little bit of repetition.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: I believe that I told you that my wife went to Israel and I went to the U.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: No, I did not know that she went to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: Oh!</span> <span id="s1156">I mean visiting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: You said that it was certain things which were beginning to happen in Leibitz towards doctors, certain things which were said and which convinced you that it was time to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">A: Right!</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: Now, when you began to discuss this, what kind of conclusions did you reach, how did you map out what you were going to do?</span> <span id="s1160">And, when did this take place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A; Lotte went on a trip, by boat at that time, to Israel.</span> <span id="s1162">I mean Palestine at that time, and I went to the U.S. as a visitor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: In 1938?</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: In January, 1938, I went to the U.S. on a visitor’s visa of thirty days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: Could we explore this in some details?</span> <span id="s1166">By what route, what ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: I went by train to Hamburg, went on a German boat, the Europa, to New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: Was there any difficulty, at this time, early 1938, to travel like this?</span> <span id="s1169">Did you have any trouble getting a visa?</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: At that time?</span> <span id="s1171">No!</span> <span id="s1172">No!</span> <span id="s1173">I went to the American Consul and he said, “What guarantee do you give me that you will come back?”</span> <span id="s1174">I wanted a visitor’s visa.</span> <span id="s1175">I said, “My wife and my child are here.”</span> <span id="s1176">“That is all!”</span> <span id="s1177">That is what he said to me.</span> <span id="s1178">I said, “I am going to come back;” for I did not, could not make any provisions to go away.</span> <span id="s1179">I just went for the purpose of getting an affidavit for I did not have any contacts which I could use by mail.</span> <span id="s1180">I arrived here and I managed to get an affidavit of support.</span> <span id="s1181">This affidavit, you know, people were afraid to give affidavits of support.</span> <span id="s1182">Nobody has ever been held responsible for support -- for the Jewish community always took the responsibility off the individuals.</span> <span id="s1183">I was here, and I looked around from New York.</span> <span id="s1184">I had a fraternity brother in Cleveland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q:” Who had been trained in medical school with you in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">A: Yes, and who lived in Germany proper, and was deprived of his license, although he was also in the army earlier.</span> <span id="s1187">So he came here one and a half or two years before me and he told me not to stay in New York since it was overcrowded.</span> <span id="s1188">That I should come to Ohio.</span> <span id="s1189">I visited here in Ohio.</span> <span id="s1190">I remember that I went by bus since I didn’t have enough money to go by train.</span> <span id="s1191">I mapped out, as much as I could as a matter of fact, he told me that the best I could do was to go to Columbus and register here, and be ready so that “when you come here you can take the next examination, and they see that you have been here, in the country.”</span> <span id="s1192">They did not ask me whether I was here permanently and so on, I just registered and then, after three and a half weeks, I went back to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: By the Europa from New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: Yes, yes, that was again on the same boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: Now, could I ask, were there many people on the boat doing the same thing you were doing?</span> <span id="s1196">Were there a large number of Jews on the Europa at that time coming to the states to make plans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A; There were some and there were some who had immigration visas who could stay here, but there were not many Jews on this boat anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: Was it a German ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: It was a German ship.</span> <span id="s1200">On the boat they were courteous and correct, decent help.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q: That is what I was going to ask.</span> <span id="s1202">You were not segregated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A: The waiters, everything was all right.</span> <span id="s1204">It was January 1938.</span> <span id="s1205">I came back at the end of January 1938 with an affidavit of support.</span> <span id="s1206">From Hamburg I went to Berlin and I made an application with the affidavit.</span> <span id="s1207">I was told that it would take about one year until I could get a visa, by the secretary there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: Now this was at the American Embassy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: Ah, yes!</span> <span id="s1210">And there I was shocked.</span> <span id="s1211">I was really shocked.</span> <span id="s1212">I was told by a man in Berlin, a distant relative, that if this secretary who is making these appointments gets a piece of candy with a $100 note, I can get the visa in three months.</span> <span id="s1213">So I said, “I don’t want to be guilty here of bribery, or anything.”</span> <span id="s1214">And he said, “I did this for three or four people already.”</span> <span id="s1215">He had a box of candy and he went to this woman who lived in Berlin, an American woman.</span> <span id="s1216">Maybe I should not have been shocked, but I really was.</span> <span id="s1217">Yes!</span> <span id="s1218">And this man came out of there and he told me that he was asked, “How many are going to immigrate?”</span> <span id="s1219">And he said, “Three, Dr. Liebermann, his wife and his son!”</span> <span id="s1220">“Three, that will be $300.”</span> <span id="s1221">300 marks, marks, excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: A mark at that time was worth how much?</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: Two and a half marks was worth one dollar at that time.</span> <span id="s1224">So, he didn’t have the money with him at the time, so he came back and gave it to her.</span> <span id="s1225">So, I got an appointment for vaccination, medical examination and the visa for May.</span> <span id="s1226">In the meantime it was March.</span> <span id="s1227">So the visa took until the beginning of June, that was three months.</span> <span id="s1228">I got the appointment and we got the visa, and I left with the next boat, leaving all the other things to Lotte.</span> <span id="s1229">For, you know, I was afraid for my life, I told you the incident which had happened with the Gestapo….</span> <span id="s1230">!</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Q: The Gestapo!</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">A: The Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1233">I arrived here on the sixth of July, this time it was on the Bremen, also a German boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: Out of Hamburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: Out of Hamburg, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: On the trip over in late June or early July, was there any difference of treatment by that time, or was it still the same courtesy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: It was stern, correct, courteous and so on.</span> <span id="s1238">I arrived here with two suitcases.</span> <span id="s1239">I was standing there, on the pier.</span> <span id="s1240">I had a cousin’s wife who knew that I was coming.</span> <span id="s1241">She did pick me up and I stayed for about four days in New York.</span> <span id="s1242">I stayed at a hotel on Broadway and 53rd Street,.</span> <span id="s1243">Hotel Bryant.</span> <span id="s1244">It was a hotel with beds, and I paid, it was a fourth class hotel, $6.00 for the week.</span> <span id="s1245">Yes.</span> <span id="s1246">Then I called the sponsor who had given me the affidavit.</span> <span id="s1247">I called him when I got back and I assured him that I would never bother him!</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: Yes, I was wondering who that sponsor was, it was a distant relative, wasn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s1250">Did I tell you this story?</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s1252">Who was it?</span> <span id="s1253">Did he live in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1255">It was a man whom my father had talked about.</span> <span id="s1256">Before I left, my father said to me, “We have one man over there who must be a very wealthy man, and I will write him a letter and maybe he will give you an affidavit.”</span> <span id="s1257">I tried for three days to get hold of him.</span> <span id="s1258">On the fourth day, again and again and again.</span> <span id="s1259">At that time it was five cents a call, and on the fourth day he was available.</span> <span id="s1260">He said, “I got the letter.</span> <span id="s1261">I want you to come to my home on Sunday, my secretary will tell you all the details.”</span> <span id="s1262">That was, that I should go on Sunday at one thirty to a penthouse apartment on 5th Avenue facing Central Park.</span> <span id="s1263">After I was screened downstairs, I went up in the elevator and a colored butler opened the door, let me in.</span> <span id="s1264">He said, “Mr. Marcus,” that was his name, “will see you.</span> <span id="s1265">Sit down.”</span> <span id="s1266">So I waited.</span> <span id="s1267">He came in and he said, “Unfortunately I have no time.</span> <span id="s1268">I have an urgent meeting downtown, but I can give you a lift if you want.</span> <span id="s1269">We have to leave right away.”</span> <span id="s1270">So we left.</span> <span id="s1271">In the car he said to me, “Where do you stay?”</span> <span id="s1272">I said, “at the Hotel Bryant, 53rd and Broadway.”</span> <span id="s1273">He said to his chauffeur, listen to this, he said to his chauffeur, “This gentleman will get out at 57th and Broadway.”</span> <span id="s1274">And to me he said, “And then you walk these few blocks.</span> <span id="s1275">You should not stay in such an obscure place.”</span> <span id="s1276">Really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">Q: How did that make you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: Listen, but he told me in the car that he would give me the affidavit.</span> <span id="s1279">And he told me to be up, do you know who he was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: He was, in 1938, the Executive Vice President of the Bendix Corporation.</span> <span id="s1282">He told me to be up, in his office, on the 48th floor of the RCA building.</span> <span id="s1283">I told him that I had all the papers to be filled out and the only thing he had to have was from his accountant, a photostatic copy of his last year’s tax return.</span> <span id="s1284">That would be from 1937.</span> <span id="s1285">I remember that I came in, I had to wait, then he came in and he asked me all the questions, and so on.</span> <span id="s1286">The next line was, “My income, my taxable income, last year was,” he looked at me and I said, “Mr. Marcus, I am not interested in knowing what your income is.</span> <span id="s1287">If you want, skip this line and we will finish it and you will finish this line and seal the envelope.</span> <span id="s1288">That is alright with me.”</span> <span id="s1289">And he said, “Doesn’t matter.”</span> <span id="s1290">That is the first time I saw an American Income Tax return.</span> <span id="s1291">This man had an income, a taxable income of $81,300.</span> <span id="s1292">In 1937!</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: That was a fortune.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">A: Pardon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">Q: That was a fortune.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1297">Anyway, I thanked him and I said, “Mr. Marcus, I hope that I will be here in a few months and I will call you.</span> <span id="s1298">If you want to see me, I will be glad to see you.</span> <span id="s1299">If you don’t want to see me, you will never hear from me, and I will never bother you.”</span> <span id="s1300">He said, “OK.”</span> <span id="s1301">I left with the letter and with the affidavit, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">Q: Was he a distant relative?</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">A: Wait a minute!</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Q: OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">A: When I came home.</span> <span id="s1306">Lotte waited for me in Hamburg, and we went to Opeln since there were her parents.</span> <span id="s1307">When I told Lotte’s father about my experience he was furious.</span> <span id="s1308">I said, “What is the matter?”</span> <span id="s1309">I think that he said, “You know, I did not want to prejudice you, but I have to tell you that is really it.</span> <span id="s1310">I did not want you to meet this man with a prejudice, but I want to tell you how they got to America.</span> <span id="s1311">In 1899, his father came to my father and asked him for a loan for one week, for 20,000 marks, and said that he had a business transaction and he has a reason why he does not want to go to a bank.</span> <span id="s1312">He was never heard from anymore and he went with the 20,000 marks to the U.S. I had to give him credit that he gave me the affidavit, but I did not get a cup of coffee or anything from him.</span> <span id="s1313">Of course Lotte’s father was furious and he did not want to tell me that before.</span> <span id="s1314">That was never paid back, or anything like that.</span> <span id="s1315">And that had been a lot of money, 20,000 gold marks!</span> <span id="s1316">You know, in Europe it was a lot of money.</span> <span id="s1317">Anyway, when I arrived here, and I called, miraculously his secretary said, “Just a minute please” when I told her who I was and that I wanted to speak to Mr. Marcus.</span> <span id="s1318">Then I waited for about two minutes on the phone.</span> <span id="s1319">Then she came back and said, “I am sorry.</span> <span id="s1320">I forgot that Mr. Marcus left yesterday for a trip overseas, and will not be back for three weeks.”</span> <span id="s1321">And that was it.</span> <span id="s1322">Out.</span> <span id="s1323">I wrote him a letter and never heard from him.</span> <span id="s1324">You know that these are all experiences!</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">Q: As they say, it takes all kinds!</span> <span id="s1326">What was the point of Mrs. Liebermann’s going to Palestine?</span> <span id="s1327">Was she looking for another alternative in case your’s didn’t work out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">A: At that time, it was very attractive to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1329">For one reason, you could, under an agreement between Nazi Germany and Britain, the British owed the German government a large sum of money and you could pay to the German Reich Bank, you know, that is the Federal Reserve Bank, you could pay either 10,000 or 20,000 marks, which was the equivalent of $5,000 or $10,000, and you could be credited for that in the British bank in Palestine.</span> <span id="s1330">Furthermore, you did not have to take an examination with a German license, you could practice wherever you wanted to.</span> <span id="s1331">But, there were plenty of physicians, there were no hospitals.</span> <span id="s1332">Most of the physicians were doing other work, like chicken farms and orange groves and working.</span> <span id="s1333">There was no need to practice medicine.</span> <span id="s1334">There were no opportunities, at that time.</span> <span id="s1335">That was 1938, that was ten years before the State of Israel was founded and since I was an ear, nose and throat specialist and I wanted to practice medicine, and I had never been a really nationalistic Jew.</span> <span id="s1336">I told you of my assimilation in Germany.</span> <span id="s1337">I came to the U.S. you see, and Lotte went there, our son was with the grandparents, while Lotte was in Israel and I was in America, and we decided on America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">Q: This tape is almost up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">This is the fifth interview with Dr. Hans Liebermann in his home.</span> <span id="s1340">Today is September 26, 1978 Last week, when I talked with you, you were detailing to me all of the steps that you had to go through, all the procedures you had to go through in order to leave Germany.</span> <span id="s1341">You had described your first trip to the U.s. and Mrs. Liebermann’s trip to Israel, Palestine, to look over the possibility of settling there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: Practicing!</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">Q: Practicing there.</span> <span id="s1344">Then you found the affidavit and went back to Germany.</span> <span id="s1345">When did you arrive back in Germany from that first trip?</span> <span id="s1346">Do you remember?</span> <span id="s1347">What were the dates?</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">A: End of February 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q; How long was it before you left Germany permanently?</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">A; I left I think on the 28th or 29th of June 1938.</span> <span id="s1351">I got the visa, one week earlier and I left on the first boat for which I could get a ticket.</span> <span id="s1352">That was within a week since, at that time, as I told you before, our lives, especially those of those men who were still working, etc., were endangered.</span> <span id="s1353">I left the finishing of all the transactions, and the government, I left to Lotte.</span> <span id="s1354">I knew that she would be able to settle that.</span> <span id="s1355">She felt relieved that I was gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: Then you arrived in the U.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A: On July 5th, 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">Q: How long was it before Mrs. Liebermann and your son joined you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">A: They came here at the end of October.</span> <span id="s1360">I think on the 30th or 31st of October 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">Q: We have not mentioned your son.</span> <span id="s1362">When was he born?</span> <span id="s1363">What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A; His name is Franz and he was born in 1929.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q: So he was nine years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: He was nine years old.</span> <span id="s1367">When this Hitler affair came out, he could not go to public school anymore, and there was a makeshift Jewish school made up for the Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s1368">I think that in the entire school were maybe 100 or 150 kids.</span> <span id="s1369">That was all makeshift.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">Q: Yes, volunteer teachers?</span> <span id="s1371">And classrooms?</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">A: Right!</span> <span id="s1373">Right!</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q: Would it be more appropriate to talk to Mrs. Liebermann about these details of leaving?</span> <span id="s1375">The bureaucracy and the red tape!</span> <span id="s1376">Or do you have some indication about that?</span> <span id="s1377">You weren’t there, and you left that up to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: Yes, I am.</span> <span id="s1379">I know all about that.</span> <span id="s1380">I leave that entirely up to you.</span> <span id="s1381">What I want to say is that for every piece, you see this is European furniture and this is European furniture.</span> <span id="s1382">For every piece you were allowed to take out you had to pay to the government, once over the price which was paid for the furniture.</span> <span id="s1383">And since assets of Jewish citizens, Jewish people in Germany, were frozen anyway, you could not withdraw more than what you needed for your daily sustenance.</span> <span id="s1384">It made no difference if you paid for the furniture over again since you could fortunately pay with German money for the transportation.</span> <span id="s1385">So it made no difference, the money was no good anyway, so it was used up for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">Q: Did you bring out a lot of your furniture, or just selected pieces?</span> <span id="s1387">Did you leave most of it behind?</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">A: No, we brought out most of it, since it did not matter.</span> <span id="s1389">Do you understand the point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">A: The money, you could not withdraw.</span> <span id="s1392">I think I told you once, when the bank, out of sheer chicanery, denounced me to the Gestapo, that I withdrew 10,000 marks.</span> <span id="s1393">Remember.</span> <span id="s1394">And the Gestapo was in my house the next day.</span> <span id="s1395">But, it did not matter, we took everything which was worthwhile and, which we thought may be useful, we brought to this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">Q: Were a lot of your acquaintances and friends leaving as you were, or would you say that most of the people you associated with were staying?</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">A: Maybe fifty percent of the people managed to get out.</span> <span id="s1398">There were other people, we had close friends, there were two attorneys who lived across the street, and were very close friends, who were so assimilated and both of them were army veterans from WWI, and they were convinced that nothing could happen to them.</span> <span id="s1399">You know, the German Jews were really assimilated to an extent, so were Lotte’s parents, you will probably hear, I told you the story already.</span> <span id="s1400">But, they thought that nothing could happen to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">Q; Did most of the people you know, most of those leaving were associated with, choose to go to the U.S., or did they just disperse in all different directions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">A: They went wherever they could get a visa to go.</span> <span id="s1403">Many of them went to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1404">You know, as I explained to you, in Palestine you didn’t have to take any examinations, there was no language barrier, since the use of the modern Hebrew language was not yet established.</span> <span id="s1405">Most people in Palestine, at that time, were speaking either German or Polish or Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1406">You know, that the revitalization of Hebrew as the modern language came up later and that really is a great achievement, to transform a classical language which was to a lot of us, only known as a praying medium, into a conversational language.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">Q: This, I never thought about, but that is a remarkable achievement!</span> <span id="s1408">This is a question which I am just asking for impressions.</span> <span id="s1409">It just occurred to me as we are talking.</span> <span id="s1410">Could you say that most of the people, most of the Jews, who were able to get out were professional people, doctors, lawyers, pharmacists, teachers, and so forth, or was there a mixture?</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A: There were all kinds of people.</span> <span id="s1412">You know, for some people it was easier for they had relatives abroad, and they got help from people who were in Palestine, from people who were in England, to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1413">You know that is a very tragic affair.</span> <span id="s1414">Those people who went to Czechoslovakia and France and Holland and Belgium and England, and so on, when these countries, at that time, and Austria, I told you about my brother, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">A: When they were overrun, they were caught again!</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">Q: Now when you got to the U.S. the second time, permanently, in July 1938, you stayed for a while in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">A: I stayed in New York for three days!</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">Q: And then came to Dayton?</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A: To Cleveland!</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">Q: To Cleveland!</span> <span id="s1422">All right!</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">A: I told you that I had a friend there who told me not to stay in New York or Cleveland.</span> <span id="s1424">I told you that on my first trip!</span> <span id="s1425">I was in Cleveland also in order to find out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">Q: You took the exam on your first trip didn’t you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">Q: In Columbus?</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A: No!</span> <span id="s1430">I registered!</span> <span id="s1431">I registered at that time.</span> <span id="s1432">I took the examination in December.</span> <span id="s1433">The 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th of December.</span> <span id="s1434">I took the Ohio State Board and had to wait for six weeks for the result.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">Q: Did you live with your friend in Cleveland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">A: No, I had a furnished room.</span> <span id="s1437">I had a furnished room for which I paid at that time, that is before your time!</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q: No, it is not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">A: How old are you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">Q: 46.</span> <span id="s1441">I was born in 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">A: All right!</span> <span id="s1443">Almost!</span> <span id="s1444">You were a little boy.</span> <span id="s1445">I paid at that time, for a small room on the fourth floor of an apartment house, of course there were no elevators and so on, $2.50 a week with breakfast.</span> <span id="s1446">I usually went down, there was a little delicatessen store, and for lunch I had a bologna or salami sandwich with a cup of coffee, and this fellow gave me an extra slice of bread, I paid fifteen cents.</span> <span id="s1447">And the same thing, I paid twenty cents for dinner.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q: How did you spend your days?</span> <span id="s1449">What did you do those days in Cleveland when you weren’t practicing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">A: I had to prepare for the State Boards.</span> <span id="s1451">I had to learn conversational English.</span> <span id="s1452">I did not take any lessons, but I listened to the radio and gradually it became better and better.</span> <span id="s1453">I was spending all my time in the Medical Library since I did not have any money to buy books, and reference books, you could not take out of the Library.</span> <span id="s1454">So usually I had breakfast at around 7.00 or 7.30, I went to the Library and I was sitting there until lunchtime.</span> <span id="s1455">Two blocks away was this little Delicatessen, I had lunch and then went back to the Library.</span> <span id="s1456">In the morning I usually started to study new stuff, which I had to review, and later, in the evening, in the late afternoon, you know, when you were not so receptive any more, I restudied what I had before in sequence so that I had all that arranged up there in an orderly fashion.</span> <span id="s1457">And I did that six days a week!</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">Q: Three or four months?</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">A: August, September, October, November and on the 5th of December, the 4th or 5th of December, I started my examination.</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">Q: In that period, from the time you got to Cleveland until the time you took the exams, while you were studying in the Library, did you have much contact with the Cleveland Medical Group?</span> <span id="s1461">What I am saying, were the doctors friendly or did they keep you at arms length?</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">A: They kept me away.</span> <span id="s1463">I think that they were afraid that if they got friendly or something, they might feel obligated to me and I may feel that I wanted to borrow some money or something like that.</span> <span id="s1464">They were correct.</span> <span id="s1465">There was, for instance, one fellow who was a Neurologist who did a lot of research work, he came in three or four times a week.</span> <span id="s1466">You know, I was at that time a novelty in Ohio.</span> <span id="s1467">He would come up and talk to me for ten minutes.</span> <span id="s1468">He wanted to know about medical problems, and how they are being handled, and professional problems in Germany, and how things are being run, hospital-wise, and so on.</span> <span id="s1469">And I remember that on the 30th of September, I was standing, taking a book from the shelf and this man came in and said, “How are you today?”</span> <span id="s1470">and I said, “I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1471">Today there is a meeting in Germany and this may mean war and my wife and my boy are still over there, and I really don’t know!”</span> <span id="s1472">You know what he did?</span> <span id="s1473">He turned around, walked away and never talked to me as long as I was sitting there.</span> <span id="s1474">Why, I was sitting there for two more months.</span> <span id="s1475">He came to the Library, but nothing more.</span> <span id="s1476">From that I learned that when someone asks you “How are you today?”</span> <span id="s1477">you say, “Fine.”</span> <span id="s1478">For that is a phrase which is not an inquiry.</span> <span id="s1479">You have to learn these things.</span> <span id="s1480">Today you laugh about this incident, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">Q: But it hurts at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1483">I don’t want to say it hurts, it just was not meant, it was just a phrase.</span> <span id="s1484">It was not meant, and this fellow was not interested in me, he was interested in gathering information.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">Q: Did you have any contact at all with Mrs. Liebermann during that period of time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">A: By letters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">Q: No phone calls?</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">A: No phone calls.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">Q: Were the letters censored?</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s1491">They were opened and marked that they were censored.</span> <span id="s1492">Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">Q: When did you have assurance that she was going to be able to get out?</span> <span id="s1494">When did you know that she was going to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">A: I tell you, she had the visa.</span> <span id="s1496">She got the visa with me.</span> <span id="s1497">This visa was good for a year.</span> <span id="s1498">She had the visa and I didn’t have any doubt that she would come.</span> <span id="s1499">She told me one month before that she had booked on that boat and that they would arrive here, they arrived here on October 24, 1038.</span> <span id="s1500">And we went back to Cleveland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">Q: You met her in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">A: I met her in New York so that she had not to go to Ellis Island.</span> <span id="s1503">Somebody had to meet her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">Q: Now when she went back to Cleveland, did you continue in your little room?</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">A: No.</span> <span id="s1506">Then we got an apartment, a one bedroom apartment, where there was a bedroom, and there was a couch in which our kid was sleeping in the living room.</span> <span id="s1507">And there we lived.</span> <span id="s1508">I rented it on October 15, until the middle of January, when we left Cleveland for Dayton.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">Q: When you took the exams were you frightened?</span> <span id="s1510">Did you have assurance that you had done well?</span> <span id="s1511">Did you feel that you had done well?</span> <span id="s1512">Or were you just totally unknowing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1514">I don’t know whether you are interested in these details, I told you about this man?</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: Yes, I am.</span> <span id="s1516">Yes, I am.</span> <span id="s1517">It all has something to say about your readjustment and how quickly this comes and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">A: You know, when I came to Columbus I stayed at the National Hotel.</span> <span id="s1519">The room was $3.00 a night.</span> <span id="s1520">And the examinations were in the ballroom of the National Hotel, which was a vast room and there were 100 men who took the examination.</span> <span id="s1521">That was in winter.</span> <span id="s1522">In summer there are more!</span> <span id="s1523">You know, at the end of the school year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">A: And then we were sitting each in front of a card table .</span> <span id="s1526">You know a bridge table.</span> <span id="s1527">And they were about ten feet apart.</span> <span id="s1528">You know the examination was two days.</span> <span id="s1529">The written examination for one day and the oral examination.</span> <span id="s1530">For the written examination you were handed questionnaires.</span> <span id="s1531">Most of the questions were essay questions, not multiple choice, but essay questions.</span> <span id="s1532">Where you had to discuss things.</span> <span id="s1533">There I was, rather confused when I got this essay, the first subject was Chemistry, Bio-chemistry.</span> <span id="s1534">Everyone started writing and I was reading and analyzing the questions.</span> <span id="s1535">You know they were so trained for this examination that they started.</span> <span id="s1536">I thought, what is the matter with me?</span> <span id="s1537">Anyway, I thought that I did rather well.</span> <span id="s1538">Also, in the oral examination.</span> <span id="s1539">I think that I told you this story.</span> <span id="s1540">That the examiner was so curious about what was going on in Germany that he did not ask me any questions about obstetrics.</span> <span id="s1541">When the examination was over, I was waiting at the hotel, in front of the hotel to take the streetcar to Union Station, which was about one mile away.</span> <span id="s1542">There was a man standing next to me who said, “You are a physician, I can speak German to you.”</span> <span id="s1543">I said, “Yes, Ja” and he said, ‘For I think I saw you during the examination.”</span> <span id="s1544">I didn’t know anybody there.</span> <span id="s1545">And he said to me, “How do you think you did?</span> <span id="s1546">Do you think you passed?”</span> <span id="s1547">I said, “I really think I won.”</span> <span id="s1548">I really think that I was doing alright.”</span> <span id="s1549">He said, “You know, how often did you take the examination already?”</span> <span id="s1550">“It’s the first time!”</span> <span id="s1551">‘You know the first time I also thought I did!</span> <span id="s1552">And here I am, the third time today.</span> <span id="s1553">I hope they will have pity on me and they will pass me this time.</span> <span id="s1554">I don’t think that I did better than the first.”</span> <span id="s1555">This man was an Associate Professor of Neurology from the University of Hamburg.</span> <span id="s1556">His name was Kaplan.</span> <span id="s1557">And you know, I was just lucky that I passed.</span> <span id="s1558">As a matter of fact, this man passed also.</span> <span id="s1559">But here, in Ohio, it was an unwritten law that not more than fifty percent of the foreign graduates passed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">Q: How long was it after you took the exam, before you came to Dayton?</span> <span id="s1561">A month?</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">A: No, I came earlier.</span> <span id="s1563">You know, I studied, I was in Dayton already on my first visit.</span> <span id="s1564">Since my friend I had suggested it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">Q: In Cleveland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">A: In Cleveland, he told me, he was right, that it would be better to be in a smaller town where you get to be known and integrate better than in a large city.</span> <span id="s1567">He had to struggle in Cleveland.</span> <span id="s1568">When I looked at the Medical Directory, I found that the youngest ear, nose, throat man, in Dayton at that time, was seventeen years older than I was.</span> <span id="s1569">So I thought that may be a good business.</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">Q: I mean, you took the examination in early December.</span> <span id="s1571">It was January when you moved to Dayton?</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1573">End of January!</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">Q: End of January.</span> <span id="s1575">Did you know anyone here in Dayton at that time, at all?</span> <span id="s1576">Did you have any contact?</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">A: I was referred to a doctor here.</span> <span id="s1578">His name was Olch, and his wife was very nice, very nice to us.</span> <span id="s1579">We stayed at the Miami hotel, which does not exist anymore today, for three days.</span> <span id="s1580">We rented a small apartment here, on Grand Avenue, which cost at that time, I believe $35.00.</span> <span id="s1581">we ordered our furniture which was then in Cleveland to be shipped to Dayton and furnished that.</span> <span id="s1582">I opened, I got an office -- I told you about my difficulties.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">Q: No, I have no idea, about them, I read about them in the article which was written about you in the Dayton Jewish Chronicle, some years ago.</span> <span id="s1584">But, you haven’t really told me about them -- if you prefer not to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">A: No!</span> <span id="s1586">No!</span> <span id="s1587">Listen!</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">Q: I would like to get this on the tape, if I may.</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">A: For instance, the Fidelity Building refused to let me in, although they had plenty – you know, that at that time, the occupancy of the downtown buildings was about 60% to 70%.</span> <span id="s1590">There were plenty of empty rooms.</span> <span id="s1591">But the doctors!</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q: On what basis?</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">Q: Why would they not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">A: Foreigner!</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: Foreigner, not Jewish?</span> <span id="s1597">Just foreigner.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">A: I don’t know!</span> <span id="s1599">I don’t know!</span> <span id="s1600">Probably both.</span> <span id="s1601">I did not want to go to the Reibold Building; and, in the Harries building they offered me an office .</span> <span id="s1602">I paid $75.00 a month for the office.</span> <span id="s1603">As a matter of fact, there was a medical office there before and they just had to put in one more wall, to divide two rooms, that is one room into two, and I stayed in that office about four years, and then I went to larger offices, in the same building.</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">Q: A foreigner coming into a strange city, a foreigner, or a medical doctor coming into a strange city, how does he spread the word that he is here and what his specialty is?</span> <span id="s1605">What does he do?</span> <span id="s1606">Put an announcement in the newspaper?</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">A: I was advised not to put an announcement in, in order not to aggravate my situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">Q: Who advised you not to do that?</span> <span id="s1609">Someone here in Dayton?</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">Q: How would this have aggravated your situation/?</span> <span id="s1612">I don’t understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">A: You know, at the Reibold Building the doctors threatened me that they will move out if they let me in.</span> <span id="s1614">So, I could not go to the Fidelity Building.</span> <span id="s1615">I applied for privileges in the three hospitals.</span> <span id="s1616">I don’t know, did we talk about that before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">Q: No!</span> <span id="s1618">No!</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">A: I did that in January, and that was never answered.</span> <span id="s1620">I was here about three to four weeks, when a doctor, a Catholic, Mike Healy, called me one day and said to me, “Dr. Liebermann, I heard that you were here, I would like to know you.</span> <span id="s1621">I would like to know who you are, what you are, how you are, and so on.</span> <span id="s1622">Would you come to my office?”</span> <span id="s1623">“When?”</span> <span id="s1624">and we talked for about half an hour, and then this man said to me, “Dr., I feel I heard about all these things, that the hospitals did not answer you, that you could not get into the Fidelity building.</span> <span id="s1625">That they would not rent to you.</span> <span id="s1626">I fear that we have to act like Christians.”</span> <span id="s1627">You know, in a way it is funny to act like Christians meaning to act like human beings.</span> <span id="s1628">But you know that is, said.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">Q: A way of speech.</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">A: A way of speech.</span> <span id="s1631">And he said, “I am going to talk that over and find out and I will probably call you within a week.”</span> <span id="s1632">And within a week, three to four days later, he called me and asked me if I would come to his office again.</span> <span id="s1633">So I came.</span> <span id="s1634">and he said, “Now, listen, of course you cannot exist in Dayton without hospital facilities, and you cannot develop a practice in Dayton, and that is what I meant when I said that we have to act like Christians.</span> <span id="s1635">I talked to the Mother Superior at Good Samaritan Hospital,” he was the Chief of Staff, “and I want you to know, I want you to contact her.</span> <span id="s1636">Make an appointment to see her, the Mother Superior there, and I, will make arrangements that you can get patients in there.</span> <span id="s1637">But, please, don’t mention me here to anybody.”</span> <span id="s1638">So, I called the Mother Superior.</span> <span id="s1639">She told me to come out.</span> <span id="s1640">She told me the same thing which Dr. Healy had said, and she said to me, “Doctor, if you need a bed here,” as a matter of fact, I want to interrupt myself here, to tell you this.</span> <span id="s1641">Do you know the average occupancy rate in the Dayton hospitals at that time, without any Blue Cross, Medicare, and other insurance was 55% and when, later on, I was ready to send a patient home, the floor supervisor, several times came to me and whispered, “This patient is a mother of three children and rather weak after surgery” and asked whether it would not be advisable to have her here for another two or three days.</span> <span id="s1642">You know, I just want to give you the description of the atmosphere of the times.</span> <span id="s1643">Today, you know, out-out, in order to save costs and so on.</span> <span id="s1644">And she said, ‘If you need a bed, you call me and I will see to it that you get a bed.</span> <span id="s1645">If you need time in surgery, you call me and I will arrange that you get time in surgery.</span> <span id="s1646">But there is one condition, if anybody asks you how did you apply and how did you do it and what did you do, and so on, just turn around and walk away, for we don’t want to have any trouble with the medical profession.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">Q: This bad?</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">Q: This arouses my curiosity in many different ways.</span> <span id="s1650">How many Jewish doctors were here in Dayton at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">A: There were ten Jewish doctors here and they were so insecure that they did not even come near me.</span> <span id="s1652">It was not that there was hostility or so on, they were so insecure at that time, that they did not even come close to me!</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">Q: Not even for courtesy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">A: Nothing!</span> <span id="s1655">Nothing!</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">Q: Why would the medical profession be that hostile?</span> <span id="s1657">Did they think that your credentials were not up to U.S. standards?</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">A: Yes, I got, I showed Dr. Healy my credentials, and my Boards and so on, and so on.</span> <span id="s1659">But, you know, at that time, especially in ear, nose and throat, doctors who wanted to specialize went to Germany or Austria, and here, all of a sudden, came a man who has been there all his life, has been trained there all his life, and that was for them for a lot of them, of course, unjustified fear of whatever you want to call it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">Q: That you were better than they were because you had been….</span> <span id="s1661">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">A: I don’t say that I was better, but you know they all had advertised in the papers “Returned from special training in Vienna, specializing in ear, nose and throat surgery” and so on.</span> <span id="s1663">That was the usual thing, at that time!</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">Q: So you attribute it mainly to their feeling threatened by you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">A: I tell you, it was not only threatened, but also, a foreigner was, you know!</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">Q: An unknown quantity!</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">A: Right!</span> <span id="s1668">And when you realize that the entire quota from Germany was 20,000 visas a year.</span> <span id="s1669">There were a lot of non-Jewish immigrants since, you know, the situation in Germany was not so good economically.</span> <span id="s1670">It was not so good here either, but you know, in Europe, it was always a saying, “You know, in America, the money grows on trees, you just have to pick it up!”</span> <span id="s1671">That is really what the European thought.</span> <span id="s1672">America was for them something unattainable, in European countries, more progressive, more enterprising, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">Q: Where then does the break come?</span> <span id="s1674">Dr. Healy provides you with some slight break, and the Mother Superior at the hospital provides you with one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">A: Right!</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">Q: Where do the patients come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">A: I got patients from the Sisters from Good Samarian Hospital.</span> <span id="s1678">In the beginning, I did not get any patients from Jewish doctors, but there were two or three Catholic doctors besides Dr. Healy who sent me patients occasionally, and so on.</span> <span id="s1679">It goes so far, that during the first year, I had sometimes two or three days where I did not have a patient, and then I had one patient and then I may have had, the next day, two patients, and then no patients, so that by the end of the year, I had collected $2,200,00.</span> <span id="s1680">That was my collection from the office.</span> <span id="s1681">And then something spectacular happened, which was meant, rather to destroy me than to help me.</span> <span id="s1682">In March, I was here for a couple of months, the President of the Medical Society, did I ever tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">Q: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">A: Called me and said to me, “I want to know you” and so on, and so on.</span> <span id="s1685">And during the course of the conversation, he said to me, “Why don’t you apply for membership in the Medical Society?”</span> <span id="s1686">And I said, “You know, Dr. Salz,” that was his name, “I have been here only a couple of months and I think, before I apply, I should give the medical profession an opportunity to know and see what I am doing, how I am doing, who I am’ and so on.</span> <span id="s1687">And he said, “I think we rather want you under our jurisdiction and I want you to apply.</span> <span id="s1688">On the second floor, get a form so I went down and came back, filled it out.</span> <span id="s1689">he said, ‘I am going to sponsor you!”</span> <span id="s1690">That was in March.</span> <span id="s1691">In August, I had not heard from the Medical Society yet.</span> <span id="s1692">So I called Dr. Salz and I was thinking, maybe he is embarrassed, he does not want, he may be afraid if he sticks his neck out people may, the other doctors may not refer any work to him.</span> <span id="s1693">So, I called him, and I said, “Dr. Salz, I did not hear anything about my application for membership in the Medical Society and, if you change your mind, if you don’t want to submit it, please tear it up and that will be the end of it.’</span> <span id="s1694">He said once I sign it, it is signed, you can pick it up here in the office.</span> <span id="s1695">So I picked it up and took it to the Medical Society.</span> <span id="s1696">That was in August.</span> <span id="s1697">And, one night, no one Saturday morning, the last Saturday morning, the meeting of the Medical Society has always been the fourth Friday of the month, I hear that my membership has been rejected, and what has been going on was that at this meeting, an amendment was passed that citizenship is required for membership in the Medical Society.</span> <span id="s1698">And, without giving me a chance to withdraw my application, in the same meeting, they voted me down.</span> <span id="s1699">And, that was front page news.</span> <span id="s1700">“German Doctor refused Membership in the Medical Society.”</span> <span id="s1701">In an interview of another ear, nose and throat man, his name was, oh, I don’t get his name right now, an interview with a reporter, also in the paper the following morning, “These foreign doctors don’t amount to anything and they cannot become members of the Medical society for at least five or ten years, for they have to learn American ethics of Medicine.”</span> <span id="s1702">Wait!</span> <span id="s1703">Am I too long?</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">Q: No!</span> <span id="s1705">Go ahead!</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">A: At around 11.00 A.M. on this Saturday morning, the same reporter called me and he wanted to talk to me.</span> <span id="s1707">I told him that I could not see him before 5.00 P.M. that afternoon.</span> <span id="s1708">You know why?</span> <span id="s1709">I had nobody whom I could ask what to do.</span> <span id="s1710">I had to think it over and I did not want to jeopardize my situation.</span> <span id="s1711">He came up at 5.00 P.M. Saturday afternoon.</span> <span id="s1712">I went to the office in order to meet him.</span> <span id="s1713">He talked to me and he said what do you have to say to that.</span> <span id="s1714">I said, “You know, I can only say one thing, I am deeply disappointed by the action of the Medical Society, and, I must say, I am also disappointed that I have not been given a fair chance, not a chance to withdraw, and I always heard that Americans are so proud of fair play, and I don’t think I got it.</span> <span id="s1715">And that was in the paper, in the Sunday paper.</span> <span id="s1716">I didn’t know anybody there at the Journal Herald at that time.</span> <span id="s1717">And there was a front, ah, on the editorial page, the first editorial, “In This Land of the Free,” (that was the heading.)</span> <span id="s1718">This editorial said, and I want to make it short, that Dr. Liebermann and his family, duly licensed to practice in the State of Ohio, came to Dayton in order to establish a practice of medicine.</span> <span id="s1719">He was invited to apply for membership in the Medical Society.</span> <span id="s1720">The Medical Society, last Friday night, adopted an amendment to their constitution requiring citizenship, and voted him down.</span> <span id="s1721">Dr. Liebermann well knows that there are differences between persecutions in a dictatorship, and persecutions in a democracy.</span> <span id="s1722">In a dictatorship it means concentration camps and possible death.</span> <span id="s1723">In a democracy it means economic persecution.</span> <span id="s1724">The Dayton Medical Society, the Montgomery County medical Society, has no reason to be proud of it’s decision.</span> <span id="s1725">All the votes were done by free men and see what happened!</span> <span id="s1726">And the next morning, the next Monday, for that was Sunday, I had eleven new patients in my office, and things went running.</span> <span id="s1727">That sounds like the story out of a novel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">Q: That is right, it does!</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">One question, I want to ask is at the medical meeting on that Friday night, did a reporter normally attend?</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">A: That must have been, this man must have been told, that must have been cooked up before!</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">Q: Could some doctor have leaked the verdict to the press?</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">A: I doubt it.</span> <span id="s1733">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">Q: You never heard?</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">A: I never heard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">Q: You never heard who your friends were or who your enemies were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">A: No!</span> <span id="s1738">No!</span> <span id="s1739">I know this.</span> <span id="s1740">I just read in the paper that this amendment to the constitution was adopted and I was not eligible, and I was voted down.</span> <span id="s1741">On Monday, I had eleven new patients and from then on my practice was established!</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">Q: And your profits went up!</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">A: And the second year I collected $9,600, which was money at that time, which was 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">Q: 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">A: That was the start of my practice in Dayton.</span> <span id="s1746">You know it, it was meant to ruin me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">Q: Yes, that’s right!</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">A: As a matter of fact, on this Sunday, my Rabbi, who wanted to be helpful and nice and so on, said to me, he came to the house and he said to me, “With this thing you got $10,000.00 worth of free advertising in the City of Dayton!”</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">Q: We really haven’t talked about your affiliation with a congregation when you came to Dayton.</span> <span id="s1750">Did you do that rather quickly?</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">A: No.</span> <span id="s1752">I did not.</span> <span id="s1753">There were three congregations here, an Orthodox, a Conservative and a Reform.</span> <span id="s1754">The Reform was closest to what German Jews who were rather, as I told you, assimilated were.</span> <span id="s1755">I joined the Temple.</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">Q: Were those patients forthcoming from the congregation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">A: I will tell you!</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">Q: During that first year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">A: During the first year, very few, very few!</span> <span id="s1760">And I did not join before July or August.</span> <span id="s1761">You know the date for Holidays, the High Holy Days are in September or October, or such.</span> <span id="s1762">I joined before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">Q: In a way this is a very sad story, this story of the resettlement in the U.S. in a way it is very happy.</span> <span id="s1764">It is a sad story with a happy ending!</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">A: A happy ending, yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">Q: What does this make you feel about the U.S.?</span> <span id="s1767">Let me elaborate on that for a little bit.</span> <span id="s1768">You know we have this feeling about ourselves, where we have the great open arms.</span> <span id="s1769">You know we recite that inscription on the Statue of Liberty, “Send me your poor, your oppressed, etc.,” do you think that is true, or from your experience that that is a myth?</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">A: I will tell you.</span> <span id="s1771">I honestly say that this is still the best country in the world.</span> <span id="s1772">You know, I have been fortunate that I could afford to travel all over the world.</span> <span id="s1773">I was in Japan, in China, in Australia, in Alaska, and all over the U.S. before I went abroad, and Europe.</span> <span id="s1774">I knew from before, and, you know, whenever we come back from a trip, and we felt that mostly when we came back from South America.</span> <span id="s1775">It is good to come back to the U.S. For to live in south America under their dictatorships, where, on every street corner you have a policeman with a carbine or machine gun, or two policemen, when people disappear, and so on, and so on.</span> <span id="s1776">This is still the best country in the world.</span> <span id="s1777">I am not saying that to please anybody.</span> <span id="s1778">That is really, honestly!</span> <span id="s1779">This is the best country in the world!</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">Q: May we go on for just a few more minutes, so we can finish up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">A: Certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">Q: But, it requires me to change tapes.</span> <span id="s1783">There are other questions, a few sort of difficult questions I want to ask you.</span> <span id="s1784">These are difficult questions.</span> <span id="s1785">They are not actually difficult, they are not easily answered, to put it that way, and sort of, I was fishing for an immediate answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">Q: Did you harbor, did you feel very bitter about the way the medical profession had treated you?</span> <span id="s1788">Did you have to fight against that bitterness?</span> <span id="s1789">I am talking in terms of making friends with the doctors and the medical profession who voted against you.</span> <span id="s1790">Did that come easy, did it take a long time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">A: The first couple of years hardly anybody talked to me.</span> <span id="s1792">You know, gradually you become part of it.</span> <span id="s1793">And, of course, today, and even twenty years ago, and thirty years ago, you are with each other by first names, although there are people who don’t like Jews, there are people who don’t like to speak with anyone with an accent, and I will have an accent as long as I live.</span> <span id="s1794">That also has special reasons.</span> <span id="s1795">You know, there are two kinds of people practically, those with an acoustic and those with a visual mind.</span> <span id="s1796">Those with an acoustic mind have much better an opportunity to, I might say, mimic, and get rid of their accent.</span> <span id="s1797">.</span> <span id="s1798">I am clearly a visual type.</span> <span id="s1799">A visual type is the type for reality, who is systematic.</span> <span id="s1800">The acoustic type is more for music and the dreaming type.</span> <span id="s1801">Those people lose their accent, right away, for their ears are more receptive to these nuances.</span> <span id="s1802">I, we, have a daughter-in-law, that is our son’s wife, who teaches English in high school.</span> <span id="s1803">She has been teaching English in high school for 15 years.</span> <span id="s1804">After she got married, had her kids, when her oldest kid graduated from high school, she got her Master’s degree, and since then she has been teaching English in high school.</span> <span id="s1805">And you know, for an English teacher, it is almost necessary to speak without an accent.</span> <span id="s1806">Right?</span> <span id="s1807">She is the typical acoustic type.</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">Q: I never thought of it in those terms, but I think there is much to what you are saying.</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">A: And, I am, you know, I like to read prose.</span> <span id="s1810">I cannot get enthused about poetry.</span> <span id="s1811">Those people who have the ear for the poetry, that is the acoustic type.</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">Q: You mentioned that you traveled considerably.</span> <span id="s1813">Did you ever go back to Upper Silesia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">A: No.</span> <span id="s1815">I never went behind the Iron Curtain, and I don’t want to!</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">Q: Have you been back to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1818">Many times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">Q: How do you feel when you go back to Germany?</span> <span id="s1820">Do you have any sort of emotion?</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">A: I don’t like it!</span> <span id="s1822">We have.</span> <span id="s1823">As a matter of fact, we have people in Germany.</span> <span id="s1824">Every time we went to Europe, Lotte has a first cousin who survived in Germany, living in Frankfurt now, since she was married to a non-Jew.</span> <span id="s1825">So, she survived and these people are lovely, nice people.</span> <span id="s1826">We always went, either at the beginning or at the end of our trip.</span> <span id="s1827">We fly to Frankfurt, or we leave from Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s1828">We spent three or four days in their house.</span> <span id="s1829">But, I don’t think that I would like to go to German resorts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">A: You see the people around there who did that to you!</span> <span id="s1832">They have grown up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">Q: When you are in Germany, and not with your cousin, with Mrs. Liebermann’s cousin’s family, do you talk about the war?</span> <span id="s1834">The Holocaust?</span> <span id="s1835">The Nazism?</span> <span id="s1836">Or, is the subject to be avoided?</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">A: I tell you, they don’t want to hear about it.</span> <span id="s1838">The schools try to take the children to Dachau to show them.</span> <span id="s1839">But the grown up population, they want to know nothing about it.</span> <span id="s1840">It goes so far that this cousin and her husband could not serve in the army in WWII since he lost his leg right here in WWI!</span> <span id="s1841">He was dismissed, he was fired from his job since he did not want to divorce his wife and, a decent fellow, and they usually come together only with people where one party was non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s1842">They also lived in the eastern part of Germany.</span> <span id="s1843">When they cane back to Frankfurt and he was reinstated with his government job, nobody talked to him.</span> <span id="s1844">You know, he was also an intruder.</span> <span id="s1845">And he says that it is very difficult, well today it is mainly, he is older than I am.</span> <span id="s1846">He is 80 or 81.</span> <span id="s1847">But, even in Germany, within Germany he was the foreign fellow who came from East Germany competing in the company where he was reinstated</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">Q: Do you have any contact at all with people from Leibitz?</span> <span id="s1849">Today?</span> <span id="s1850">Friends?</span> <span id="s1851">Former friends and acquaintances?</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">A: Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">Q: Anyone from Leibitz?</span> <span id="s1854">Do you ever write to any of them?</span> <span id="s1855">Have you kept in touch with any of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">A: Yes, listen.</span> <span id="s1857">The peculiar thing is when we travel around the world, not around the world you know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">Q: Here and there in the world?</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">A: Yes, we have friends and relatives everywhere, for German Jews are so dispersed and scattered around the world that I came to Sydney, Australia, I have a fraternity brother who is a dentist there.</span> <span id="s1860">When we came to Melbourne, Australia, we have some of our best friends there, who lived in the same house with us.</span> <span id="s1861">When I came to Japan I have a fraternity brother who is practicing internal medicine in Tokyo.</span> <span id="s1862">You know, that makes it interesting, for you are not confined to tourist guides, you go right to the homes.</span> <span id="s1863">Of course, when I go to Israel, when I go to England, we have really friends and relatives everywhere, you know that makes travel?</span> <span id="s1864">When I went to South America, I have cousins in Rio de Janeiro.</span> <span id="s1865">Lotte has a cousin in Buenos Aires and I have two cousins in Rio de Janeiro, and you know that makes it interesting that you really see how the people live, what their problems are, not that you just get a conducted tour.</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">Q: When did you retire from active practice?</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">A: After I had two heart attacks and a broken leg in 1973.</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">Q: Is that when you began to spend part of your year in Florida?</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1870">For in winter, in cold weather, it is very difficult, we have a very small apartment.</span> <span id="s1871">One bedroom, small apartment, with a big terrace right on the waterfront.</span> <span id="s1872">That is very nice!</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">Q: I have asked you a lot of questions over a number of hours.</span> <span id="s1874">Is there anything that you would like to add that I did not cover in my questions?</span> <span id="s1875">Is there anything that you thought of that you wanted to say, or any point you wanted to bring up, in the area you wanted to explore that was not prompted by a question on my part?</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">A: You know, I can only say what I said when we were at my one granddaughter’s, who is a physician when she got married.</span> <span id="s1877">I believe I told you that at the rehearsal dinner they wanted me to say something and I said to them, “When I look back on the fifty years” you know we had been married for 50 years last February, “When I look back on the fifty years I certainly cannot say that they were boring and I must say things turned out better than I ever hoped and expected.”</span> <span id="s1878">And, I said, “If I would be 18 years old today again, I would do it all over again.”</span> <span id="s1879">And while I said it, it occurred to me at the end, “I would even marry the same girl again.”</span> <span id="s1880">And, I told this bride and groom, “And I hope that after 50 years you will be able to say the same thing.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">Q: This is marvelous!</span> <span id="s1882">I thank you for all the time you have given.</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">A: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s1884">Listen, that was a pleasure.</span></p></body></html>
