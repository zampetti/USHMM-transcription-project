name please?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: Eugene Lipman.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: And where and when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, October 13, 1919.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s16">Uh...Gene, tell me something about your family and growing up in Pittsburgh.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: Uh...My father was a small jeweler in the mill district of Pittsburgh, my mother a Pittsburgher by the way.</span> <span id="s18">My father was born in Europe...uh...had and raised children and was the compliant homemaker.</span> <span id="s19">Uh...We never had any money.</span> <span id="s20">My grandparents,...uh...all four, lived in Pittsburgh until my grandfather, my paternal went off to Palestine.</span> <span id="s21">In 1925 or 6 came back for my Bar Mitzvah celebration, and then came back permanently during World War II because the idea of the Germans taking over Palestine was an unpleasant idea to him and so he came back and he died in Pittsburgh.</span> <span id="s22">We are a long lived family.</span> <span id="s23">My paternal grandfather was 93 at the time of his death.</span> <span id="s24">Uh...I grew up in this mill district of Pittsburgh to the age of 7, then moved to the ghetto of Squirrel Hill because I had to go to Hebrew and all the synagogues and Hebrew schools were in Squirrel Hill, and I completed my high school education at High School, 40 percent Jewish and...uh...finished in 1936, by which time I had already decided to be a Rabbi.</span> <span id="s25">And started the Pitt because I could live at home and go to Pitt.</span> <span id="s26">This was depression time.</span> <span id="s27">And then in 38...Solomon Freuhauf who was my mentor in this Rabbi business decided that I was wasting my time in Pittsburgh and sent me off to Cincinnati.</span> <span id="s28">I went to Hebrew College in Cincinnati and the University of Cincinnati at the same time.</span> <span id="s29">They were across the street from the other...from each other.</span> <span id="s30">They still are.</span> <span id="s31">And...uh...got my degree from University of Cincinnati, finished it HUC in 1943, having accelerated a year because they needed chaplains so badly.</span> <span id="s32">And...uh...so we went to school for 22 straight months in order to accomplish this.</span> <span id="s33">No professor would allow us to give up a course.</span> <span id="s34">How can you be a chaplain without my course in mid rush five, one of them was known to say.</span> <span id="s35">Uh...It was required by the military that you have a year of experience before you can go into chaplaincy, and so I replaced a Rabbi in Fort Worth, Texas, who went into the Navy and spent a very uncomfortable year there.</span> <span id="s36">I was 23 years old and everybody I met in the street 23 years old was in uniform.</span> <span id="s37">Uh...The entire American army was in Texas.</span> <span id="s38">And...uh...I was not in uniform so as soon as I could get into uniform, I got into uniform.</span> <span id="s39">Uh...We had married...in...1943, the day after ordination.</span> <span id="s40">It was a long weekend, and...uh...by the time I went into the military, Esther was pregnant with our first child.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: When and under...when did you go overseas.</span> <span id="s42">What were the circumstances?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Well, I had decided very early on that my war in World War II was the European theater, not the Pacific theatre, even though I wavered on that because of something I'll mention in a minute.</span> <span id="s44">But I had really decided that I wanted to go to Germany and I had asked the Chief Chaplain's office to ship me to Germany.</span> <span id="s45">Going overseas was unavoidable.</span> <span id="s46">I knew that.</span> <span id="s47">And so…uh...in February of 1945, I got orders to go overseas and didn't get there until April because that's the war the army worked.</span> <span id="s48">The...uh...thing I didn't mention to you was that while I was in Fort Worth, a member of my congregation who had rabbinical connections...uh.</span> <span id="s49">.</span> <span id="s50">asked me, right after Yom Kippur services, as a matter of fact, if I had ever thought about becoming a pilot.</span> <span id="s51">Uh...He taught fairy pilots, the women pilots.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s53">I want to hold it.</span> <span id="s54">And can you stop the tape please?</span> <span id="s55">Alright, just hold the tape for a minute and then we'll pick it up.</span> <span id="s56">We've had construction problems on the third floor.</span> <span id="s57">The sound is coming through the roof.</span> <span id="s58">Okay.</span> <span id="s59">These people are just marvelous.</span> <span id="s60">What we will do, we'll back it from the beginning of that story.</span> <span id="s61">I'll ask you to describe... Dean, tell me about...uh...the gentleman in Texas.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: His name was Stanley Herst, and he had rabbinical connections.</span> <span id="s63">He came up to me after services on Yom Kippur and introduced himself.</span> <span id="s64">We had never met.</span> <span id="s65">I had been there all of about 4 weeks after all, and said that all his adult wanted to teach a Rabbi to fly and all Rabbis were chicken.</span> <span id="s66">And being 23, I wasn't having any of that and I said, "When do we start."</span> <span id="s67">And he said, "Tomorrow morning at 7 o'clock."</span> <span id="s68">And (laughter) I said, "No.</span> <span id="s69">I can't do it tomorrow.</span> <span id="s70">Give me a couple days."</span> <span id="s71">Because, among other things, I didn't have a flight jacket.</span> <span id="s72">And in those days, you had to wear a yellow jacket.</span> <span id="s73">You couldn't go up in an airplane.</span> <span id="s74">They were open.</span> <span id="s75">There were no closed airplanes.</span> <span id="s76">That's a long time ago.</span> <span id="s77">So he taught me to fly in his little piper cub which went 70 miles an hour maximum, and I notified the...uh...Jewish Welfare Board and the Chief Chaplain's office that I was doing this in case it was of interest.</span> <span id="s78">And the Chief Chaplain's office was very interested, they said.</span> <span id="s79">So I got my license and...uh...after Chaplain's school, which was 5 weeks we got our assignments and I was signed to the armored force.</span> <span id="s80">And I thought, you know, "Typical Army screw up!"</span> <span id="s81">But...uh...It was done deliberately.</span> <span id="s82">I found out that they just didn't want Chaplains flying airplanes.</span> <span id="s83">They wanted Chaplains praying for troops.</span> <span id="s84">And so I did go to Europe instead of doing Island hopping in the Pacific was what they had been talking about.</span> <span id="s85">So I arrived in Europe in...uh...April 1945.</span> <span id="s86">The...uh...voyage was of interest historically.</span> <span id="s87">I became the radio announcer on the plane...I..</span> <span id="s88">.</span> <span id="s89">on the ship.</span> <span id="s90">I probably was the only one who could read English, something of the sort.</span> <span id="s91">And several times a day I did news broadcasts, which I had written from whatever material they could garner.</span> <span id="s92">Uh...Historically, I guess the most important thing I did was announce the death of Franklin Roosevelt...uh...who died while we were on our way overseas.</span> <span id="s93">That was a very discouraging and depressing...uh...idea.</span> <span id="s94">Who...who was Truman became a very important question to those of us who were on our way overseas.</span> <span id="s95">We also had a..</span> <span id="s96">.</span> <span id="s97">uh... marathon bridge game going.</span> <span id="s98">It should be noted for historical record that nobody in my Army career ever suggested that we play bridge for money.</span> <span id="s99">Never did.</span> <span id="s100">There were eight of us in this bridge game and we cut in and cut out for all kinds of necessary purposes, like sleep.</span> <span id="s101">And...uh...I didn't get a good hand (laughing) in 14 days.</span> <span id="s102">Several million points were involved in my losses.</span> <span id="s103">Uh...I also agreed to...uh...box for the only time in my life, because they were having a series of boxing matches and they couldn't find a heavy weight to fight against this lieutenant who was crazy enough to volunteer, but he had fought a couple of times before.</span> <span id="s104">We sort of sparred around for three rounds.</span> <span id="s105">I..</span> <span id="s106">.</span> <span id="s107">uh...developed a strep ear toward the end of the voyage and was taken by ambulance from dockside to an Evac hospital just outside Lahov in France.</span> <span id="s108">And the rumor went around that this guy I had fought against had beaten me up so badly that I had been hospitalized.</span> <span id="s109">And...uh...rumor also went around that I was being sent back home again because I was so sick.</span> <span id="s110">I heard that long after I got into Germany.</span> <span id="s111">Couple...couple of people were surprised to see me.</span> <span id="s112">I was in this hospital for 3 days.</span> <span id="s113">The hospital chaplain, who was bored out of his mind,...uh... stole a couple of bicycles and he and I peddled each night into this little village where he had met a French couple, and we played bridge in French, which was fun.</span> <span id="s114">Uh...Eventually, though, that had to stop and I had to get to work.</span> <span id="s115">So I..</span> <span id="s116">.</span> <span id="s117">uh...was put onto a troop train headed for Germany.</span> <span id="s118">Typical 40 and 8 box car and I staked out my little piece of turf big enough for my pack and me, and then I was standing at the entrance to this box car waiting for the train to start and some sergeant was walking up and down yelling, "Who can talk French?</span> <span id="s119">Who knows some French?"</span> <span id="s120">So, one never volunteers, but he wasn't getting anybody and I said,...uh... "Will some French do?"</span> <span id="s121">And he says, "Three words will do.</span> <span id="s122">And Colonel needs a French translator."</span> <span id="s123">So I went back to the Colonel, an old regular Army man, obviously unsuccessful because he was in the transportation corps running these troop trains which didn't require much military skill.</span> <span id="s124">And he was delighted to see me, and I was moved into his car which was not a box car.</span> <span id="s125">It was a heated Pullman car and...uh...I lived very well for 5 days going into France.</span> <span id="s126">Uh...My job was every time the...uh... train stopped to tear up to the other end to the engineer and ask him what was wrong.</span> <span id="s127">And he told me, "Signal."</span> <span id="s128">(laughing) Every time, it was "Red Signal.</span> <span id="s129">I can't go."</span> <span id="s130">And I went back and told the Colonel who was quite content to go on doing whatever he was doing.</span> <span id="s131">I had lots of bad books to read.</span> <span id="s132">I had a fine, fine trip into Germany.</span> <span id="s133">Uh...wasn't wanted in Germany at that time.</span> <span id="s134">No one knew what to do with me.</span> <span id="s135">I was moved back to a town in Belgium called Verea, and...uh...as a casual.</span> <span id="s136">I did not have an assignment.</span> <span id="s137">And then V.E. day came, and we celebrated V.E. day by going from our camp which was outside Verea into Verea to watch the celebration and to celebrate.</span> <span id="s138">I was depressed.</span> <span id="s139">I didn't feel like celebrating.</span> <span id="s140">I don't know why.</span> <span id="s141">I..</span> <span id="s142">.</span> <span id="s143">Probably because I was alone, and...uh...couldn't think of much to celebrate as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s144">The world was over, but in the square in Verea, I saw some men and women in concentration camp uniforms.</span> <span id="s145">Clearly!</span> <span id="s146">Uh...I knew what they were, and they were standing over there, and I walked over toward them.</span> <span id="s147">They recognized my insignia and crowded around because I was the first American Jew that they had run into.</span> <span id="s148">They were Buchenwald graduates, and they were the first survivors of the Holocaust whom I met.</span> <span id="s149">Uh... They didn't want anything.</span> <span id="s150">I didn't have anything.</span> <span id="s151">Uh... But we talked, and...uh...they did a lot, my first concentration stories, my first Holocaust stories.</span> <span id="s152">They were followed by thousands more Holocaust stories over the course of the next 3 years.</span> <span id="s153">I did get an assignment to 22nd Corps Headquarters in the Rhineland.</span> <span id="s154">Our town was Hildan, not to far from Cologne, and I moved in.</span> <span id="s155">Large territory, all of the Rhineland, including Cologne.</span> <span id="s156">A lot of troops.</span> <span id="s157">Theoretically, we were conducting services for all those troops.</span> <span id="s158">I got a jeep and went to work.</span> <span id="s159">Early discovered that a lot of German Jews and a lot of East European Jews had come into the area not in displaced persons camps, but living on their own where they could find a place to live, which many of them could not do.</span> <span id="s160">So I began to do three things.</span> <span id="s161">First of all to push military government to find housing for them; second, to see that they got food because they had no source of income and they did not get UNRRA food because they were not in a UNRRA installation.</span> <span id="s162">And...uh...some clothing because they were still wearing concentration camp uniforms, and that was not a very good idea.</span> <span id="s163">Uh...So my services with American soldiers consisted of a gang coming together.</span> <span id="s164">There were about 10 of these a week, and my saying to them,...uh... "Anybody need to say cottage, ...uh...there was frequently somebody who needed to say cottage, so we had a short service cottage, and then I said, "Let's go.</span> <span id="s165">We need food.</span> <span id="s166">Let's go get it."</span> <span id="s167">And after the first time in each of these installations, anybody who could beg, borrow or steal a truck...uh...came with truck, and we went to army depots and we got food.</span> <span id="s168">Uh...Sometimes was able to sign for it.</span> <span id="s169">I have often had a nightmare about the army catching up with my memorandum receipts...uh...and they will some day.</span> <span id="s170">My great, great, great grandchildren may have a problem with the army...uh...I know that they catch up, because about 1947 or 48, my uncle who fought in France in World War I got a bill from the United States Army for $45 for a pistol that he had signed a memorandum receipt for in France, and had never turned in.</span> <span id="s171">...Uh...Actually, he had turned it in, but the Army didn't think so.</span> <span id="s172">So he had a correspondence with the army for many, many moons about that money for the...I think this was all those years later...so someday... Most of the time, though, we didn't bother to sign for it.</span> <span id="s173">We just stole it.</span> <span id="s174">And there were millions of tons of supplies stashed in depots around the area and...uh...they should be used.</span> <span id="s175">And they were.</span> <span id="s176">We also managed to get hold of some kinds of clothing.</span> <span id="s177">Couldn't use uniforms, of course, but there was underwear.</span> <span id="s178">There were socks.</span> <span id="s179">There were shoes.</span> <span id="s180">There were jackets and things like that.</span> <span id="s181">So, we were starting a pretty good system going when orders came out moving us.</span> <span id="s182">Uh...The British were taking over our area.</span> <span id="s183">There had been negotiations and most of the Rhineland became British zone.</span> <span id="s184">And in typical army fashion we were moved as far as you could get, which was Plezn, Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s185">We packed up and we started across Germany.</span> <span id="s186">Before that happened...after we got the notice that the British were coming in and before we left, I decided that I better do something in this part of Germany that needed doing for me.</span> <span id="s187">I went to Dachau.</span> <span id="s188">Took a 3 day pass and took my jeep and went down to Dachau where Abe Klausner, my classmate, ...uh...was working fulltime, and Klausner's a story unto himself, and we'll probably get around to it in the course of this thing.</span> <span id="s189">Uh...My reaction to Dachau was what exactly what you would expect somebody's reaction to Dachau to be.</span> <span id="s190">There was still 30 odd thousand Jews there.</span> <span id="s191">Some were dying each day cause there was no way for them to make it.</span> <span id="s192">Most of them were going to live.</span> <span id="s193">They didn't look like they were going to live, but the Army medical people, who are very good by the way, said they were going to live.</span> <span id="s194">Abe was in the same business that I was in, only more so as he had this fine clothing for them.</span> <span id="s195">I remember the day that he got 38 thousand pairs of shoes out of a German Army warehouse just by going in, opening the doors, and taking them.</span> <span id="s196">And...uh...Every day he had people to bury.</span> <span id="s197">I..</span> <span id="s198">.</span> <span id="s199">uh...often have said to people who are skeptical about the size of the Holocaust that if they would like me to step off approximately how many...uh...feet of space it takes in full directions to make a rectangle that would hold 70,000 dead Jews, I know how to do that because I have seen them.</span> <span id="s200">Uh...I stayed those 3 days with Abe and then went back.</span> <span id="s201">On the way to Czechoslovakia, we went through Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s202">And once and for all...uh...the myths got exploded that the Germans didn't know about concentration camps cause when we went into the marvelous old town of Yana, and into the wonderful former capitol of the German Republic of Weimar, I saw smoke.</span> <span id="s203">And I asked what it was, and those were the fires, not the...uh...crematorium fires, but the fires at the Buchenwald concentration camp where there were still people.</span> <span id="s204">You could see them.</span> <span id="s205">They were only 3, 4 miles away from each of those two towns.</span> <span id="s206">I have a funny feeling that when the wind blew the right...blew the right way during those years...uh...you could smell Buchenwald without any trouble.</span> <span id="s207">We got to Plzen, and I settled into my room, and to my office.</span> <span id="s208">Uh...Two things happened in fairly short order, one of which is...uh...just of historic interest.</span> <span id="s209">The other of which transformed my life.</span> <span id="s210">I'll do the easy one first.</span> <span id="s211">I got a phone call.</span> <span id="s212">It was the Bishop of Plzen, a Catholic Bishop who told me his name, which I don't remember.</span> <span id="s213">And I said to him, "Sir, I..</span> <span id="s214">(You see he had some English)...that you want my Catholic colleague, Chaplain Straun," and he said, "No.</span> <span id="s215">You're the Rabbi, aren't you?"</span> <span id="s216">And I said, "Yes Sir."</span> <span id="s217">And he said, "You're the man I want to come to see, he said, "You don't have to come out here."</span> <span id="s218">It was a couple of miles from us to the center of town where the cathedral was.</span> <span id="s219">"I am coming down this evening.</span> <span id="s220">I'll stop in."</span> <span id="s221">And I went to see him.</span> <span id="s222">And I met for the first time a bishop who looked like a bishop.</span> <span id="s223">You know, the long robes, the pointed toes, shoes, the whole business, and he greeted me very warmly and said that he wanted to take me somewhere.</span> <span id="s224">Didn't want to explain too much, but that...uh...it will be a great relief to one of his parishioners if I would go with him.</span> <span id="s225">I said, "Alright," and we made a date for the next afternoon.</span> <span id="s226">We went into the old part of Plzen, which is centuries old.</span> <span id="s227">These wonderful 4 and 5 story apartment buildings, which looked like a slum on the outside and are often very nice on the inside, and I was introduced to a man named Snyder, an engineer, who told me the following story.</span> <span id="s228">In the building in which he lived, a neighbor had been...Rabbi Katz, the Rabbi of the congregation in Plzen.</span> <span id="s229">The synagogue, by the way, was still standing.</span> <span id="s230">We cleaned it out.</span> <span id="s231">It had been made a warehouse, of course, by the Germans, and it was rededicated and used by the Jews who happened to be in Plzen during that time.</span> <span id="s232">It may still be used.</span> <span id="s233">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s234">(Sigh) Rabbi Katz and Mr. Snyder, became very close friends because they both had an interest in French impressionist paintings, and they both collected what they could afford to collect.</span> <span id="s235">In 1938, when the Nazis came in, the Rabbi said to Snyder, "They are going to take our pictures because they want paintings.</span> <span id="s236">They steal paintings.</span> <span id="s237">Let's hide them.</span> <span id="s238">Snyder, being an engineer, was ingenious, and he took his living room which was 40 feet long, by the way.</span> <span id="s239">One of these European saloon-type rooms, and he built a fake wall 3 feet in from the regular wall, and that wall was covered with book shelves and other nice things, with one a typical spring door.</span> <span id="s240">He took me inside, and there were all the paintings which they had stashed away, both Rabbi Katz's and his.</span> <span id="s241">His agreement with Rabbi Katz was that, obviously, if Katz came back...uh...the paintings would be his...his paintings.</span> <span id="s242">If he did not come back, all the paintings would be Snyder's.</span> <span id="s243">Uh...He also left some books, and that's why the Bishop had taken me.</span> <span id="s244">His most precious books.</span> <span id="s245">Rabbi Katz was killed in Auschwitz, his whole family, so there was nobody to inherit either the paintings or the books.</span> <span id="s246">And I took the books at Snyder's request.</span> <span id="s247">An interesting group of 4, 5 books.</span> <span id="s248">Not his library, just the books he cared most about.</span> <span id="s249">One 2 volume set turns out to be precious.</span> <span id="s250">It's now in the rare book room of our seminary in Cincinnati.</span> <span id="s251">It's one of two copies of this 1520 Hebrew edition of one of the great classics... uh...in the whole world.</span> <span id="s252">The other one is at Oxford.</span> <span id="s253">Uh...There were some German poems, beautiful edition, which I gave to Sylvia.</span> <span id="s254">We'll come across Sylvia shortly, and...uh...a Hebrew New Testament, 17th Century, which I gave to the Bishop.</span> <span id="s255">And...uh...for myself, I kept and sent home an album of Visidor Kaufman, a prince.</span> <span id="s256">Visidor Kaufman was a fine classical Jewish painter of the beginning of the 20th century who was himself Austrian and got interested in East European types.</span> <span id="s257">And his paintings of East European Jews and East European scenes are classics.</span> <span id="s258">And...uh...I have been distributing those to friends, and I have one or two of them.</span> <span id="s259">That was my visit with the Bishop, and these books.</span> <span id="s260">The same day there was a knock on my door and a little woman walked in, in an American Red Cross uniform.</span> <span id="s261">Uh...Sylvia was maybe 5 feet tall, a skinny little thing, very good looking, about 10 years older than I, and she told me the following story.</span> <span id="s262">She was a social worker who had been part of the social work department at Steven Wise Free Synagogue, which was then just called Free Synagogue because Steven Wise was still living.</span> <span id="s263">And she had worked for Wise•, and told wonderful stories about Steven Wise.</span> <span id="s264">When America got into the war, he said to her, "You have to go into the Red Cross."</span> <span id="s265">And she said, "Why?</span> <span id="s266">To feed donuts to G.I.'s?"</span> <span id="s267">And he said, "Yes, because in Europe you are going to be in front line areas, and you are going to be able to help Jews.</span> <span id="s268">There will be survivors, and they are going to need all kinds of help and you're just the type to do it."</span> <span id="s269">He was right.</span> <span id="s270">She was just the type.</span> <span id="s271">She got into the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s272">She went to Europe, ...uh...opened one of the first concentration camps in France...uh...organized all of the little kids, and middle sized kids who survived, and that was the transport that went to Palestine legally...uh...after liberation.</span> <span id="s273">She landed in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s274">I don't know how.</span> <span id="s275">And was the director of the Red Cross club in downtown Plzen.</span> <span id="s276">She had four other women working with her.</span> <span id="s277">And from early in the morning till 10 o'clock at night, she handed out donuts and coffee and talked and chatted with American soldiers.</span> <span id="s278">Then they closed up for the night, and they opened the back door and the Jews started to come in for all sorts of things.</span> <span id="s279">Uh...Sylvia asked me if I wanted to help Jews.</span> <span id="s280">Since that's why I went to Europe, I agreed "Yal," and...uh...asked her what was going on.</span> <span id="s281">She had been contacted by the Jewish Brigade group which was in Italy.</span> <span id="s282">They had been attached to the British army in Italy, had fought through the war, and at the end of the war were in town called Trevisio, way up in the Italian Alps.</span> <span id="s283">Immediately, they organized themselves to work with Jews and they sent ambulances and they sent trucks over the hills into Austria and they began to move Jews into Italy to get on ships, illegal of course, to go to Palestine, and would I help with this enterprise?</span> <span id="s284">We could send Jews from Czechoslovakia into Austria and the Brigade would pick them up and take them to Italy.</span> <span id="s285">That sounded like a very intriguing idea to a 25 year old kid.</span> <span id="s286">Cops and robbers!</span> <span id="s287">And so Sylvia and I organized a movement out of the American zone of Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s288">Actually, it was out of all of Czechoslovakia, because at that point the border between the American zone and the Russian zone was an open border.</span> <span id="s289">We were still friendly.</span> <span id="s290">We mutually declared the Cold War only in August of 1945.</span> <span id="s291">So I was given the 3rd language...uh...pass to go anywhere in Czechoslovakia I wanted to go for my purposes.</span> <span id="s292">And...uh...two things happened.</span> <span id="s293">First, Sylvia and I went over to Prague.</span> <span id="s294">There were 6,000 Jews in the Rothchild Hospital there without a place to go, and new people were coming in all the time.</span> <span id="s295">Some from Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s296">First time I had heard of Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s297">Others from further East coming West because they had no intentions of living in the East.</span> <span id="s298">Uh...Poland was not a place for Jews.</span> <span id="s299">Uh...They didn't want to live in Hungary.</span> <span id="s300">They didn't want to Czech.</span> <span id="s301">They didn't want to live in Europe.</span> <span id="s302">They wanted out.</span> <span id="s303">And they would come to a Jewish center hoping that somebody would have some ideas about how to get out.</span> <span id="s304">They were also looking for relatives...uh...a very important function.</span> <span id="s305">We'll talk about that some more when we come back to Abe Klausner.</span> <span id="s306">We organized...uh...a way for these Jews in the Rothchild Hospital to...uh...receive railroad passes to come into the city of Plzen.</span> <span id="s307">From Prague to Plzen is only about 40 or 50 miles.</span> <span id="s308">The only way to get there is by train.</span> <span id="s309">We then proceeded to type one at a time...uh...passes, authorizing this person a United Nation's Stateless Person to travel from Prague to Plzen for the purpose of looking for relatives.</span> <span id="s310">We looked around Plzen for the biggest stamp we could find.</span> <span id="s311">I haven't any idea what it was about, but we found one and got a little bunch of red stamp pads and we put big red stamps on this thing and signed the name of a non-existent American Colonel to this document.</span> <span id="s312">And...uh...We would collect them when the people came into Plzen and then take them back to Prague because I could travel.</span> <span id="s313">And...uh...leave them at our Headquarters, hospital and a new group would come.</span> <span id="s314">Uh...We wanted them to come a few at a time.</span> <span id="s315">We didn't want large groups taking over trains, so they came in every day.</span> <span id="s316">And they reported to us at the Red Cross Club after 10 o'clock at night, and we drove them out to the Karlov displaced persons camp which was just on the edge of Plzen.</span> <span id="s317">It was an UNRRA camp.</span> <span id="s318">We were able to do this because of a rather remarkable coincidence.</span> <span id="s319">I went out to the camp to meet the Director and see if we could make a deal for our people to spend some time in the camp.</span> <span id="s320">His name was Andrew C. Dunn, and when we met I said, "Tell me.</span> <span id="s321">Does the C stand for Carnegie?</span> <span id="s322">," and he said, "How do you know?"</span> <span id="s323">I said, "Because anybody with named Dunn with the first name Andrew, the chances are fifty fifty that your middle name would be Carnegie, and you have to be from Pittsburgh."</span> <span id="s324">And he said, "Amazing."</span> <span id="s325">I said, "Yal, So am I." And we talked and he said, "Lipman.</span> <span id="s326">Lipman.</span> <span id="s327">Is your old man a jeweler?"</span> <span id="s328">And I said, "Yal."</span> <span id="s329">And he said, "I bought my wedding ring from him."</span> <span id="s330">His assistant, a woman named Fay Green, who many years later became his wife...uh...was intrigued by this whole business so he offered a five hundred in his camp.</span> <span id="s331">.</span> <span id="s332">We used for transportation to Austria and the answer was U.S. Army trucks.</span> <span id="s333">And who drove them?</span> <span id="s334">U.S. Army personnel.</span> <span id="s335">Why did they do it?</span> <span id="s336">Scotch.</span> <span id="s337">And some money.</span> <span id="s338">We did not want people doing us favors.</span> <span id="s339">We were commercial.</span> <span id="s340">Uh...We made a trip down to the Austrian border and made the discovery that the only bridge across the Danu...Australian River• that we knew about was a military bridge and we weren't about to use that.</span> <span id="s341">So we went down the road looking for a way to get across that blasted river, and we found one.</span> <span id="s342">It was an old dam no longer in use, but serviceable and was just wide enough at the top for an Army 6-pod• to get across with about 6 inches of play on each side.</span> <span id="s343">And that's the one we used.</span> <span id="s344">We went across the dam into Austria and found our way either to Lintz or to Gratz or to Saltsport, depending on whether the Brigade told us to bring this bunch of Jews.</span> <span id="s345">Others, it worked.</span> <span id="s346">But I have to tell you where we got the liquor because that involves one of my more favorite memories.</span> <span id="s347">I was entitled to a few bottles of Scotch a week as a..</span> <span id="s348">.</span> <span id="s349">I was a Captain by then.</span> <span id="s350">That wasn't enough because we needed at least a dozen to 20 trucks or it wasn't worth taking the chance on the trip.</span> <span id="s351">Uh...One of the breaks we got by the way...lots of breaks in this...Massel is not to be considered a minor thing.</span> <span id="s352">The...uh...sergeant in charge of our motor pool at Corps Headquarters.</span> <span id="s353">Now Corps Headquarters has a lot of trucks.</span> <span id="s354">It just does.</span> <span id="s355">Uh...Corps a big thing.</span> <span id="s356">Was a sergeant named Katz, and he was from Brooklyn, and Sergeant Katz and I made a deal that he would get truck drivers for me and trucks and we would pay with money and Scotch.</span> <span id="s357">As I recall, it was 2 bottles per round trip or something like that.</span> <span id="s358">But where the Hell do you get Scotch in that kind of quantity?</span> <span id="s359">And I decided to take a real risk.</span> <span id="s360">I went to my senior chaplain, a Presbyterian from Kansas, Bird Colonel, full Colonel, but not regular army.</span> <span id="s361">He was a reservist.</span> <span id="s362">A very, quiet, pleasant man.</span> <span id="s363">He said to me, "You know, I haven't asked you any questions, but you travel a lot more than is comfortable for the Chief of Staff."</span> <span id="s364">Cause I was going to all the Jewish camps and communities and people I could find all over Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s365">I was also going to Theresienstadt by then.</span> <span id="s366">We haven't come to Theresienstadt yet.</span> <span id="s367">And he said...uh...Chief of Staff has asked...has asked me about this and I said I would investigate it."</span> <span id="s368">He said, "I can cover for you if I know where you are going.</span> <span id="s369">And you haven't any reason to tell me where you are going, but you will have to or I can't cover for you with the Chief of Staff," who is after all a 2-star General.</span> <span id="s370">I said, "Okay.</span> <span id="s371">I'll make a deal with you.</span> <span id="s372">When I leave each day, I will put under your blotter a statement of where I am going, from town to town to town each day, and then I'll give you my trip ticket.</span> <span id="s373">And you validate it if you chose to do so."</span> <span id="s374">He said, "Of course, I chose to do so.</span> <span id="s375">I know what you're doing and you got to do it."</span> <span id="s376">He did not know that we were taking Jews to Austria, but he knew I was working with Jewish displaced persons and he thought that was absolutely essential.</span> <span id="s377">Bless him, said I.</span> <span id="s378">He says, "Anything else I can do for you?"</span> <span id="s379">And I said, "Yal.</span> <span id="s380">You're a Bird Colonel.</span> <span id="s381">You get all the liquor you want, don't you?"</span> <span id="s382">He said, "I wouldn't know.</span> <span id="s383">I don't drink."</span> <span id="s384">I said, "I knew that, but you're about to."</span> <span id="s385">And he listened and he said a couple of people in supply are going to be awfully (laughing) surprised.</span> <span id="s386">I said, "You don't have to explain what you're doing with it.</span> <span id="s387">It's for charitable purposes that you getting into Protestant charities in Czechoslovakia which is your bound duty as a Christian."</span> <span id="s388">And he smiled and he thought that made sense, and I got all the liquor I wanted from then on, on his tab.</span> <span id="s389">Bless his heart.</span> <span id="s390">I was...I heard of his death in the early 50s, and I was very sorry.</span> <span id="s391">He was a good, good man.</span> <span id="s392">He saved my life, and saved Jews.</span> <span id="s393">That operation worked very well until August when...uh...we got caught in one of the Austria towns.</span> <span id="s394">Red handed!</span> <span id="s395">The whole bunch of us!</span> <span id="s396">We had not yet transferred these people to the Jewish Brigade...uh...and we got picked up.</span> <span id="s397">And I got terrible reaming from a General who announced me that he was going to radio my General immediately, and I would be court-martialed.</span> <span id="s398">And...uh...General Hubner did not court martial me.</span> <span id="s399">General Hubner, who was known as the little Patton, was a tough...uh...guy, but he wanted to get rid of Jews.</span> <span id="s400">He didn't want Jews in his territory.</span> <span id="s401">I have to tell you the Jewish displaced persons were the only displaced persons who were difficult.</span> <span id="s402">All other displaced persons, and there were 20 some nationalities of displaced persons...Outer Mongolians, for example, that the Germans imported for labor purposes.</span> <span id="s403">They were grateful for being alive, for being fed by UNRRA where they ate better than they had eaten most of their lives, and they were no hurry to go home.</span> <span id="s404">The Jews were not grateful.</span> <span id="s405">The Jews were in terrible conflict over being alive, over having survived.</span> <span id="s406">They didn't like anybody very much and...uh...they wanted out, and nobody would let them out.</span> <span id="s407">And so they caused more trouble than everybody else put together.</span> <span id="s408">Some of us understood it.</span> <span id="s409">We tried to organize it so that it wasn't too difficult.</span> <span id="s410">In addition, of course, we had all the internal Jewish problems that we always have.</span> <span id="s411">For example, within a month of liberation every Zionist party there was was in business, and they all wanted paper for publications and they all wanted everything.</span> <span id="s412">It was not easy.</span> <span id="s413">And these were not pleasant people at that point, and I think that should be understandable that they were not.</span> <span id="s414">So General Hubner• said, "Get them out of here.</span> <span id="s415">I don't care."</span> <span id="s416">He didn't tell me that, but that's how he behaved.</span> <span id="s417">One incident will illustrate this.</span> <span id="s418">He called Sylvia and me in one day.</span> <span id="s419">Now I had never met General Hubner.</span> <span id="s420">Uh...Captains don't monkey around much with 3-star generals.</span> <span id="s421">There are layers of bureaucracy in between, and certainly Red Cross women don't have a lot to do with Generals, though Sylvia had had more to do with Hubner than most because she was always making demands.</span> <span id="s422">Sylvia was a tough, tough lady.</span> <span id="s423">And Sylvia told the General...uh...got what she wanted most of the time, because the General didn't want to monkey with the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s424">He needed the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s425">Those donuts were very precious.</span> <span id="s426">Donuts and coffee kept American troops going.</span> <span id="s427">Uh...He called us in and said, "I hear there is going to be a Jewish meeting in London to talk about the future of all these Jews."</span> <span id="s428">And we said, "Yep."</span> <span id="s429">And he said, "You're going.</span> <span id="s430">You go my plane.</span> <span id="s431">When does the meeting start?"</span> <span id="s432">And we told and he said, "Okay.</span> <span id="s433">Two days before that, get out there and tell them for me to get all these Jews out of here.</span> <span id="s434">They should do everything they can do to get them out fast.</span> <span id="s435">It's not good for them and it is not good for us either."</span> <span id="s436">And he said it not unkindly, but he wasn't smiling.</span> <span id="s437">And Sylvia and I flew to London to the special Zionist Congress that was called in July in London, the chief purpose of which was to set the course that would lead to...uh...Israel's independence 3 years later, which meant that Ben-Gurion had a fight with Wietzman and Ben-Gurion wiped up the floor with Wietzman in a 4 hour Yiddish speech which, for me, is pretty unforgettable.</span> <span id="s438">Uh...What did he say?</span> <span id="s439">He did what Ben-Gurion always did.</span> <span id="s440">Ben-Gurion's idea of a speech was first to tell the history of the Jewish people, starting back with Abraham and working his way up.</span> <span id="s441">Sometimes I felt like he was going it minute by minute.</span> <span id="s442">Four hours was not his longest speech.</span> <span id="s443">Uh...He has made longer.</span> <span id="s444">And then rehearsing the Zionist movement from Belu all the way up...uh...and then minute by minute the events of World War II, subjectively stated so that Wietzman looked like an idiot who played the British and he was the savior who was going to see to it that we had a Jewish State.</span> <span id="s445">And they believed him.</span> <span id="s446">And Wietzman was really not in condition to do a proper answer.</span> <span id="s447">Wietzman aged 10 years in 5 days, and he became the old man, the inevitable person to the first President of the State.</span> <span id="s448">Powerless and ceremonial.</span> <span id="s449">That's what Wietzman became as of that day.</span> <span id="s450">Ben-Gurion became the leader of the Zionist movement.</span> <span id="s451">Uh...Sylvia and I did not spend much time in sessions.</span> <span id="s452">We spent our time meeting people that Steven Wise told us to meet to tell them about Czechoslovakia, to tell them about displaced persons, to tell them about the Haganah, and to urge certain kinds of support, none of which we had yet gotten.</span> <span id="s453">I met some fascinating people.</span> <span id="s454">Uh...I discovered this Lord Reading.</span> <span id="s455">Rufus Isaacs had gout, and that Lady Reading was really a lady and as passionate about...uh...Jewish things as any convert could be and...uh...all the leaders of the Zionist movement wanted to hear from us.</span> <span id="s456">We were the only people there from the occupied territories.</span> <span id="s457">That is, from Germany, Czechoslovakia, Austria.</span> <span id="s458">Nobody else there.</span> <span id="s459">Because nobody could get there.</span> <span id="s460">It never occurred to them for some reason or other to send some displaced persons over to tell the thing first person.</span> <span id="s461">There wasn't a single one there.</span> <span id="s462">So we were busy.</span> <span id="s463">And the General made that possible because that's how he wanted to get rid of the Jews.</span> <span id="s464">(Laughter) Benevolently!</span> <span id="s465">So he did not court martial me.</span> <span id="s466">He called me in.</span> <span id="s467">Actually, it was the Chief Staff who called me in and said, "We got this TWX from Austria."</span> <span id="s468">"Yes, Sir."</span> <span id="s469">"What the Hell have you been up to?"</span> <span id="s470">"TWX tells you what I have been up to."</span> <span id="s471">"We can't allow this."</span> <span id="s472">I said, "No, I suppose not.</span> <span id="s473">What'll you do."</span> <span id="s474">He said, "We're moving you so you can't do it."</span> <span id="s475">Alright, that was fine.</span> <span id="s476">Sylvia could keep the thing going and then other people took over.</span> <span id="s477">So far as I know some transports continued to go until the communists took over Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: I would like to halt a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: Yal.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: Go back to London.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: Yal.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Uh...Something else happened, I believe, when you were in London.</span> <span id="s483">You met Leo Beck.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Huh?</span> <span id="s485">That has to do with Theresienstadt so we have to start.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Let's go back.</span> <span id="s487">Go back and do Theresienstadt because that leads to Leo Beck•.</span> <span id="s488">Þ‑HÞ</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: Yal.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: When I got to Prague the first time, I discovered there had been a concentration camp at Theresienstadt, or as the Czechs call it Terezin, north and a little bit west of Prague.</span> <span id="s491">So I went there.</span> <span id="s492">There was still 16,000 Jews there with a Russian unit...uh...running the camp because it was in a Russian zone.</span> <span id="s493">And...uh...Theresienstadt was exactly what...uh...all the pictures have ever shown it to be.</span> <span id="s494">It was an army barracks...uh...and wasn't bad, because Theresienstadt, I remind you, was the show-off concentration camp.</span> <span id="s495">That was the place that the Red Cross came to.</span> <span id="s496">The International Red Cross was not exactly heroic during World War II, but they would go to Theresienstadt and make inspection...inspections and then send out a report saying the concentration camp was fine.</span> <span id="s497">They had a band and gave concerts and they had classes and they did all sorts of things.</span> <span id="s498">What they didn't say is that everyday transports left for the east and that none of those people survived.</span> <span id="s499">Leo Beck had survived by accident, by the way.</span> <span id="s500">There was somebody else named Beck in the camp, and they got mixed up and they sent that Beck off to East instead of Leo Beck.</span> <span id="s501">Leo Beck had left by the time I got there.</span> <span id="s502">The Russians had flown him into the British zone, and the British had flown him to London where his only child, a daughter, lived.</span> <span id="s503">And...uh...We proceeded, the Russian and I, to make a very simple deal.</span> <span id="s504">He wanted to close the camp.</span> <span id="s505">We wanted to close the camp.</span> <span id="s506">UNRRA had agreed that they would take this people to a town called Begendorf in the American zone.</span> <span id="s507">It was just a case of getting them there, and I had trucks.</span> <span id="s508">So we made a deal to move all the Jews out of Theresienstadt to Begendorf and here I have to tell you another one of those absolutely uncanny coincidences.</span> <span id="s509">All of our conferences, the camp commander and I, took place in the presence of a third person wearing a plain uniform who was the Commissar, the political leader, and he ran things.</span> <span id="s510">He sat there.</span> <span id="s511">Fortunately, he knew virtually no German.</span> <span id="s512">The only language the Commander and I had in common was German.</span> <span id="s513">Mine was fairly bad, and his was even worse.</span> <span id="s514">So we were talking German to each other, making ourselves understood and then I heard a word in a sentence that this man was saying, which was not German.</span> <span id="s515">It was a Yiddish word with a Hebrew origin.</span> <span id="s516">Aw, said I, He has just sent me a signal.</span> <span id="s517">So in my next paragraph, I carefully used a Yiddish word that had a Hebrew origin.</span> <span id="s518">Neither of us blinked an eye lash, but we both knew why he was going to work his head off to get those Jews out of there and he wanted me to know why.</span> <span id="s519">I had a Jewish camp commander.</span> <span id="s520">Never again in the whole time I was there...those...almost 3 months did he allude to it.</span> <span id="s521">We were never alone.</span> <span id="s522">The Commissar never let us alone.</span> <span id="s523">If I went there for lunch, the Commissar had lunch with us.</span> <span id="s524">He was with us every minute that I was in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s525">Came the last day.</span> <span id="s526">The last transport leaving Theresienstadt for Dagendorf, trucks all lined up, my jeep ready, my driver excited, Vic, and...uh...suddenly was a scream toward the back of the transport, somebody yelling "Halt."</span> <span id="s527">And a woman, I remember her, a kind of heavy set lady climbed out of the truck and started to run toward one of the buildings.</span> <span id="s528">So we followed her, the Camp President and I.</span> <span id="s529">She went into the building.</span> <span id="s530">She went down some steps, around corners, down some more steps, way down into the bowels of the earth, and came to a..</span> <span id="s531">.</span> <span id="s532">what looked like a piece of metal covering the wall, only it wasn't.</span> <span id="s533">It was a door.</span> <span id="s534">And when we went through that door, we were in the Theresienstadt synagogue.</span> <span id="s535">And...uh...it had not been completely cleaned out.</span> <span id="s536">There were some things there, and we took them.</span> <span id="s537">One of the things was a Megillah, of Esther.</span> <span id="s538">And they wanted to give it to me, and I said, "No, that I thought it belonged to Leo Beck."</span> <span id="s539">Whether or not it was his, it should be his.</span> <span id="s540">They all agreed that was so.</span> <span id="s541">He was a hero in the camp, by the way, because he had organized all those classes.</span> <span id="s542">He had insisted after pulling his garbage truck all day that you could not let your mind go to waste, and he had organized what amounted to a university.</span> <span id="s543">Anybody who could teach anything taught it.</span> <span id="s544">And he taught it.</span> <span id="s545">And that was...uh...accepted by these people as terribly important.</span> <span id="s546">And so he was...there have...there has been some statements about Beck's status in the camp as being something less than heroic, but not in my conversations with people in that camp.</span> <span id="s547">They really respected this old man.</span> <span id="s548">So I said I would take it to him, that one way or another eventually I would be going to London or I'd send it or whatever.</span> <span id="s549">So when I went to the Zionist Congress in July, I took the Megillah with me, wrapped in a piece of plastic, and I called, spoke to his daughter and made an appointment to see him on a particular day I don't remember.</span> <span id="s550">When I arrived, I was taken through the house to the back garden.</span> <span id="s551">It was a little back British gardens which are so nice.</span> <span id="s552">And...uh...Leo Beck was a bit of a ham, and my later experiences with him confirmed the fact that he was a bit of a ham.</span> <span id="s553">He was sitting...uh... reading something in profile.</span> <span id="s554">He had a marvelous profile, and the sun was shining directly on to him.</span> <span id="s555">(Laughter) And we talked for awhile.</span> <span id="s556">I had to give him condolences.</span> <span id="s557">His niece...uh...had been killed in a truck accident on the way out of Theresienstadt, the only on toward thing that we had in our Theresienstadt transports.</span> <span id="s558">A truck slid into the ditch and she was killed.</span> <span id="s559">His great niece was okay though.</span> <span id="s560">Her daughter!</span> <span id="s561">And we talked about that for awhile, and this young lady's future and I gave him the Megillah•.</span> <span id="s562">And he looked at it, and he looked at it, and he said, "I don't want this."</span> <span id="s563">I said, "Why not?</span> <span id="s564">The people wanted you to have it."</span> <span id="s565">He said, "No.</span> <span id="s566">If I have it, it's a museum piece.</span> <span id="s567">The Megillah should not be a museum piece.</span> <span id="s568">It should be a living document.</span> <span id="s569">It should be read.</span> <span id="s570">It should be read by Jews.</span> <span id="s571">This one being the Theresienstadt Magila should be read under circumstances which connect the story of the Megillah with Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s572">You take it.</span> <span id="s573">Only you promise me that that's how it will be used."</span> <span id="s574">And I took it.</span> <span id="s575">I had a box made for it by a Holocaust survivor when I came back.</span> <span id="s576">Actually, I didn't have it made until I got to Washington.</span> <span id="s577">And a woman named Friedal Blumenthal, a superb silversmith, made this box.</span> <span id="s578">The box is teac and she has ornamented it with appropriate symbols and the fact that it's a Megillah of Theresien.</span> <span id="s579">It is now going into its second generation.</span> <span id="s580">When I retired, I gave it to my son who happens to be a Rabbi, and he uses it in his congregation and he has made a..</span> <span id="s581">.</span> <span id="s582">an arrangement with the Holocaust Museum that it will be on display here for part of each year.</span> <span id="s583">That's my first meeting with Leo Beck.</span> <span id="s584">Later, he taught me.</span> <span id="s585">He came to Cincinnati in 1948, and from 1948 until his death in 55, I think it was, he taught one semester each year at the college institute in Cincinnati and the rest of the year was in London where he lead the World Union For Progressive Judaism.</span> <span id="s586">First rate lecturer and a bit of a ham.</span> <span id="s587">Uh...Now where do we go from here?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: What I want to do from here is to go back?</span> <span id="s589">Uh...I want to...I do not yet want to leave Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s590">Uh...And I would like to know...You worked so closely with the Haganah, and you worked with Berichah.</span> <span id="s591">I would like for you to talk a little bit about that.</span> <span id="s592">Uh...Tell us who you worked with and what those relationships were like.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: Okay, then I'll have to talk about the girls too.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s595">I want to do all of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: The people I worked with were primarily my American truck drivers.</span> <span id="s597">Andy Dunn and Faye Green at Camp Karlof...uh...I don't remember the names of anybody from the Rothchild Hospital, but there was an office there in which these documents...uh...which we did about 4 or 5 hundred eventually, these one-page things with the red stamp, that ...uh...got these people.</span> <span id="s598">They never had trouble getting from Prague to Plzen traveling.</span> <span id="s599">Even after the...uh...cold war was declared, and I had to go back roads my last couple of trips to Theresienstadt, by the way.</span> <span id="s600">I could not just go across.</span> <span id="s601">I had to go through a back road that I found to get to Theresin and then I could get to Prague and then I had to go back to my road to get back into the American zone because the Russians would no longer let us travel.</span> <span id="s602">My 3ªlanguage pass was no longer acceptable.</span> <span id="s603">Even after that, United Nations displaced persons traveling from Prague to Plzen for the purpose of looking for relatives had no trouble getting through the border crossing at Brockisoni.</span> <span id="s604">So I don't remember names very well.</span> <span id="s605">I remember nobody from the Jewish Brigade group.</span> <span id="s606">Sylvia had made contact with a man named, who had been a Captain in the Jewish Brigade, and , an attorney and I heard of him subsequent over the years.</span> <span id="s607">I never met him.</span> <span id="s608">So I had no dealings directly with him.</span> <span id="s609">I dealt with whoever happened to come across with the ambulances or the trucks or the combination that was taking our people from the town in Austria across to Italy.</span> <span id="s610">It was pretty much a...uh...two-person operation, Sylvia and me.</span> <span id="s611">Sylvia worked day and night.</span> <span id="s612">She was absolutely incredible in that Red Cross thing of hers.</span> <span id="s613">Her four people, the other women knew exactly what was going on, and they helped as much as they could.</span> <span id="s614">They wanted to.</span> <span id="s615">They were nice, healthy American kids who...uh...got a little bit bored listening to G.I. stories from 9 o'clock to 9 o'clock and handing out donuts and coffee, which is all Red Cross...un...canteens served.</span> <span id="s616">They got tired making those donuts too.</span> <span id="s617">So...uh...I didn't have a great many...uh....Berichah contacts then.</span> <span id="s618">Later it...uh...it changed drastically.</span> <span id="s619">But, the Czechoslovakia thing was pretty much as I have described it.</span> <span id="s620">Uh...One ...uh...group of people I really have to mention because they become so important to me.</span> <span id="s621">Shortly after we got to Czechoslovakia, I kept hearing about places where there were Jews and that's why the Chaplain had such trouble with my trip tickets because I went to all these places.</span> <span id="s622">And incidentally managed to show up at all the American Headquarters I was supposed to go to.</span> <span id="s623">There was a town in, a town in the southern part of ... And I heard that there some Jewish girls there.</span> <span id="s624">Women!</span> <span id="s625">And I went down there, and sure enough, there were.</span> <span id="s626">Nearly 400 of them in a hospital.</span> <span id="s627">They had been in a labor camp in Germany and the Germans who were really suicidal about Jews had put these women...more than 400, nearly a thousand....</span> <span id="s628">on to a train and sent the train east.</span> <span id="s629">Toward the end of the war, they did that with a lot of Jews.</span> <span id="s630">Their minds, I think, going like...we don't want the Americans to find them.</span> <span id="s631">It will be better for us if the Americans don't find them.</span> <span id="s632">These women got as far as Suchita when they couldn't get any more fuel for the train.</span> <span id="s633">So the engineer abandoned the train, and there they were.</span> <span id="s634">Somebody opened it up because they heard screams presumably, and they buried the dead and put the rest of them into this hospital.</span> <span id="s635">I went there and met these women.</span> <span id="s636">They wanted a service, so we had services, after which one young woman came up to me, introduced herself in quite good English, told me that she and her three sisters and three of their friends, all from Krakow, had been together through the war.</span> <span id="s637">Turns out that she mama'd this group and saved them through the war.</span> <span id="s638">And...uh...they wanted to get out of the hospital.</span> <span id="s639">Was there any place they could live?</span> <span id="s640">Because she had been offered a job with UNRRA, and one of the others was going to this, one of the others was going to do that.</span> <span id="s641">They all had plans for living in Suchison, so we got them a house.</span> <span id="s642">And...uh...they became my kids.</span> <span id="s643">Uh...The word kid is funny because Erna is really only about 5 years younger than I am, and the man she married was older than I. But...uh...They're my kinds.</span> <span id="s644">A little later...uh...the job situation was such that they would do better in the Bavarian town of Tishinroit, so they were moved to a house in Tishinroit, where they lived until they came to...well, 1946, Bronya, now Betty, married Henry and they moved to Australia where his only living relative was, and they are still there and we still correspond.</span> <span id="s645">I have not seen them since 1946.</span> <span id="s646">Uh...Dora, who was the housekeeper....she was the domesticated one of this crowd...married Borrof, and they disappeared in the wilds of Brooklyn, where he is a Hasid and does not permit his wife to have much to do with the rest of us.</span> <span id="s647">But Dora manages to call Erna periodically to make sure everybody is alright and to send her love.</span> <span id="s648">The other five have been together constantly ever since.</span> <span id="s649">They all came to the United States.</span> <span id="s650">They all married.</span> <span id="s651">Two of them...three of them married in Europe.</span> <span id="s652">I officiated at all three marriages.</span> <span id="s653">And...uh...some of the kids were born in Tirsenroit, including a pair of twins, who are now both M.D., Ph.Ds doing extraordinary work.</span> <span id="s654">Uh...They've remained my family to this day.</span> <span id="s655">Uh...Interestingly enough, the one who was not their sister...uh...married their uncle.</span> <span id="s656">They had a very uncle, and Maguska married him.</span> <span id="s657">So we've been through a lot of things.</span> <span id="s658">Births, Bar Mitzvah and a couple of deaths.</span> <span id="s659">Remarkably few deaths, I am glad to say.</span> <span id="s660">And we are still in routine communication.</span> <span id="s661">Uh...Erna's marriage was rather miraculous because in the concentration camp, she had met a woman who had said to her that she was absolutely perfect as a mate for her son.</span> <span id="s662">And after the war she married that son, a physician who had a successful practice in Syracuse.</span> <span id="s663">The coincidences are such.</span> <span id="s664">Anyhow, that's my …</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: We need to break tape.</span> <span id="s666">Let's change tapes at this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s668">Uh...We are still in Czechoslovakia, and you said there was a story that you wanted to tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: Not everything that happened in Czechoslovakia (clearing throat) or anywhere else was upbeat.</span> <span id="s670">There were problems.</span> <span id="s671">There were tragedies and there were horrors.</span> <span id="s672">Uh...I'll tell you a horror story just because it happened.</span> <span id="s673">The Karlov camp was our salvation, but there were problems there too.</span> <span id="s674">One middle of the night, I got a frantic call from Andy Dunn to come out immediately, so I went over to the camp.</span> <span id="s675">It seems...uh...a Kapo had turned up in the camp.</span> <span id="s676">A Kapo was a Jew who worked for the Germans or Poles in the concentration camp, and if the Jews hated anybody more than they hated Germans and Poles and other people, they hated Kapos.</span> <span id="s677">Somebody recognized this Kapo in Karlov that night, and they had killed him and they just tossed his body over the fence outside the camp, and the body had been found.</span> <span id="s678">And poor Andy didn't know what to do with a dead Kapo, and that was understandable.</span> <span id="s679">And...uh...It seemed to me that to inform the Czech authorities was a bad idea.</span> <span id="s680">So we just buried the guy.</span> <span id="s681">And...uh...he, like many other Jews, lies in an unmarked grave.</span> <span id="s682">My own feelings that night made that one of the low points of the entire 3 year experience in Germany.</span> <span id="s683">Uh...It's not my only Kapo experience.</span> <span id="s684">We had another one, but...that Jews could kill somebody, another Jew.</span> <span id="s685">No matter how terrible the other Jew was, with no due process of any kind, outraged me and upset me and scared me.</span> <span id="s686">But...uh.</span> <span id="s687">.</span> <span id="s688">it was another lesson to be learned.</span> <span id="s689">Let's go from that to a birth.</span> <span id="s690">A woman came to Sylvia, Hungarian Jewish girl who was very pregnant and who didn't want the baby.</span> <span id="s691">The father of the baby was a concentration camp guard.</span> <span id="s692">Following liberation she had met a man, a Hungarian, who wanted to marry her, only he wouldn't marry her with the baby.</span> <span id="s693">It didn't bother him that she was pregnant.</span> <span id="s694">After all, she had nothing to do with that really, but...uh... he wasn't going to raise that child and neither was she.</span> <span id="s695">What should we do with this baby about to be born?</span> <span id="s696">Sylvia said, "Give it to me.</span> <span id="s697">I will somehow get it to the United States.</span> <span id="s698">I have a sister who does not have children.</span> <span id="s699">That will be her child."</span> <span id="s700">And on June 1...July 1...July 1, 1945, this baby was born.</span> <span id="s701">A little girl.</span> <span id="s702">And the doctor who delivered her, I remember his name.</span> <span id="s703">Interestingly enough his son, who was very young at the time, became my friend because of this incident and the son died in California just about 2 weeks ago to my sorrow.</span> <span id="s704">Uh...Here was this baby.</span> <span id="s705">The mother agreed that she would keep the child until she was ready to leave for Hungary.</span> <span id="s706">Five days later she came into the club after 10 o'clock one night and said, "I can't do this.</span> <span id="s707">I have no interest in this baby.</span> <span id="s708">Why should I waste time looking after this kid?</span> <span id="s709">Here."</span> <span id="s710">And handed a baby to Sylvia.</span> <span id="s711">Sylvia and four Red Cross girls found themselves the mother of a 5 day old baby, and I became it's sort of surrogate father.</span> <span id="s712">The child lived in the Red Cross Club.</span> <span id="s713">The five women took care of her.</span> <span id="s714">The...uh...story of how we found... Well, bottles were easy.</span> <span id="s715">Coke bottles worked fine.</span> <span id="s716">You sterilize a coke bottle, and we had lots of coke bottles around.</span> <span id="s717">Nipples were harder to find.</span> <span id="s718">It took almost a whole day of tearing around Czechoslovakia until we found one nipple for this kid that would fit a coke bottle.</span> <span id="s719">That's part of the problem.</span> <span id="s720">(Laughter) It was big enough for a calf as a matter of fact, but the baby thrived on it which is what mattered.</span> <span id="s721">We had no trouble with the other necessities for a young baby.</span> <span id="s722">And then in very dramatic fashion...uh...Sylvia had to come home on emergency in the summer of 1945.</span> <span id="s723">Her father was desperately sick and did, in fact, die.</span> <span id="s724">So she got emergency leave to go home and she packed up the baby in a bed roll and took her along with her.</span> <span id="s725">When she got to Scotland to get on the Transatlantic plane they wanted...uh...baby's not on the manifest.</span> <span id="s726">And Sylvia said, "Who puts 2 month old babies on a manifest?"</span> <span id="s727">"Where did you get the child."</span> <span id="s728">"It's my child.</span> <span id="s729">I had a baby."</span> <span id="s730">And she bluffed her way through immigration into the United States.</span> <span id="s731">And her sister got the child and the child is, I understand, very healthy and alive.</span> <span id="s732">We changed her birthdate.</span> <span id="s733">On the birth certificate, which...uh...happened under extreme circumstances also, it must have been...oh...a year later, I guess.</span> <span id="s734">No....a year and a half later, I got a frantic letter from the child's mother saying, "We're trying to complete the adoption and the court will not put through the adoption without a birth certificate.</span> <span id="s735">Get me a birth certificate."</span> <span id="s736">The communist had taken over in Czechoslovakia and I wasn't about to go to Plzen trying to get a birth certification.</span> <span id="s737">So I went to my Commanding Officer and I said to him, "Colonel, is it true that all camp commanders and post commanders are notaries."</span> <span id="s738">"Yes."</span> <span id="s739">"Would you notarize a document for me?"</span> <span id="s740">"Yes."</span> <span id="s741">So in my name, I wrote a statement about the circumstances of this child's birth, never alluding to the child's name or mother because I wasn't going to lie...uh...not in a sworn affidavit.</span> <span id="s742">I'm a funny American...uh...in view of the stories I am telling you, it sounds strange that I would lie in an affidavit, but I didn't want to.</span> <span id="s743">So I wrote it very carefully.</span> <span id="s744">Told the circumstances of the child's birth and the movement to the United States, and...uh...civil affairs were not exactly in order Plzen in July of 1945 and there was no birth certificate, and would the court please accept this sworn affidavit in lieu of a birth certificate, and they did.</span> <span id="s745">And so the adoption was completed.</span> <span id="s746">Uh...That's one of my nice stories.</span> <span id="s747">I hope you can get to Sylvia to get the rest of it because she tells it beautifully and I don't want to tell more because the young lady is around.</span> <span id="s748">The young lady and I have no contact whatsoever.</span> <span id="s749">I have not tried to keep these kinds of contacts.</span> <span id="s750">Okay.</span> <span id="s751">Let's now go to the USO.</span> <span id="s752">We'll finish up Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s753">USO tours were very important, especially during the occupation period.</span> <span id="s754">American soldiers were bored, and these entertainers came and...uh...you know, you've seen television pictures of Bob Hope and the crowd he gets.</span> <span id="s755">Well, every group that came over, no matter how mediocre got this kind of reception.</span> <span id="s756">I was called in by our special services officer in Plzen and asked if I could do them a favor.</span> <span id="s757">I said, "What do you want?"</span> <span id="s758">He said, "Well, we have a strange USO group coming over.</span> <span id="s759">They have let it be known that they will not under any circumstances do the job they're being sent here to do, namely to entertain American troops, unless they can also go to Jewish displaced persons groups.</span> <span id="s760">And they're important people.</span> <span id="s761">So I want to indulge them.</span> <span id="s762">Can you help me."</span> <span id="s763">I said, "Yal.</span> <span id="s764">I can help you.</span> <span id="s765">I can make arrangement for concerts and appearances in Jewish DP camps."</span> <span id="s766">"Alright, they are arriving day after tomorrow.</span> <span id="s767">WIll you meet them at the hotel?"</span> <span id="s768">"Yes."</span> <span id="s769">And I walked into a room which contained, and now I am name dropping, the only time I shall do this I hope, Ingrid Bergman, Jack Benny, Larry Addler, the world's greatest harmonica player and Martha Tilton of whom I had never heard till then, but who turns out to be a very good pop singer.</span> <span id="s770">And...uh...they said to me that they wanted to do this.</span> <span id="s771">I said, "What do you want to do for these Jews?"</span> <span id="s772">"Leave that up to us."</span> <span id="s773">And I took them in a command car for one solid week during the day.</span> <span id="s774">After all American troops could not be entertained...until 11:00 in the morning or 2:00 in the afternoon, they were supposed to be working.</span> <span id="s775">But Jews were sitting around.</span> <span id="s776">They spent their days entertaining Jews, and their evenings entertaining American troops.</span> <span id="s777">And they were magnificent.</span> <span id="s778">They were absolutely superb.</span> <span id="s779">Jack Benny's Yiddish was quite good.</span> <span id="s780">Larry Addler's Yiddish was quite good.</span> <span id="s781">Uh...Ingrid Bergman talked to them in a broken kind of German which she broke deliberately so they wouldn't think it was Yiddish, and (laughter) they knew it wasn't and...uh...I had a wonderful time for a week.</span> <span id="s782">I really did.</span> <span id="s783">I was...uh...the only spectator at about 1 o'clock one morning to a recital in which Jack Benny played the piano and Larry Addler played the violin.</span> <span id="s784">I wish I had a tape of that one.</span> <span id="s785">I wish the world had a tape of it.</span> <span id="s786">It was a really spectacular experience, and I developed enormous regard for those four people because they really knocked themselves out for these Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s788">Uh...You were done with your Czech tour in Czechoslovakia and you were sent to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: I was exiled to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: You were exiled to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s792">I was...uh...assigned to the 4th Armored Division, one of its combat commands.</span> <span id="s793">In those days a armored division consisted of three combat commands.</span> <span id="s794">I was assigned to one of them in a little town not far from Regensburg.</span> <span id="s795">And...uh...it didn't take long to find Jews.</span> <span id="s796">There were 2,000 of them in Regensburg, not under UNRRA auspices, which means they needed everything in the world and we had to work there.</span> <span id="s797">One of the things we got them was a building, a Jewish Center.</span> <span id="s798">It had an auditorium.</span> <span id="s799">It had offices cause they organized.</span> <span id="s800">Two thousand Jews are either organized or you have chaos.</span> <span id="s801">One or the other!</span> <span id="s802">By this time, incidentally, it's the very end of August 1945.</span> <span id="s803">And I was very worried.</span> <span id="s804">We had inadequate food for these people and no money to get food.</span> <span id="s805">I had written to the JVC in Paris, trying to get money and we could buy food, and...uh...was told no, this was not the way they wanted to do business, that they would be coming in with their people and they would take care of everything.</span> <span id="s806">Meanwhile, we had hungry Jews.</span> <span id="s807">Uh...I guess the first thing to tell you is the meeting of Chaplains, which happened shortly after I got to Regensburg or... I am going to call it Regensburg.</span> <span id="s808">It was really a little town called Zoul, but it doesn't matter.</span> <span id="s809">Uh...Got instructions to be Munich at a certain time to meet with the Chair of the Commission of Army and Navy Chaplaincy of the Jewish Welfare Board of the late Rabbi Joseph Lipstein, an orthodox rabbi, and with Rabbi who was a director of that commission, who was a reform rabbi.</span> <span id="s810">And we all gathered in this hotel room in Munich.</span> <span id="s811">My guess is there were probably 30 or 40 of us.</span> <span id="s812">Uh...There were about 90 Jewish Chaplains in the American Zones, but they weren't...he didn't meet them all at once.</span> <span id="s813">He had met some in Frankfurt and he met them...I don't know where else.</span> <span id="s814">But he met us in Munich, and that was the first time I had seen Klausner...uh...since Dachau because I had just gotten back to Germany, and had not had a chance to go down in Munich to see him.</span> <span id="s815">And...uh...I'll never forget Lipstein.</span> <span id="s816">He greeted us and he said, "Now Gentlemen, my report to the Jewish Welfare Board on Chaplain activities, I wrote on the plane coming over.</span> <span id="s817">It was easy.</span> <span id="s818">Now I want to know, and if you trust me, don't hold back.</span> <span id="s819">Tell me what's going on."</span> <span id="s820">And we looked at one another, and we decided we'd tell him.</span> <span id="s821">So we told him.</span> <span id="s822">We had lots of problems, and nothing to deal with them with.</span> <span id="s823">Uh...Abe was the most outspoken and said the most because he had the most experience by then.</span> <span id="s824">I should tell you that by then, you see, he had organized the Central Committee of Displaced Persons in the U.S. zone of which he was the president.</span> <span id="s825">And he had departments set up.</span> <span id="s826">They were doing health work.</span> <span id="s827">They were getting food and clothing where they could scrounge it, and I guess most of important of all, they were doing a relative search.</span> <span id="s828">Uh...Abe published five volumes of names of survivors which sat in Munich in the old Dorchus museum which was his office then and on the walls of this building...I wish we had pictures of it...I think he does...are the names of thousands of Jews and where to find them so they could find relatives.</span> <span id="s829">And relatives were found this way.</span> <span id="s830">It was a very inefficient way, but it was the only way we had so we used it.</span> <span id="s831">And...uh.</span> <span id="s832">.</span> <span id="s833">during that meeting with Lipstein not participating, the chaplains decided that our people had a right to clothing, and they weren't getting it and there was no indication that when JDC or anybody else would come in to give people clothing who weren't in DP camps.</span> <span id="s834">And even in some DP camps they didn't have clothing.</span> <span id="s835">They particularly didn't have clothing for children.</span> <span id="s836">Our people were beginning to have kids if you can count.</span> <span id="s837">And...uh...we decided we would use a technique which was legal which the Army permitted.</span> <span id="s838">You in the United States could send to any soldier anywhere in the world a 11-pound package of food and or clothing...uh...to his A.P.O. number, and you could send as many as you wanted.</span> <span id="s839">So each of us wrote letters, and we sent them to everybody we knew.</span> <span id="s840">I sent them to every Rabbi I knew.</span> <span id="s841">I sent them to my family.</span> <span id="s842">I have a large family, and all my friends and everybody else I could think of.</span> <span id="s843">Send packages.</span> <span id="s844">And God helps us, they began to come in.</span> <span id="s845">Tons.</span> <span id="s846">By the end of October 1945, I had 80 people working full time in a warehouse in Regensburg on just the stuff addressed to me, sorting this clothing, throwing away some of it I am sorry to say or using it for smotas and fixing that which was repairable and getting it cleaned and once a week I visited all of the 31 camps and communities in my part of north Bavaria delivering sacks of this stuff.</span> <span id="s847">I began to worry about my post office.</span> <span id="s848">So I went to my postal officer and I said, "People in the United States are sending me a lot of stuff as you know."</span> <span id="s849">He said, "Yes, Chaplain, I am aware of it."</span> <span id="s850">I said, "How about it if I make it easy on you and I send a truck down here everyday to pick up the stuff so you don't have to deliver it."</span> <span id="s851">"Oh, that will be wonderful.</span> <span id="s852">Thank you."</span> <span id="s853">He didn't ask a question.</span> <span id="s854">I didn't give him any information.</span> <span id="s855">(laughing) I just sent the truck, and we got our stuff.</span> <span id="s856">Absolutely incredible quantities.</span> <span id="s857">Tons and tons of clothing.</span> <span id="s858">Now people began to ask questions.</span> <span id="s859">We give contributions to the Joint Distribution Committee which is supposed to be doing relief work all over the world.</span> <span id="s860">How come we get asked by the Rabbis for these packages?</span> <span id="s861">And that must have been....must have been embarrassing to JDC but by that time, I am afraid we weren't very sympathetic.</span> <span id="s862">Uh...When they came in, they came into my territory...uh...no...they came into Munch in August...three social workers.</span> <span id="s863">Not carrying a stitch of anything with them, and no budget for anything.</span> <span id="s864">Klausner got them him a house.</span> <span id="s865">As he had a house in Munich and he brought them into his house, and that became their headquarters cause they had no place to work.</span> <span id="s866">They were credited to UNRRA, but UNRRA didn't supply them with anything.</span> <span id="s867">It wasn't UNRRA's job.</span> <span id="s868">It was their job to be supplying.</span> <span id="s869">These people were absolutely unprepared for what they were going to do.</span> <span id="s870">They didn't know anything about relative search.</span> <span id="s871">They didn't know anything about getting people out, if you could get people out.</span> <span id="s872">They had not been trained.</span> <span id="s873">Of course, neither had we.</span> <span id="s874">One of the astounding facts of my life is that those of us who went to Europe got absolutely no orientation from anybody about what we were going to find when we got there.</span> <span id="s875">None.</span> <span id="s876">Not from the JWB, which...whose job it wasn't, but not from the other agencies either who really might have gotten a hold of us before we left and said, "Hey, you're going to run into A, B, C. and D, and contact so and so and so and so, and at least know the address of the JDC office in Paris which none of us had.</span> <span id="s877">So...uh...those relationships...uh... were either strained or good, depending on the personnel.</span> <span id="s878">Two of the three people who came to Munich were magnificent as people.</span> <span id="s879">Ceil Wineburg, I shall always...married a man...uh...died in Detroit, was superb.</span> <span id="s880">And she wouldn't leave Europe.</span> <span id="s881">She got so attached to those people and their needs that she must have stayed 5 years.</span> <span id="s882">Uh...The other one, a girl named Debbie, I am sorry to say died in Europe...uh...a defective heating stove...uh...in her room.</span> <span id="s883">This happened in 1946.</span> <span id="s884">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: Another thing we had to do...</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: Tell me more about JDC and this.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: (Sigh) Well, I was lucky.</span> <span id="s888">In late October, early November, there came to Regensburg, a full time JDC person named Joe Levine, who now lives in Fort Wayne, Indiana, deeply devoted, cared about these people and did everything in the world that could be done.</span> <span id="s889">He even learned how to scrounge, and he learned how to steal, and he learned how to send for this and that not through JDC channels, and eventually JDC managed to get stuff in.</span> <span id="s890">I mean it didn't stay this way forever.</span> <span id="s891">But those...that first year was pretty horrendous and Joe was as frustrated as I was.</span> <span id="s892">Fortunately, we became very close friends and we were on the same wave length from beginning to end.</span> <span id="s893">We are still good friends, by the way.</span> <span id="s894">High Holidays, 1945, I must tell you.</span> <span id="s895">Had to do something.</span> <span id="s896">Not only for soldiers, but for displaced persons as well.</span> <span id="s897">And I decided that they were decided...that they were entitled to have a break fast at the end of Yom Kippur which would be traditional.</span> <span id="s898">What do you need for a break fast?</span> <span id="s899">Herring.</span> <span id="s900">You gotta have herring.</span> <span id="s901">Without herring you can't do it.</span> <span id="s902">How do you get herring?</span> <span id="s903">There's no herring in Regensburg.</span> <span id="s904">Legal, illegal, no herring.</span> <span id="s905">So I cabled military to a Chaplain friend in England and said, I need a big barrel of salt herring, enough for 2,000 people for break fast.</span> <span id="s906">One day in August...late August, 1945, beginning September, I don't remember the dates at this point, I got a phone call.</span> <span id="s907">Munich airstrip.</span> <span id="s908">"Are you Chaplain Lipman?"</span> <span id="s909">"At the end of our runway is the biggest God Dam barrel (you'll have to censor that) I have seen and it stinks."</span> <span id="s910">"I'll be right down."</span> <span id="s911">(Laughter) I put my trailer on my jeep, and I went to the air strip and we unloaded what was an enormous barrel.</span> <span id="s912">You think of a barrel as this big.</span> <span id="s913">It was three times that big.</span> <span id="s914">Was almost as tall as I.</span> <span id="s915">We couldn't lift it.</span> <span id="s916">It had to be rolled.</span> <span id="s917">And I took it up to Ragensberg, and said, "Now what do I do with it?</span> <span id="s918">How do I make this into pickled herring, because it was old salt herring, in brine, untouched.</span> <span id="s919">It had its heads.</span> <span id="s920">It had had its scales.</span> <span id="s921">It had everything.</span> <span id="s922">Then I got an idea.</span> <span id="s923">My commanding officer was a Colonel Koen.</span> <span id="s924">We were not friends, I am sorry to say.</span> <span id="s925">He should rest in peace.</span> <span id="s926">Harold Kone was not very Jewish.</span> <span id="s927">He was part of the famous teams of Abrahams in Kone.</span> <span id="s928">The 4th Armored Division had been hell on wheels for the Germans.</span> <span id="s929">They had hated the 4th Armored, and they particularly Abrahams and Koen.</span> <span id="s930">They thought they were both Jews.</span> <span id="s931">Abrahams was the late General Kritein, Abrahams of Viet Nam fame who was then a Colonel, and was Harold Koen's commander.</span> <span id="s932">He commanded the combat command.</span> <span id="s933">Harold...No, he commanded the regiment.</span> <span id="s934">Harold had the combat command.</span> <span id="s935">Harold Koen taught Kreitein Abrahams some Yiddish and to the extent they could on their walky talkies, they talked Yiddish.</span> <span id="s936">And the Germans called them terrible names, these two Jews.</span> <span id="s937">But that was as Jewish as Harold Koen got.</span> <span id="s938">He was not interested in me.</span> <span id="s939">He was not interested in what I was doing, and so we kept away from each other.</span> <span id="s940">I went in to him and I said, "Harold, I need something, and maybe this will appeal to you.</span> <span id="s941">I need some PWs, a bunch of them for a whole day."</span> <span id="s942">"What for?"</span> <span id="s943">I said, "To clean herring."</span> <span id="s944">And he said, "What?"</span> <span id="s945">I said, "Yal, I got a barrel of herring here, a big barrel for both our troops and for the Jews in Regensburg for Yom Kippur."</span> <span id="s946">And he said, "Oh, how beautiful."</span> <span id="s947">We had a PW cage for high ranking officers.</span> <span id="s948">He gave me 10 Colonels, 10 Nazi Colonels, who arrived in step in uniform, and I said to them, "Gentlemen, I suggest to you that you take off as much of your uniforms as you can because the task you have is not going to be exactly..." "We are forbidden to do menial labor.</span> <span id="s949">We are officers."</span> <span id="s950">I said, "I am aware of that, and we will keep the Geneva Convention.</span> <span id="s951">We will not smash it.</span> <span id="s952">We may bend it a bit before the day is over."</span> <span id="s953">I sat them down on relatively low stools with big buckets in front of them, put the barrel of herring in front of them, and said, "Gentlemen, you are to cut off the heads.</span> <span id="s954">You are scale it.</span> <span id="s955">You are to gut it.</span> <span id="s956">And then put it into these buckets of water."</span> <span id="s957">They refused.</span> <span id="s958">And I said, "Here's the written order from Colonel Koen.</span> <span id="s959">I am not sure what you can do about it.</span> <span id="s960">You are, after all, prisoners of war."</span> <span id="s961">They sat down and they spent 10 hours...it was a pretty hot day...cleaning herring.</span> <span id="s962">I loved every minute of it.</span> <span id="s963">I was a sadistic so and so.</span> <span id="s964">Koen must have come out 10 times to watch it.</span> <span id="s965">He had a marvelous time that day.</span> <span id="s966">And then when they went back...uh...the herring having been cleaned, they demanded baths.</span> <span id="s967">And the camp commander said, "But it's not your bath day.</span> <span id="s968">You'll get your bath day on your bath day."</span> <span id="s969">And so these guys walked around reeking of herring for I don't know how many days until their bath day came, and I must tell you I had no compassion.</span> <span id="s970">I confess that I am not that human, or humane.</span> <span id="s971">So we made enormous quantities of pickled herring.</span> <span id="s972">I found some other things that the commissary or the... our supply group was willing to let me steal and then I got 4,000 donuts from our Red Cross people.</span> <span id="s973">Had lots and lots and lots of coffee and all the rest of it.</span> <span id="s974">And then I got a break.</span> <span id="s975">The 4th Armored Division was a New York Division and organized at Camp Pine.</span> <span id="s976">And of its 10,000 people when it was full strength, almost 15 hundred were Jews.</span> <span id="s977">It had the highest casualty rates in Jews of any unit in the United States Army I suspect because 4th Armored had been through very heavy combat.</span> <span id="s978">Between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, the high point men got their orders to go home.</span> <span id="s979">I had over a thousand men at Rosh Hashanah services.</span> <span id="s980">I had 80 at Yom Kippur services.</span> <span id="s981">They had left me.</span> <span id="s982">(Laughter) They had gone home.</span> <span id="s983">I was delighted for them.</span> <span id="s984">I was delighted for another reason too.</span> <span id="s985">I had that much more food for my DPs.</span> <span id="s986">We finished early.</span> <span id="s987">I deliberately started services early and finished early, so we could all get into Regensburg.</span> <span id="s988">And all these guys that wanted to go...some of them drove trucks for me...had this food all loaded and we went into Regensburg and we parked our trucks in front of the Jewish Center where the Jews were dining.</span> <span id="s989">And...uh...somebody looked in one of the trucks.</span> <span id="s990">They didn't know I was coming.</span> <span id="s991">I had not told them we were bringing a meal.</span> <span id="s992">And I am not sure they ever finished the meal that day.</span> <span id="s993">They unloaded those trucks faster than I have ever seen trucks unloaded, and that food disappeared.</span> <span id="s994">I stood in there.</span> <span id="s995">I had such a wonderful time watching these people break fast as you're supposed to break fast.</span> <span id="s996">It was a quite memorable experience.</span> <span id="s997">Lots of other adventures in Regensburg,...uh...including my second kapo.</span> <span id="s998">I came into the center one day, and they were screaming and yelling at this poor, bedraggled looking Jew who was a kapo, and I said, "You are not going to do anything in this center."</span> <span id="s999">And we asked questions.</span> <span id="s1000">The guy admitted that he had been a kapo, so we had no trouble with that.</span> <span id="s1001">And I said to the Jews, "Was being a kapo a war crime?"</span> <span id="s1002">"Yes."</span> <span id="s1003">"What do we do with war criminals?</span> <span id="s1004">We try them.</span> <span id="s1005">I am taking this Jew to military government, and I am having him arrested as a war criminal and the Allied Armies will try this war criminal as we are trying war criminals and you won't touch him."</span> <span id="s1006">And they screamed and they yelled I was a traitor.</span> <span id="s1007">They were going to kill this guy.</span> <span id="s1008">The least they could do was get there vengeance, etc., etc., etc.</span> <span id="s1009">And I said to my assistant, a wonderful Jew named Si Pova, who lives in Hartford, Connecticut.</span> <span id="s1010">He's a social worker.</span> <span id="s1011">He raised an orthodox family.</span> <span id="s1012">He was 19 years old.</span> <span id="s1013">They called him , Simon, the righteous one.</span> <span id="s1014">And he was.</span> <span id="s1015">Si must have worked 20 hours a day, 6 days a week for these people.</span> <span id="s1016">He was absolutely magnificent.</span> <span id="s1017">I said to Si, "Si, you have to do something.</span> <span id="s1018">Don't say anything.</span> <span id="s1019">Just go, unhook your carbine out of the rack in the jeep and bring it up here."</span> <span id="s1020">And he did.</span> <span id="s1021">And I said to the Jews, "Si, here has a gun.</span> <span id="s1022">Wouldn't it be terrible if he had to use it.</span> <span id="s1023">But we want to use it rather than let you kill this Jew."</span> <span id="s1024">And we marched the Jew out and turned him over the military government, and I can't tell you what became of him.</span> <span id="s1025">That was my war criminal.</span> <span id="s1026">It took awhile for the people in Regensburg to forgive me.</span> <span id="s1027">They were very angry, and I understand their anger.</span> <span id="s1028">But that's what...our Hasidic style.</span> <span id="s1029">We changed hats and we danced and we went absolutely bananas and 5 o'clock in the afternoon when I went back to my hotel....I managed to stagger in...uh...they had finished yet because they had danced so long.</span> <span id="s1030">And...uh...I had an incident with my antiªHasidic grandfather as a result of that day.</span> <span id="s1031">I made a mistake.</span> <span id="s1032">Before I sobered up, I wrote him a letter, telling him of the wonderful time I had had with those people and that I wanted to see more of them.</span> <span id="s1033">He wrote me back.</span> <span id="s1034">We corresponded always in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1035">From the time that I was 7 years old, I got only Hebrew letters from my grandfather, who figured I was smart enough to get somebody to translate them for me for the parts I couldn't translate myself.</span> <span id="s1036">And he had beautiful handwriting.</span> <span id="s1037">So I got this letter by return mail which sort of crinkled the edges of the paper in which he said, "I have your letter.</span> <span id="s1038">I want to remind you of something.</span> <span id="s1039">When you wrote me to Jerusalem that you had decided to become a reform Rabbi I didn't argue with you.</span> <span id="s1040">I thought about it.</span> <span id="s1041">After all, your father was a businessman and an atheist.</span> <span id="s1042">At least, you weren't going in either of those directions.</span> <span id="s1043">To become a Rabbi, even a reform Rabbi you would have to study.</span> <span id="s1044">You would know something, which is more than most Jews did, so remember I didn't fight with you.</span> <span id="s1045">But, if you become a Hasid, don't come home.</span> <span id="s1046">And he signed the thing.</span> <span id="s1047">(Laughter) One of my favorite all-time letters from the old man.</span> <span id="s1048">Okay.</span> <span id="s1049">We now move into...uh...November.</span> <span id="s1050">We got theater orders that any Chaplain who could was to report to Paris in time for a theater wide memorial service on November 11, the speaker at which would be David Ben-Gurion, and it would be held in the Synagogue in Paris.</span> <span id="s1051">And I didn't want to go.</span> <span id="s1052">Joe and I had a lot of things going, 31 camps and communities...uh...the package system is working.</span> <span id="s1053">I'll have to tell you about the mail system which was also working.</span> <span id="s1054">I didn't really want to go.</span> <span id="s1055">And my Senior Chaplain said, "Gene, go."</span> <span id="s1056">I said, "Why?"</span> <span id="s1057">He said, "You're too tired.</span> <span id="s1058">You don't look good.</span> <span id="s1059">Just don't like the way you look."</span> <span id="s1060">And Si Pava said, "You're pain a neck these days.</span> <span id="s1061">You're irritable.</span> <span id="s1062">You're terrible.</span> <span id="s1063">Go to Paris."</span> <span id="s1064">said, "Pava, you just want to go to Paris."</span> <span id="s1065">He says, "I want to be at that service.</span> <span id="s1066">I ought to be there."</span> <span id="s1067">And I said, "Pava, you've earned the right.</span> <span id="s1068">Let's go."</span> <span id="s1069">So we went.</span> <span id="s1070">Snowed the whole bloody way across Europe.</span> <span id="s1071">We had to go by jeep.</span> <span id="s1072">There was no other way to go and...uh...it was not exactly a happy, happy ride, but we made it.</span> <span id="s1073">And one of the most frigid experiences of my entire life was that service at the Synagogue.</span> <span id="s1074">Not the atmosphere, but it was cold.</span> <span id="s1075">There was no heat in this synagogue.</span> <span id="s1076">We were all sitting there in our gray coats, and Ben Gurion hung a on us.</span> <span id="s1077">He made a long, long speech.</span> <span id="s1078">I had been instructed by my Berichah people to see Ruth Kluger in Paris, at the Haganah office.</span> <span id="s1079">Haganah had an office in Paris.</span> <span id="s1080">European headquarters.</span> <span id="s1081">So I wondered in there, and we were talking, Ruth and I, about what was going on in Germany and Czechoslovakia and what we needed and how we could do a better job of moving Jews when her phone rang.</span> <span id="s1082">And from the conversation at my...at our end, it was clear that she was talking to Judge Simon Riskin who had arrived...I don't remember how many weeks earlier...as the advisor to General Eisenhower on Jewish Affairs, with a rank of Lieutenant General.</span> <span id="s1083">And they were talking about a deal which Ben Guron had made with Eisenhower just before Ben Guron came to Paris for the service.</span> <span id="s1084">The deal in which teachers would be sent from Palestine to the DP camps to teach Hebrew, to teach agronomy.</span> <span id="s1085">All of those teachers would be Haganah people, and the Army would try to turn its back to the maximum possible extent to let them operate.</span> <span id="s1086">Eisenhower asked one thing.</span> <span id="s1087">You will not bribe any American soldier.</span> <span id="s1088">You will not corrupt my men.</span> <span id="s1089">I'll help you get around them, but you're not going through them.</span> <span id="s1090">And Ben-Gurion thought that made good sense.</span> <span id="s1091">So they wanted to get going.</span> <span id="s1092">The Army had an airplane ready to go to...uh...what is now Ben Guron airport, then called Lud• to pick up the first group to bring them.</span> <span id="s1093">And it suddenly occurred to Judge Riskin that an American crew flying into Lud wouldn't know what to do with itself when it got there.</span> <span id="s1094">That some liaison person was necessary, and Ruth agreed that a liaison person was necessary.</span> <span id="s1095">And she looked at me and suddenly she said to Judge Riskin, "I think I have the person sitting right here.</span> <span id="s1096">Shall I put him on the phone."</span> <span id="s1097">And I introduced myself and Judge Riskin• said, "If Ruth thinks you're the person to do this, then it's alright with me.</span> <span id="s1098">Can you be here tomorrow morning?"</span> <span id="s1099">I said, "If I drive all night, I can."</span> <span id="s1100">He said, "So drive all night."</span> <span id="s1101">Lieutenant Generals are like this, and Simon Riskin is like this too.</span> <span id="s1102">He's a very blunt...uh...guy who had given up a place on a Federal District bench, a life appointment, to take on this temporary thing, to work for Eisenhower and do Jewish things.</span> <span id="s1103">He was wonderful.</span> <span id="s1104">So I found Si with no trouble.</span> <span id="s1105">We had a terrible time finding our other driver who was carousing Paris, but we caught up with him and we loaded him in the back of the jeep because he couldn't drive and the two of us drove all night.</span> <span id="s1106">We reported to Judge Riskin in Frankfort the next morning.</span> <span id="s1107">Uh...the morning following that, I was on a B-17, with a crew of five Americans heading for... Uh...Bewildered.</span> <span id="s1108">Excited.</span> <span id="s1109">I had my orders from General Walter Bedel Smith, and they were for 7 days.</span> <span id="s1110">Okay?</span> <span id="s1111">So I got into Delist.</span> <span id="s1112">Got to Jerusalem, and discovered nothing was ready.</span> <span id="s1113">Uh...Our Israel friends will all forgive me, but the Middle East is not exactly the most efficient place in the world to do business.</span> <span id="s1114">Not then and not now.</span> <span id="s1115">Uh...I went to meetings and tried to get things going.</span> <span id="s1116">There was no way to get those people out in 7 days.</span> <span id="s1117">But I got a lot of questions that had to be answered in Germany.</span> <span id="s1118">So we flew back to Germany, went into conference with the various people at headquarters that were going to deal with this thing and...uh...got answers and flew back again.</span> <span id="s1119">I made two trips in about 2 weeks I guess it was.</span> <span id="s1120">My second trip was not long before Hanukkah.</span> <span id="s1121">And...uh...while we were getting my 14 people organized, a couple of incidents are worth mentioning.</span> <span id="s1122">First, my 7 day orders, the 7th day was a Shabbat.</span> <span id="s1123">It was alright with me.</span> <span id="s1124">I was under military orders and you do things under military orders.</span> <span id="s1125">But 4 of my 14 teachers so-called were orthodox Jews.</span> <span id="s1126">They refused to fly on Shabbat.</span> <span id="s1127">And I said, "What will give you permission to fly on Shabbat?"</span> <span id="s1128">And they said, "Written authorization from the Chief Rabbi."</span> <span id="s1129">I said, "Okay."</span> <span id="s1130">So I called the Chief Rabbi's office and I talked with a gentleman who is now the President of Israel, the Chief Rabbi's son, who was then his secretary.</span> <span id="s1131">I told him what I wanted and he laughed and he said, "All of us are gonna have fun with that one."</span> <span id="s1132">And...uh...he invited me for Shebot dinner and I didn't accept because I was having Shabbat dinner with the men who was really the political head of the Haganah, the first foreign minister of Israel, who I am delighted to say became Esther's and my very good friend.</span> <span id="s1133">Uh...We loved him dearly.</span> <span id="s1134">And I remember President Hertzog saying, isn't going to like that.</span> <span id="s1135">You don't turn down an invitation to the Rabbi's dish."</span> <span id="s1136">And I said, "One is also not rude.</span> <span id="s1137">One has to have .</span> <span id="s1138">And I had accepted another invitation.</span> <span id="s1139">Now would the Chief Rabbi call Sharet and give him reasons for me not to go to Sharet's for Shabbat dinner?"</span> <span id="s1140">He said, "No, the Chief Rabbi will not do that."</span> <span id="s1141">I said, "Fine.</span> <span id="s1142">You'll give my apologies to the Rabbi.</span> <span id="s1143">I have no choice whatsoever."</span> <span id="s1144">But I went there late Friday afternoon, and the Rabbi's little synagogue and had an interview with him before .</span> <span id="s1145">His first question to me...he spoke Hebrew and English and Yiddish with an Irish accent.</span> <span id="s1146">He had been Chief Rabbi in Dublin before he went to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1147">Charming, wonderful little man.</span> <span id="s1148">His first question to me was, "Is it true that you are Morris Neman's nephew?"</span> <span id="s1149">And I said, "How did you ever hear of Morris Neman?"</span> <span id="s1150">And he said, "We know things out here."</span> <span id="s1151">I said, "Yes.</span> <span id="s1152">I am his nephew."</span> <span id="s1153">And he said, "You can't be all bad, even if you're a reform Rabbi."</span> <span id="s1154">I said, "Thank you for nothing."</span> <span id="s1155">(Laughter) He gave me the piece of paper authorizing these guys to go on the grounds it was .</span> <span id="s1156">Human life was involved, and they had to fly out on Shabbat or not fly out.</span> <span id="s1157">I would have to go without because I wasn't going to get court martialed for this bunch or anybody else.</span> <span id="s1158">So we left on Shabbat.</span> <span id="s1159">Chief Rabbi was wonderful.</span> <span id="s1160">I was carrying with me not only 14 somewhat scared Jews, but the most peculiar package I have ever carried in my life.</span> <span id="s1161">I had been called and asked to come and see a man named Caplan, who was the treasurer of the Jewish Agency, First Minister of Finance, with the Government of Israel in 1948.</span> <span id="s1162">I walked into his office.</span> <span id="s1163">This was before my meeting with the Chief Rabbi.</span> <span id="s1164">And he said, "Are you really Morris Neman's nephew?"</span> <span id="s1165">I said, "Yes," and he offered me condolences because as it happens Morris had died in September of 45.</span> <span id="s1166">One of the first things I did in Jerusalem was go to the walls and say kottish for him.</span> <span id="s1167">He was a great Zionist in Pittsburgh.</span> <span id="s1168">A magnificent, magnificent man.</span> <span id="s1169">My favorite uncle.</span> <span id="s1170">So he said, "Okay, then I'll trust you."</span> <span id="s1171">He said, "I want you to do something for me.</span> <span id="s1172">I want you to take a package to Paris.</span> <span id="s1173">I said, "But I am not going to Paris."</span> <span id="s1174">He said, "If you take this package you are."</span> <span id="s1175">I said, "What will be in the package?"</span> <span id="s1176">And he said, "A quarter of a million dollars."</span> <span id="s1177">I said, "That's too big a package."</span> <span id="s1178">(laughter) for my purposes.</span> <span id="s1179">He says, "No, it will fit in your shaving kit."</span> <span id="s1180">I said, "How?"</span> <span id="s1181">He said, "Because it's going to be in gold sovereigns.</span> <span id="s1182">It's the budget for the Paris office for the next period of time."</span> <span id="s1183">And I said, "Alright.</span> <span id="s1184">So I'll get court martialed.</span> <span id="s1185">What can I do?"</span> <span id="s1186">And he took me through a door and through another door into a room that consisted of shelves, each one of which was marked with a country.</span> <span id="s1187">All currency.</span> <span id="s1188">This was the Jewish Agency's private treasury of foreign currency.</span> <span id="s1189">I don't know how much money was there.</span> <span id="s1190">No idea.</span> <span id="s1191">All I know is that he was correct.</span> <span id="s1192">I got a quarter of million dollars in gold sovereigns into my docket.</span> <span id="s1193">Then I wondered, "How'll I pull this off?</span> <span id="s1194">I am going to have to trust one of my pilots.</span> <span id="s1195">And I got hold of the Major and I said to him, "Look.</span> <span id="s1196">I am going to do something very dangerous.</span> <span id="s1197">I am going to tell you something you don't want to know and I don't want to tell you, but I need you.</span> <span id="s1198">I need you in two ways.</span> <span id="s1199">I need you to protect me.</span> <span id="s1200">I am going to be walking around for the rest of the time we are Palestine with my dock kit in my hands, and I don't anybody to ask why.</span> <span id="s1201">And I don't want anybody to take it because it is money in it.</span> <span id="s1202">A lot of money."</span> <span id="s1203">"Okay, Chappy.</span> <span id="s1204">It's alright with me."</span> <span id="s1205">I said, "Second of all, you are to arrange an emergency that makes us land in Paris for 1 hour."</span> <span id="s1206">"That's not as easy," he said.</span> <span id="s1207">I said, "You'll do it though."</span> <span id="s1208">I let them know approximately when we would be coming in, and we were met at the airport by a man who became one of my most beloved friends, Efriam Decal who is second in command of the was the boss and Decal was his second.</span> <span id="s1209">Decal has written extensively about the Berichah and about all sorts of things.</span> <span id="s1210">He...uh...has died.</span> <span id="s1211">His wife is still living I am glad to say.</span> <span id="s1212">I just handed him this, and he, in effect, said thank you.</span> <span id="s1213">(Laughter) That was our first meeting.</span> <span id="s1214">We became friends later.</span> <span id="s1215">And we flew back to Germany.</span> <span id="s1216">And we got away with it, which was alright.</span> <span id="s1217">We had something else on board, about which I was very sentimental and still am.</span> <span id="s1218">I was invited to a meeting of the Vodlume, which is the National assembly of the Ishuf, headed by...uh...Ben , who became the second President of Israel.</span> <span id="s1219">And I met all the people who are legendary.</span> <span id="s1220">You name them and they were all sitting there, and I was introduced to all of them.</span> <span id="s1221">And Ben said, "I need a favor."</span> <span id="s1222">"What."</span> <span id="s1223">The school children of Israel had been making Hanukiyot for the children of the DP camps in Germany.</span> <span id="s1224">We have 36,000 of them.</span> <span id="s1225">And we have candles.</span> <span id="s1226">We don't know how to get them to Germany.</span> <span id="s1227">Nobody ever thought of that.</span> <span id="s1228">I understand, he said, that you are flying in a bomber.</span> <span id="s1229">I said, "Yes, and my bomber has bomb bays, and I think it would be very nice if we filled the bomb bays of a B-17 with Hanukiyot and candles."</span> <span id="s1230">And we did.</span> <span id="s1231">And I sent a military TWX to Si Pava to alert everybody he could alert to come to the airport at Piece boden and pick up their Hanukiyot and they did.</span> <span id="s1232">All 36,000 of them got distributed in about 24 hours to Jews all over Germany, all over the American zone of Germany.</span> <span id="s1233">And...uh...that was some Hanukkah.</span> <span id="s1234">By the way, I don't have one of them.</span> <span id="s1235">We distributed them all.</span> <span id="s1236">(Laughing) I never got one.</span> <span id="s1237">I would give much to have one of those Hanukiyot but I don't have one, and I guess that's proper and just that I should not have.</span> <span id="s1238">I never went back to Regensburg to work.</span> <span id="s1239">I spent the next period of time until April 46 running around, doing I don't know what, but there were emergencies constantly.</span> <span id="s1240">The American headquarters in Frankfort would call...the G.5 sections civil affairs, or Hiam...then called Hans Hoffman, later became Hiam Hoffman, later became , one of the fine people of Israel, and I had to do things.</span> <span id="s1241">So I was on detached service at Frankfort Headquarters for some months, but that had to end.</span> <span id="s1242">You just can't keep doing that.</span> <span id="s1243">So the theater Chaplain, a man named Hunan, Catholic, Truman's Chaplain, he called himself, from the first World War, called me in and said, "You gotta stop this monkeying around.</span> <span id="s1244">This isn't why you're in the Army.</span> <span id="s1245">I am sending you to Berlin.</span> <span id="s1246">That should be far enough away from all those displaced persons."</span> <span id="s1247">And I said, "Yes, Sir."</span> <span id="s1248">Excited, because the Jews from Poland and Russia had just started to come in and we were routing them all through Berlin.</span> <span id="s1249">We had one of the Haganah people stationed in Berlin, and that's where the action was going to be.</span> <span id="s1250">Break my heart.</span> <span id="s1251">Send me to Berlin.</span> <span id="s1252">Twenty four hours later, he called me in and he said, "You're not going to Berlin.</span> <span id="s1253">I just found out the stuff that's going on there.</span> <span id="s1254">You're going to Augsburg to the 1st Division."</span> <span id="s1255">"Yes, Sir."</span> <span id="s1256">"And," he said, "when you get there, find Chaplain Freedman, whom I assigned there, but who is now going to Berlin in your place."</span> <span id="s1257">And I went to Augsburg and found Herb Freedman, whom I had never met before.</span> <span id="s1258">A young, first lieutenant, fresh into the Army, who was angry at me because Augsburg is near Munich, and in Munich is where the action was because he wanted to do Haganah work.</span> <span id="s1259">He was busting to do this stuff.</span> <span id="s1260">And I explained to him that Berlin was better and he should be made on me.</span> <span id="s1261">(laughter) And he went to Berlin.</span> <span id="s1262">Of course, Herb Freedman's career since then has been legendary.</span> <span id="s1263">He and Phil Burstein did things that people really shouldn't have been able to do.</span> <span id="s1264">And...uh...it was superb.</span> <span id="s1265">I was delighted to be in Augsburg.</span> <span id="s1266">But my time was running out, because Hoffman was negotiating with the Army to make me into a civilian because it was clear during this period from December when these 14 arrived that this , this Jewish agency for Palestine group, as it was called,...uh... was going to have constant dealings with the Army.</span> <span id="s1267">And some American had to be there to see to it that nothing got fouled up.</span> <span id="s1268">And they decided I should be that person, and I was not unwilling.</span> <span id="s1269">My condition was that my wife and child be allowed to come to Germany with me.</span> <span id="s1270">I had two reasons for that.</span> <span id="s1271">First of all, I been away 18 months and that's a lot longer than 2 years...those 2 years that I thought wouldn't be so long, and second of all, I felt that Esther had to experience this or we weren't going to have much of a life because I was no longer the person who had gone overseas.</span> <span id="s1272">An awful lot had happened.</span> <span id="s1273">Deeply, deeply transforming stuff.</span> <span id="s1274">And they agreed.</span> <span id="s1275">Somebody fouled up, and in April 1946, just before Passover...uh...I got orders to go home to be demobilized and I asked Heim about it and he sort of shrugged and we talked to Ruth Kluger in Paris who was theoretically making these arrangements and she sort of shrugged.</span> <span id="s1276">So I came home.</span> <span id="s1277">And I became a civilian.</span> <span id="s1278">Uh...There was an Haganah office in New York.</span> <span id="s1279">It had been organized for a very simple purpose.</span> <span id="s1280">Money.</span> <span id="s1281">They had to buy ships.</span> <span id="s1282">Ships are expensive.</span> <span id="s1283">The only place they really could buy ships was the United States because they wanted larger ships.</span> <span id="s1284">Ships for 2 or 3 hundred people were not going to be able to do this thing anymore.</span> <span id="s1285">They needed big ships.</span> <span id="s1286">So they were going to buy them in the United States, and they sent 4 Palestinians over, led by who later became , the first chief of staff of the Israel army, later the President of the in Haifa.</span> <span id="s1287">A marvelous, marvelous man.</span> <span id="s1288">When I got to New York, I went into the office, naturally, and asked me if I would go to work for them.</span> <span id="s1289">As long as I had to be in the United States for a little while making speeches for the Haganah.</span> <span id="s1290">So from the end of April 1946 until February 1947, I was on the staff of the Haganah in the United States making speeches.</span> <span id="s1291">Esther and I lived in New York.</span> <span id="s1292">First in a hotel, but then we couldn't stand it.</span> <span id="s1293">And Michael was getting sick in this hotel.</span> <span id="s1294">The food just wasn't for a 2 year old.</span> <span id="s1295">And...uh...so we found an apartment on Staten Island, and we lived over there.</span> <span id="s1296">It was not a good time.</span> <span id="s1297">I was away more than I was there....uh... making the same speech over and over and over again to secret meetings of Jews to get money.</span> <span id="s1298">Was not my style, but it was what had to be done.</span> <span id="s1299">There was some compensation.</span> <span id="s1300">There was a rainy night.</span> <span id="s1301">I don't remember what month when I was allowed to go to Baltimore.</span> <span id="s1302">And down on the docks was a ship, then called the SS Warfield.</span> <span id="s1303">The Warfield being the same person as the Duchess of Windsor because her daddy was the President of the steamboat company that ran steamboats up around the Chesapeake Bay.</span> <span id="s1304">This was a Chesapeake Bay steamer.</span> <span id="s1305">Decrepit, messed up which the Haganah had bought, and we were sending off to Europe to transport Jews.</span> <span id="s1306">We estimated that maybe 25,000 Jews uncomfortable could get on it.</span> <span id="s1307">When it sailed in June of 47 to Palestine from France as the exodus 1947, it had 52 hundred people on board, and we'll pick that up later because I have more to do with the exodus.</span> <span id="s1308">That night in Baltimore we commissioned the exodus in a non-existent Jewish navy.</span> <span id="s1309">Gave it flag, and all the rest of the .</span> <span id="s1310">A word ought to be said about Americans for Haganah.</span> <span id="s1311">It was an astonishing organization.</span> <span id="s1312">It's head was a multi-millionaire oil man named Rudolph Sonaborn, whose last claim to fame was that he married Dorothy Shift, the publisher of the New York Post then.</span> <span id="s1313">But he gave at least half his time to Americans for Haganah.</span> <span id="s1314">We met every Tuesday for lunch in a hotel in New York, and...uh... books have been written about this operation, which was clandestine.</span> <span id="s1315">The bank account was the bank account of the Palestine pavilion of the New York Worlds Fair.</span> <span id="s1316">There had been a New York World's Fair in 1930...what...8, 9, something like that, and they never closed the bank account of the...of the Jewish pavilion or the Palestine Pavilion it was called.</span> <span id="s1317">And that money was funneled through the Palestine Pavilion bank account, and we never got caught.</span> <span id="s1318">Later, there was trouble with armed shipments to the Haganah, but that was much later, after the Foundation was dated as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s1319">This group that met on Tuesdays was a remarkable bunch, and the fact that we raised several million dollars for the purchase of ships is amazing because we were a small group and you couldn't talk about it.</span> <span id="s1320">You couldn't do the usual kinds of fund raising hoopla.</span> <span id="s1321">We met in people's rumpus rooms, they were called in those days.</span> <span id="s1322">They are called family rooms today, I think.</span> <span id="s1323">And...uh...everybody had to know everybody, and they couldn't talk about it, and they had to get lots of money.</span> <span id="s1324">It was a wild operation.</span> <span id="s1325">I did not enjoy it.</span> <span id="s1326">One of my tasks, for example, was to go once a week for lunch to the 21 Club in New York because one of the Krinlers was interested in us, and he introduced me to all these degenerate people.</span> <span id="s1327">He used to hang out at the 21 Club and I'd get money from them.</span> <span id="s1328">Uh...Some of the ladies were very frank about where they money came from and how it came.</span> <span id="s1329">And I had a conscious problem about this, but it didn't last because buying the ships was more important than my Jewish conscious.</span> <span id="s1330">But it was a tough time for my family and me.</span> <span id="s1331">We were relieved when finally, finally, finally the paperwork was done, and we could get back to Europe, we thought.</span> <span id="s1332">I flew to Paris and went in back in to Germany immediately.</span> <span id="s1333">Got us a house in Heidelberg, and then went to Paris to pick Esy up when she and Michael arrived.</span> <span id="s1334">They got stuck in Paris for 4 week because the paperwork wasn't in order.</span> <span id="s1335">She lived in a very fancy hotel in Paris for 4 weeks, and then we moved into Heidelberg and the next phase of this operation begins.</span> <span id="s1336">Þ HÞ</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q: The tape is...</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: Good place to break.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1340">It's a good place to break.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: Tell me about Manford.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: Uh...We went out to dinner at one day last week, and he was alert and he was alive and he was fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1344">We may begin.</span> <span id="s1345">We're back on tape.</span> <span id="s1346">Uh... Let us go back to Germany for a minute.</span> <span id="s1347">Uh...There were two people you wanted to tell us more about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">A: One day in early Fall (clearing throat) 1945 I walked into our building in Regensburg and I went upstairs and I heard very loud sounds, kids stomping and shouting, and so I went to see what it was.</span> <span id="s1349">There about 20 teenagers with this short, very short, heavy set, young, young man leading them in a dance...in a song.</span> <span id="s1350">Uh.</span> <span id="s1351">was the theme and stuff and he had those kids going absolutely mad.</span> <span id="s1352">And I watched this guy and said to myself, "He's a leader.</span> <span id="s1353">That man is a leader."</span> <span id="s1354">So I met him.</span> <span id="s1355">His name was Leon Retter from , a genius who had been sent by the Russians to the language school in Moscow when he was 16.</span> <span id="s1356">He spoke then and still speaks somewhere between 10 and 15 languages quite fluently.</span> <span id="s1357">He was a captain in the Red Army during the war, and at the end of the war decided that he wanted to get out.</span> <span id="s1358">This was what he wanted that he wanted to live in Palestine.</span> <span id="s1359">So he ran away, and came into American zone in Germany.</span> <span id="s1360">Landed in Regensburg.</span> <span id="s1361">some months later his girlfriend joined him and they married.</span> <span id="s1362">They are still married and they lived in Munich for reasons which will become clear.</span> <span id="s1363">Uh...We had organized not only the central committee, but regional committees.</span> <span id="s1364">More people involved the better.</span> <span id="s1365">He became a member of our regional committee, and then I..</span> <span id="s1366">.</span> <span id="s1367">uh...let Klausner know, as a matter of fact, that I thought this guy was...uh...good material and Klausner met him, moved him down to Munich and Irea which is the name he took instead of Leon,...uh...for reasons that have to do with language.</span> <span id="s1368">Leon means lion and Irea means lion.</span> <span id="s1369">Their translation.</span> <span id="s1370">And Redder became just because he wanted it to.</span> <span id="s1371">He...uh...became the foreign secretary of the displaced persons.</span> <span id="s1372">It was he who dealt with the big people who came in.</span> <span id="s1373">It was he who went to Frankfort headquarters to, as he said, make demands on behalf...on behalf of the Jewish displaced persons.</span> <span id="s1374">Tough minded,...uh...brilliant orator who in the spring of 1946 was sent to the United States for his first UJA missions.</span> <span id="s1375">And he has done UJA off and on ever since until his retirement about 2 years ago.</span> <span id="s1376">He's 68 now.</span> <span id="s1377">He...uh.</span> <span id="s1378">.</span> <span id="s1379">should have become a major political figure, but...uh...Mr. Ben-Gurion was rather capricious about his boys, as he called them, and when there was a revolt against Ben-Gurion within the Labor Party, in the 50's, Irea joined the revolt.</span> <span id="s1380">And the old man punished him and then made him do projects for him afterwards.</span> <span id="s1381">Irea decided that the way to get along in Israel was to be independent, and so he become Israel's first management consultant on human relations.</span> <span id="s1382">As new immigrant groups came in, there were all kinds of tensions and problems and he would work with those.</span> <span id="s1383">He's a remarkable fellows, still one of my very closest friends.</span> <span id="s1384">He had the right kind of hutspah in huge amounts.</span> <span id="s1385">Uh...It was fun to watch him telling General Clay what General Clay had to do.</span> <span id="s1386">(Laughter) It was really great.</span> <span id="s1387">He's also...was great with the Jews.</span> <span id="s1388">I went with him one night to one of the DP camps where we had just gotten a telephone call that there was a riot going on.</span> <span id="s1389">The G..</span> <span id="s1390">.</span> <span id="s1391">the American Army did some not very bright things.</span> <span id="s1392">As we became friendly with the Germans, which we did by 1946, 47...Secretary Burns had led the way on that...they began to put German police in Jewish DP camps, and the Jews didn't like it much.</span> <span id="s1393">And we had that kind of situation, and the Jews went berserk.</span> <span id="s1394">So Irea and I went.</span> <span id="s1395">He got up on the back of the truck and he hushed those Jews, and then he spoke to them with his kind of beery voice, and they went back to their room...home to behave themselves.</span> <span id="s1396">I have never seen one person stop a riot before, but he did.</span> <span id="s1397">He had that kind of power.</span> <span id="s1398">Extremely, extremely charismatic, powerful guy, who became my brother.</span> <span id="s1399">And...uh...has remained very much a brother.</span> <span id="s1400">(Sigh) I am trying to think of....</span> <span id="s1401">Well, we had a Congress of Displaced Persons...uh...in the first year, and unquestionably, the most influential individual there, besides Klausner, was Nesher.</span> <span id="s1402">Okay, that's Nesher.</span> <span id="s1403">That's who he is.</span> <span id="s1404">That's who he was.</span> <span id="s1405">Uh...He went to Palestine in time for the War of Independence cause he insisted on doing so.</span> <span id="s1406">He and Lilly took a bunch of kids on a legal trip because there were some... And both of them went into the Army, and I tease them to this day about the fact that she outranked him.</span> <span id="s1407">He was a sergeant and she was a lieutenant.</span> <span id="s1408">Lilly, his wife, is one of the experts on Soviet Jewry.</span> <span id="s1409">She was taking Jews out of the Soviet Union when nobody was taking Jews out of the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1410">And...uh...still there was a great deal about Soviet Jewry.</span> <span id="s1411">Okay, so much for Nesher Klausner.</span> <span id="s1412">When I saw Klausner at the Chaplains' meeting, first time I had seen him since Dachau, and we made all the plans and started the package system.</span> <span id="s1413">Uh...It was clear that any Chaplain who wanted to do the job right should do so in consultation with Abe.</span> <span id="s1414">The leaders of the DPs were his.</span> <span id="s1415">He was the President.</span> <span id="s1416">The processes of the central committee he was in the middle of.</span> <span id="s1417">He tried not to deal with the U.S. Army because he was absent without leave.</span> <span id="s1418">He spent total of 8 months absent without leave.</span> <span id="s1419">He had no assignment.</span> <span id="s1420">He didn't get paid.</span> <span id="s1421">He also did not do anything for the Army.</span> <span id="s1422">He was unconnected to the American Army.</span> <span id="s1423">He met every once in awhile with some general, but he was unconnected with the American Army and nobody realized it.</span> <span id="s1424">Uh...I knew it, but what the heck?</span> <span id="s1425">It wasn't my business.</span> <span id="s1426">One day I had to go to 3rd Army Headquarters in .</span> <span id="s1427">That was the day I saw all of General Patton's cars and jeeps and his private...uh...fleet.</span> <span id="s1428">I went up to the Chaplain's office to get whatever I went to get.</span> <span id="s1429">I don't remember what.</span> <span id="s1430">And I heard a voice call, "Chaplain."</span> <span id="s1431">So everybody in the room turned around because there must have been 15 chaplains in the room, and this guy from inside the private office was pointing his finger at me.</span> <span id="s1432">And I said, "Yes, Sir."</span> <span id="s1433">And I went in.</span> <span id="s1434">A bird Colonel...uh...O'Reilley, he's Senior Chaplain of the 3rd Army, regular Army Catholic, and he said, "What's your name, Chaplain?"</span> <span id="s1435">I told him my name.</span> <span id="s1436">And he said, "Tell me Lipman, do you happen to know a Chaplain named Klausner?"</span> <span id="s1437">I thought, "Oh, boy!"</span> <span id="s1438">I said, "Which one, Sir?"</span> <span id="s1439">And he crossed himself and said, "Holy Mary, Mother of God.</span> <span id="s1440">Don't tell me there are two of them."</span> <span id="s1441">And I said, "Yes, Sir.</span> <span id="s1442">There's Chaplain Berkland Klausner.</span> <span id="s1443">There's Chaplain Abraham Klausner."</span> <span id="s1444">What I knew that he didn't know was that Berk Klausner was in England, but that didn't matter.</span> <span id="s1445">I was telling the truth.</span> <span id="s1446">He said, "You know, I have been hearing rumors about a Chaplain Klausner in my area, but I don't get monthly reports from him.</span> <span id="s1447">Do you ever see him."</span> <span id="s1448">And I said, "I suppose I could find him if I tried hard."</span> <span id="s1449">He said, "Would you do me a favor?"</span> <span id="s1450">"Of course, Sir."</span> <span id="s1451">"Would you please tell him that I am looking for him because I must have his monthly reports?"</span> <span id="s1452">I said, "I will certainly tell him."</span> <span id="s1453">Next day, I had lunch with Abe in Munich and I said to him, "Here's your message from Chaplain O'Reilly."</span> <span id="s1454">And he listened, and he said, "Okay, message has been received."</span> <span id="s1455">I said, "No.</span> <span id="s1456">Let's do it.</span> <span id="s1457">Let's regularize you.</span> <span id="s1458">It will be good for you, and it would enhance your status.</span> <span id="s1459">It wouldn't destroy your status with the Army."</span> <span id="s1460">We sat down in his house on with the help of the JDC women sitting at the typewriters and we wrote 8 monthly reports.</span> <span id="s1461">(Laughter) Numbers, statistics, services conducted, counseling sessions held, the works!</span> <span id="s1462">And he signed them, and we sent them in through channels with no note of any kind.</span> <span id="s1463">We arranged for one of the officers to see that they got into the mail system and they landed in the Chaplain's office.</span> <span id="s1464">Next thing Abe heard was he got orders brought to him by a finance officer who was bringing him 8 months pay.</span> <span id="s1465">He hadn't been paid for 8 months.</span> <span id="s1466">He got this stack of occupation currency, and the finance officer said, "While I was coming here, the Adjutant General asked if I would bring you these.</span> <span id="s1467">They are orders."</span> <span id="s1468">And Abe looked and in the orders he was assigned to a hospital in Munich.</span> <span id="s1469">And that's where he remained.</span> <span id="s1470">He just kept right on going.</span> <span id="s1471">Never moved into the hospital.</span> <span id="s1472">Reported to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1473">Spoke to the hospital Chaplain and said, "If you have any Jews problems, call me."</span> <span id="s1474">(Laughter) And disappeared and never heard from again.</span> <span id="s1475">That's how he operated.</span> <span id="s1476">Abe opened DP camps.</span> <span id="s1477">He started two hospitals.</span> <span id="s1478">When they emptied out Dachau, he took care of those people.</span> <span id="s1479">There was a famous transport of twelve hundred Hungarians who were supposed to go back to Hungary.</span> <span id="s1480">The U.S. Army had a policy.</span> <span id="s1481">It had two parts.</span> <span id="s1482">First, one was everybody goes home.</span> <span id="s1483">No matter what.</span> <span id="s1484">It's our job to repatriate.</span> <span id="s1485">It isn't our job to move people around and second of all, there are no Jews.</span> <span id="s1486">They are Poles.</span> <span id="s1487">They are Hungarians.</span> <span id="s1488">They are Rumanians.</span> <span id="s1489">They are Germans.</span> <span id="s1490">They are Austrians.</span> <span id="s1491">There aren't any Jews.</span> <span id="s1492">And at first, there were mixed DP camps.</span> <span id="s1493">And the Army couldn't understand why there were riots every night.</span> <span id="s1494">People getting hurt every night.</span> <span id="s1495">Some of us wrote letters through channels to the Commanding General, a fellow named Eisenhower, saying, "Can't do this.</span> <span id="s1496">The Jews are in unique position, and you really must somehow, Sir, ... uh...organize special camps for them."</span> <span id="s1497">It wasn't until July that orders came out (a) declaring Jews a nationality and (b) permitting separate facilities.</span> <span id="s1498">So we started...we...UNRRA blew it.</span> <span id="s1499">They started Jewish DP camps.</span> <span id="s1500">UNRRA was unable to do so.</span> <span id="s1501">Well, Abe did it.</span> <span id="s1502">He had this crazy capacity to do all sorts of things with very few resources.</span> <span id="s1503">Another funny story that happened to Abe, but it's not about him.</span> <span id="s1504">Obviously, the Jews wanted to leave.</span> <span id="s1505">One day, he was in his office, still at the Dorchus Museum, before he moved into…There was a knock on the door, and this little Jew came bursting in and, "Herr Chaplain.</span> <span id="s1506">Herr Chaplain."</span> <span id="s1507">"Yes."</span> <span id="s1508">This was...conversation was carried on in Yiddish although an instantaneous translation.</span> <span id="s1509">Uh..."I have a visa."</span> <span id="s1510">"Wonderful," said Abe.</span> <span id="s1511">And they danced together and they pranced together, "You have a visa.</span> <span id="s1512">Where are you going?"</span> <span id="s1513">"Costa Rica."</span> <span id="s1514">"Marvelous, it's a beautiful country," and they kibitzed around for a good...and the guy was about to leave and he turned to Abe and said, "Herr Chaplain, May I ask a question?"</span> <span id="s1515">"Of course."</span> <span id="s1516">"Where's Costa Rica?"</span> <span id="s1517">He had no idea what part of the world Costa Rica was in, and I suspect he didn't go there either.</span> <span id="s1518">He may have started for there, but he didn't land there.</span> <span id="s1519">What else should I tell you about Klausner?</span> <span id="s1520">Uh...The Army arranged for him to come home in 1946 too.</span> <span id="s1521">He will give you all kinds of stories about how...how and why it happened, but it happened.</span> <span id="s1522">As soon as he got to the United States, he began to maneuver to get back because that's all he wanted to do.</span> <span id="s1523">He was a bachelor, and this was his life.</span> <span id="s1524">And General Hilldring was Assistant Secretary of State for International Affairs.</span> <span id="s1525">Good guy!</span> <span id="s1526">And Abe went to him, and Hilldring arranged for him to go back to Germany and he did go back.</span> <span id="s1527">Did some interesting things that had to do with the exodus people as a matter of fact and when I get to exodus we'll talk about that.</span> <span id="s1528">And then, eventually, I came home and...uh...took up a Rabbinical career.</span> <span id="s1529">He's been in Yonkers, New York, for many, many years.</span> <span id="s1530">He's just retiring.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1532">We'll pick up with him later.</span> <span id="s1533">Before we leave Regensburg, was it in Regensburg that you had occasion to call upon a Nazi doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">A: No.</span> <span id="s1535">It was not in Regensburg, and it was later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">A: It's from Heidelberg to another town.</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">Q: Then let's pick up as it were chronologically again.</span> <span id="s1539">We jump back.</span> <span id="s1540">You have been civilianized and returned to Heidelberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">A: Went to Heidelburg to live.</span> <span id="s1542">And I did (sigh) three jobs.</span> <span id="s1543">I was responsible for all routine liaison with the American Army.</span> <span id="s1544">there was a Brigadier General in Frankfort Headquarters, a good man, solid man, with whom I had the right to talk anytime I wanted to, or he would call me whenever he had something, and we talked a great deal.</span> <span id="s1545">Second, any publicity or public relations that had to do with the underground, I was responsible for and...uh...I'll come back to that in a minute.</span> <span id="s1546">My third one was to lead transports with a guy who was then called Wolf, whose name was not and is not Wolf.</span> <span id="s1547">Uh...His name is Efrian Franke.</span> <span id="s1548">Uh...He lives in .</span> <span id="s1549">He's an attorney, Israel's most distinguished restitution attorney.</span> <span id="s1550">Married to a woman named Hanna, who was one of the members of this group in Germany, and they have an infinite number of grandchildren by now.</span> <span id="s1551">It was the second marriage for both of them.</span> <span id="s1552">So, Efrian who was never called Efrian and I did transports together, as the leaders of them.</span> <span id="s1553">I was called to Paris one day because a major American newspaper person wanted an interview with the famous Colonel Wolf, and I arranged it.</span> <span id="s1554">Efrian was in Paris, and we made this interview by agreeing to meet at a certain place.</span> <span id="s1555">We met at that place, got into a cab and went to another place.</span> <span id="s1556">Got into a cab, and went to a third place.</span> <span id="s1557">I guess it was about the 4th place where Efrian finally walked in, and the reporter joined us.</span> <span id="s1558">Because everybody assumed all the time that the British were looking for us.</span> <span id="s1559">That was one of my P.R. jobs.</span> <span id="s1560">The most important P.R. job I guess I ever did had to do with the late M .</span> <span id="s1561">We had a contact in the United States where reporters were concerned.</span> <span id="s1562">Let me tell you about one of the incidents and then I will come to .</span> <span id="s1563">Uh...The door bell rang one day in Heidelberg, and a young, fresh faced guy said, "My name is Dick Dudman, and I want a story about the Haganah."</span> <span id="s1564">And I said, "Never heard of it," and I closed the door.</span> <span id="s1565">And I sent a wire to the late I.F. Stone in New York.</span> <span id="s1566">Isy Stone was our New York contact.</span> <span id="s1567">He was working for P.M. newspaper then, and nobody could get into Haganah for a story unless Stone sent him.</span> <span id="s1568">And I in this cable said, "What's this Dudman guy?</span> <span id="s1569">Do I let him in or not?</span> <span id="s1570">He claims to be from the Denver Post."</span> <span id="s1571">And I got a wire back saying, "Yal, He's okay."</span> <span id="s1572">So I managed to get word...uh...I don't remember how I did it or whether Isy did it, but Dudman came to my door again.</span> <span id="s1573">And we made him into a displaced person.</span> <span id="s1574">Gave him everything he needed to be a displaced person, and sent him on one of the trips.</span> <span id="s1575">And he wrote a memorable series of articles for the Denver Post on being a displaced person, and what it was like to go on one of these illegal trips...uh...for which he got a name and fellowship by the way.</span> <span id="s1576">Later, we became friends again here in Washington, because he was the head of the Washington Bureau, the St. Louis Post Dispatch, and...uh...now lives in Ellsworth, Maine.</span> <span id="s1577">He and his wife decided that it was a small town for them.</span> <span id="s1578">They bought a radio station in Ellsworth.</span> <span id="s1579">Dick also became famous because...uh...remember when we were not in Cambodia, he was captured...uh...with the American troops in Cambodia...with his press credentials, and he was missing for several weeks and we all went out of our minds till he came back quite unharmed.</span> <span id="s1580">Remarkable reporter, and those stories I think...uh...were very exciting and very important in having Americans understand what this crazy underground was all about.</span> <span id="s1581">But...uh...I guess the longest lasting piece of P.R. has to do with a movie, which was made by Myrlon in.</span> <span id="s1582">.</span> <span id="s1583">starring his wife,, who is now his widow.</span> <span id="s1584">She was a writer.</span> <span id="s1585">Uh...He came with full credentials, of course, and moved into our house in Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s1586">He was going to make a movie of one of our transports because the story of this movie was this displaced person and how this displaced person got to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1587">And obviously this displaced person had to be out of Germany.</span> <span id="s1588">And we decided to use one of our regular transports.</span> <span id="s1589">So one night, we applied all transports out of our part of German...the ones I was responsible for left on Saturday night.</span> <span id="s1590">Why, I hear you ask, Saturday night?</span> <span id="s1591">Because as few American troops as possible were on duty Saturday night.</span> <span id="s1592">Saturday night is getting drunk night or having a beer night or reading a good book night, but you're not on duty Saturday night if you can avoid it, so it was easiest to get through the border on Saturday nights.</span> <span id="s1593">We always had some kind of papers.</span> <span id="s1594">We never tried just to sneak through a border.</span> <span id="s1595">That was too risky.</span> <span id="s1596">Uh...There were times when for small groups we would go through borders, but we had a list of the constabulary units and their schedules, where they would be when General Mickelson always saw that we had those.</span> <span id="s1597">That was the guy at Frankfort Headquarters who was my contact, a Brigadier named Abraham Mickelson.</span> <span id="s1598">And he provided those.</span> <span id="s1599">Uh...But the big transports, we had to go through roads and border points because we were in 6 by 6 trucks, and some German trucks, though we never used wood burning ones.</span> <span id="s1600">We bought trucks.</span> <span id="s1601">We bought gasoline.</span> <span id="s1602">If did not have Army supplies unless we could steal them, and you couldn't steal large quantities of gasoline.</span> <span id="s1603">That's hard to do.</span> <span id="s1604">But by this time we had a budget and we were getting money from the United States.</span> <span id="s1605">This was a transport of about twelve hundred people, leaving Saturday night from the town of Noowhom.</span> <span id="s1606">We owned a barracks in Noowhom.</span> <span id="s1607">We bought it.</span> <span id="s1608">It was ours.</span> <span id="s1609">And we could use it to get people ready to go.</span> <span id="s1610">And we would appear there on either Friday or sometime early Saturday, and the people would arrive.</span> <span id="s1611">How they were selected and how they got there is a story unto itself, but that's what we eventually had 130 Palestinians doing out around the countryside.</span> <span id="s1612">They had political problems; they had age problems; they had all kinds of problems in making up these transports.</span> <span id="s1613">How did we know how many to send?</span> <span id="s1614">Uh...Let me ask myself the question when I finish the Myrlon Lynn story because it's a separate story which has its own kind of interest.</span> <span id="s1615">We got instructions on my telephone.</span> <span id="s1616">Saturday night we would have our people all ready.</span> <span id="s1617">This was a well organized thing.</span> <span id="s1618">We knew who was going to be in which trucks.</span> <span id="s1619">If they were pregnant women, they were in the same truck, and there was a nurse with them.</span> <span id="s1620">Sometimes the nurse was a woman named Esther Lipman, who was not a nurse.</span> <span id="s1621">But she was pregnant at the time, so she knew all about it.</span> <span id="s1622">(Laughing) We were going to have our second child, so Esther a few pieces of equipment and she went on some of these transports as transport nurse.</span> <span id="s1623">We never delivered a baby on one of these transports, I'm glad to say.</span> <span id="s1624">It's just as well.</span> <span id="s1625">The tough part of the trip was the night part into the Black Forest.</span> <span id="s1626">And so we left.</span> <span id="s1627">Every 2 hours we would stop for relief.</span> <span id="s1628">We left at midnight so that we had two or three 2-hour periods before dawn.</span> <span id="s1629">At dawn or shortly thereafter, we would arrive at what was known as the picnic area.</span> <span id="s1630">We had been looking for this for weeks, and when we found it, it was as though we had found Heaven.</span> <span id="s1631">There was a place in the middle of the Black Forest where a small road went off to the right.</span> <span id="s1632">And they went about a half a mile and then there was a circle, at the end of which there was a wine house.</span> <span id="s1633">End of road.</span> <span id="s1634">That's perfect.</span> <span id="s1635">No traffic.</span> <span id="s1636">On the side of the road was a little cabin.</span> <span id="s1637">And there we got one of the great breaks of the entire era.</span> <span id="s1638">When a DP named Gittshuck, who worked for us, and I were looking for this place...and...for a place, and we came to this, we decided we better check out that cabin.</span> <span id="s1639">We knocked on the cabin door, and a lady answered wearing Bavarian costumes as everybody in the Black Forest did.</span> <span id="s1640">They wore old fashioned Bavarian costumes.</span> <span id="s1641">And we talked to her and asked her if she would have any objections if every once in awhile, every week, 10 days, some people would come and rest on the side of the hill and use the stream at the bottom of the hill just to wash.</span> <span id="s1642">And she said, "I have no objection, but who are they?"</span> <span id="s1643">And I said, "They're concentration camp survivors who are going to their new homes, and we are moving them."</span> <span id="s1644">And she said, "Oh, can I help?"</span> <span id="s1645">And I said, "If you want to feed them, it would be a great help.</span> <span id="s1646">We often have children.</span> <span id="s1647">It would be marvelous if we could leave cereal with you and we could have hot gruel for these kids when they get here and hot tea for the adults.</span> <span id="s1648">That would be absolutely marvelous."</span> <span id="s1649">Nothing to that.</span> <span id="s1650">Asked some more questions, as I was interested.</span> <span id="s1651">This woman was a Jew, who had married when she was at the University a nonªJewish German.</span> <span id="s1652">When the Nazi...when the war started, he was pulled into the Army.</span> <span id="s1653">She decided and he decided and his father decided that she should hide out in this cabin with the father because he lived there in the middle of the woods.</span> <span id="s1654">How many people would come into the Black Forest looking for somebody?</span> <span id="s1655">Uh...She was announced as his daughter-in-law, and her husband was off in the Army being a hero.</span> <span id="s1656">Her husband was killed on the eastern front, so she stayed.</span> <span id="s1657">Took care of the old man.</span> <span id="s1658">She took care of the old man till he died about 1946, and because some of the neighbors knew that she was Jewish and nobody had turned her in, she decided to live out her life there.</span> <span id="s1659">She had a job.</span> <span id="s1660">She worked.</span> <span id="s1661">She had her husband's pension from the Army, whatever it was, and she was living there.</span> <span id="s1662">So then we were able to tell her that these were Jews.</span> <span id="s1663">And this became our picnic area.</span> <span id="s1664">Every transport going to Milhouse in France...uh ...went through there, and this woman loved it.</span> <span id="s1665">She was magnificent.</span> <span id="s1666">I remember her with great affection.</span> <span id="s1667">Any how, after resting at the picnic ground and having a meal, we got back into the trucks and headed for a place called Pompdecess, where the only bridge across the Rhine was.</span> <span id="s1668">It was a military bridge.</span> <span id="s1669">And...uh.</span> <span id="s1670">.</span> <span id="s1671">we got to Pompdecess, and we had to be there at 4 o'clock.</span> <span id="s1672">Not 5, not 3 because the French officer whom we owned, the , immigration officer, was sure to be on duty then.</span> <span id="s1673">Any day but Sunday.</span> <span id="s1674">And he would take our papers and pass them right through.</span> <span id="s1675">So we got through the Duon easily.</span> <span id="s1676">And then from there to Milhouse in France was nothing to it, and there there was a big railroad yard and the French Haganah picked up the people at Mulhous and took them by train to somewhere in the Marseilles area depending on where the ship was going to be sit, Port Boog or Marseilles itself, whatever.</span> <span id="s1677">This particular transport had Tereska on board as a DP.</span> <span id="s1678">She had DP papers.</span> <span id="s1679">She had DP clothing.</span> <span id="s1680">She was a DP.</span> <span id="s1681">In front of this particular transport just before my car was the camera car with Myra.</span> <span id="s1682">And we had a terrible time with Myer.</span> <span id="s1683">It wasn't his fault.</span> <span id="s1684">He had to make noise.</span> <span id="s1685">He had to call something out to the camera crew.</span> <span id="s1686">You can't do it.</span> <span id="s1687">He had to call this...There's simply no way to do it.</span> <span id="s1688">You're going to shut up or you ain't going.</span> <span id="s1689">You see you had to go through the American zone of occupation to the French zone of occupation.</span> <span id="s1690">Pompdecess was in the French zone.</span> <span id="s1691">The French zone was a small zone in the southwestern Germany.</span> <span id="s1692">The French insisted on having a zone.</span> <span id="s1693">It was a four-power power thing after all.</span> <span id="s1694">So going from the American zone to the French zone was the dangerous one.</span> <span id="s1695">And having the camera crew along was great, because we say the United Nations wanted to have records of all these transports of survivors as they go to their new homes and...uh.</span> <span id="s1696">.</span> <span id="s1697">we have a crew with us, and want to take your picture at the border as you do your duty, and we got through very fast.</span> <span id="s1698">Uh...It was very difficult for Myer.</span> <span id="s1699">I am sure he suffered a lot.</span> <span id="s1700">It's got the illegals.</span> <span id="s1701">It is still available in 16 millimeter.</span> <span id="s1702">It still gets rented I understand by school groups and others who want to see it.</span> <span id="s1703">One minor tragedy in it which we laugh about in our family, but it isn't totally funny.</span> <span id="s1704">Esther was along on that transport as transport nurse.</span> <span id="s1705">The only time that I appear in the film was at Pompdecess where I am standing with the Duan going over the papers and getting people ready to go through.</span> <span id="s1706">And Esther was filmed there too.</span> <span id="s1707">There were other pictures of me in the...in my car and so forth.</span> <span id="s1708">We had a car with a moveable roof so that we could stand on the seat and watch what was going on.</span> <span id="s1709">Dangerous, but...uh...very effective because we had to see what was going on.</span> <span id="s1710">We didn't want to lose any trucks.</span> <span id="s1711">They had to stay in line.</span> <span id="s1712">Uh...We had to go through one or two towns, went through Fribrook for example and in the streets of Fribrook, we did not want to lose trucks.</span> <span id="s1713">But the only one that got printed and is in the film is me at the...there's nothing of Esy.</span> <span id="s1714">All the shots of Esther got cut in the editing, and she never stopped teasing Myer about it.</span> <span id="s1715">And whenever we met, he would come up and want to hug her hello and she would say, "You don't want to hug me.</span> <span id="s1716">You wouldn't even put me in your movie."</span> <span id="s1717">(Laughter) So...uh...that's our...Myer saga of The Illegal.</span> <span id="s1718">Incidentally, they...uh...filmed the...the boat.</span> <span id="s1719">That part of the trip being caught by the British, going to Cyprus.</span> <span id="s1720">They got a complete record on the illegal.</span> <span id="s1721">I forget how much of it is in the film.</span> <span id="s1722">But that was part of the P.R. job as well as taking transports.</span> <span id="s1723">Uh...With one exception we had no difficulty, with the transports to France.</span> <span id="s1724">Uh...One night they got nasty at the border and kept us there 5 hours, and it was only when we finally, finally found Paul Edwards... It being a Saturday night, he wasn't at home either.</span> <span id="s1725">When he finally got home...uh...just before dawn, that he was able to say to these guys, "Are their papers in order?</span> <span id="s1726">Is my signature on them?</span> <span id="s1727">What do you want?</span> <span id="s1728">Get them out of there?</span> <span id="s1729">You've had those peoples in there a long time.</span> <span id="s1730">They're tired.</span> <span id="s1731">They have to get where they're going."</span> <span id="s1732">So the soldiers backed down.</span> <span id="s1733">And...uh.</span> <span id="s1734">.</span> <span id="s1735">that had been the result of a tip from a CID Criminal Investigation Division of the Army, I am sorry to say, a young man I knew.</span> <span id="s1736">The son of somebody I had grown up with in Pittsburgh who was stuck on his duty and he got a..</span> <span id="s1737">.</span> <span id="s1738">in his investigations or whatever, he heard that a bunch of Jews were going out on Saturday night and he notified the border station.</span> <span id="s1739">But it happened.</span> <span id="s1740">Not everybody was...uh...all for what we were doing.</span> <span id="s1741">There were people aside from the British who didn't think we were...uh...behaving properly.</span> <span id="s1742">Okay, that's transports.</span> <span id="s1743">Oh, no, there's one more thing about it that I must mention.</span> <span id="s1744">How did we get the quotas and the number of people who were going to take a transport?</span> <span id="s1745">I had a telephone.</span> <span id="s1746">Because I was a Lieutenant Colonel, I had a telephone that could call outside the country.</span> <span id="s1747">Whenever we were scheduled for a transport, at precisely 7 o'clock in the evening, my phone would ring.</span> <span id="s1748">It would be a female voice talking English with a heavy French accent who never identified herself and who gave me a list of agricultural implements and tools and God knows what all, that I was to copy down with numbers.</span> <span id="s1749">And the code Hiamhead I didn't know what it said.</span> <span id="s1750">I immediately called Munich and transmitted it to Munich, and that's how we knew about our transports.</span> <span id="s1751">Some years later, 48 or 9, I don't remember, I was asked by the UJA to go to the opening of the campaign in Nashville, Tennessee, at a posh country club and I went.</span> <span id="s1752">Sitting next to me at dinner was a woman named Paulette Oppert O P P E R T, a French Jew, whose husband had been killed in the resistance who had herself been in the resistance and who after the war worked for the French Haganah and for people in Paris.</span> <span id="s1753">She later married an American businessman named Fink, and lived in Minneapolis for many, many years.</span> <span id="s1754">I saw her once in awhile.</span> <span id="s1755">I listened, and I said to her, "Paulette.</span> <span id="s1756">I know your voice."</span> <span id="s1757">And she said, "I have been sitting here going crazy cause I know your voice."</span> <span id="s1758">It was she.</span> <span id="s1759">She had been calling from Paris all those months, giving me all those instructions out of order which she understood, not a word of which I understood, that made it possible for the transports to go.</span> <span id="s1760">We felt like blood brother and sister.</span> <span id="s1761">Okay, that's the...uh...that's the transport business.</span> <span id="s1762">What's next?</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1764">Alright.</span> <span id="s1765">Uh...How did you start preparing for the Exodus?</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">A: Well, first of all we got a call from Paulette, telling us that we had to 52 hundred people in Marseilles on a certain date.</span> <span id="s1767">The largest transport that had ever been contemplated.</span> <span id="s1768">And the people in the camps did their job.</span> <span id="s1769">And it was decided that two of the transports would go by train, by way of Strasbourg, and three of them would go by truck and they would be back to back and then we would go down, turn around and come back, load up, and do this three times.</span> <span id="s1770">Two of them being Saturday nights, and one of them being mid-week which we had never done before.</span> <span id="s1771">But what're we going to do.</span> <span id="s1772">Because we had to get these people on board.</span> <span id="s1773">The British were watching this ship in sit where it was, and they didn't have a heck of a lot of time, so we rushed it.</span> <span id="s1774">All of these people had to get new identities because we using a series of French transit visas that the Minister of the Interior people had kindly prepared for us, but they were...we would call in blank.</span> <span id="s1775">They weren't really blank at all.</span> <span id="s1776">They had names on them.</span> <span id="s1777">They just weren't names of any living people, and they all had ages and they all had birth places.</span> <span id="s1778">So we prepared in advance DP cards.</span> <span id="s1779">Uh...All DPs had identity cards issued by UNRRA with military authorization and we had tens of thousands of them that we had printed and...uh...we issued new ones to all of these people with the proper stamps on them and then we handed them out at Nooam in the barracks in the stables there, and told them, "You got a new name.</span> <span id="s1780">You got to know how old you are.</span> <span id="s1781">You got to know where you were born.</span> <span id="s1782">It has nothing to do with you.</span> <span id="s1783">It has to do with whatever that name is on that piece of piece."</span> <span id="s1784">So they all had to learn them.</span> <span id="s1785">And some of the old people had difficulties with this.</span> <span id="s1786">Kids had no trouble at all.</span> <span id="s1787">There was one cute little kid with obviously orthodox origins was standing there holding these things and chuckling back and forth as he memorized his name and his birthplace and his birth date.</span> <span id="s1788">It was nice.</span> <span id="s1789">And then we took them.</span> <span id="s1790">Normally, when we got Milhouse there was a little hotel there.</span> <span id="s1791">A wonderful lady owned it who fed us a hot meal.</span> <span id="s1792">This is the staff who had gone on the trip.</span> <span id="s1793">The people were on the train bound for Marseilles already...and...uh...we'd spend the night and part of the next day.</span> <span id="s1794">Relax a little bit, have some fun, drink some good wine.</span> <span id="s1795">I learned to eat pâté for the first time and...Milhouse is in...uh...SS Lorraine...that part of France and they made wonderful pâté.</span> <span id="s1796">So this time we got there early evening.</span> <span id="s1797">We turned in.</span> <span id="s1798">Didn't have all that wonderful hospitality.</span> <span id="s1799">And in the middle of the night, we got back in our trucks and we went back to , and that night we loaded up and we did that three times in 8 days.</span> <span id="s1800">Esy was not with me on the Exodus ones.</span> <span id="s1801">I don't remember why not, but she wasn't.</span> <span id="s1802">And...uh...when I left I said to her as I always did, "I'll be back when I get here," and all she would say to people who called was, "I am sorry.</span> <span id="s1803">He's out of town.</span> <span id="s1804">Have you tried the Munich office?"</span> <span id="s1805">Uh...This was the longest I had been away.</span> <span id="s1806">And she allowed as how she was a little bit apprehensive, but nothing we could do about it.</span> <span id="s1807">That's how the people got on the exodus.</span> <span id="s1808">The French Haganah did a superlative job in getting all those trains.</span> <span id="s1809">Uh...That's a lot of bribery for the railway officials to... These were private trains.</span> <span id="s1810">These weren't just seats on train.</span> <span id="s1811">Twelve hundred people is a lot of...lot of people.</span> <span id="s1812">So these were three transports of between a thousand and twelve hundred each, and the other approximately two thousand went by train from Germany.</span> <span id="s1813">Then the exodus story doesn't end there.</span> <span id="s1814">It goes on because as people should know, the British sent that ship back.</span> <span id="s1815">Not the ship.</span> <span id="s1816">The ship stayed in Haifa Harbor.</span> <span id="s1817">It's still there.</span> <span id="s1818">By the way, it's falling apart.</span> <span id="s1819">It is disintegrating and will not last forever.</span> <span id="s1820">They've tried to preserve it.</span> <span id="s1821">It's not working very well.</span> <span id="s1822">It's been in a museum for quite awhile.</span> <span id="s1823">They sent the people back in three ships to a place called Port Luke, where they went on a hunger strike.</span> <span id="s1824">They wouldn't get off.</span> <span id="s1825">The British took them off by force, and then put them back on again and shipped them around to Hamburger in the British zone where they were taken, by I think, truck or train to two concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1826">One is called Amistow and one is called Popendorf where they incarcerated them.</span> <span id="s1827">One of the things Abe Klausner did was organize their escape with a bunch of the Haganah people, and they escaped.</span> <span id="s1828">And one of my great stories was greeting some of them again at Nooam when they went a second time.</span> <span id="s1829">I don't know how many of them went the second time by Haganah, but I had all transport of them one night, twelve hundred of them who went.</span> <span id="s1830">They landed on Cyprus.</span> <span id="s1831">Cyprus requires specific mention.</span> <span id="s1832">We made jokes about Cyprus.</span> <span id="s1833">We are going to have a Jewish State, but it's not going to be an ordinary state.</span> <span id="s1834">It's already an empire.</span> <span id="s1835">It has a colony.</span> <span id="s1836">Cyprus.</span> <span id="s1837">Because we had tens of thousands of Jews interned on Cyprus by the British in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1838">The first immigrants who came into Israel after independence were the people from Cyprus.</span> <span id="s1839">They had priorities.</span> <span id="s1840">God knows they had earned them, and they came through.</span> <span id="s1841">That was Cyprus.</span> <span id="s1842">I have never been to Cyprus.</span> <span id="s1843">I should go there some day.</span> <span id="s1844">What's next Linda?</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1846">Where did you...What did you do after the exodus transport or do you want to go back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">A: Uh...I think we ought to do the baby before we forget it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">A: A good friend of mine, displaced person, had a child.</span> <span id="s1850">Called me from where they were, told me that they were in terrible trouble.</span> <span id="s1851">The child was born with infantile jaundice, and she was getting dehydrated and they weren't sure she could live.</span> <span id="s1852">It was particularly painful because they were displaced persons and looked forward to this child, even more particularly painful for this father was a physician and didn't know how to save his child.</span> <span id="s1853">So Esther and I got into our truck...our car...it was truck, and we went to that town to be with them.</span> <span id="s1854">When I got there the father told me in the most agonized tones I have ever heard that he had a decision to make and didn't know how to make it.</span> <span id="s1855">That 30 or 40 miles down the road, not in the country, was a very famous German...uh...obstetrician, pediatrician, who was barred from practicing medicine because he had not only been a Nazi, but he had done experiments on Jewish children.</span> <span id="s1856">But, said the father, this man can save my daughter if anybody can.</span> <span id="s1857">He has unique information and methods that nobody in this hospital knows about.</span> <span id="s1858">I said, "I don't think I am asking you.</span> <span id="s1859">I think I am going to tell you.</span> <span id="s1860">Your daughter's life is more important than the fact that this man was a Nazi.</span> <span id="s1861">If he can save your daughter's life, that's saving the world for you.</span> <span id="s1862">You gotta do it."</span> <span id="s1863">So he decided we better do that.</span> <span id="s1864">So I went down in my jeep and met this doctor who was living in a little cabin in the woods.</span> <span id="s1865">A very dignified, middle-aged man who spoke relatively good English.</span> <span id="s1866">I told him the circumstances and said we would pay him well to come and take care of this child.</span> <span id="s1867">And he said, "Alright."</span> <span id="s1868">And he got into the jeep with his bag and he came.</span> <span id="s1869">And he spent about 48 hours without sleep taking care of this baby.</span> <span id="s1870">And he saved her.</span> <span id="s1871">After it was all over, I drove him back to his cabin and gave him German money, a large sum and I said, "I trust that's enough for your services."</span> <span id="s1872">He said, "I don't care about the money."</span> <span id="s1873">He said, "I want a letter from you addressed to military government saying that you recommend that I be permitted to practice again because I saved this Jewish child."</span> <span id="s1874">Now I said, in effect, "Doctor, you should live so long."</span> <span id="s1875">And I left the money, and I left with him not being very happy with me.</span> <span id="s1876">The end of this story is not a pleasant one.</span> <span id="s1877">The child developed acute leukemia at the age of 4 and died.</span> <span id="s1878">The family had other children, but that was a bad blow.</span> <span id="s1879">That was in the United States.</span> <span id="s1880">Okay.</span> <span id="s1881">You know who to talk to if you want more about that one, and if that person says to you, "Cut it completely," I insist you have to do so.</span> <span id="s1882">She has a perfect right to her privacy and if this is too much to identification it's got to go.</span> <span id="s1883">Next, after the exodus we went into a bad time.</span> <span id="s1884">Uh...First of all, all the stuff was going on at the United Nations.</span> <span id="s1885">Would there be a Jewish State, whether or not there would be a Jewish State, where they'd be partitioned, wouldn't there be partition and what should we be doing meanwhile.</span> <span id="s1886">So I sat in my office day after day in Heidelberg doing not very much.</span> <span id="s1887">Uh...Taught English to a couple of medical students at Heildelberg University.</span> <span id="s1888">Uh...This, I think, is worthwhile story.</span> <span id="s1889">Uh...The University gave 15 fellowship to Jewish survivors to study medicine.</span> <span id="s1890">Full tuition and books.</span> <span id="s1891">Three of them I still have communication with.</span> <span id="s1892">One of them was my secretary's husband, and...uh...he practices as an internist in New York, and we are good friends.</span> <span id="s1893">I taught him English.</span> <span id="s1894">She was my secretary because she spoke Hebrew, German, Yiddish, Hungarian, Russian, and was a remarkable woman.</span> <span id="s1895">She still is.</span> <span id="s1896">Her husband is a good doctor.</span> <span id="s1897">Two of them are my story really.</span> <span id="s1898">It...uh...has to be told backwards.</span> <span id="s1899">About two years ago, here in Washington, my wife attended a seminar at the Washington School of Psychiatry, being conducted by two very imminent psychiatrists from the University of Cincinnati Medical School, named Ornstein.</span> <span id="s1900">Anna and Paul Ornstein.</span> <span id="s1901">They had the full day and Esther went up at the end to thank them, and Anna said to her, "Tell me your name again.</span> <span id="s1902">I want to remember you."</span> <span id="s1903">She told her her name.</span> <span id="s1904">Paul, who was standing about 10 feet away, came over and said, "What did you say your name was?"</span> <span id="s1905">She told him.</span> <span id="s1906">He said, "Are you by any chance related to...to Chaplain Lipman."</span> <span id="s1907">Anybody who calls me Chaplan Lipman goes back to Germany.</span> <span id="s1908">She said, "Yes, I am married to him."</span> <span id="s1909">At which point, he bursts into tears, threw his arms around her and wouldn't let her go.</span> <span id="s1910">He and Anna had been two of those medical students in Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s1911">Very poor.</span> <span id="s1912">They had a room in a German house.</span> <span id="s1913">The Germans would do nothing for them.</span> <span id="s1914">They lived, aside from going to medical school which they wanted to do, for Friday night for whenever I was in town we had a Shabbat service, and if anybody else could conduct one when I wasn't there, they had a Shabbat service, followed by a Shabbat dinner for all the Jews in the area.</span> <span id="s1915">Displaced persons, G.I.s, the Palestinians who might be passing through because our house was a way station for any illegal going through.</span> <span id="s1916">We had 4 bedrooms on the third floor with 12 army cots and we had as many as 14 people on a given night.</span> <span id="s1917">Uh...And then of course the arms and the czar.</span> <span id="s1918">They came and went without us.</span> <span id="s1919">They had a key to the cellar and they moved out.</span> <span id="s1920">After the service and dinner, we sit around and talked.</span> <span id="s1921">And it was the only adult conversation these people had and they thought of the Chaplain as somebody very special.</span> <span id="s1922">The next night after this revelation, Paul gave a lecture in Washington and I went and then we went out afterwards to drink coffee and begin to catch and he looked at me and he smiled and he said, "You know.</span> <span id="s1923">It's eerie."</span> <span id="s1924">I said, "Why?"</span> <span id="s1925">He said, "You are only 4 years older than I am."</span> <span id="s1926">I said, "Oh, you're thinking of that Chaplain."</span> <span id="s1927">He said, "That's right.</span> <span id="s1928">I have never quite gotten rid of that image."</span> <span id="s1929">I said, "Please get rid of it (laughter) real fast."</span> <span id="s1930">And we have seen a great deal of one another since then, and are good friends.</span> <span id="s1931">The person who saved their lives in Heildelberg was a Protestant minister.</span> <span id="s1932">Herman Maus,...uh... whom I call the of Heildeberg.</span> <span id="s1933">I read an article about him once.</span> <span id="s1934">He had been a very famous pastor...uh...before World War II was pastor of the Holy Ghost Church of Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s1935">He had become a Zionist in 1933 because when he grew up in Titisay in the Black Forest, his father, a poor pastor, had not been able to send him to college.</span> <span id="s1936">A Jew in Titisay came to him and said, "Herman, you want to be a pastor like a father don't you?"</span> <span id="s1937">And he said, "Yes.</span> <span id="s1938">You have to go to school, don't you."</span> <span id="s1939">"Yes.</span> <span id="s1940">Okay, you go to school and I will take care of the bills.</span> <span id="s1941">You just be a good pastor."</span> <span id="s1942">The year he graduated and was ordained the Jewish friend said, "Herman, you've done well.</span> <span id="s1943">Before you take up your first congregation, you have a vacation coming.</span> <span id="s1944">He handed him some money and told him to take a vacation.</span> <span id="s1945">And he went to Switzerland and he turned up in Bail during the 1903 Zionist Convention, the famous one at which the Uganda Resolution was turned down, and he met Hertzl and he met Nordau and he met all of those people, and he joined up.</span> <span id="s1946">David Yellin became his particular friend.</span> <span id="s1947">He made his first trip to Palestine with his wife and daughter in 1933 this summer, and he said to David Yellin, "I'm not going back.</span> <span id="s1948">There is where I belong and this is where I want to stay."</span> <span id="s1949">And Yellin said to him, "Herman, you haven't earned the right to stay.</span> <span id="s1950">You have to go back and to earn it."</span> <span id="s1951">The daughter said, "My father can go back.</span> <span id="s1952">I am not going."</span> <span id="s1953">And the daughter remained in Jerusalem, became a weaver, until after World War II.</span> <span id="s1954">When her father got very old, she went back to care of them because the mother couldn't anymore.</span> <span id="s1955">But she lived in Palestine the whole time.</span> <span id="s1956">He came back and because he was a pacifist, he went to every peace meeting there was anywhere in Europe carrying messages about how to get Jewish kids out, how to save this, how to save that, and he did that until 1941 when the Germans picked him up and put him in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1957">And he and his wife both spent the war years in a concentration camp, and they both survived.</span> <span id="s1958">He came back and became Dean of the Diocese, that's second to the Bishop and did several things which were characteristic of him.</span> <span id="s1959">First of all, every Yom Kippur, he spent all day in the synagogue and fasted as penance for the Germans.</span> <span id="s1960">Second of all, he announced to his congregation, that is to the people he dealt with, that for the rest of his life he would never preach a sermon on a New Testament theme.</span> <span id="s1961">That it was time that Christians went back to their origins and learned what they should have been.</span> <span id="s1962">He preached only out of the Hebrew bible for the rest of his life, and he never missed.</span> <span id="s1963">I know that.</span> <span id="s1964">Third of all, every Jewish displaced person around he would take food to.</span> <span id="s1965">He visited all of these students at least once a week bringing them food on condition that they tell nobody.</span> <span id="s1966">My secretary never told me that she ever had a visit from him.</span> <span id="s1967">Anna and Paul told me last year about their relationship with Maus.</span> <span id="s1968">Maus had been to my home.</span> <span id="s1969">I had been to his home.</span> <span id="s1970">He took me to meet Carl Yasburs, and we had an incomprehensible conversation one day (laughter) and...uh.</span> <span id="s1971">.</span> <span id="s1972">but he never told me.</span> <span id="s1973">No one told me.</span> <span id="s1974">They kept their promise.</span> <span id="s1975">He looked after these people.</span> <span id="s1976">I think it's absolutely fitting that there is a large forest in Israel named for him, and it pleases me.</span> <span id="s1977">You know this is all part of the Heidelberg saga.</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1979">Let us break at this point.</span> <span id="s1980">We're going to break and change tapes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">A: You know what we ought to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">Q: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">A: It's a quarter after 2:00.</span> <span id="s1984">My own suggestion would be that we break until you have a chance to read this stuff and I have a chance to go through the letters.</span> <span id="s1985">I have mentioned a number of times the role that luck played in getting results and coincidence.</span> <span id="s1986">Luck every one in awhile reunited a family.</span> <span id="s1987">I have one particular memory of being in my office in Regensburg, and a young woman came in, kind of agitated and excited.</span> <span id="s1988">She had heard a rumor.</span> <span id="s1989">She had no living relatives so far as she knew.</span> <span id="s1990">Everybody had been killed, but she heard a rumor that maybe her younger brother had survived and was in Germany.</span> <span id="s1991">And I said, "Do you have any idea where?"</span> <span id="s1992">And she said, "Yal.</span> <span id="s1993">I think so."</span> <span id="s1994">I said, "The way to find out is to go there.</span> <span id="s1995">There's no point in trying to do it...uh...by any other way."</span> <span id="s1996">So we got in my jeep and we went.</span> <span id="s1997">We got to this town and found a Jew and asked around and it was her brother and he was there.</span> <span id="s1998">And we really should have tape recorders in those days.</span> <span id="s1999">Every recording of the looks on their faces as they met each other, each believing...having been forced to believe that the other was dead.</span> <span id="s2000">Every once in awhile a tragedy occurred however in this connection.</span> <span id="s2001">I remember a case, sad case, which has since been written up in the annals of Jews Law.</span> <span id="s2002">I didn't decide it.</span> <span id="s2003">A guy came in to one of our communities, lived there, and did not know what had become of his wife.</span> <span id="s2004">Went on the assumption that she was killed.</span> <span id="s2005">We took a sort of informal position.</span> <span id="s2006">Jewish law didn't permit it, but we took it informally that as a certain date there would be a presumption that anybody who hadn't been heard from was dead.</span> <span id="s2007">I don't remember whether it was 2 years or what length of time.</span> <span id="s2008">And we...we knew this was an informal, not...uh...sanctioned, position in Jewish law, but...uh...people had to get on with their lives.</span> <span id="s2009">And a lot of people were just plain missing.</span> <span id="s2010">There was no way to find out.</span> <span id="s2011">And this man met a woman, wanted to marry her, and...uh...the time came and they married.</span> <span id="s2012">And 6 months later, his first wife turned up.</span> <span id="s2013">She had been off in Soviet Union over in Siberia somewhere and it had taken a long time for her to get out and to come to Germany.</span> <span id="s2014">Under Jewish law, of course, he had to divorce both of them.</span> <span id="s2015">And as happens so often, one does not hear the end of the story.</span> <span id="s2016">I don't know with which one he ended up.</span> <span id="s2017">I am not sure that it matters at this point.</span> <span id="s2018">The dilemma...that was a very poignant one, and the fact that I have only one story out of the many hundreds of people...uh...with whom I came into contact during those 3 years is, I think, a marked statement of the propriety of making a decision that just set a date after which you have to gamble.</span> <span id="s2019">You gamble.</span> <span id="s2020">For most of the people, they had a little mazal and the gamble was okay.</span> <span id="s2021">When they married, they could stay married.</span> <span id="s2022">I don't think it's good luck that one's first spouse is dead, but there it is</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">Q: Under what circumstances did you leave Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">A: We finished our work.</span> <span id="s2025">We had a huge celebration in November when the partition plan was announced...uh.......decided not to send transports thereafter because what was the point of...of that, and then changed our minds because it was a good idea to keep pressure on the British and have more people go to Cyprus.</span> <span id="s2026">So we did somewhat.</span> <span id="s2027">Not a great deal though.</span> <span id="s2028">Much of it by then was being done from Constansus or from Italy, not from France, and I simply don't know about those operations.</span> <span id="s2029">One of the generalizations that you have to know about is that none of us knew anything we didn't have to know.</span> <span id="s2030">People keep asking me did you know so and so who worked on this.</span> <span id="s2031">One of my closest friends in the kibitz in Israel is a man who was one of the leaders of the Berichah in Italy.</span> <span id="s2032">I never met him in Europe.</span> <span id="s2033">I met him in 1960 when I got to the kibbutz because he was not my business.</span> <span id="s2034">I knew what I had to know and nothing else.</span> <span id="s2035">In Washington, it's called "need to know."</span> <span id="s2036">Uh...the doctrine of secrecy.</span> <span id="s2037">But by February, March of 1948, it was clear that the State would come in to be, and that our work, Berichah, would end.</span> <span id="s2038">There would be lots of people at the camps, a lot of to become Israelis would have to stay there.</span> <span id="s2039">To help and to work and to teach and all the things that they were doing legally, but I was none of those things.</span> <span id="s2040">My operation would end.</span> <span id="s2041">I turned down, with thanks, the suggestion, an urgent one, from of my...uh...Israeli friends that I take Esther and our one and half children and go to Israel and fly for the upcoming air force which at that point had one and a half piper cubs, I think.</span> <span id="s2042">I said, "No, Thanks, that...that isn't how I wanted to die," as a matter (laughter) and decided very reluctantly to go home.</span> <span id="s2043">Mostly because of the war.</span> <span id="s2044">That there was a war coming was clear, and...uh... I had had my war.</span> <span id="s2045">So, in...uh...April of 48, we tried to get out of Germany.</span> <span id="s2046">It was almost as hard to get out of Germany as it was to get into Germany because the American Army had forms and you had to fill them out, and a pregnant wife caused problems.</span> <span id="s2047">We wanted desperately to go to Norway.</span> <span id="s2048">I have a thing for Scandinavia, and take the Oslo home.</span> <span id="s2049">They wouldn't let us.</span> <span id="s2050">The Oslo did not have a full-time physician on board.</span> <span id="s2051">Although my wife was having the healthiest pregnancy in the history of the world, but there had to be a ship with a doctor.</span> <span id="s2052">The Army would not take responsibility.</span> <span id="s2053">So we decided to come home on the SS America from Lauf, and we close up the house and shipped everything home.</span> <span id="s2054">Michael was very disturbed because nothing he was ever going to see again.</span> <span id="s2055">He was 3, and....uh...he couldn't bring his dog, and I think that bothered him more than anything else.</span> <span id="s2056">He...uh...he really a mess.</span> <span id="s2057">But we got to Paris, settled in for a couple of days and went to the boat .</span> <span id="s2058">Two of the people in the world closest to us were Eva Kaufman, now Eva Kaufman Penn, and her late husband, Rabbi Jay Kaufman.</span> <span id="s2059">They had gone to Jerusalem in 1946 for Jay to get a doctorate at Hebrew University.</span> <span id="s2060">Uh...They tried to leave the United States in the middle of the Maritime strike, and they got held up, and stayed at our house in Staten Island.</span> <span id="s2061">When they left they were allowed to go, but they couldn't take the car.</span> <span id="s2062">They had Palestine and stayed with us until Paul was done.</span> <span id="s2063">It was this kind of relationship.</span> <span id="s2064">Then they disappeared in the wilds of Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s2065">What we heard about them once in awhile was from Jay's parents who would drop us a note saying they got a letter.</span> <span id="s2066">They were okay, and then we didn't get that any more for awhile because Jerusalem was under siege, and they were in the of Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s2067">We were in Paris, and we went to to the and Michael was riding a little kiddie car up and down the platform, and we suddenly heard a scream.</span> <span id="s2068">It was Eva.</span> <span id="s2069">She and Jay had tickets for the same ship to come home.</span> <span id="s2070">Coincidence.</span> <span id="s2071">And she was 2 weeks more pregnant than Esther, and we had a 5 day trip across the Atlantic which was an extraordinary experience, just trying to catch up with one another with these two very pregnant ladies.</span> <span id="s2072">Their son, their first child, was born on Israel's independence day, and our second child was born 2 weeks later.</span> <span id="s2073">I had had an offer from Henry Montaur, the head of the UJA, and the world's greatest fund raiser in all of history.</span> <span id="s2074">I would add here that the 1948 UJA campaign raised a hundred and 80 million dollars.</span> <span id="s2075">As of that date, that was the largest fund raising campaign in private hands in the history of the world.</span> <span id="s2076">And it was not surpassed for quite awhile.</span> <span id="s2077">Now, of course, it sounds like small money thanks to inflation, but it was an absolutely amazing out-pouring of money.</span> <span id="s2078">Uh...And I spent 3 months doing speaking full time.</span> <span id="s2079">One of my first speeches was on the night of Israel's independence.</span> <span id="s2080">I went to Norfolk, Virginia, to speak.</span> <span id="s2081">Why was I sent to Norfolk?</span> <span id="s2082">Because the featured speaker was the Senator from Kentucky, Alban Berkley, shortly to become Vice President of the United States.</span> <span id="s2083">Now Barkley was one of the world's worst speakers in terms of content, but he was an affable pleasant guy and he loved Jews.</span> <span id="s2084">And he went around making speeches for Jews and for Israel and for Zionism all the time.</span> <span id="s2085">So he was to be the featured speaker.</span> <span id="s2086">He made a very short speech.</span> <span id="s2087">He walked over, wrapped himself in the Israel flag, and the cameras popped and I made a sort of content speech.</span> <span id="s2088">Only later I discovered how much money he was paid for all the speeches he made for the Zionist movement and for Israel and for the UJA and the rest.</span> <span id="s2089">Fortunately, I make it a practice not to have illusions about public figures, so I didn't get disillusioned about him.</span> <span id="s2090">Uh...He was not a pleasant experience.</span> <span id="s2091">Most of them were very pleasant experiences because to watch people give more money than they ought to give...uh...has its beauties.</span> <span id="s2092">And the statements they made.</span> <span id="s2093">Uh...I didn't fight in the second World War.</span> <span id="s2094">I was too old.</span> <span id="s2095">I was not involved in the decimation of our people in Europe.</span> <span id="s2096">Therefore, the least I can do is pay for it.</span> <span id="s2097">And the money poured in.</span> <span id="s2098">Unbelievable amounts of money.</span> <span id="s2099">I learned to respect sacrificial giving for the first time.</span> <span id="s2100">There has been very little of it, of course, but I respect it when I find it.</span> <span id="s2101">I was invited to go to Hawaii to open their campaign.</span> <span id="s2102">That was exciting.</span> <span id="s2103">Never been to Hawaii.</span> <span id="s2104">And I understood that the Hawaii Jewish community was all excited.</span> <span id="s2105">When you're that far away, you get more excitement.</span> <span id="s2106">Excitement grows in direct proportion to the distance from the action.</span> <span id="s2107">And...uh...Montra called, asked me to go.</span> <span id="s2108">I said, "What dates?"</span> <span id="s2109">And he said, "Well, the affair is on June 2nd, but you would have to go a day or 2 early because it's a long way."</span> <span id="s2110">And I said, "Forget it.</span> <span id="s2111">Not me.</span> <span id="s2112">We're due to have a baby right on June 2nd."</span> <span id="s2113">And...uh...he kinda said, "So what?"</span> <span id="s2114">And I understood that.</span> <span id="s2115">I said, "Well, I wasn't there when the first one was born, and I have solemn advice from my wife that if I am not there when the second one is born, there won't be a third and I won't have a wife.</span> <span id="s2116">And I believe her."</span> <span id="s2117">And he was a little bit upset, but he accepted that.</span> <span id="s2118">As it happens, the child was born on June the lst so it was very sensible of me to stay home.</span> <span id="s2119">Those 3 months were exhilarating and exhausting.</span> <span id="s2120">And then I settled down for the first time since I had become a Rabbi to be a Rabbi.</span> <span id="s2121">I accepted a position at our seminary to teach and to get my doctorate and we moved to Cincinnati and became people for the first time.</span> <span id="s2122">No longer did our son Michael get into a pullman berth and say, "Home," which he had done a number of times when he was 2 years old and traveling constantly.</span> <span id="s2123">I'm done.</span> <span id="s2124">Finished.</span></p> <p><span id="s2125">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2126">A: Unless you have something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2127">Q: No.</span> <span id="s2128">I don't think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">Conclusion of Interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s2130">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0135 PAGE 39</span></p></body></html>
