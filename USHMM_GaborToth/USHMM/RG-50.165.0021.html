Did you come here by boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">DF: Yes, in 1949, on a Dutch boat, called the Noordam.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">WH: Where are you from?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">DF: From a small town in Hungary.</span> <span id="s16">I was born in 1921.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">WH: Where were you taken at first?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">DF: I went to the Hotel Marseilles.</span> <span id="s19">NYANA (New York Assoc. for New Americans) took me there.</span> <span id="s20">I davened (prayed) at the Sassower shul (synagogue) on 103rd Street.</span> <span id="s21">I stayed on the West Side until the end of May.</span> <span id="s22">Then I went to Williamsburg because our people were moving there.</span> <span id="s23">The Lower East Side was becoming a bad neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">WH: When you came on the boat were you dressed like a Hasid (ultra-Orthodox)?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">DF: No, because after the war I returned to my town in Hungary and the people were very anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s26">It was too much for them that an average Jew should go with a beard; only a shochet (kosher butcher) or a rabbi dressed like that.</span> <span id="s27">So I went with a black hat and a dark suit.</span> <span id="s28">But the minute I stepped off the boat I began to grow a beard.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">WH: After all you saw in the camps, how were you able to keep your belief in God?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">DF: This question you could ask anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">WH: And if someone asked you, what would you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">DF: If a father slaps his son, is he no longer his father?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">WH: But what about a big slap?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">DF: What’s the difference?</span> <span id="s35">Does a heretic really understand the world?</span> <span id="s36">Every day he thinks that he thought the day before is no longer true.</span> <span id="s37">I also don’t understand everything.</span> <span id="s38">This is a faulty question.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">WH: I’m only asking you for the book, not because I personally don’t understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">DF: I’ll ask you—when Einstein stated his theory, how many people in the world understood him?</span> <span id="s41">Two?</span> <span id="s42">Three?</span> <span id="s43">And twenty years after Einstein died, how many more people really understood it?</span> <span id="s44">One knows the mechanics, but not the logic</span></p> <p><span id="s45">behind it.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">WH: I interviewed a man from Munkac, Hungary, who said he could no longer believe because the irreligious Jews who came to America before the war didn’t get killed.</span> <span id="s47">He also questioned how God could allow women and children to be killed.</span> <span id="s48">What do you say to a man who asks those questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">DF: I don’t like to go into philosophical matters like these.</span> <span id="s50">It’s not good or healthy.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">But this person who asks such questions never really believed deeply.</span> <span id="s52">You know who believed?</span> <span id="s53">People who put on tefillin and who didn’t eat non-kosher food in the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">WH: Have you been to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">DF: Yes, four or five times.</span> <span id="s56">I like it there.</span> <span id="s57">I have relatives there.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">WH: Why didn’t you go to Israel after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">DF: Two reasons.</span> <span id="s60">First, many who went found life so difficult there they had to leave and they came to America.</span> <span id="s61">Second, I’ll explain it by way of an example: If I see a Jew smoking on Shabbos (Sabbath) in the street, I don’t like it but I don’t do anything about it.</span> <span id="s62">But if I saw my own son smoking in my house on Shabbos, would I stand for it?</span> <span id="s63">Of course not.</span> <span id="s64">So this is how I feel about Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">WH: What was it like in terms of Yiddishkeit ( Jewish culture) when you first came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">DF: Most of the stores in Williamsburg were still open on Shabbos in the early fifties, and if not for the highway construction, most of the American Jews would have stayed there.</span> <span id="s67">Several American shuls (synagogues) were removed to make room for the highway.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">WH: But you stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">DF: Well, the greener (newcomers) were greener.</span> <span id="s70">They had no money.</span> <span id="s71">Where should we have gone?</span> <span id="s72">So we stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">WH: What kind of work did you do here?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">DF: I worked a little as a shochet (kosher butcher) and as a shammos (sexton / custodian) in a shul.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">WH: How many children do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">DF: Seven.</span> <span id="s77">One of my daughters has fourteen children.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">WH: It must have been hard to financially support them?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">DF: No.</span> <span id="s80">As they say, “Every child brings his own luck into the world.”</span></p> <p><span id="s81">WH: What do they do?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">DF: Some are in business and some are learning.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">WH: Where are the Jews here from?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">DF: Here in New Square, the Jews are mostly Hungarian.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">WH: Do you think what happened in Europe could happen here?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">DF: There could be a Hitler here legally with our system of government.</span> <span id="s87">Hitler was elected by a multi-party parliament.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">WH: When you think of voting for someone here, do you think in terms of whether or not he would be good for Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">DF: Not necessarily.</span> <span id="s90">I live here and I can’t say all my thinking is about Israel.</span> <span id="s91">If there was a situation here that would be good for Jews here but not so good for Israel, what would you do?</span> <span id="s92">You would pick here.</span> <span id="s93">But in general, of course, what’s good for Israel is likely to be good for the Jews here.</span> <span id="s94">Certainly the Gentile doesn’t make that distinction.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">WH: What about blacks?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">DF: My opinion is different than that of many people.</span> <span id="s97">I went through a great deal in Europe and I don’t see where the whites are better than the blacks.</span> <span id="s98">When someone is oppressed, he looks for a scapegoat.</span> <span id="s99">So the blacks pick on the Jews.</span> <span id="s100">If blacks had the same education and family life as whites, they would be no different than the whites.</span> <span id="s101">Now Puerto Ricans are different.</span> <span id="s102">They can be very nice, but if they get angry, they lose control of themselves completely.</span> <span id="s103">At that point they could stab you.</span> <span id="s104">Blacks could be the same sometimes but not if they’re brought up in a good environment.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">WH: Are people still moving in to New Square?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">DF: The Skvirer Rebbe’s position now is he doesn’t accept new people, only those who grew up here.</span> <span id="s107">Outsiders can cause difficulties.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">WH: Why did you come here?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">DF: Because of the crime and it was nice here.</span> <span id="s110">It was also not so expensive.</span> <span id="s111">Today, it costs no more to live here than in Williamsburg and less than in Monsey.</span> <span id="s112">It’s similar here to Monroe although we are perhaps more secluded than Monroe.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">WH: Have you been back to Hungary since the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">DF: I went recently to check on my family’s graves.</span> <span id="s115">When I went I couldn’t open my mouth.</span> <span id="s116">I was like a stone.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">WH: When you get together with other survivors, do you talk about the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">DF: It’s impossible to get together with survivors without telling stories about the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">WH: Did religious people act better than others during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">DF: I saw it.</span> <span id="s121">The religious didn’t say they had to have everything.</span> <span id="s122">I saw educated people from Pest who acted like animals.</span> <span id="s123">But not us, the religious ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">WH: What is your impression of Elie Wiesel?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">DF: He is a righteous Jew.</span> <span id="s126">He went to yeshiva.</span> <span id="s127">I don’t have a real opinion.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">(reluctant to comment)</span></p> <p><span id="s129">WH: I understand you’ve also published something.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">DF: Yes, I’ve edited and gotten published certain teachings of my rebbe.</span> <span id="s131">[He shows me the book and we agree to exchange books, one of his for one of mine.</span> <span id="s132">He was under the impression I was studying for my doctorate and was surprised to learn that I’ve already written some books.</span> <span id="s133">His book is in its second edition.]</span></p> <p><span id="s134">WH: Is there a difference between the way a Hasidic Jew looks at the Holocaust and the way a Lithuanian or Modern Orthodox Jew sees it?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">DF: I would say there is no difference.</span> <span id="s136">The Holocaust did not challenge Hasidism: it challenged general belief.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">WH: What did the Holocaust teach you about people?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">DF: Why does every prayer that is said daily talk about the Gentiles?</span> <span id="s139">Save us from the Goyim (Gentiles), etc.</span> <span id="s140">Not because they’re so wonderful, but because they haven’t risen to the level yet to be decent people.</span> <span id="s141">Haven’t we seen that when a Goy gets angry he can take a knife and stab someone to death and a Jew doesn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Why is that?</span> <span id="s143">Because we have a Torah and know how people are supposed to act.</span> <span id="s144">Every person is born an animal and without learning he remains that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">WH: What are you proudest of?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">DF: My children and grandchildren, of course.</span> <span id="s147">But you have to remember that I always look back into the past, what I went through.</span> <span id="s148">And when I look at the past, I can’t really be happy.</span> <span id="s149">I think about what might have been, what more I might have been able to [do] with my life, with scholarly activity, and I am sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Conclusion of Interview</span></p> <p><span id="s151">PAGE USHMM Archives RG-50.165*0021 PAGE 5</span></p> <p><span
