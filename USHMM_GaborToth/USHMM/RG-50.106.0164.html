Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Thea Sacca Rips, conducted by Gail Schwartz on January 20th, 2004, in Washington, D.C..</span> <span id="s4">This is tape number one, side A.</span> <span id="s5">What is your full name?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Answer: Thea Marguerita Valeria Sacca Rips.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Q: And when were you born and where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: I was born in Trieste on February 24, 1922.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Q: Tell me a little bit about your family, how long they had been there.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">A: Here in the United States, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: No, how long they had been in Trieste.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: Well, in Trieste from ’22 to ’27, because my father was working -- he was an engineer, electrical engineer, and he was working with the shipyards in Monfalcone.</span> <span id="s13">And when it were -- he was transfers to Fiume, which now is Rijeka.</span> <span id="s14">We moved to Fiume when I was about five years old.</span> <span id="s15">And we lived in Fiume until 1945, until the end of the war.</span> <span id="s16">And Father worked there, he was a chief -- he was the director of the electrical department of the shipyard.</span> <span id="s17">Can-Cantieri Navale del Quarnaro, where they were building all kind of ships, from submarines, even to the yacht for Mussolini they built, which was never delivered.</span> <span id="s18">And he was in charge of -- not only of the projects for the electrical equipment on the ships, but also of the -- care of the cranes and all the electrical equipment of the shipyard itself.</span> <span id="s19">And practically I was born with fascism, grew under fascism, without realizing -- it wa -- it w -- it was normal for -- for s -- my life.</span> <span id="s20">And we went to school.</span> <span id="s21">Then they came when -- when we went to school.</span> <span id="s22">Of course, we were all supposed to be piccolo Italiani, small, little Italians, because otherwise the schools -- apparently we were not able to go to school, as far as I know.</span> <span id="s23">I never realized that, of course.</span> <span id="s24">And I went through the whole system until I finished the -- what we call senior high school.</span> <span id="s25">Actually it is the Liceo Scientifico, Scientific Lyceum, which is practically comparable to the -- to here -- even though it was only four year.</span> <span id="s26">Four year of junior high and four years of senior high.</span> <span id="s27">The junior high I went to the technical institute.</span> <span id="s28">The senior high I went to the Liceo Scientifico.</span> <span id="s29">But as far as education, they told me it’s comparable, when you finish Liceo Scientific -- Scientifico, excuse me, like two years of college in this country, because we had very thorough, you know, the education in Europe.</span> <span id="s30">And that’s it.</span> <span id="s31">My father continued to work.</span> <span id="s32">H-He was never a -- a -- a carda -- a card holding fascist.</span> <span id="s33">He became -- he had to become or -- or -- a member of the fascist party in 1942, because otherwise he would have lost his job and h-he had responsibilities [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s34">He had trouble because he didn’t want to wear the uniform, and he never had a uniform and he never wore the black tie -- the -- the black shirt.</span> <span id="s35">But you know, they were, with the exceptions of few fanat -- a few -- several fanatics, the population was a strange population in Fiume because they were open-minded on one side and fascist on the other side because after the first World War, Fiume was next to Italy only in 1924, after the famous DiNunzio coup.</span> <span id="s36">Apparently th-the Italians didn’t want them, but they felt and they are still feel f -- extremely Italian, even though the population was mixed and the ch -- the city was occupied by everybody, from the Espaniards to the st -- Napoleon, th-the Venetians.</span> <span id="s37">It started as an Roman colony and -- but they were always, who knows why, very deeply, they felt deeply Italian.</span> <span id="s38">And so that’s why they accepted DiNunzio.</span> <span id="s39">So DiNunzio and Mussolini, even though they didn’t like each other very, very much, I must say -- for awhile they did, but then -- you see, they connected their fact that they were -- that they could join the Italian, they were admitted to be Italians betwe -- to DiNunzio and to Mussolini.</span> <span id="s40">So they felt in that fak -- ka -- in that sense they felt that they were fascists.</span> <span id="s41">Fascists because th -- fascism permitted them to be Italians, you know?</span> <span id="s42">The city was [indecipherable] after.</span> <span id="s43">And that’s it.</span> <span id="s44">I tell you also another thing, that this city which was extremely wealthy, small city, we ended up with 45,000 people, but we were much smaller when I was little, had many plans, many industries.</span> <span id="s45">It had the torpedo plant, it had th-the shipyards, it had the oil refinery.</span> <span id="s46">It had heavy machinery plant, it had mills, and it -- ab-absolutely everything, and the population, the workers were very well off.</span> <span id="s47">They had nice houses, we were going skiing together at the engineers -- th-th-th-the director, with the son of th-the -- th-th-th-th-the -- of -- of everybody.</span> <span id="s48">We were really a str -- strong community.</span> <span id="s49">We were playing tennis together with the children of the workers and so on.</span> <span id="s50">So much so that we had a limited number of poor, who were known all by name, you see.</span> <span id="s51">And there was a very important Jewish community, Ashkenazi, coming from the east, from the Balkans, from Germany.</span> <span id="s52">I don’t think there was a single Sephardic Jew, as far as I can remember.</span> <span id="s53">And we had in Villa Firenze where we lived, among the other places, just across of it, a beautiful, beautiful, three domed synagogue with the cupolas covered with copper tiles.</span> <span id="s54">It was really beautiful.</span> <span id="s55">And living across the street from them, you see -- we were always saying, oh, d -- you know, they were th-the -- the real Orthodox Jews, the one with the curls and the -- and the fur k -- and the hats with the fur around it, you see.</span> <span id="s56">And we were s -- and -- and they were telling us, you know -- we were children, we were -- we were actually not so much children al-already, they were saying, oh well we cou -- we cannot go in there, we cannot go in there, because you know, we -- they don’t allow us to go there and who knows what’s going on there?</span> <span id="s57">But I never heard about -- people talking about blood sacrifices or things like this because they were -- we were so interwined that even then there were not many, but there were several mixed marriages at the time.</span> <span id="s58">And in my case, for instance, I found -- I found out that some of my schoolmates in -- in school were Jewish because they were allowed, on the Sabbath -- because at the time we were going to school also on s -- on Saturday -- on the Sabbath they were not going to school, but they were justified.</span> <span id="s59">They were allowed not to come, because until the racial laws were applied, unfortunately, there was no problem.</span> <span id="s60">And -- and -- and -- and we were going -- Jewish kids and non-Jewish kids and Protestant kids, we were all together, we couldn’t care less about religion, o-or wherever they were coming from.</span> <span id="s61">And that was it.</span> <span id="s62">So, what did I say?</span> <span id="s63">And I remember, of all these other people, there was a -- a v -- a very interesting man, a -- a Jew, Mr. Tannenbaum, ma -- mister -- well fa -- probably Mr. Tannenbaum, for us he’s -- it looked like -- like a -- like a priest or something, because [indecipherable] we know, with the black caftan and the hat with the fur around.</span> <span id="s64">He was the sweetest man in the world.</span> <span id="s65">My father knew him well.</span> <span id="s66">He didn’t come to our house often, but he was going around the house of people he knew, he was friendly.</span> <span id="s67">He was collecting money for charities.</span> <span id="s68">But charities not for the Jewish population, for everybody who was born in town.</span> <span id="s69">He was well known for that.</span> <span id="s70">Then, of course, he disappeared.</span> <span id="s71">Life was very comfortable in Fiume, very comfortable.</span> <span id="s72">Every year we were going to a [speaks Italian here].</span> <span id="s73">And th-there I met a-another group of -- I had this group of Jewish friends tha -- the Lagers, Bondy and Kathy Lager, his bra -- his cousin, and we were all having fun going to the ocean together [indecipherable] this or that.</span> <span id="s74">And I remember they were already on guard in the sense that while we kind of ignored the musics from America, jazz, the [indecipherable] they already heard, may-maybe because they had relatives here or something, I don’t know for sure.</span> <span id="s75">But anyhow, they were bringing this music and we learned jazz through these Jewish friends of ours, you know.</span> <span id="s76">They were really fantastic.</span> <span id="s77">I remember that Bondy Lager was very much in love with me.</span> <span id="s78">An-And I met Bondy when I first came here in ’55, and he was married to an Austrian girl -- Jewish girl, and he had a child.</span> <span id="s79">And we met in -- in New York where he had a plant or -- or -- or a store -- o-of t-toys for -- and it -- it was very emotional, you know.</span> <span id="s80">After so many years, you know I call, who’s there?</span> <span id="s81">He says, B-Bondy’s there.</span> <span id="s82">Also because when Bondy escaped from Fiume in -- just as -- with the last boat which left Naple, it must have been 1940, his parents remained in Fiume.</span> <span id="s83">They were merchants and they had a deposit with they had all kind of food, the potatoes, all kind of thing.</span> <span id="s84">Th-The parents remained in Fiume, but Bondy and his sister came to the States.</span> <span id="s85">And they left from Naples.</span> <span id="s86">And when they left Fiume by train to go to Naples, my sister and myself went to the train to say goodbye.</span> <span id="s87">And the funny thing is that since at that time I was young and I had many boys at the same time growing around me, my sister was saying, you know, yi -- there is like a -- like a-a -- a torta, a -- a cake.</span> <span id="s88">All the flies go to hel -- you know?</span> <span id="s89">So that when Bondy was writing to me, he was saying lot of love to the torta, you know [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s90">Well, that was the story of Bondy.</span> <span id="s91">His -- his cousin went to Milan, h-he’s -- hid in Milan, the -- Lazi, because they were of Hungarian descent, that Lazi -- Ladizlow, and -- and he was all right.</span> <span id="s92">Then what happened with this?</span> <span id="s93">The anschluss, yes, there’s -- now we come to the real s -- thing, which is important.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Let -- let me just ask you some questions before we get to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: You say you had it -- you have a sister ti -- and what is her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: My sister name is Laura and she is five years younger than I am.</span> <span id="s98">And f -- wh-while we were in Fiume, more or less we shared our life, but being five years younger, you know, she had -- at that moment she had her group and I had my group.</span> <span id="s99">We were always together because we were hikers and skiers and we were going every f -- every weekend -- weekend -- every Sunday of every festivity.</span> <span id="s100">We -- Father introduced us to the love of nature and -- a-an-and -- and mountains and thing.</span> <span id="s101">We were going skiing or hiking.</span> <span id="s102">And she was very funny, they loved her very much, so much so that when I f-finished the -- ha -- the Lyceum, the senior high and there was the party, she was invited too, because she was so funny, and sh -- and so agile that she was making herself a ball, and they were throwing her like one.</span> <span id="s103">It was -- she -- she’s still a funny character, I must say.</span> <span id="s104">Unfortunately she cannot be a ball any more, but she is still go to the -- to the gym.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: What are your parent’s names?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: My father is Giorgio and my mother was Emma Pacore.</span> <span id="s107">Because my father parents were -- are -- well, my gr-grandmother from my father’s side was born in Courtsela, and my grandfather was born in Montenegro, in Corta, but they lived always in Trieste.</span> <span id="s108">My grandfather was a purser or [indecipherable] there is a special name, it’s [speaks Italian] which is the assistant purser, but one who is in charge of buying all the material f-f-food, everything for the ships, for the liners of the Austrian Lloyd, which later on became Lloyd Adriatico.</span> <span id="s109">No, first I think it was Lloyd Triestino, and then Lloyd Adriatico.</span> <span id="s110">And he traveled a lot to the Orient, so much so that the house of my grandparents had a lot of Oriental stuff, which like stupid we broke, and not only if we had not broken, we had to leave there when we escaped as refugees, so it was all lost.</span> <span id="s111">And my -- and his mother -- I -- we -- I have the documents, but I don’t remember -- I don’t know where she was born, but she was Italian speaking and German speaking, and she had three sons.</span> <span id="s112">My grandfather was the youngest one, and when her husband died -- and I don’t know what her husband did, which I think he was making bottles, wine bottles.</span> <span id="s113">He had the plant where he was making wine bottles.</span> <span id="s114">And she was a -- she didn’t finish school.</span> <span id="s115">When my grandfather -- great grandfather died, on my father’s side, she c -- finished her school, she became a teacher, and I still have the documents where she writes to the Austrian, to Vienna, to have the permission to teach in a school for girls, you know?</span> <span id="s116">But everything written in Italia.</span> <span id="s117">When Mussolini, as soon as he took over, forbade the people of our area -- we’re in -- th-the interland of Fiume was Slav, Croatian and [indecipherable] Trieste Slav, Slovenian, he forbade them to use their language, he made them change their names, and he was stupid, while Franz Josef was smart enough to let each -- each nationality to use their own language and si -- that’s why we lost that, kind of, because if he had been more intelligent, I will speak Croatian, which I love, and -- and they wouldn’t ha -- we -- we wouldn’t have made enemies.</span> <span id="s118">Instead, they were enemies.</span> <span id="s119">Of course, they forced to -- to -- to use a language -- the old people wer -- never could speak Italian, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s121">And -- and Fiume is a -- a city on the -- on the Adriatic, a port city on the Adriatic --</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Oh [indecipherable] yes, it’s right, you know, with the eastern peninsula on one side, you know, there is like a triangle.</span> <span id="s123">There is Trieste.</span> <span id="s124">Then, at the tip of the triangle is Paola, or Pula as they call it now, and then it’s Fiume on the other side that -- of -- and we -- now it’s called Rijeka, which means Fiume too, beca -- also in Russia, Rijeka is -- Rijeka is Fiume.</span> <span id="s125">And then immediately there is the Dalmatian coast and along the Dalmatian coast, among the islands is the island where my grandmother was born.</span> <span id="s126">And my grandmother was speaking German, of course, Croatian and Italian.</span> <span id="s127">So did my cra -- grandfather.</span> <span id="s128">So that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: You have one sister, do you have any other sisters or brothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: No, no, no, only one sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Now you say you were born in 1922.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: When a man named Hitler came into power in 1933, did you hear of him then?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Well, you know, we kids, we couldn’t care less about politics, you know.</span> <span id="s135">I think this is typical.</span> <span id="s136">Maybe now may -- maybe now kids follow more, but I know more about ancient history than the history that I lived through.</span> <span id="s137">Now I remember, now I start to -- to give importance to the facts, you know, but I went through the war in -- Spanish war, when -- when we had the Franco, that was a very good chance to go and take a day vacation because we were going demonstrating against this, or -- or when the [indecipherable] to go demonstrate on the British consulate.</span> <span id="s138">You know, it was -- in the meantime we didn’t know -- we’re not going to school.</span> <span id="s139">We didn't even know what we are doing, it was just having fun, you know.</span> <span id="s140">And as our famous journalist Indro Montanelli, who is now -- now dead [indecipherable] said, you know, who cared about fascism or anything until things happened?</span> <span id="s141">We were young.</span> <span id="s142">We didn’t think, we -- we didn’t -- we didn’t s -- we didn’t suffer.</span> <span id="s143">We didn’t follow th-the -- all the stories so much [indecipherable] this and that.</span> <span id="s144">Father, yes, probably, but in my home we never spoke about politics, never.</span> <span id="s145">Father was a rather -- rather closed character, and I think that we [indecipherable] never discussed politics.</span> <span id="s146">They just didn’t agree, they did what they had to do, their job.</span> <span id="s147">They didn’t participate to the famous [indecipherable] reunions, every ti -- ev-every -- every Saturday.</span> <span id="s148">They didn’t -- they were just -- I mean, an-and they were not disturbed, they -- they could live their life.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: How religious was your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Catholic.</span> <span id="s151">I was bor -- baptized -- born and baptized in Trieste in the famous San Giusto [indecipherable] church, you know, Roman -- beautiful Romanic church, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: So, up to the time of the anschluss --</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: -- you had Jewish friends, you were comfortable with them --</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Oh, very.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: -- you played with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Oh well, of course.</span> <span id="s158">Th-They’ve -- then, actually only after a -- a f -- I must say, after the anschluss and then in ’38 the ration laws came about, we realized that there were Jews and non-Jews.</span> <span id="s159">And we were -- I -- I --</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: These are racial laws in Fiume?</span> <span id="s161">A: In da -- always in Fiume, yes, because we didn’t move from Fiume until the end of the war.</span> <span id="s162">A-And --</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: What -- what were some of the restrictions?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: What were some of the restrictions of the racial laws?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Well, they were supposed not to have maids.</span> <span id="s167">The ki -- the girls couldn’t come to school, but the professor, for quite a long time, kept an eye closed and the kids were coming to school just the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Then, when they realized it, they started to be the -- th-the worst part started when the Germans took over, because until 1943, when the ger -- when, after the armistice, the Germans occupied the area, and it was the only area of Italy which was incorporated into Germany.</span> <span id="s170">At that time we became part of Germany.</span> <span id="s171">And that when the real trouble started.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: A -- but up to that time, did you still have close contact with your Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Yes, because after the anschluss, we had these -- well, in the same building was living an engineer fa -- naval engineer working [indecipherable] a friend of Father, working in the same shipyard [indecipherable] Fierst, Bruno Fierst.</span> <span id="s174">Then there was the fa -- the Weiss family, Jewish.</span> <span id="s175">The daughter married a Catholic boy, a -- the brother of a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s176">She was studying piano, she was playing beautifully.</span> <span id="s177">On the groun -- on the first floor was living -- were living the Moscovitz.</span> <span id="s178">The Moscovitz had a beautiful -- kind of hardware store, but they were selling toys and everything.</span> <span id="s179">And every Christmas [indecipherable] it was a two story thing, you know, and it was on the wa -- in the -- o-on one of the main s-squares of Fiume, and they had on that -- on the second floor, an enormous window and there was appearing a Santa Claus, and showing -- and -- and the children, we were all on the street, you know, watching what was going on, and -- and he was showing the [indecipherable] and the children, to me, to me, to me, to me, you know, and these were the Moscovitz’, you know?</span> <span id="s180">And they were very nice.</span> <span id="s181">She was a very lovely little girl -- little woman, bu-but -- but he was even funnier because he was very, very short and very, very, very prim all the time, you know?</span> <span id="s182">But wonderful people, and they all had the mezuzah, th-the mezuzah on the their door, so what?</span> <span id="s183">You know, they [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: Did they ever confide in you that they were con -- or -- or -- your Jewish friends ever confide in you that they were concerned or frightened?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: Until ’43, no, they were not very -- they -- they didn’t like the idea.</span> <span id="s186">Many were smart enough, many -- I don’t know how many p -- but several left.</span> <span id="s187">But these friends, close friends of ours who were living in the same building, they didn’t.</span> <span id="s188">Then the -- the Weiss left first.</span> <span id="s189">Then the Moscovitz left.</span> <span id="s190">They had a maid, the Moscovitz, Paula -- Paola, Catholic.</span> <span id="s191">And when they left, they left the apartment, they were in the way it was.</span> <span id="s192">But even -- yes, there it was with the mezuzah on the door.</span> <span id="s193">They only gave us to save, to put aside for them, an enormous portrait, natural size, of Mr. Moscovitz, which we hid behind a -- a -- an armoire we had, you know?</span> <span id="s194">[indecipherable] okay.</span> <span id="s195">And when the Germans came th-there, that apartment, th-the maid was there -- oh sorry -- that the maid was there, and they occupied the apartment of the Moscovitz.</span> <span id="s196">They saw the mezuzah, they could even -- they couldn’t care less.</span> <span id="s197">They were there, Paola remained to take care of them.</span> <span id="s198">They were too old, and one was Rudy Bukovitz, a commander.</span> <span id="s199">The other one I don’t remember, he was not -- a-and they were stationed at the shipyard where my father was working, you know, because they -- with the ships.</span> <span id="s200">And the -- and the shipyard was supposed then to repair damaged ships which were coming i-in port, Germans, si -- Italian.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: We’re talking now April 1941, is that what you’re thinking of?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Ah, no, this is -- this was in ’43.</span> <span id="s203">With [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s204">I mix up the dates because they are difference -- different people, different stories, you see.</span> <span id="s205">This was in ’43 when they came.</span> <span id="s206">And I know that, for instance, the [indecipherable] the tanks -- we were leaving in a very w-wide avenue, you know, and they were coming with the tanks and they stopped under our building.</span> <span id="s207">And since they were living in what we call mezzanino, which is not really the first floor.</span> <span id="s208">Here is called first floor, but you have a few steps up and there’s the doors, you know?</span> <span id="s209">And the Moscovitz’ were li-living -- I mean, on the mezzanino, and the soldiers knocked at their door, asked for water, they gave them do -- water.</span> <span id="s210">Then they gave them breakfast and tha-that was it.</span> <span id="s211">The soldiers didn’t even di -- bother them at all, and -- and then they went away.</span> <span id="s212">Then finally Bukitz, they took this apartment and the Moscovitz’ went to Venice and then they were -- they went -- they were -- they took refuge in the island of Saint George, San Giorgio is one of these islands around Venice.</span> <span id="s213">And there was a kind of a sanitarium or a fi -- a psychiatric thing, and -- and they hid there during all the period of the war.</span> <span id="s214">Well, if I have to continue about the Moscovitz’, then he died, and then I saw Mrs. Moscovitz when she went to Milan, a-after the war sh-she was there.</span> <span id="s215">An-And -- and I think that there she was f -- living in Milan, and across her apartment, there was an apartment where there was a couple, I don’t remember the name because I met them only that time, a young couple whose husband of the man and wife -- the wife of the man and the husband of the young woman died in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s216">They met in concentration camp, they got married and they had a little daughter.</span> <span id="s217">And I was there just for Passover.</span> <span id="s218">I didn’t know what was Passover.</span> <span id="s219">And so I invite -- I was sleeping at Mrs. Moscovitz, so we went for -- for the passo -- the ne -- we were the five of us, it was my first Passover, you know?</span> <span id="s220">And they did explain to me, and this little girl, she said di -- when she had to tell the story of Passover, she said and then the carabinieri came.</span> <span id="s221">The ca -- the carabinieri with the [indecipherable] you know.</span> <span id="s222">Think it was really cute.</span> <span id="s223">And -- and that was it.</span> <span id="s224">So -- but then I didn’t see Mrs. Moscovitz any more again.</span> <span id="s225">I heard that she died.</span> <span id="s226">These are the Moscovitz’.</span> <span id="s227">The Weiss, I don’t know at -- what happened to them.</span> <span id="s228">Then I -- we had very close friends, this was a -- oh, a -- let’s so -- go to the -- the important ones, the -- the Schtitzel.</span> <span id="s229">After the anschluss, this family arrives from Vienna.</span> <span id="s230">Arnold, Nellie and Anton Schtitzel.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Thea Sacca Rips.</span> <span id="s233">This is tape number one, side B, and you began -- you had begun to tell the story of this family.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: So they arrived, and they found an apartment.</span> <span id="s235">It was a beautiful apartment building near the station an -- and the tennis courts.</span> <span id="s236">And there were only two apartments per building -- per -- per floor.</span> <span id="s237">We were on the fifth floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: And when was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: 19 -- after -- immediately after the anschluss, what was -- what year was --</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: So it was spring, 1938?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: 1938, yes.</span> <span id="s242">They arrived -- we were flabbergasted, because they were, all of them, about two fee -- two -- two meter of tall -- one meter -- two meter tall.</span> <span id="s243">He was a very elegant gentleman, you know, very well dressed.</span> <span id="s244">She was a beautiful woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Wh-Where had they come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: From Vienna, as far as I remember, and then they had son, Anton, called Tondo in [indecipherable] he’s always been Tondo.</span> <span id="s247">And I think that he was from very wealthy family in Vienna.</span> <span id="s248">I think that they were [indecipherable] special wines were -- expensive, gourmet food.</span> <span id="s249">As far as I think -- v-vaguely this -- I -- we never investigated what they were doing or something, and -- you know.</span> <span id="s250">And we started to talk, wi -- you know, th-the balcony, which was giving on the tennis courts, it was the balcony of our kitchen, and by the balcony of their kitchen was just looking as -- an -- by us, to our balcony.</span> <span id="s251">So we -- I was already -- well, in ’38, I was already 16 year old [indecipherable] something, and my sister was 12.</span> <span id="s252">Tondo was the age of -- o-of my sister, and we started to talk [indecipherable] soon from the balcony and then we became friends, we were [indecipherable] with the parents, and then that was it.</span> <span id="s253">And they were at four -- ended ‘43.</span> <span id="s254">We became very close.</span> <span id="s255">When, in ’43, the Germans took over our area, after the armistice, immediately after September eight, we, at that time were h-having our -- spending our vacation at the seashore in Lowranna, or Lovranna now, in Notelle.</span> <span id="s256">And we’ve, unfortunately saw them arriving, the soldiers, how would you say?</span> <span id="s257">Making pee pee, you know, on the street, you know.</span> <span id="s258">Walking whi -- whi-while they were walking, going like this.</span> <span id="s259">Then we her -- we heard shots.</span> <span id="s260">They shot a couple of partisans who were already ready there, and they didn’t let anybody to go near them.</span> <span id="s261">There was one in the orchard and we can -- nobody can go -- can go there to take care of this person, and so on.</span> <span id="s262">And so, since we didn’t feel safe in the hotel, there was -- there were some Croatian friends who had a villa, which once belonged to one of the archdukes, because that area was very famous during the Austro-Hungarian empire.</span> <span id="s263">They were keeping their -- their mistresses and they were spending their vacation there, and this kind of thing.</span> <span id="s264">And we went to stay with them, eating only sardines and potatoes, okay, that was it.</span> <span id="s265">And the Schtitzel were also vacationing in the same place, and they got extremely scared, of course.</span> <span id="s266">And they -- they found a -- a f -- a fisherman, who took them by boat to Yugoslavia, to the -- to the Dalmatia actually, to the other coast.</span> <span id="s267">They were hoping to be able to reach, probably -- I don’t know, southern Italy.</span> <span id="s268">And I remember that they gave us a bag with the jewelry and -- and the -- and the key to the apartment.</span> <span id="s269">The only thing she took with -- no -- they took the jewelry with them, giving a -- and -- and they went there.</span> <span id="s270">Then they came back from Yugoslavia and they came to the apartment because they felt safe, an-and they were safe, nobody bothered them.</span> <span id="s271">But th-the -- we know -- nobody knew for how long they would have been safe, so they wanted to go away.</span> <span id="s272">And they got in touch with the police commissioner, who probably is on the -- how do you say, the roll of the just or whatever it is in Jerusalem, Panicucci was the -- the commissioner.</span> <span id="s273">One was [indecipherable] the name, they made a sort of film about him.</span> <span id="s274">The --</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Schindler, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: No, no, no, no, the -- the commissioner, the -- th-they made a -- the documentary, that -- that it was even shown on th -- a couple of weeks ago in the Jewish thing.</span> <span id="s277">The last one was about the one who was also killed afterwards, who gave her passports to the Jews, and so on, but Panicucci was --</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Wallenberg -- Raoul Wallenberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: No, no, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s280">In Italian.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: And [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Per-Perlaska?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: Perlaska, Perlaska.</span> <span id="s285">They -- Panicucci was the Perlaska of our area.</span> <span id="s286">And so apparently he gave them -- yeah, and he gave them papers with another name, Sardi, and th-the Franciscans father of the church of sa -- of San Geron -- Geronim -- Geronimo’s church gave them birth certificates, Catholic [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s287">But they fact is that i-in -- in the -- between ’38 to ’43, Tondo became a big boy.</span> <span id="s288">They were -- in Fiume, everybody knew them because they were so visible, you know, tall, handsome, they see all [indecipherable] of them going, you know?</span> <span id="s289">So, they were -- th-they went to f -- they went to flo -- to the -- they wanted to go to Venice, but how do we go to Venice?</span> <span id="s290">Everybody knows us, somebody meet you on the train, and if we have different documents, the Germans were going up and down the train.</span> <span id="s291">Okay, we -- Thea can take the -- the -- the documents for you, but -- but you le -- so they left with the f-forged documents on the train, and on the same train, like an idiot, I was on the same train as they were o-on with their real documents.</span> <span id="s292">So -- but we pretended not to know each other.</span> <span id="s293">I was sitting in one -- I -- I was sitting on one side, in one compartment, they were sitting on the other.</span> <span id="s294">And then, you know, we were in different are -- Tondo and I went on the corridor, we started to talk like two people who just meet, you know, it wa -- it was really something.</span> <span id="s295">They were no trouble.</span> <span id="s296">In the meantime we had told to my sist -- my aunt -- my mother’s sister, who was living in Trieste, that they were coming, to please -- she s -- since she had the large apartment, not many beds, but a large apartment, an enormous living room, dining room, larger than this one, to arrange for them to spend the night there, because the next day they were going to -- to Venice.</span> <span id="s297">So when they arrived, we went to the house of my aunt, she had arranged some mats on the floor an-and we slept there.</span> <span id="s298">And the next day they went to Venice.</span> <span id="s299">Their new names were Sardi.</span> <span id="s300">They were no more Schtitzel, they were Sardi, and they went to live for awhile in hotel.</span> <span id="s301">But, of course, Venice and Fiume are pretty close and they were afraid that some people from Fiume would recognize them there, or [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s302">And I remember that even I went once to visit with them -- o-or es -- yes, before leaving they gave us their jewelry, and there was another family too, in Abbazia, where they left a trunk, where she left her fur coats.</span> <span id="s303">I don’t know what was there because we never saw the trunk and we never saw that family.</span> <span id="s304">And I don’t know if -- how the stuff she gave them left.</span> <span id="s305">We -- they left in the apartment only some wine, some food that he had put aside, Mr. Schtitzel.</span> <span id="s306">But they gave us the jewelry, and she took only a beautiful diamond ring she had, she took with her.</span> <span id="s307">And they went to -- as I say, they went to Venice.</span> <span id="s308">I went to visit with them and by mistake I knocked at the door and I said, Mr. Schtitzel.</span> <span id="s309">The poor man was scared -- was scared to death, but I did -- you know, it win -- I-I -- without thinking.</span> <span id="s310">He was so scared.</span> <span id="s311">Anyhow, from there they moved to Milan where this engineer, Fierst, who was th -- working my -- with my father had found refuge in a -- in an apartment building in Milan, where many Jews were living we -- under ma -- different names, and they moved in there.</span> <span id="s312">The portieri knew about them, everybody knew who they were, but nothing happened.</span> <span id="s313">But the fact is that -- came that time that Tondo had the age to be called into the army.</span> <span id="s314">And th -- Mr. Schtitzel, Arnold, got so scared that he -- I don’t know through whom, thi-this we heard later wa -- from -- from the sh -- from the Fierst who told them, don’t do that, don’t do that, they might not call him.</span> <span id="s315">Hide the boy, don’t do it.</span> <span id="s316">Instead, no, no, no, no, we go to Switzerland, we go to Switzerland, we go to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s317">And the guys who were supposed to take them across the border apparently betrayed them, and -- and that was it.</span> <span id="s318">For a long time we didn’t hear anything.</span> <span id="s319">The war was over.</span> <span id="s320">Tito occupied our area.</span> <span id="s321">And one day a nice gentleman knocks at our door.</span> <span id="s322">And he says, I am so and so and so.</span> <span id="s323">I am the head of the Jewish community here in Fiume.</span> <span id="s324">I know that you helped the -- the Schtitzels and that the Schtitzels gave you some jewelry, so on.</span> <span id="s325">Oh, says, thank goodness.</span> <span id="s326">So we gave to him -- he -- of course he -- he demonstrated [indecipherable] and we gave the jewels to him a-and then we didn’t hear from him any more, but I’m -- it -- I’m sure -- how -- how else could he know if -- if they had not told him?</span> <span id="s327">We trusted him immediately and we gave him back the jewels.</span> <span id="s328">She had -- she had hidden her diamond in her rectum when she was traveling and of course they found it, you know, because there -- they were examining a-absolutely everything.</span> <span id="s329">And so -- and this man told us that Tondo and her -- and the father died in Auschwitz and, which is even more terrible, Nellie, the mother, was sick and she was killed by the dogs.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s331">Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: They were chasing after her and they -- and she died like this.</span> <span id="s333">In the meantime, they had left with us the address of her brother, who was living in New York, Otto Weiss.</span> <span id="s334">And I started to correspond -- as soon as I heard this, I wrote to him also, telling him about the jewels and telling him about the few things that they left with us, a -- a -- a silver box, because Mr. Schtitzel, during the first World Wars, was a officer in the Austrian army.</span> <span id="s335">And the box he left with us was a box that he received from his companions, I don’t know in what occasion, with all the signatures of his companions.</span> <span id="s336">And we have a photograph of the group of Austrian officers, and he is there, you see?</span> <span id="s337">It was -- it -- and so I wrote to Uncle Otto in English, with my poor English, but I managed.</span> <span id="s338">No, I -- I a -- at the time I was speaking some German, I don’t know whether it was German or English, I mixed up things.</span> <span id="s339">I still have the correspondence, it’s home.</span> <span id="s340">And so he said well, that to give certain things to -- to -- to I don’t know who it was, and to keep the rest for us, it was a -- the -- th-the -- took the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s341">And -- and that was it.</span> <span id="s342">And that was the end o-o-of the Schtitzel.</span> <span id="s343">And to us it was just like losing family, and -- and to hear that they went like that was really terrible.</span> <span id="s344">I kept corresponding with Uncle Otto, who was sending us care packages, because under Tito it was much worse than during the war.</span> <span id="s345">That was the worst part of -- for us, because Fiume was bombed only by -- by the -- but when the British were bombing, where they were coming only with the s -- small planes, with the Sp-Spitfires, you know, and they were -- since all the -- th-the -- the big industries were along the coast, they were not touching the city.</span> <span id="s346">They were going ba -- th -- shooting at whatever the equipment they had there.</span> <span id="s347">But th-then the -- the Americans came and then they bombed also the city, so much so that where we were -- no, we had shelters since there is the mountain behind th -- we are on the ocean and -- th-the sea and the mountain and the shelters were under the mountain.</span> <span id="s348">And when the Germans were there, in the -- in the -- a-and they occupied the shipyard, part of the he -- lighter works were hidden under the rocks under the mountains and so that -- and also, near our home there was a shelter under th-the hills, so that we were safe in there.</span> <span id="s349">And during that time, they were recruiting the Germ -- the Germans -- this is -- this has nothing to -- the Schtitzel were already away, but at that time, yes, we were still -- there were still Jews, men -- several Jews in Fiume.</span> <span id="s350">Among them were the two Farcas brother, Rudy and -- Rudy and Paolo.</span> <span id="s351">Rudy was the youngest one, a little bit light-headed, simple, very, very pleasant boy.</span> <span id="s352">And Paolo, who was helping my sister with her Latin, you know.</span> <span id="s353">And the ta -- the time came that -- when th-the -- the Germans started to recruit the young people to work -- the famous [indecipherable] organization, you know, to build a -- fortresses to -- to -- to build for them things all along the border because we were right on the border with the Yugoslavs, you know?</span> <span id="s354">And we were saying, Paolo and Rudy, Paolo, go away, go away, go away.</span> <span id="s355">Why do you stay here, why do you stay here?</span> <span id="s356">And they said no, but there is no, we are working there, they are kind to us, they are nice.</span> <span id="s357">We are not only Jews there, they were recruiting everybody, you know.</span> <span id="s358">And he said, no, no, he said, we stay.</span> <span id="s359">Then one day they took away their parents, and they said co -- and they took them to Trieste, to the only concentration camp that th-the Germans made in Trieste, the famous rice factory, you know, the risia -- Risiera where they -- well, they di -- I don’t know wha-what they did to them, they burned them or the wa -- I had -- I had no idea what -- what was going on.</span> <span id="s360">The Risiera now is the national monument in tr -- in Trieste, you know.</span> <span id="s361">A me-me -- a memorial.</span> <span id="s362">And we were telling them, go away, go away.</span> <span id="s363">No, no, no.</span> <span id="s364">When, after the parents were sent we’d say, but now you better go.</span> <span id="s365">No, no, no, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s366">In the meantime also, my sister and myself were recruited and my sister became a welder.</span> <span id="s367">Be si -- since Father was working at the shipyard, he immediately put them to work there.</span> <span id="s368">I was studying to be a doctor, so I was in the infirmary, and I was there helping the doctor, giving injections for -- for all kind of people, you know?</span> <span id="s369">And my sister was a welder for the ships, you know?</span> <span id="s370">And -- and the funny thing is that they were repairing the -- one of the -- I think it was a cruiser, I don’t rem -- I don’t know the name, the American names of the ships, but anyhow, which had been damaged, and the work was not -- never proceeding because the workers were working and undoing.</span> <span id="s371">Doing and undoing so that the Germans couldn’t get it, you know?</span> <span id="s372">But finally they had to do it, and they -- because the Germans started to -- so, it was completed, and they went [indecipherable] to test, they were only -- but they were only the workers, Italian, that they f -- workers.</span> <span id="s373">My father was on board, everybody.</span> <span id="s374">They went to sea, they tested, they came back, everything was perfect.</span> <span id="s375">The first time that the Germans went at sea with the [indecipherable] with the cruiser or whatever name it is, all at once we were standing on -- in -- looking at the -- at that ship, because working there both of us, we were there at the shipyard with Father.</span> <span id="s376">All at once from -- it was a sky like this one with broken clouds and sun, out of the clouds, Spitsfires started to comes.</span> <span id="s377">They knew that there were only Germans on board, so there must have been, you know, something.</span> <span id="s378">And vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, they came back to the shipyard, you know, with wounded people and so and so.</span> <span id="s379">That was it.</span> <span id="s380">Then they bombed of course the -- the -- the -- the shipyard, the Americans who were in there.</span> <span id="s381">We were able to go underground, in -- under the -- th-the rocks.</span> <span id="s382">Then, when the bombardment was over, they brought some soldiers which were -- had been there [indecipherable] the German soldiers, I remember I had to give morphium to whoever there was very heavily wounded, the -- he broke a -- he lost a leg, but I remember he was there.</span> <span id="s383">We were -- we were two -- there were the -- the -- the -- the real nurse, then -- it was a man, the doctor and myself, and we had really to work, you know, [indecipherable] morphium Schwester, morphium Schwester, because he was in terrible pain.</span> <span id="s384">His hand was completely open, like this, you know.</span> <span id="s385">I gave him morphium and then they took him to the hospital.</span> <span id="s386">I heard that day he lost a leg, this soldier.</span> <span id="s387">And so the Farcas brothers were still there and one morning, it was a Sunday, we wake up and we could see the synagogue from our building, because it was very opened, and we see f-fire.</span> <span id="s388">We said, God gracious, that’s the synagogue.</span> <span id="s389">So my sister and I got dressed.</span> <span id="s390">Father and Mother didn’t even dream to say no, don’t go.</span> <span id="s391">It was naturally for us, we all -- we went to there and the fra -- th-the -- the synagogue was as fa -- afire.</span> <span id="s392">And there he -- who was, Paolo and Rudy Farcas, who said, go away, go away.</span> <span id="s393">He says to [indecipherable] if the Germans see that you are with us, he said, you are in danger, go away.</span> <span id="s394">We said my -- no, don’t -- when -- we didn’t go away.</span> <span id="s395">We were there crying, crying, crying.</span> <span id="s396">You should have seen that synagogue, it was so beautiful.</span> <span id="s397">And -- but we se -- an-and they didn’t let the firemen to go and take care of the fire.</span> <span id="s398">It was a terrible day.</span> <span id="s399">It was in ’43 when they burned th-the synagogue, those [indecipherable] th-th-the -- the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s400">And that was it.</span> <span id="s401">And of course, after awhile Rudy and Farcas [indecipherable] Rudy an-and -- and -- and -- and Paolo didn’t appear any more.</span> <span id="s402">They were taken and we don’t know how -- what, we don’t know.</span> <span id="s403">We can imagine how they end up.</span> <span id="s404">So that [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s405">I think that’s as far as our experience with [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s406">That’s all that I can remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: When you were on the train carrying those false papers for -- I mean, carrying the true papers --</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: -- were da -- were you questioned at all?</span> <span id="s410">Were there any -- wa-was there any incident where you had to make up a story?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: No.</span> <span id="s412">No.</span> <span id="s413">There were -- I was a -- I were just a passenger, period.</span> <span id="s414">I -- [indecipherable] and I was afra -- I was not afraid, I was not worried.</span> <span id="s415">My parents sent me like nothing, you know, it’s -- we didn’t think of the danger, actually.</span> <span id="s416">I don’t know why, because we were really -- it -- it was n -- to -- to us it was normal to -- to -- to do that, you know.</span> <span id="s417">That was it.</span> <span id="s418">A-And also for my aunt to give them refuge there for -- that night and -- and also the people in -- in -- i-i-in Milan, if Arnold wouldn’t have been so afraid for -- for -- for his son, probably nothing would have happened, because Fierst came back, went to work in Genoa after the war, and, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: The fi -- the first names of the Schtikless parents was Arnold --</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Arnold, and she was Nellie Weiss, Nellie Weiss.</span> <span id="s421">But they -- they were adorable people, so nice, so nice.</span> <span id="s422">And when I came here, I tried to get in touch with Otto Weiss and I was not able to find it.</span> <span id="s423">Maybe either he had died, or the company was no more there, or something.</span> <span id="s424">But I have the correspondence with Uncle Otto and he actually -- his is the one who told -- who wrote to me that he had -- tha-that Nellie was killed that horrible way, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: When the synagogue was burning, what about the rest of the people in the town, or other people, were they horrified?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: The -- the people were really hor-horrified -- horrified, but you know, probably there were some fanatics who were really happy, you know, like always, but no, the people were really -- I tell you, until -- it was until ’43 that -- that they were living peacefully.</span> <span id="s427">Then we did -- then the Germans came, then there was the -- of course, the ones who were just accusing people for -- for re-revenge, which happened also when Tito took over, they had just to say, well, that was a fascist, even if he had not been ever, he said, and they killed several people of ours, and -- with nothing to do.</span> <span id="s428">It wa -- under Tito it was terrible.</span> <span id="s429">But under Tito I was a -- I left in December to stay with fr -- just to pass -- spend Christmas with a friend in Valdosta for -- to go skiing and then they arrested th-they -- th-they -- they -- wa -- we call them Titini.</span> <span id="s430">The partisans arrested my father as an enemy of the people, you know, because then it stopped to be something like a war, it was a -- the Slavs against the Italians.</span> <span id="s431">And they arrested everybody who was somebody.</span> <span id="s432">The owner of all the bus lines which were going from Fiume to Trieste in the area, the director of the for -- torpedo plant.</span> <span id="s433">Everybody who was somebody.</span> <span id="s434">For awhile they were in -- in jail all together, and for awhile they had their -- they were very worried, especially for my father because my father, being an engineer, a technician, they were lacking personnel but it -- in that -- in -- in that field.</span> <span id="s435">We were afraid the -- because some were sent inside Yugoslavia to -- to work there for them.</span> <span id="s436">And instead there were some workers who accused Father of mistreatment.</span> <span id="s437">Father was a -- a rabbit like I am.</span> <span id="s438">Very good on his job, but not -- not a courageous person in the sense that -- courageous, yes he was, but not -- not to beat people or do these things of this kind, but you always find one who was for one reason or another.</span> <span id="s439">And then he was for one month in isolation, and -- and that broke my father.</span> <span id="s440">My father had never been the same, and if -- it ended -- fortunately it ended peacefully in, you know, his own bed without ever being sick, but he was a depressed person for an o -- when he came I -- i-in the meantime, I wanted to go back to Fiume because before going, they came to have us opting to be Yugoslav or Italian.</span> <span id="s441">Of course, we all opted to be Italian, to go back to Italy, [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s442">And -- and I fr -- heard that my father was in prison by some university companions who were also from Fiume, who came to meet me at the station and they said, oh you know, your father is in jail in Fiume.</span> <span id="s443">That was the way I heard it.</span> <span id="s444">So I wanted to run to -- to Fiume.</span> <span id="s445">And I got, with great difficulty, in touch with my family and they told me, please don’t come because otherwise they catch you too, because you were [indecipherable] when you -- okay.</span> <span id="s446">So I started to work.</span> <span id="s447">I -- I -- at the time I was studying and then I had to start to work, that’s why I -- I am not a doctor, because I couldn’t work and so on.</span> <span id="s448">Th-The iron fist, the British troops who had been stationed in -- in Naples, opened a garrison in Padwa and they hire me -- my English was just school English, poor, but it was better than nothing.</span> <span id="s449">At the time nobody was speaking English, so whatever I spoke was pretty -- it was better than nothing, you know?</span> <span id="s450">And I si -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Thea Rips.</span> <span id="s452">This is tape number two, side A, and let’s just talk a little bit about the end of the war before we continue on with your story.</span> <span id="s453">What was that like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Well, the -- as I said, I was working as a nurse in the shipyards, and my sister was a welder, but for -- at the time she stopped working as a welder because she had typhoid fever, something like this.</span> <span id="s455">She was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s456">And when the end was coming, it was the beginning of May, the Yugoslav were bombing with ca -- with ca-cannons, grenades, Fiume.</span> <span id="s457">And in order to be safer, they had -- they -- the engineers had the -- the shifts to spend the nights in the shipyard, to keep an eye on whatever was going on, you know?</span> <span id="s458">And I as a nurse, was staying with Father and we were sleeping underground in the shelter, under the rocks.</span> <span id="s459">It was a very safe shelter, I must say because when they bombed, nothing happened to us.</span> <span id="s460">They destroyed a lot of things, but the bomb didn’t bother us.</span> <span id="s461">And, in parentheses, my fat -- my father was made th-the head of -- chief of the oompah, which I don’t remember right now what it means, but it was a -- a -- a group which was taking care of -- in case of a fire -- so-some -- some kind of a fireman, in case of bombings and things of this kind.</span> <span id="s462">And he and his workers -- how -- how can I say?</span> <span id="s463">The Germans had put dynamite under all the cranes of the shipyard, because before leaving they wanted to destroy the shipyards.</span> <span id="s464">Father and his men of the oompah, I don’t know when, I don’t know now because he didn’t -- they didn’t talk about these things, took off th -- everything, so that nothing blew up, you know, never s -- never tol -- never recognized because it was an a -- again, a natural thing to do.</span> <span id="s465">So th -- he saved the shipyard.</span> <span id="s466">Never recognized, never got a penny for it, but who wanted it anyhow?</span> <span id="s467">So anyhow, when they started to bomb th-th-the -- the bombs started to come from the Yugoslav side and the Yugoslavs were advancing, the partisans and so on, the Germans started to flee.</span> <span id="s468">And it was a heavy bombardment.</span> <span id="s469">So we fa -- they said -- Father called the di-director, he said -- th-the -- of the -- of the shipyard, what do I do?</span> <span id="s470">He said, here I have a few men, and do I -- he said, do what you want.</span> <span id="s471">Washed their hands.</span> <span id="s472">You -- you -- you decide, you do what you want, he said, because I cannot leave here, nobody want -- you can leave because anyhow that is -- so -- so we -- we left and we went walking and it was quite the walk, you just -- like going from here, more than down, going to -- from here to Bethesda, something like this.</span> <span id="s473">And we -- we heard the grenades, fssh, pssh, falling around us.</span> <span id="s474">And I kept the white cas -- boar -- rope, you know, was a [indecipherable] on the street, you know.</span> <span id="s475">But do you think that the Germans bothered t-to bother us?</span> <span id="s476">They were running.</span> <span id="s477">They were passing by us, going, running, scup -- escaping, escaping.</span> <span id="s478">And -- and then we went -- we went home.</span> <span id="s479">And when we reached home, since it was in a dangerous positions, we went to stay with a family, some friends of ours for a --for a few days.</span> <span id="s480">Then we went back home and -- and it was May -- must have been the third or fourth, because Tito’s birthday, I think, is on the -- I have to look in my book, but was in on the fifth or the sixth of May, when they started to shoot like crazy, pom, pom, pom, pom, pom to -- to celebrate, you know?</span> <span id="s481">And ye -- we could see, since we are in this wide avenue, you know, living, it was just like going through a dead city, you know, all the shutters were down.</span> <span id="s482">We were looking through the shutters and they were coming with these carts, with the car -- with the -- how do you say, the animals, the [indecipherable] the warri -- [phone ringing] -- sorry.</span> <span id="s483">[tape break].</span> <span id="s484">So th-th-this was all the shutters down and they came wi -- on the carts, pulled by the oxen, and that -- a thing which was unbelievable, and they di -- and you could see these people sitting la -- you know, th-the poor -- I understand they -- they were poor people who lived in the woods, these partisans, but they were really mean.</span> <span id="s485">And they were s-standing on the streets and dancing the kolo.</span> <span id="s486">And th-the ones from Montenegro, th -- with the sh -- sheepco -- sheepskin coats over there ki-killing lice, you know.</span> <span id="s487">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s488">And that was the time when we were afraid to talk, when we couldn’t even talk to friends because we didn’t know what we’re going to do, we -- what they were going to say or something.</span> <span id="s489">These people di -- went in -- they enter some apartment, they didn’t understand what they’re -- they didn’t know how to use th-the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the facilities.</span> <span id="s490">They were looking at the chandeliers, you know, all this light coming from.</span> <span id="s491">It was really a [indecipherable] affair.</span> <span id="s492">And that was it.</span> <span id="s493">So then they came, they wanted us to [indecipherable] as I said, and -- and then I, as I said, I went to -- first to F-Florence just for a visit.</span> <span id="s494">I came back to it -- to -- to Fiume, then I went to Valdosta and when I went to Padwa they told me not to go back to Fiume.</span> <span id="s495">I started to work with the British troops, [indecipherable] head-headquarters Padwa garrison.</span> <span id="s496">I worked for there for awhile, taking care of the wives of the English soldiers, Italian wi -- and they picked up some very good kids, but they picked up a lot of trash too, you know?</span> <span id="s497">And -- and after -- and I was there until ’48.</span> <span id="s498">When my father came out th -- my -- finally my father was freed because the judge of this tribunal of the people w-was -- had been friendly with the Jews too, and he knew about our friendships or something, I don’t know how.</span> <span id="s499">And I f -- with the excuse that Father had arthritis, one thing and the other, they said no, no, no, he has to go -- he has to go to Abbano, which is a spa, and Father came out, but th-that man on the street didn’t want to talk.</span> <span id="s500">My f -- my father didn’t want to talk.</span> <span id="s501">He was turning always his head, he -- no, no, no, th-they are following me, they -- they’re -- that was -- Father was ruined, that was it.</span> <span id="s502">And fr -- then in ’48 he didn’t want to stay in -- in -- he finally found a job down south in -- near Foja, in Napolia, that he worked for awhile, and I worked too.</span> <span id="s503">I went to teach at the Boys Town in Bari.</span> <span id="s504">And in Boys Town in our Bari came an American gentleman, Mr. Broya to visit this place.</span> <span id="s505">And at the s -- at the same time, I was working with the [indecipherable] of Bari for the rice company of Milan, and they told me that if I could be t-to help them, because Ambassador Dunne was coming to Bari, a-and so I went.</span> <span id="s506">And this way I started to get in touch with the Americans, because I went to -- I went to the theater, there were a ceremony, I was there with Ambassador Dunne, I had the pictures around.</span> <span id="s507">And -- and there there were a certain Mr. Mamoly who was working with the Marshall Plan in Rome.</span> <span id="s508">So when the fair was over he said, why don’t you come over and look for a job?</span> <span id="s509">And they -- I got the job with the Marshall Plan.</span> <span id="s510">They had organized, as kind of a traveling -- it was like a circus, it wa -- it looked, you know, it was with a tent and something.</span> <span id="s511">But there was all booths with propaganda for the Marshall Plan and what the Marshall Plan was doing.</span> <span id="s512">But they were coming from France, the group [indecipherable] group.</span> <span id="s513">And they were all French, two Americans, an Italian and myself.</span> <span id="s514">And we went from Bari to Catan -- to Sicily, Catania, Palermo, Messina, Bari.</span> <span id="s515">And this way I got acquainted with the Americans and fine -- I got the permanent job with the Marshall Plan.</span> <span id="s516">I worked there from ’51 to ’54.</span> <span id="s517">In ’54 they needed interpreters here in this country because with the counterpar -- counterpart funds, which p-program they were exchange -- they were sending Italian technicians, politicians, trade union people to learn here in America how things were going.</span> <span id="s518">They send somebody from the State Department to -- to -- to -- to test several people, and among [indecipherable] and -- and a friend who just died not long ago, and myself were chosen to -- an-and so I came here as an interpreter.</span> <span id="s519">I was an interpreter for three years, from ’55 to ’57.</span> <span id="s520">And then --</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Were -- you say -- wa -- s -- what month did you come and where did you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: I came here in January ’55.</span> <span id="s523">I left in December ’57, then I ca --</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: Wh-Where were you living?</span> <span id="s525">In -- in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: [indecipherable] in the -- at that time since I went to work in Rome with the embassy, you know, with the Marshall Plan, my family followed me, because from that moment on, my family was going where I was going.</span> <span id="s527">My family follow me to Rome.</span> <span id="s528">And then I went back to Rome, then in Rome, they opened here the office of the nash -- the -- it was called National Committee for Nuclear Energy of Italy, which was a kind of a -- a -- a American [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: So -- so --</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: -- energy commission, you know, the same ca -- [indecipherable] Atomic Energy Commission, only the Italian, they open an office here.</span> <span id="s531">They knew that -- they knew me here, th-the person here [indecipherable] sent there because she knows and so on, so forth.</span> <span id="s532">So I went and then I worked there.</span> <span id="s533">On the way to -- to America from Naples, my husband boarded the ship in Nice, and so we met.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Now -- now again --</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: In fi -- this was in ’48 -- in ’58.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: In other words, you worked in the United States and then went back to Italy --</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: No, no, no, I didn’t work -- I work in the United States as an interpreter, then I went back to Italy.</span> <span id="s538">And then they call me here for this other job.</span> <span id="s539">And on --</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: And on your trip back to the United States --</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: -- [indecipherable] back to the United States, I boarded that ship on the bord -- on -- on the ou -- the Augustus in Naples.</span> <span id="s542">My husband boarded the Augustus in Nice, and it -- I never travel first class because I didn’t have the means, but at that time the -- since they knew me very well, also because I was the fine -- the niece of -- the old Sacca was my grandfather, who had worked for the [indecipherable] and he had to be in -- the president of the Orphans of the Sea and every time a ship was coming in Trieste he was going to visit them and everybody, oh, you are the niece of the old Sacca.</span> <span id="s543">So I was treated like a princess, you know?</span> <span id="s544">But a -- he -- we -- he came on board there, in Nice and -- and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: And his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: Serge -- Serge Rips.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: And what was his experience?</span> <span id="s548">Where was he from and where did he grow up and what was his experience during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: He -- he -- he -- he -- when you [indecipherable] that thing there.</span> <span id="s550">Oh, welcome to my notes, okay.</span> <span

Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: He was Jewish.</span> <span id="s558">Th-The whole family was Jewish.</span> <span id="s559">He had a brother who had -- w-where -- was living in Australia,

president of the International Court of Justice in The Hague.</span> <span id="s571">Then international, economic and trade, under Leon Binz, who was chairman of a shipping company and later on it became the Defense Minister of Belgium.</span> <span id="s572">And then he was a journalist in Belgium.</span> <span id="s573">He was the assoc -- associate with “The Daily Neptune” --</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: -- and -- which it was one of the lousiest papers European continent, which was specialized in economics, shippings and these kinds of things -- and to the Midi, another newspaper that he was editor and editor-in-chief.</span> <span id="s576">And also with Liquor de la Burrs, which had to do with stock market and economics, finance and this kind of thing.</span> <span id="s577">And also with La [indecipherable] Belsh, which was a -- where he wrote a weekly column, an editorial column which was called, Today and Tomorrow.</span> <span id="s578">But th-this is what he did between ’26 and ’40, you want to know that too?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: No, that’s okay [indecipherable] the-then --</span></p> <p><span

id="s581">When he was a journalist, since we’re talking about journ -- th-the pa -- newspapers, this is the right point, when he was a journalist, he covered the civil war in Spain.</span> <span id="s582">And apparently he wrote something good tha-that he wrote for both sides.</span> <span id="s583">Of course, being a journalist he was covering the whole thing, and apparently st -- Franco did something good too, an-and he mentioned what he was -- done.</span> <span id="s584">So that later on he was decorated with the Order of Isabel the Catholic, by Franco.</span> <span id="s585">He -- and then he kept going, traveling, wi-wi-with -- all over it, all over Europe, all over the world and so.</span> <span id="s586">Then, when the bat -- when the Germans occupied Belgium, then he escaped with his f -- evo -- eve -- he had his sister living in Berlin at the time, but -- an-and she escaped to Australia to join her brother.</span> <span id="s587">He [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: But we -- we are s -- we’re talking now about spring of 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s590">It happened that when -- they left just while the Germans were entering Belgium.</span> <span id="s591">He -- he -- they had the car, and with this -- his parents, and -- and he -- [indecipherable] went through the Basque countries to Bayonne and they had to cross th-the border, and there is ther -- there was this bridge there in th-the border.</span> <span id="s592">He -- he was able to go there very easily because he was known, he had been decorated and so on.</span> <span id="s593">And he went to see Carrero, Admiral Carrero Blanco, who at the time was only a -- a naval officer or something, only of -- of -- I don’t know how he was related in th -- th-the rel -- the relationship with Franco and -- an-and Carrero Blanco, I don’t know what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: Ha-Had -- had he already --</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: -- had he already been decorated by Franco by this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Let’s see.</span> <span id="s598">This I don’t know.</span> <span id="s599">I have to look becau -- ah, wait, I have th-th-th-the -- I have the certificate.</span> <span id="s600">[tape break]</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: So according to your document, he was awarded this ho-honor in November 4th, 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: And he -- I don’t know if -- if Carrero Blanco, I think was the one who c -- put in contact with Franco, you see, they want to talk to Franco.</span> <span id="s605">He said, no, but it’s impossible, and so on, so forth.</span> <span id="s606">No, no, no, he said, it’s important, I want to talk to him, and Franco received him.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: Franco received your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: [indecipherable] Franco received my husband.</span> <span id="s609">And my husband talked to Franco, and he said listen, we are escaping from Belgium.</span> <span id="s610">There is plenty of people at the border who cannot come over because they have -- don’t have documents, they -- they -- they -- there are so many, they don’t know -- but there were not only Jews, there were communists, there were all people who wanted to escape from -- from -- from the Germans, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: And get into Spain.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: And late -- get into Spain.</span> <span id="s613">And he said, why don’t you make a good gesture and ope-open the border, let these people come in?</span> <span id="s614">Because otherwise th-they -- they are lost, you know, they’re -- and apparently this is -- I tell you what -- what he told me.</span> <span id="s615">So apparently Franco said, wh-why should I do it?</span> <span id="s616">He said, why?</span> <span id="s617">And my husband said, because this is, I think, the right thing to do.</span> <span id="s618">And so Franco called somebody in, sign a paper and they open the border and these people were able to come over.</span> <span id="s619">And he told me that they were not put in concentration camps or nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Did your husband say about how many people he was talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: No.</span> <span id="s622">No, he didn’t, he didn’t.</span> <span id="s623">He said there were many, said they were running, they had nothing, they said th-they even printed a stamp that th-th-the police at the border stamped a -- cards, you know, identity cards.</span> <span id="s624">Whatever paper they had, just to let them in and then they would let them go.</span> <span id="s625">They didn’t ask what they were, what they -- what they were doing, where they were coming, they would let them in like this.</span> <span id="s626">That’s what my husband says.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: And he was with his family?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: He was with his family and then he was for a short while in Spain and then they moved to Portugal and from Portugal they came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s630">And now let’s -- and then he worked in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: And then later on you met him?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: But I met -- I met him mu-much later, much later.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: And di -- ha -- did all his family survive the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: Well, he -- some of his relatives, I don’t know if some uncles, aunts, so on, to whom he always said leave, leave, leave, they -- of course they didn’t want to leave, never heard of them.</span> <span id="s638">But his brother was already in Australia and his sister too.</span> <span id="s639">So his brother died a natural death in Australia and his sister, after she -- she was married in Australia with a -- I think a German Jew.</span> <span id="s640">And -- but married in Germany and went to Australia.</span> <span id="s641">And she had a son, sh -- her husband died, and then her 16 year old son died, so she came to the United States.</span> <span id="s642">Serge helped her to come here, and she died in ’78, I think.</span> <span id="s643">She was living in New York, and never remarried.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: So he came to the United States with his parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: With his pare --</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: And what kind of work did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: This I have -- this I have to read, because is too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: Well, just generally what did he do?</span> <span id="s649">Did he work for the government?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Yeah, but I ri -- we write this down.</span> <span id="s651">He was not even a citizen when he had to -- they -- it was request -- he was requi -- requested to join th-the Office of War Information.</span> <span id="s652">And then he was the editor for the French branch, and he was preparing the material to broadcast to the country -- French

he was living at the time in New York, while it -- his parents were living in Queens and he was living in New York, sleeping during the day and working during the night to broadcast, you see?</span> <span id="s654">And they pre -- and he prepared -- and I’m sorry, but I did not find it -- he prepared a text of President Roosevelt’s message in English to France the day of the invasion of -- of -- of North Africa.</span> <span id="s655">I didn’t find it.</span> <span id="s656">Then he joined th-the Board of Economic Warfare, and -- which later on became for -- then -- was -- member enemy branch economic potential division.</span> <span id="s657">Then he was acting chief for vario -- various western European countries.</span> <span id="s658">Then the Board of Economic Warfare became the Office of Economic Warfare, and po -- and they din -- became f -- the [indecipherable] economic administration.</span> <span id="s659">Then it worked for them for the Balkan division.</span> <span id="s660">[indecipherable] he became [indecipherable] afterwards, he became chief of the first eastern division.</span> <span id="s661">Then, when this was over -- ah, it -- it prepares some program for the rehabilitation and recovery of Japan, Thailand, Southeast Asia and Korea, and here was his major job, and also China.</span> <span id="s662">And he resigned when the foreign economic administration became ca -- part of the commerce department.</span> <span id="s663">Then he was -- then they ask him that -- for one year to be the ec -- economic advisor for Greece, and there it per -- to organize the assistant programs -- you know, Greece was in -- in a pretty bad shape, you know, have to imagine now ger -- Germans, the Italians and so on.</span> <span id="s664">And he worked with the ambassador [indecipherable] Geropolous.</span> <span id="s665">[tape break] He-Here it’s not written, but he had -- he ha -- he has the power of autonomy by the good king of Thailand, you know?</span> <span id="s666">S -- where were we?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: Well, you were talking that -- wha-what -- what h-his different economic jobs were, and then you said one -- one of the important jobs after was --</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: Well, he had several important jobs with various countries, with Greece, then with Yugoslavia with na -- all wi -- all kind a we -- then he was assistant to the president of Haiti.</span> <span id="s669">But finally, in ’47, he was in -- in charge of the economic affairs and war reparations, which in Japan and Thailand, nobody had been succe -- had succeeded in rearrange this thing because during the war Japan [indecipherable] occupy Indochina and Thailand and so on, they took away the gold and lot of money from the country, and -- and at the time Macarthur was in Japan, very much pro-Japanese, you know, and he was opposed to the fact that they was requested to return this material, this gold, this valuable s -- to the ca -- to -- to the Thailand.</span> <span id="s670">And my ma -- Serge, my husband, he was able to -- apparently he’s a good -- was a good diplomat -- to rearr -- to rearrange the thing so that the gold was returned and whatever else was due to the Thais was returned to them, and that way was decorated with the -- well, let’s see, he got all these decorations.</span> <span id="s671">He was knight

continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Thea Rips.</span> <span id="s675">This is tape number two, side B, and you were starting to talk about his decorations.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: Well, the decorations he received was -- is Officer of the National Order of the Legion of Honor of France.</span> <span id="s677">Commander of the Most Exalted Order of the White Elephant of Thailand, and Knight Commander of the Most Exalted Order of the White Elephant Thailand -- this is a knightgood -- knightgo -- knighthood, with the motivation -- in gratitude for fruitful and unstinted assistance.</span> <span id="s678">Because thanks to him, Japan returned the -- the gold and whatever, owed them for war reparations.</span> <span id="s679">The Legion of Honor was given to him because returning th -- whatever was taken by Japan from Indochina, they took also s -- whatever was French or -- in Indochina, and so they had to return it to France, and France decorated him with the order, the Officié of the -- the Legion of Honor.</span> <span id="s680">Then he received from Japan, even though Japan was defeated in a way, by him, the wa -- the wa -- the Order the k -- Knight Commander of the Order of the Sacred Treasure of Japan, which is knighthood, which was given by Minister Shiga Mitsu, who said this is the first time Japan decorates with deep thanks, enemy on battlefield, without alienating us, you know?</span> <span id="s681">Then he had other orders.</span> <span id="s682">Order of the Jade of China, and the Order of the Golden Ear, also of China, which he received when he was still a journalist in Belgium because he started the campaign to erase the unequal treaties which were made between the European countries and China whereby -- m-many countries of Europe had their concessions in China and the Chinese got no -- got nothing for them, and he started, with his new-newspapers in gi -- in Belgium to write why, what do we need them?</span> <span id="s683">Why do you we do this?</span> <span id="s684">What a -- so Belgium took off -- closed their da -- their thing.</span> <span id="s685">And little by little the other countries were -- le-le-left China in peace and th -- and they got the -- the [indecipherable] back, you see?</span> <span id="s686">That’s why he got these two orders from the Chinese.</span> <span id="s687">Then he got the Order of the Crown fr-fr-from Romania -- Romania, but here I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s688">He got the Order of the Crown of Italy because he was the only Belgian journalist who was invited to attend the wedding of Prince Humberto, th-the son of the king of Italy [indecipherable] third to the pr -- the Belgian Princess Maya José.</span> <span id="s689">And he was there to report on the wed -- and so they gave him the order, you see?</span> <span id="s690">Why did he get the order as the -- o-of Izhat -- Knight of the Order of Izhat of Afghanistan?</span> <span id="s691">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s692">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s693">He told me probably, this I know he told me, but I forgot.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: So when did you get married?</span> <span id="s695">A: We were -- officially in 19 f -- Fe-February, Friday February 13, 19 sic -- ’76.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: Ninetee -- and -- and what kind --</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: But we were -- but we -- we went together since -- well, 18 years of engagement and 18 years of marriage.</span> <span id="s698">We didn’t get married until practically I left my job, because I had the -- this job with atomic energy commission of Italy and he said well yo-you know, better not, and better not, then finally when I -- then -- then we decided that was about time.</span> <span id="s699">You know, we f -- we talked it over quite a bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: And -- and you lived in New York, and then when did you come to Washington?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: I never live in New York, I always lived in Washington, always.</span> <span id="s702">I -- b-because I came here, I was staying with a -- first in a fr -- [indecipherable] when I was an interpreter, then I moved in with a girl who was working with Italian ta -- technical delegation.</span> <span id="s703">Then, when I left and went back to Italy, when I came back here I got a -- an apartment at the Alban Towers a -- on Columbia Road.</span> <span id="s704">Then they built the Colonnade.</span> <span id="s705">In the meantime my husband was living in different places, and it -- he was not mine -- my husband, of course, at the time.</span> <span id="s706">And then we moved both into the Colonnade when it was built.</span> <span id="s707">I had an apartment on the seventh floor, he had apartment on the 12th floor.</span> <span id="s708">Then from there we -- we moved to Bethesda fo -- just for a year, because he was scared, he didn’t want to buy the apartment.</span> <span id="s709">And when it became a condominium, then we rented here at the Towers for a year or something.</span> <span id="s710">Then from here when this one became a condominium, we moved to a 41 [indecipherable] and then finally decided it was about time to buy an apartment and we moved here in ’81 and I been here since.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: Just to finish off, do you -- are you an American citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: Yes, yes, I am an American citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: Wh-When did you become a citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: ’98.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: Mm-hm, 1998.</span> <span id="s716">Do you -- wh-what are your thoughts now, looking back?</span> <span id="s717">You had such an interesting childhood and you did -- do you -- do you have any final thoughts about what happened during the war and your relationship with the Jewish families that you helped, from this vantage point of 50 years later?</span> <span id="s718">A: Well, from -- n-now that I’m old and wise, I hope wise, yes, I -- I see wher -- o-on a diff -- I -- I -- I -- I didn’t realize, first of all, that my life was interesting.</span> <span id="s719">It was living, you know?</span> <span id="s720">Only now, going back and remembering these things, yes, I -- I think that it was -- life was while living and probably if I would live again I would do it again the same things as [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s721">And as far as the Jewish situation is concerned, well, my feelings had always been the same.</span> <span id="s722">T-To me that we are all human beings and with -- as I told you, I found out that the people were Jewish by chance, and not because we -- and only after the war they started what are you.</span> <span id="s723">Are you this, are you that?</span> <span id="s724">Never dream -- never -- never, never dreamt, we’re just good friends, period.</span> <span id="s725">You know, no prejudice.</span> <span id="s726">Ma -- there was never any prejudice in my family -- I remember even my grandfather -- now I remember that they had probably some Jewish friends, from the names that they -- vaguely I remember, but one more -- one thing really I’m very happy of, that in Trieste we have the most beautiful synagogue, beautiful, and I don’t know how it was not touched.</span> <span id="s727">It is -- well, pr-probably they stole something away, they -- they -- they -- they -- they -- they used it, the Germans, for something, but it -- it was not torn, it’s a beautiful synagogue.</span> <span id="s728">I don’t know how it happen.</span> <span id="s729">And -- and in -- in Trieste, for instance, where I was born, in my mentality is more Triestini than Italiana.</span> <span id="s730">I am very much middle European not -- I don’t -- I feel Italian very deeply one way, but more middle European.</span> <span id="s731">And I’m proud of it because if -- you have to read that book by John Morris, you know, Trieste [indecipherable] and you will see.</span> <span id="s732">And we had, for instance, our great -- two -- two of the greatest Triestini writers, Humberto Saba, he is half Jewish, mother Jewish and -- and father not.</span> <span id="s733">And Italos Levo, who was [indecipherable] is also -- makes -- and we had a -- a fantastic Jewish community over there in Italy.</span> <span id="s734">But we didn’t think of it.</span> <span id="s735">They were -- we are Triestini.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: Was the synagogue in Fiume ever restored?</span> <span id="s737">A: No, th -- I don’t know what they built there, they told me.</span> <span id="s738">We -- I went back to Fiume 25 years after the end of the war.</span> <span id="s739">We didn’t have the heart to go.</span> <span id="s740">This is really another experience really worthwhile te-tell -- recounting, to show what Yugoslavia was under Tito.</span> <span id="s741">And we went with my nephew who at the time was about 10 year old.</span> <span id="s742">And we went to all the places where we had lived.</span> <span id="s743">Ha -- he -- and we went to slees -- via Mario Asso number two, where my sa -- my family, the Moscovitz, the Weiss and the Schtitzel were living.</span> <span id="s744">[crying].</span> <span id="s745">We find so much.</span> <span id="s746">How uncivilized they are -- or they were over there.</span> <span id="s747">We had that -- you know, we were -- a few step underneath, there was the apartment over there -- of the porter -- of the doorman, they say.</span> <span id="s748">And after the stairs there -- th -- there were the boxes for their mail.</span> <span id="s749">Mailboxes with the names, you know?</span> <span id="s750">The names were there.</span> <span id="s751">To us it was a terrible thing.</span> <span id="s752">Not our, that was not, but the Schtitzel were there.</span> <span id="s753">And the Moscovitz were there, but the Moscovitz at least died peacefully, but when we saw the Schtitzel there, it was something so terrible, so terrible.</span> <span id="s754">I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: Oh no, no.</span> <span id="s756">Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: That was a terrible experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: Is there any message you want to give to people who might listen to this tape?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: Well, you know, it’s -- it’s a message which should -- wh-which has been repeated and repeated and repeated thousand times.</span> <span id="s760">It should never any more, never, nevermore.</span> <span id="s761">Unfortunately we can see it happening over and over again.</span> <span id="s762">But with how much we reach, with how much we pray, [indecipherable] what we do -- well, maybe we are too few doing, thinking like this, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: Have you remained an observant Catholic since child -- have you remained an observant Catholic since childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: Yes, well, you know, at the beginning it was a li -- Serge was little [indecipherable] in certain way, he would have liked me to convert.</span> <span id="s765">And I was -- I would listen.</span> <span id="s766">I -- I love you the way you are.</span> <span id="s767">You love me the way you are, why -- I -- I wer -- it were -- I grew up this way.</span> <span id="s768">And I even went to a rabbi for a summer to be -- for education to -- to -- to learn, but I -- I didn’t feel it.</span> <span id="s769">And not because I have ha -- because I -- I know that we are fundamentally we are Jews, nothing doing, you know.</span> <span id="s770">No, we are Jews.</span> <span id="s771">Nothing doing in tha -- we’re -- we -- well, we just accept one thing that you didn’t accept, period, but we are the same, absolutely.</span> <span id="s772">So I was not able to do it, I -- I could not.</span> <span id="s773">Not that my parents objected, not at all.</span> <span id="s774">My father said, do what you want, you -- you do f -- what you feel like doing.</span> <span id="s775">But I didn’t feel like doing it.</span> <span id="s776">Then, for -- but I was always going -- my husband was not very observant.</span> <span id="s777">We were more observant when we were more with the -- with the Korns, you know, and we were going to their house, then we were going to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s778">There was a time of -- o-of Rabinovitz, we loved his sermons, we became very good friends, so it -- it was a -- and I went to all the festivities, I enjoyed them very much, I followed and so on.</span> <span id="s779">And sometimes Serge came to -- but I didn’t go to church.</span> <span id="s780">I didn’t go.</span> <span id="s781">Well, you know, the -- Serge di-didn’t like it, so I didn’t go.</span> <span id="s782">Then -- then for a couple of su -- we were -- w-we spent a couple of Christmases [indecipherable] Catholic, just let’s go to meet -- went to meet [indecipherable] so we are going to meet [indecipherable] an-and a -- and Serge was coming.</span> <span id="s783">Then, t-towards the end, th-the feel -- the last few years at Easter, Serge was saying, hey, we -- y-you -- this is Easter.</span> <span id="s784">We -- you have to go to chur -- we were -- he was going to church with me, you see?</span> <span id="s785">So that was a -- the kind of a di -- di -- mix up.</span> <span id="s786">And if you look at my -- it was -- we were laughing yesterday with some people, because I have a-an in -- an image of the Virgin and on top of the bed I have David with the head of Goliath.</span> <span id="s787">And even in Rome, I -- I have in the -- on -- on my night table, a -- a -- a -- a menorah.</span> <span id="s788">So, you know, it’s -- but that’s the way I feel.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: When did your husband pass away?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: He passed away on September nine.</span> <span id="s791">September 9, 1994.</span> <span id="s792">It’s impossible for me to think that it’s almost 10 years.</span> <span id="s793">Nine years past.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: And now you are moving back to Italy, you said?</span> <span id="s795">A: Yes, now I move.</span> <span id="s796">I -- I tell you, it’s very painful, because all of my friends are like the Korns, and then others, they are all here, you know?</span> <span id="s797">I spent 38 years of my life here.</span> <span id="s798">I never spent more than -- than eight years in an apartment in -- in -- in Europe.</span> <span id="s799">Here I am 22 -- 22 years.</span> <span id="s800">And in Europe I have a lot of friends, but they are all over Italy, you know, is not -- here I have a concentration of friends in my life, and besides here I had the very good life, met very interesting people.</span> <span id="s801">I-It was -- my sister, she had a completely different life.</span> <span id="s802">I was the lucky one in the -- in the family.</span> <span id="s803">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: Anything else you wanted to add?</span> <span id="s805">A: Not really, I don’t know, to add just -- just that I am very sorry to leave the States.</span> <span id="s806">I will miss the States very, very, very, very much, and I will miss my friends very much, but I hope they will come and see me.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s808">And I hope you’ll come back and visit.</span> <span id="s809">Thank you very
