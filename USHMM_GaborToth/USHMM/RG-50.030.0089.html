id="s13">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s14">Now we're on tape.</span> <span id="s15">Would you tell me your name please?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: My name is Max Haber.</span> <span id="s17">I was born on the 31st of December, 1904, in Essen on the Ruhr [River], Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: Tell me about your childhood as you were growing up.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: My childhood up to the First World War, which started when I was 9 years old, was a nice one, a happy one.</span> <span id="s20">In fact, my father took us and my uncle to visit our grandparents in Kolomier.</span> <span id="s21">In other words, in those 5 weeks that I was there, I met my grandparents and I still remember when we went back to Germany, he asked me, "What is your name?"</span> <span id="s22">I said, "Max.</span> <span id="s23">Max.”</span> <span id="s24">He said, "No.”</span> <span id="s25">He said, "Moshe.”</span> <span id="s26">Uh...then he said, this what I wanted to know from you.</span> <span id="s27">When you go to Germany, I'd like to stay a good Jew.</span> <span id="s28">And I think my father did everything and myself to follow his advice.</span> <span id="s29">After then during the war time, we were very hungry.</span> <span id="s30">We did have very little to eat.</span> <span id="s31">There was a blockade against Germany.</span> <span id="s32">My father was in the army, and my brother was taken a little bit later into the army.</span> <span id="s33">But they came back in 1918, 19 and life was normal.</span> <span id="s34">I learned my trade.</span> <span id="s35">Was an export refinery for non- ferrous metals.</span> <span id="s36">We had different....we had different...uh...uh... departments and I chose to be in the metal department.</span> <span id="s37">By the way this trade I continued here when I came to Chicago.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Max.</span> <span id="s39">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s40">Tell me about...before we go on, being a Jew, being raised as a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Uh...What kind of school did you go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: The school I attended was an orthodox school, real orthodox school, .</span> <span id="s43">Our teachers were good Germans, but they were good Jews too.</span> <span id="s44">We were very knowledgeable.</span> <span id="s45">The teacher that taught us math or geography was at the same time teacher .</span> <span id="s46">After finishing 5th school, it was not very hard to get a position as a apprentice.</span> <span id="s47">So you had to work 3 years with a little pay in order to become a businessman.</span> <span id="s48">Interestingly as you asked me these questions, something comes to mind.</span> <span id="s49">At the Christmas time, after I was 1 and a half years employed, I was called...little bit over l and a half years, I was called to the personnel office and I was told...up to now they called you Haber, Haber.</span> <span id="s50">From now on your name will be Herr Haber.</span> <span id="s51">We let you... consider you that you finish your apprenticeship, but under the conditions that you stay with us the full 3 years, but your salary will be as of a full- fledged...uh...uh...employee.</span> <span id="s52">This reminds me about how Germany has changed.</span> <span id="s53">He was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s54">He was very friendly.</span> <span id="s55">He was knowing that I was Jewish because I did not work on Saturday.</span> <span id="s56">I came Sundays.</span> <span id="s57">Sunday morning half a day, and Saturday I had off.</span> <span id="s58">Well, after a certain years being offering them a buyer...</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: In what city?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: In Homburg.</span> <span id="s61">Everything is Homburg.</span> <span id="s62">Everything is Homburg because as...uh...when I was still a baby, we moved from Essen on the Ruhr to Homburg.</span> <span id="s63">In...uh...I became a businessman and was even for myself in business until I had to give it up when Hitler came to power.</span> <span id="s64">And end of 1933, my father having passed away and buried now in Homburg, I remained with my mother because my brother and my sister lived already in the East.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">My...my sister married and my brother had to...in order to be...to be a doctor, practicing doctor, had to go there where he was born.</span> <span id="s66">He was...when he was born, it was Austria, as I mentioned before, but it became after the first world...world war, Polish territory.</span> <span id="s67">In 1933, I tried to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s68">I had relatives there, an uncle, brother of my mother, and cousins.</span> <span id="s69">It was...I did not get an answer so that means I could not get any papers and go here...go to the United States.</span> <span id="s70">So I decided in Germany I cannot stay and I went to Poland because my brother and sister lived there and they said there are three and a million Jews live.</span> <span id="s71">You can live too.</span> <span id="s72">When I came to Kolomier where my sister lived, was a city not far away from Rumania border, and there I could make a living because I needed a territory where there was industry.</span> <span id="s73">So I figured it out and I went to Katowice.</span> <span id="s74">For two reasons.</span> <span id="s75">First of all, there was the so-called Polish industry, and the other one was that I did not speak Polish and I could help myself with a lot of German and a little Polish.</span> <span id="s76">And I even went to an evening school to know a little bit more of the language.</span> <span id="s77">I made a living, but in 39 we heard, in May 39, that there will come probably a war between Germany and Poland.</span> <span id="s78">So I decided to get out of Poland.</span> <span id="s79">But, as I mentioned, before you couldn't go anywhere.</span> <span id="s80">I met a young man on the street and I told him we had to talk.</span> <span id="s81">And I told him I think we get...have to get out from here, somewhere.</span> <span id="s82">So he just said.</span> <span id="s83">.</span> <span id="s84">uh...(clearing throat) well, you have a Polish passport, you cannot go anywhere.</span> <span id="s85">You have the will to go, but nobody lets you in.</span> <span id="s86">A few weeks later I joined the party on advice of friends and they told me that they will have an illegal transport to Palestine some day in August.</span> <span id="s87">I joined them, paid in, and we went in this transport to the Rumanian border.</span> <span id="s88">In order to be told we cannot get farther...farther, at that time the English Ambassador to Rumania told the Rumanians to withdraw the visa to go through Rumania because they don't want illegal ships to come on the...on the...on the borders of the Arab Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Tell me about the people on the transport and tell me about...I believe you met Begin.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: I did not meet Begin because he kept himself incognito.</span> <span id="s91">He was afraid because the transport was not...was not legal.</span> <span id="s92">I..</span> <span id="s93">.</span> <span id="s94">he was pointed out later to me when we went...got through that this is Begin.</span> <span id="s95">This was in August of 1939, and my sister lived in that city.</span> <span id="s96">I came back and I had nowhere to go.</span> <span id="s97">And when the war broke out I was in Kolomier, the city that my sister lived and my mother was there because I left her there because I was going to Palestine.</span> <span id="s98">We were very surprised when on the lst of September the war broke out and nobody came to the help of the Poles.</span> <span id="s99">Neither the English nor the French.</span> <span id="s100">We know that 2 days later, they declared war against Germany, but no help.</span> <span id="s101">And we thought, "Where is Russia?"</span> <span id="s102">Nobody came to help, and as you all...as everybody knows, Poland was overrun by the Germans and in 14 days Warsaw was taken.</span> <span id="s103">My brother who was at that time in Krakau, and on the way to Warsaw because he hoped that there will be the least possibility that the Germans will get it, but then he saw that in...in 10 days, they were already close to Warsaw they changed their routine and went to the Rumanian border and so we were reunited in Kolomier altogether the whole family once more except my father who was not anymore alive.</span> <span id="s104">Thirteen or 14 days later the Russians came in.</span> <span id="s105">And I remember so well because they came with tanks, slowly in, and every second tank did not function.</span> <span id="s106">A few days later we saw trains going day and night out of Poland with everything they could get...put their hands on and they were at that time making the Ribenthrow-Molotov Pact and felt obliged to give them food and assistance to kill everything that is...uh...capitalist.</span> <span id="s107">Soon thereafter you had to stand for bread in line.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Everything was...you couldn't get.</span> <span id="s109">The businessmen were forced to sell everything they had for was declared as null, as...of no value.</span> <span id="s110">And when I looked at all these things, I decided I will get out from here whatever.</span> <span id="s111">And so my brother-in-law joined me and we went to the border and hoped to help to get to the Rumanian side.</span> <span id="s112">Instead, I landed in Russian hands because the people that wanted to brings us over there, agents of the Russians.</span> <span id="s113">I went to several prisons, smaller prisons.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: Wait a second.</span> <span id="s115">Tell us what happened when you fell into Russian hands.</span> <span id="s116">What did that mean?</span> <span id="s117">How were you handled?</span> <span id="s118">What did they say to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: I went to several prisons, smaller prisons, and within 8 or 10 days...I don't remember exactly, we were back in Kolomier in the prison of Kolomier.</span> <span id="s120">There I was interrogated twice at midnight.</span> <span id="s121">But I made it very simple.</span> <span id="s122">I said, "I am a Jew from Germany and I lived in Poland because I could not stay anymore in Germany and here in Poland I was not even at home and I wanted to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s123">That was, of course, for the Russians already a prison term of 5 to 10 years because as a Zionist you were already not considered a nice person.</span> <span id="s124">Then from there we went to Stanislav...Stanislav, of course, and from there to Limburg , and there most of the people once more interrogated I was not.</span> <span id="s125">I had a clear case.</span> <span id="s126">A Zionist!</span> <span id="s127">A man who didn't like Russia.</span> <span id="s128">We came to...to free them and to make a better life for them and he wanted to get away.</span> <span id="s129">And according to that, they gave me paragraph 58, which means they cannot be anything worse than as a politician...uh...political prisoner.</span> <span id="s130">That's what they had in the paragraph 58.</span> <span id="s131">From there, we were several months in prison.</span> <span id="s132">Of course, the prison was not clean.</span> <span id="s133">We got a lot of lice and...uh...the food was not good, but later on this was good food.</span> <span id="s134">Then we were taken to Kiev from there.</span> <span id="s135">It took us about 10 to 15 days to get there.</span> <span id="s136">I don't know exactly the days.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: How were you taken and what...</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: In cars, in...in animal cars.</span> <span id="s139">Uh...42 a car.</span> <span id="s140">Uh...It was the 18th of March 1940 that we arrived in Kiev.</span> <span id="s141">Uh...There we were taken into an office and we thought of course, it would be right to take the hat off, and he told us in Russian, "This is not a church.</span> <span id="s142">You can have the hat on.”</span> <span id="s143">He had his on.</span> <span id="s144">But we slept on the floor, on a stone floor and they didn't give us anything to eat until we went into a cell.</span> <span id="s145">That was about 24 hours later.</span> <span id="s146">There they started to get...not to interrogate us and that...this...this room was made for eight people and we were 40.</span> <span id="s147">The few strong people slept on the bed.</span> <span id="s148">The other slept on the floor.</span> <span id="s149">When we came, there was a Russian man in there, and they took him pretty soon out because a big part of the people were Jews that fled Poland from the other side where the Germans came and they took them prison...as prisoner anyhow if they didn't do anything either.</span> <span id="s150">Then 2 days later there was an other man with us who was Jewish.</span> <span id="s151">His name was Mesha.</span> <span id="s152">He was very friendly and we...he said...we asked him what are you here doing...doing here.</span> <span id="s153">He said, "I am a leather cutter and I stole a little bit of leather.</span> <span id="s154">He gave me 2 years.”</span> <span id="s155">But he used to get packages.</span> <span id="s156">He used to be very friendly, and he heard what we talked and up to the time when Paris fell to the Germans that means somewhere in June or July...don't know exactly, we didn't know that people that are interrogators take nights out and I was not, as I told you before, I had a clear case what I am.</span> <span id="s157">A Zionist!</span> <span id="s158">They told me there were a lot of papers in different languages.</span> <span id="s159">He was very friendly...gave him cigarettes.</span> <span id="s160">in German.</span> <span id="s161">And...uh...looked to...looked to it that they should see that Paris was taken by the Germans.</span> <span id="s162">So he told them, "You see.</span> <span id="s163">Now the capitalist are gone.</span> <span id="s164">Now we will fight the fascist.</span> <span id="s165">That is our purpose.”</span> <span id="s166">So he came back to the cells and I..</span> <span id="s167">.</span> <span id="s168">I..</span> <span id="s169">.</span> <span id="s170">I heard from anybody of them...from all of them the same...the same news.</span> <span id="s171">And in August 1940 they took us all down in the former church of the Kiev prison and told us we will judge...be judged now and get the sentence.</span> <span id="s172">I was called and there were three men sitting there, not dressed very nicely.</span> <span id="s173">, proud of it and said in Russian language.</span> <span id="s174">May I say it in language which I talk you know?</span> <span id="s175">.</span> <span id="s176">That means, "The judges of three gave you 5 years.”</span> <span id="s177">When I asked for what?</span> <span id="s178">The answer was .</span> <span id="s179">"You will find out.”</span> <span id="s180">.</span> <span id="s181">You will go into a camp and then you don't withstand it, you just die like an animal.</span> <span id="s182">We got double rations and prepared for the transport to the camp.</span> <span id="s183">Uh...Somewhere beginning of September we were taken out and went to a place not far away from...from Kiev farther north I imagine.</span> <span id="s184">It was north.</span> <span id="s185">And there we were prepared to be shipped to different kind of places.</span> <span id="s186">Chernigov was the name of that place and...uh...there was a woman doctor, a Jewish woman doctor and I told her that I suffer from...uh...ulcers.</span> <span id="s187">"Oh," she said, "Everybody has here something and nobody wants to go to work.”</span> <span id="s188">And that was it.</span> <span id="s189">But 2 or 3 days later, a transport went and two or three of us stayed.</span> <span id="s190">Was not sent out.</span> <span id="s191">Was not for the better.</span> <span id="s192">Was not for the worst.</span> <span id="s193">We were retransported to Kiev.</span> <span id="s194">And there we went into that big church that was not any more a church in the prison, and we were among real, real thieves, murderers...6, 7 of us.</span> <span id="s195">There it happened to become Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year.</span> <span id="s196">How did we know it?</span> <span id="s197">By the moon.</span> <span id="s198">Jews have the moon calendar.</span> <span id="s199">We were knowing when it was full moon and so on and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s200">But we had...we were not 10 people, and we were in one corner.</span> <span id="s201">All of a sudden that afternoon, the day before Rosh Hashanah, they threw us in three young men like...looking like Hasidim with the beard, with Patots, and they came from the ditches, and they were originally from Galicia, taken prisoners and were kept in the ditches but were now prepared to go with the transport probably with us a new transport into concentration camp.</span> <span id="s202">The man that was on the table who was directing everybody, the main man, the chief of the criminals, wanted to know who they are.</span> <span id="s203">They considered them like angels.</span> <span id="s204">He never saw people like that and he wanted to know from us and we told them we have a holiday and they were sent to us and so they made peace with us and did not touch us, did not bother us for 2 days...the criminals.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">But before that they took...when I had...uh...handkerchief or whatever I had, they took everything from us because they had nothing and everything was dealt with like on the black market.</span> <span id="s206">You exchanged tobacco for this or that.</span> <span id="s207">Between Rosh Hashanah Yom Kippur, we are put in a train.</span> <span id="s208">The train was not...uh...a car.</span> <span id="s209">.</span> <span id="s210">uh...animal car, but it had grates and it was similar to the first class of prewar Germany.</span> <span id="s211">Hard seats and outside was both sides soldier with a gun, and we were transported through Russian Europe.</span> <span id="s212">To show it is nor so bad, we were in a train like humanbeings.</span> <span id="s213">But as soon as we arrived...as we reached the , we were put again in those wonderful trains and it took us several weeks.</span> <span id="s214">On the transport there, there was a day when we didn't get...more than a day when we didn't get nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s215">The food was handed out every morning to the leader of that car...car...of that...uh...of that...uh...animal car.</span> <span id="s216">And he was a Pole...he was...uh... uh...a criminal.</span> <span id="s217">They never put a politician in charge.</span> <span id="s218">He had a dirty handkerchief which he used for everything and in that they gave him this little bit of sugar.</span> <span id="s219">40 people got so and so much sugar, and it was measured in a..</span> <span id="s220">.</span> <span id="s221">in a little...uh...match box.</span> <span id="s222">A little match box was measured out to everybody.</span> <span id="s223">And then we got the bread.</span> <span id="s224">The bread was good at that time.</span> <span id="s225">When you were hungry, you could eat it, and it was 5 or 6 hundred grams.</span> <span id="s226">Little bit more than a pound of bread.</span> <span id="s227">We arrived in Yetsevel.</span> <span id="s228">It was called Yetsevel.</span> <span id="s229">That was originally a point where the first prisoners came.</span> <span id="s230">It was only a forest.</span> <span id="s231">They got...all they got was a saw and a hammer, whatever, to build there a station.</span> <span id="s232">They lived in...under 30 degrees...they lived in...in tents until it was built.</span> <span id="s233">And that was the place that the Germans used to call the umschlagplatz, which is the same thing.</span> <span id="s234">And there we were gathered together.</span> <span id="s235">And when we arrived...of course, hungry, exhausted, with lice, first met a Jewish fellow and he was in charge of the sauerkraut...of the sauerkraut...uh...basins.</span> <span id="s236">There were big basins and that was...this...this place has mostly cabbage.</span> <span id="s237">And so they made that as a diet for prisoners.</span> <span id="s238">The bread, the cabbage, and the...and the cabbage soup day in and day out.</span> <span id="s239">But we didn't stay very long there.</span> <span id="s240">He told us it's very bad here and he... uh...managed to see already a month here but then they sent you away it's so bad there and somebody come back he...he cannot tell us anything good.</span> <span id="s241">So the next morning, we went out...it was about...was not more than ll or 12 kilometers from there and we went on the railroad siding because there was no street.</span> <span id="s242">There was no other way but by the railroad went once a day or went every two days, to and back on the same...same...uh...same...uh...same...same thing.</span> <span id="s243">When we arrived in that....that camp, by the name of Meuselwitz.</span> <span id="s244">In my opinion there were there not less than 3 or 4 thousand prisoners.</span> <span id="s245">There were already Polish prisoners there or Jewish prisoners there and first when we came we were put in a barrack or call it...uh...to... to...where...where you...where you live and where you sleep, and that was like made out of a few boards and the wind was blowing in.</span> <span id="s246">In the middle was a big furnace, iron furnace and the prisoners came home wet from work and everybody and I..</span> <span id="s247">.</span> <span id="s248">I..</span> <span id="s249">.</span> <span id="s250">around the oven warmed himself and dried his clothes.</span> <span id="s251">Otherwise, it was cold all...all over and the only light that was there was about in a big, big place, a little about maybe... The next day we had to go to work.</span> <span id="s252">How do we get the soup?</span> <span id="s253">You don't get anything in Russia.</span> <span id="s254">Don't get the fork.</span> <span id="s255">Don't get the spoon.</span> <span id="s256">You have to see that you get it, that you make it yourself.</span> <span id="s257">So there were prisons who said I will first go and then you...give it to you when it's empty and you go.</span> <span id="s258">But you have to be in time outside to go to work.</span> <span id="s259">They made spoons out of wood and the can that was an empty American can...uh...meat was eventually in...packed in, and that was made to...uh...to a can where you received your...your soup.</span> <span id="s260">Standing in line, you got your soup and we went out early at 6 o'clock in the morning and music was playing...prisoners.</span> <span id="s261">And they played.</span> <span id="s262">When they saw there was a lot of Jews, they played Jewish songs.</span> <span id="s263">Like .</span> <span id="s264">When we went out to work, we went over l and a half hours til we got there where I work was.</span> <span id="s265">And what was the work?</span> <span id="s266">To cut trees.</span> <span id="s267">Not with electric cuts, but two men with a saw and others had to transport it and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s268">I was not able to do that work and I was when I came back I did a little something in order not to go to prison...in prison and I got...uh...300 grams of bread.</span> <span id="s269">Others got 700 because they worked good.</span> <span id="s270">But it showed after them that after 2 years of that kind of work that I was better off than the others because they got more bread, but they died too from the hard work, and I somehow survived.</span> <span id="s271">I became so thin.</span> <span id="s272">I lost a lot of weight.</span> <span id="s273">You could see all my ribs.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">In June of 1900...of 1941 when the Germans attacked Russia, we heard it in the camp on loud speaker and the...uh...all the foreigners were told they're going to freedom if they are Polish citizens because of the attack on...on...on...on Russia.</span> <span id="s275">I was not called.</span> <span id="s276">Most of them were called, and every day so and so many disappeared to so-called freedom.</span> <span id="s277">Three months later, I was called.</span> <span id="s278">Was one of those cases that they didn't know what to do with.</span> <span id="s279">I was caught...taken on Polish territory, had relatives that were Polish...Polish citizens and I, on the other hand, was German born.</span> <span id="s280">So I was sent back and was...that was the most terrible time in my life.</span> <span id="s281">I was beaten up by other prisoners because they thought I was too...too happy to go...to go away but I was still one of them.</span> <span id="s282">These prisoners were...had the same faces like today and Armenian but were there and accused Jews that because of us they are here.</span> <span id="s283">The Jews are the leaders of communism and as I am a Jew, they beat me up.</span> <span id="s284">When I see today on television those faces, these were the people they did it to me.</span> <span id="s285">In the camp the man that cut the bread was sentenced in 37 to 10 years because he was .</span> <span id="s286">There was a time when Stalin cleaned out and then he found somebody and got 10 years.</span> <span id="s287">I got only 5 years.</span> <span id="s288">The doctor was a , and the other doctor was a .</span> <span id="s289">And when there came Yom Kippur I went to the doctor and I told him I cannot go to work.</span> <span id="s290">That was the first Yom Kippur I..</span> <span id="s291">.</span> <span id="s292">the first Yom Kippur I was in the train.</span> <span id="s293">The second one I had to go to work, but I did not work, but when I came back I got 10 days prison in prison for not working.</span> <span id="s294">So I spent 10 days with young boys age 10 to 14 or 16 who played cards on my rags that I had there and they made me sleep at the latrine.</span> <span id="s295">I had to take it out, and I got my bread...instead of picking it up I got it 3 hours later and the soup cold.</span> <span id="s296">In day time I went to work and when I came back from work this was a 10-days prison in prison.</span> <span id="s297">The...uh...second Yom Kippur I did not work because I complained again and this doctor shouted at me.</span> <span id="s298">His name was Ilia Selimonowitz.</span> <span id="s299">I don't have the family name.</span> <span id="s300">And he said you don't want to work and that's it, and you will go to work, that's it, and get out.</span> <span id="s301">The next day the marchik is the...that is a man who drives you to work, that sees to it that nobody stays inside.</span> <span id="s302">It's usually a criminal and many years of experience there and if necessary, he beats you up, then...then you have enough.</span> <span id="s303">You will remember next time not to hide.</span> <span id="s304">He...uh...called out my name that I am not going because I'm sick.</span> <span id="s305">So this whole scene was made by the doctor in order not to be under suspicion that he is on a high holiday...on a high holiday, Jewish high holiday freeing prisoners not to work.</span> <span id="s306">The third Yom Kippur...I came before that already an invalid because I was weighing....I did not know my weight, but I was so thin and so weak that they could not push me to work.</span> <span id="s307">So the doctors, Polish doctor declared me an invalid of .</span> <span id="s308">That means I have the right to sleep on the bunker.</span> <span id="s309">I get a piece of the bread and the soup and I don't have to go to work.</span> <span id="s310">So that Yom Kippur I did not go to work because I didn't have to.</span> <span id="s311">I mention that because it was...at that time when I started to give a account, I had a home.</span> <span id="s312">I had a family.</span> <span id="s313">I had a mother, a brother, a sister, relatives.</span> <span id="s314">And all probably looked where I am, hungry and almost dying.</span> <span id="s315">My body was going.</span> <span id="s316">It was my soul.</span> <span id="s317">My knowledge of my religion, my education from Homburg that made me think I will survive, gave me hope.</span> <span id="s318">I used to cover myself and forget where I am and dreaming that today is holiday.</span> <span id="s319">The fourth Yom Kippur I was in a camp because Russia lost a lot of people at Stalingrad and in the war at all, and they started to empty out prisons...prison camps, especially those people that could not work.</span> <span id="s320">And they want them out maybe to replace the men that were killed.</span> <span id="s321">So I was sent to a camp.</span> <span id="s322">There I was told I cannot go out.</span> <span id="s323">He looked at me and he said in Russian language, " .”</span> <span id="s324">He is such a bird.</span> <span id="s325">They don't know what to do with.”</span> <span id="s326">There is such an expression in Russian, .</span> <span id="s327">Such a bird!</span> <span id="s328">So I was sent back and a few days later I was called to the gate and I was told to go take my few things, less than I brought here today.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">And there was a horse and wagon waiting and a woman was sitting on it.</span> <span id="s330">She's going to have a child.</span> <span id="s331">And I..</span> <span id="s332">.</span> <span id="s333">and the...the man with the gun, , went with us to go to another camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Could see it from far away.</span> <span id="s335">It was a workers' camp.</span> <span id="s336">In contrast to this camp which was an assembly place for those they took eventually go out.</span> <span id="s337">I couldn't walk that far so I told him I cannot.</span> <span id="s338">I was sitting down in the snow.</span> <span id="s339">I cannot.</span> <span id="s340">So he told the woman to go up...down, and put me up because the horse could not pull that much.</span> <span id="s341">Such a horse wasn't fat either.</span> <span id="s342">We finally arrived after l and a half hours there and there I was taken to the office and in the office there was sitting a woman that...uh...told me, "Grandpa.”</span> <span id="s343">And I looked at her because I had a beard and I walked with a cane which I bought for a piece of bread...that somebody made out of wood.</span> <span id="s344">And she said, "Take a look.”</span> <span id="s345">I said, "I'm not a grandpa.</span> <span id="s346">I'm 39 years old, and I..</span> <span id="s347">.”</span> <span id="s348">And she said, "Take a look at the mirror.”</span> <span id="s349">And it was the first time in many years that I saw a mirror and I didn't recognize myself.</span> <span id="s350">Being friendly to me...she was a , she was a prisoner too.</span> <span id="s351">She told me...uh...I told her, "I'm hungry.</span> <span id="s352">I didn't get anything to eat from the morning til now.</span> <span id="s353">It's afternoon.”</span> <span id="s354">She said, "I cannot give you anything I don't have.”</span> <span id="s355">And it was Christmastime, and nobody was there of the high ranking.</span> <span id="s356">And she said, "Evenings when they give everybody to eat again.”</span> <span id="s357">So I had to wait.</span> <span id="s358">And I got the piece of bread and I went.</span> <span id="s359">.</span> <span id="s360">before that I went to the , so called hospital of the camp and told the doctor I hardly can walk.</span> <span id="s361">I'm hungry.</span> <span id="s362">And he looked at me and he never saw somebody with the ribs out like this and he put me on the scale and I weigh...weighed 40 kilo, which you know is 88 pounds.</span> <span id="s363">It was the first time in 4 years I found out how much I weigh.</span> <span id="s364">So he put me in the so called sick... sick...uh...place, and there I got twice a day soup.</span> <span id="s365">The bread was brought...brought to me, and one spoonful of oil.</span> <span id="s366">What kind of oil I don't know.</span> <span id="s367">After 14 days...it's the most time a man can be there, I didn't gain because he weighed me again.</span> <span id="s368">I didn't weigh...weigh...uh...gain any weight, but he told me he has to sign me out.</span> <span id="s369">And I was signed out.</span> <span id="s370">I was put in a barrack and the people there...working people.</span> <span id="s371">They went out.</span> <span id="s372">And when they saw somebody weak, never from the outside where you're beaten.</span> <span id="s373">They didn't touch you.</span> <span id="s374">When you stood before them, you had to have your hands in the back and that was it.</span> <span id="s375">Never!</span> <span id="s376">Never!</span> <span id="s377">Never!</span> <span id="s378">They told you only in nasty words but otherwise you were not beaten.</span> <span id="s379">The prisoners were among themselves because so many nationalities which hated themselves and they were altogether there in those camps.</span> <span id="s380">Uh...One tried to take away this like can that I had where I got my...my...my soup.</span> <span id="s381">The other one saw my...my jacket which was rags was better than his, and he wanted me to exchange.</span> <span id="s382">But lucky enough towards evening...quite a bit of people came back from work and among them boys from Vienna.</span> <span id="s383">Jewish boys from Vienna.</span> <span id="s384">Oh, I said...and I am bad on Germans and working there.</span> <span id="s385">This is a working camp and I will not go free.</span> <span id="s386">And that was very sad.</span> <span id="s387">But they had flour because they worked unloading flour and they brought flour with them.</span> <span id="s388">And they took water and flour and made it because our soup was watery.</span> <span id="s389">The spoon did not stand, but there the spoon stood.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">And they gave me as much as I wanted of flour and water and with a spoon to eat.</span> <span id="s391">And I told them about what the others do to me and they went over and told them, "You are talking here to soldiers.</span> <span id="s392">You will get it.”</span> <span id="s393">And they let me go.</span> <span id="s394">Let me go.</span> <span id="s395">They called me uncle.</span> <span id="s396">Was 20.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">21 years boys that were expelled from Vienna.</span> <span id="s398">Children of...probably of parents that once were from Galicia and lived in Vienna and the children are born there and they were prisoners there.</span> <span id="s399">What happens to them I don't know.</span> <span id="s400">Anyhow, after a short while I was called back to the other camp.</span> <span id="s401">When I came to the other camp it was empty.</span> <span id="s402">Only a few people from...uh...which you see now on television from this.</span> <span id="s403">.</span> <span id="s404">from those Republic that wants to be by themselves.</span> <span id="s405">They...we had there to sleep.</span> <span id="s406">The food was not good.</span> <span id="s407">Again a piece of bread and that soup.</span> <span id="s408">So I had no other way.</span> <span id="s409">I lived everyday in and out, but I didn't go to work.</span> <span id="s410">It was in February.</span> <span id="s411">It was Christmastime.</span> <span id="s412">It was in February.</span> <span id="s413">We didn't have the calendar.</span> <span id="s414">I cannot tell you exactly the date and it was very hard winter, of course there 40 below.</span> <span id="s415">And...uh...but one nice day, that is a nice day in 44, in March 44, I went somewhere.</span> <span id="s416">I went to the man of the kitchen, in charge and he was from White Russian, a Polish citizen from White Russia and he wanted to learn how to speak German.</span> <span id="s417">So he will give me a little bit of bread and soup.</span> <span id="s418">So I spent my time with him.</span> <span id="s419">As soon as he didn't cook I spent my time with him.</span> <span id="s420">When I came back to the barrack, "Where are you?</span> <span id="s421">Where have you been?"</span> <span id="s422">The looked for you.</span> <span id="s423">I said to him, "I'm free to go.</span> <span id="s424">I don't have to go...be where...I'm in the camp.</span> <span id="s425">I was in the camp.”</span> <span id="s426">The came back, called my name.</span> <span id="s427">Always that same way, "Maxim ."</span> <span id="s428">Max, the son of Solomon.</span> <span id="s429">You go to freedom.</span> <span id="s430">I didn't believe it because I was once sent there before.</span> <span id="s431">He said, "You are the bird.”</span> <span id="s432">And he didn't let me out.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">That was in March of 1944.</span> <span id="s434">In other words, I was 4...and 4...and 4 years and 5 months about in prison.</span> <span id="s435">He told me I have to go and get a shave, a haircut, and a so-called bath.</span> <span id="s436">That means a little bit of water with...with almost no soap and the second one to put...to put over me, to clean me up from the soap.</span> <span id="s437">They gave me a different jacket than I had on.</span> <span id="s438">It had no holes and it was very good.</span> <span id="s439">It suited me so that the next 2 years at my house as everything where I slept on there, where I kept my bread, where I kept everything.</span> <span id="s440">The next morning...and I must tell you according...it was the 27th of March...of April...of April.</span> <span id="s441">I'm here...I'm here wrong.</span> <span id="s442">On the 27th of April, Yom Ha-Shoah falls on the same date today when I was liberated and I was knowing it that it was the 27th day of Mishnah, because of the moon again.</span> <span id="s443">I went to freedom.</span> <span id="s444">How?</span> <span id="s445">The , elderly Russians...among them one Jew, a lawyer from Leningrad who got 10 years as a Troskiers, and he was have to serve...he served for 47, but they let him out because of sickness in 44.</span> <span id="s446">Like several others.</span> <span id="s447">We went to the station.</span> <span id="s448">They gave us a loaf of bread, but we considered that it's too weighing too much.</span> <span id="s449">We cut off one piece for the two days trips.</span> <span id="s450">And a herring...not a herring that you buy.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">There's everything in.</span> <span id="s452">There's nothing taken out, but you like it you ate everything.</span> <span id="s453">Ate even the bones you chewed down all the way.</span> <span id="s454">One herring and this piece of bread and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">So we came to the station quite a bit from the camp.</span> <span id="s456">There the window was closed and after a certain time she opened it up.</span> <span id="s457">There was...uh...uh...a station made of wood.</span> <span id="s458">Everything is wood there.</span> <span id="s459">They have nothing else, but wood.</span> <span id="s460">And it was, of course, cold.</span> <span id="s461">Worse than outside because the cold inside is usually worse when it's not heated.</span> <span id="s462">And she opened up.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">She said, "Children.”</span> <span id="s464">In Russian they talked that way.</span> <span id="s465">"The Biata...I have no tickets for you today.</span> <span id="s466">The train will come through in half an hour and they have no space on that train.</span> <span id="s467">The train from Blabiwostick to go...went through there and we were going .</span></p> <p><span id="s468">City of Kotanich.</span> <span id="s469">That is the city where the Czar used to send all people that didn't behave like politically sent there, and there everything was encumbered there.</span> <span id="s470">There were more encumbered there than free people.</span> <span id="s471">There we were sent.</span> <span id="s472">The next day we complained it is cold.</span> <span id="s473">What shall we do?</span> <span id="s474">She said, "I have a saw.</span> <span id="s475">I have everything.</span> <span id="s476">Go to the forest.</span> <span id="s477">It's not far...far from here.</span> <span id="s478">Get some wood and heat it.</span> <span id="s479">I will be glad to.”</span> <span id="s480">I said, "Are you kidding?</span> <span id="s481">When we take the wood from today, it will take months to dry to be able to make fire with it.</span> <span id="s482">You want us to make for you wood.</span> <span id="s483">We'll let you have it later.</span> <span id="s484">So all of us went up...up there.</span> <span id="s485">There was a gallery and one next to the other warmed himself.</span> <span id="s486">The food was gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">The bread was gone.</span> <span id="s488">The herring was gone.</span> <span id="s489">Before we went into the train.</span> <span id="s490">Who keeps bread?</span> <span id="s491">Because it was immediately stolen by somebody else.</span> <span id="s492">When you kept it, he took it away from you.</span> <span id="s493">If you slept for 1 minute there were among them thieves enough, and they took it.</span> <span id="s494">It took ...uh...I think 3...no 2 days...2 days, the 27th...29th yal, we came to Kotenish.</span> <span id="s495">On the way...uh...to...uh...where they told us to go, we met...we met a man with one foot.</span> <span id="s496">And he was in...he was in the...in the army and lost his foot.</span> <span id="s497">He was shoeless.</span> <span id="s498">He ask...he asked us, .</span> <span id="s499">Are you Jewish?</span> <span id="s500">.</span> <span id="s501">The lawyer and I.</span> <span id="s502">Then he changed into Yiddish.</span> <span id="s503">He didn't know much.</span> <span id="s504">First he said, "Shalom.”</span> <span id="s505">He said, "The lawyer told him he is from Leningrad and he got 10 years.”</span> <span id="s506">He told him a little bit of his story, and his wife and daughter and other children are here and here but he cannot go now because it's frozen.</span> <span id="s507">And he will have to be in Kotenish.</span> <span id="s508">They wrote him about it until he can make it by boat because he had no horses to go on the ice.</span> <span id="s509">, a German Jew.</span> <span id="s510">He sent me to a butcher who had goose there in the marketplace.</span> <span id="s511">All I had what my papers was that I was come from a concentration camp, Paragraph 58, that means Russianary...a man who can be a spy, everything the worse that exists.</span> <span id="s512">And I came to this goose and I told him that a man with one foot who had by the way the Lenin...uh... Medal for bravery sent me to you.</span> <span id="s513">And he said to me, "German Jew?</span> <span id="s514">You from the concentration camp you come out now.”</span> <span id="s515">All the Jews came out in 41.</span> <span id="s516">He was a Polish...but he was not in a concentration ever because he was a communists and he went by that means by free will when the Russians came in he reg...registered he wants to go where the Messiah is.</span> <span id="s517">There he had the butcher...the butcher thing there, butcher store.</span> <span id="s518">From here he gave to the workers every week or every two weeks a piece of meat that was allowed to them because of work.</span> <span id="s519">If they worked they got...except Vodka, a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s520">And he said, "The German Jews were not nice to us.”</span> <span id="s521">I said, "It is true I was born in Germany, but my parents were not born and to prove to you I speak fluently Yiddish."</span> <span id="s522">Start talking Yiddish and he thought it over and he looked here and there, couldn't make his heart giving in to give me something.</span> <span id="s523">But then we looked and as far as three times from here to the door, the other side of the marketplace was a young man looking like a Haludient and he looked and he called him because he was knowing him.</span> <span id="s524">So he told him...uh...a German Jew, , uh...is here and he wants...and he wants to...uh...to...uh...make me to help him.</span> <span id="s525">He comes from the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s526">So he took out 300 rubles and gave it to him to give it to me.</span> <span id="s527">When he did that he went and bought me...brought me a piece...a little piece of a..</span> <span id="s528">.</span> <span id="s529">of a roll, black roll and some milk.</span> <span id="s530">So I told him I cannot use the milk.</span> <span id="s531">I haven't had it for several...for 5 years almost.</span> <span id="s532">I'm afraid to drink it.</span> <span id="s533">But the bread...so he brought me which is boiled water.</span> <span id="s534">In Russia, as soon as they came in occupied they put a kettle on the...up in the middle of the city and constantly burning and to that you have hot water but no sugar.</span> <span id="s535">So I..</span> <span id="s536">.</span> <span id="s537">I..</span> <span id="s538">.</span> <span id="s539">I came about early afternoon and I made him, as I talk to you, I think I am capable to convince him that I am not so bad and he should help me.</span> <span id="s540">He brought me more bread and he told me, "I am living with a Russian woman.</span> <span id="s541">She has a..</span> <span id="s542">.</span> <span id="s543">they all had their own one room or two room home, and sometimes a cow.</span> <span id="s544">Sometimes!</span> <span id="s545">And he even made the remark if she's at home she should burn...and in Yiddish it sounds even different...then I cannot give you anything.</span> <span id="s546">But if she is not at home I will give you potatoes....uh...fried potatoes.</span> <span id="s547">I was lucky.</span> <span id="s548">She was not at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s550">I want to stop.</span> <span id="s551">We're going to change tapes and then we'll pick up from there.</span> <span id="s552">A: Fine.</span> <span id="s553">I have to go to the washroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s555">How it is so far.</span> <span id="s556">I have it still a long to talk.</span> <span id="s557">It will be more than 2 hours.</span> <span id="s558">Q: That's fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: We're back on camera.</span> <span id="s562">Now?</span> <span id="s563">Okay.</span> <span id="s564">Uh...Tell me...the butcher gave you food or did the butcher take you home?</span> <span id="s565">Tell me about the butcher.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: When we talk about the butcher, he had not a butcher's store.</span> <span id="s567">It was a booth with an open window and nights locked.</span> <span id="s568">You couldn't go into it.</span> <span id="s569">From the street, you showed your that means to prove that you are entitled to so and so much meat.</span> <span id="s570">And he gave it to you and he saw to it that he didn't give you everything to you was yours because he needed some for a black market so that he could exchange it.</span> <span id="s571">The...he took me home and he wanted to help me.</span> <span id="s572">All of a sudden, his Jewish heart came out.</span> <span id="s573">He wasn't an educated man, but his Jewish heart came out and he said, "Stop suffering.”</span> <span id="s574">I did not know...I thought he...I said, "You went by one of the and they were nice to you.</span> <span id="s575">You were a friend.</span> <span id="s576">I wasn't considered a friend.”</span> <span id="s577">So he went with me to another Jewish place.</span> <span id="s578">The man was not married and he lived in a small there.</span> <span id="s579">I said, "All I can do....I cannot sleep here.</span> <span id="s580">I can give him bread.”</span> <span id="s581">And that was like giving you blood.</span> <span id="s582">Because it was rationed.</span> <span id="s583">And he gave me a big piece of bread.</span> <span id="s584">I had, as I told you before...uh... called and there I put in with the piece of rag a big pocket.</span> <span id="s585">And needles we made ourselves.</span> <span id="s586">Got a piece of wire and yarn we got from other materials and I sewed a big pocket in and there I kept all the things that I hoped I will have when I..</span> <span id="s587">.</span> <span id="s588">get...don't get anything I will not die from hunger.</span> <span id="s589">Of course, I couldn't eat anymore bread so I put the bread away.</span> <span id="s590">Then he continued...he needed from me where to go to sleep.</span> <span id="s591">Outside was still 30 below, and it was end of May.</span> <span id="s592">So we went to a place.</span> <span id="s593">Her name was Sara.</span> <span id="s594">I never was her...know her name.</span> <span id="s595">And there was somebody living there by the name of Shiem, Shier.</span> <span id="s596">And her so called husband...don't know, Samuel...I don't know.</span> <span id="s597">Don't remember.</span> <span id="s598">She was...she had two rooms.</span> <span id="s599">One was like this window here where we are look on it, that you could look out and there was a big scale inside a scale...outside the scale and inside to read up how much it weighs.</span> <span id="s600">The farmers used to bring their product...delivered, that they had to deliver and she rated...and in the other room there slept.</span> <span id="s601">And he told her, "Sara, the man has to sleep somewhere.</span> <span id="s602">You know I cannot take him to me.”</span> <span id="s603">She wouldn't give.</span> <span id="s604">But here he is among Jews...you understand, and she said, "When Shier comes home from work, she will talk to him.</span> <span id="s605">So I waited...he went home in the meantime and left me there...get rid of me, and then the others will take over.</span> <span id="s606">So when Shier came home he said, "No.</span> <span id="s607">We don't know you.</span> <span id="s608">You may have lice.”</span> <span id="s609">They had the lice.</span> <span id="s610">I was deloused.</span> <span id="s611">When I went out I was deloused.</span> <span id="s612">So they had lice.</span> <span id="s613">And he cannot...no...and he gave and he gave me a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s614">It is blood and a drink.</span> <span id="s615">And they let me be on the hayloft.</span> <span id="s616">There I went up and I thought maybe the hay...when I go under the hay I will not...I will be not too cold.</span> <span id="s617">It will be not so bad.</span> <span id="s618">But after 2, 3, 4, 5 minutes I had to get up.</span> <span id="s619">Couldn't stand there.</span> <span id="s620">I started to exercise, do whatever I could and I was waiting because I went to bed 6 o'clock, got...got...got night there and... uh...in the morning...the nights were short.</span> <span id="s621">Came already towards June and there was already sometimes when it had only half a hour night.</span> <span id="s622">And I was waiting for the morning to see again the butcher.</span> <span id="s623">Shier came up before he went to work and he told me in Yiddish, " .”</span> <span id="s624">So I told him, "It's cold and I am almost frozen and so on and so.”</span> <span id="s625">He cried and he gave me 500 rubles.</span> <span id="s626">He said for 500 rubles, could buy 2 and a half loaf of bread on the black market.</span> <span id="s627">It is not so much, but 2 and a half loaves of bread.</span> <span id="s628">I went to the butcher and I told him everything and he went...he brought me a hot soup.</span> <span id="s629">Not good, not that soup.</span> <span id="s630">It was bitter, bitter flour.</span> <span id="s631">I don't know what's in it...what it...what it was.</span> <span id="s632">Probably a food that they give to animals but...uh...you cannot die from it.</span> <span id="s633">And I had...uh...the hot soup and the bread again and he was...he told me he made an arrangement with a Russian Jew who has chil...children that are...uh...manager of a cohorse.</span> <span id="s634">Cohoss is like the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s635">When he came and he start to talk to me, I went with him because he started from Kanaa and he wanted to know this and that.</span> <span id="s636">"Oh," he said, "Yal.</span> <span id="s637">Yal.</span> <span id="s638">Yal.”</span> <span id="s639">And he showed me his wife is standing on the black market and sell things.</span> <span id="s640">They were fleeing the Germans, and he pretended that they always...that they took the last things with them and he sells it day after day so that they can live.</span> <span id="s641">But in fact, he was a black marketing.</span> <span id="s642">Things she bought, got and they lived.</span> <span id="s643">So he took me home and I got the first time after 4 and a half years of my life, I got a hot dinner.</span> <span id="s644">That means a piece of meat, a soup with beans and.</span> <span id="s645">.</span> <span id="s646">and noodles.</span> <span id="s647">But sleeping he couldn't give me.</span> <span id="s648">He was tight, and they didn't know who I am from a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s649">Didn't know.</span> <span id="s650">And I had a beard and I walked with a cane.</span> <span id="s651">I didn't look like I look today.</span> <span id="s652">Came back and the man, the butcher went home and he couldn't do anything for me so I went to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s653">Because the railroad station you wait for a train and there is an oven.</span> <span id="s654">So I went there to sit down and warm myself until the next night goes through and then I had an appointment with a Ukrainian manager where the children said he should get in touch with me to go to the cohoss.</span> <span id="s655">There I had...there had a hat...I had to sleep and where to live.</span> <span id="s656">I was sitting there and fell asleep at the oven, at the belly oven because I didn't sleep the night before and I was always on my feet.</span> <span id="s657">I wonder today how I did it.</span> <span id="s658">And I was awake by...uh...by...uh... .</span> <span id="s659">And he said, "What are you doing here?</span> <span id="s660">Where is your papers?"</span> <span id="s661">Papers mean that everybody that was over those years had to have a passport.</span> <span id="s662">So I had to have something to show who I am and why I am in this city.</span> <span id="s663">If I'm allowed in this city or in this village.</span> <span id="s664">You couldn't go from one city to one village without permission of the .</span> <span id="s665">When he looked it...oh, he said, Paragraph 58, come on with me.</span> <span id="s666">And he took me to higher...like you see him today on television was a nicer camp.</span> <span id="s667">You know, you see them today.</span> <span id="s668">And he told me...he told me.</span> <span id="s669">.</span> <span id="s670">uh...what are you doing here.</span> <span id="s671">Where....</span> <span id="s672">I said, and I told him about that...what I told right now.</span> <span id="s673">I said I was released from a concentration camp and I have nowhere to be and I'm frozen.</span> <span id="s674">Why it was much better in the camp.</span> <span id="s675">I got a little bit of soup and a piece of bread, but there I couldn't lay down.</span> <span id="s676">It's worse than freedom in here.</span> <span id="s677">He said...and I showed him...I said I have to work.</span> <span id="s678">I said where should I work?</span> <span id="s679">If I cannot work in the camp and I showed him I was only bones.</span> <span id="s680">Think he...he cried or anything?</span> <span id="s681">He told, "Get out of here.</span> <span id="s682">This time I let you out.</span> <span id="s683">Otherwise, we give you another 10 years.</span> <span id="s684">Get out of here.</span> <span id="s685">When I find you once more, then you go back to a..</span> <span id="s686">.</span> <span id="s687">to a camp.”</span> <span id="s688">So I was afraid to go back and I spent the rest of the night up and down on the street.</span> <span id="s689">Snow!</span> <span id="s690">Winter!</span> <span id="s691">Siberia!</span> <span id="s692">The next day I hardly could wait for the butcher again.</span> <span id="s693">There was my place where I met my future helper.</span> <span id="s694">And the Ukrainian manager came.</span> <span id="s695">He was quite nice.</span> <span id="s696">Ukrainians were not so nice to Jews, but he was at that time quite nice to me.</span> <span id="s697">He said, "Can you teach me German?"</span> <span id="s698">I said, "Yes.”</span> <span id="s699">"So come on to...with me to our cohoss and I will see to it that you have something to eat.”</span> <span id="s700">And he took from the newspaper a little piece of paper because they have no paper there...from a newspaper and wrote down to the kibbutz manager there, a woman, to give me 4 or 5 potatoes...I don't remember the details, 4 or 5 potatoes and a bowl of sauerkraut.</span> <span id="s701">So I waited because I will go with several other people, with their girl who had been to the marketplace, brought there something from the village to take home, salt, , and he told that one girl, "See to it that he goes there and there...there to this village," because she lived not far away.</span> <span id="s702">She didn't know if I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s703">She didn't know who I was.</span> <span id="s704">She saw that I'm a grandpa.</span> <span id="s705">Good looking, strong, not educated girl.</span> <span id="s706">And she helped me to carry that little wooden case where I had nothing in.</span> <span id="s707">I..</span> <span id="s708">.</span> <span id="s709">I..</span> <span id="s710">.</span> <span id="s711">I threw it away after that.</span> <span id="s712">(clearing throat) And when I came they were all sleeping because it took us a long time.</span> <span id="s713">They were all sleeping.</span> <span id="s714">She woke up.</span> <span id="s715">I gave her this little ticket.</span> <span id="s716">She gave me the potatoes.</span> <span id="s717">She gave the sauerkraut and in the farm house always benches along in Russia, where they sleep.</span> <span id="s718">They sleep on the oven and all on the benches all high up because the heat goes up.</span> <span id="s719">So I laid down and I couldn't...I couldn't get up anymore.</span> <span id="s720">I couldn't get up anymore because in walking so far, I had pains here, my bones.</span> <span id="s721">I think close to the...to the first of May.</span> <span id="s722">I made there a mistake.</span> <span id="s723">It was the first of May...it was the end of April and not May.</span> <span id="s724">I have got to correct that.</span> <span id="s725">I was...was right originally that it is...uh...it is the 27th of April and...uh...not May.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Uh...uh...I got...they were sitting down that day over meat, bread, soup and I didn't get anything.</span> <span id="s727">Uh...She told me in Russian, she told me .</span> <span id="s728">"Whoever does not work does not get.”</span> <span id="s729">She had red hair and all the people that worked in that cohoss came to that party and she had I think 3 or 4 or 5 children from different men.</span> <span id="s730">There was one...I think he was 16 years old.</span> <span id="s731">Red hair like his mother, and he didn't like it what she talked to me.</span> <span id="s732">And he took something from the table when she went away for a minute and gave it to me and said, "Cover yourself and eat.”</span> <span id="s733">And that was it.</span> <span id="s734">The next day I was waiting for the man, the manager of the cohoss, Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s735">That day I got so much soup, so much bread.</span> <span id="s736">Course meals, but so much but after then I was afraid I will fall sick.</span> <span id="s737">Everything was bloated, not used anymore to such food because it was all chunked together.</span> <span id="s738">For the first next few days, I did not work.</span> <span id="s739">I taught him German.</span> <span id="s740">And he gave me a piece of sausage which was not good for me because it was fat.</span> <span id="s741">I couldn't...I wasn't used to anything...any that, and...uh...I..</span> <span id="s742">.</span> <span id="s743">I..</span> <span id="s744">.</span> <span id="s745">I might...may make a joke.</span> <span id="s746">I lived all the way...all the time kosher.</span> <span id="s747">We never got any meat.</span> <span id="s748">All we got was a cabbage and a piece of bread and sometimes a a head of a fish.</span> <span id="s749">A head of fish or a herring.</span> <span id="s750">And I didn't want it.</span> <span id="s751">For two reasons!</span> <span id="s752">I was afraid I cannot digest it and on the other hand, I break...I break dietary laws.</span> <span id="s753">I thought to myself.</span> <span id="s754">Then I became...uh...uh...watching the field evenings, nights...uh...as a watchman that nobody takes out the newly put in potatoes or whatever.</span> <span id="s755">Of course, it was cold and all night and it was that reason...for that you got a piece of bread, like in the camp and the soup and...uh...and every two weeks a bottle of vodka, a liter of vodka.</span> <span id="s756">I didn't stay very long there because I couldn't.</span> <span id="s757">It was too cold outside.</span> <span id="s758">So he transferred me to the hospital for the...to the state hospital of that city for the people that were not quite healthy and there were quite a bit of German soldiers there that and they talked freely.</span> <span id="s759">Hitler will win and all that because they were not normal.</span> <span id="s760">And there I couldn't stay very long because there was a night service and they wanted me to clean up there what they did on the floor and all that, and they had no soap either.</span> <span id="s761">So I didn't stay very long, but the doctor in charge over there, the Russian woman, saw that I..</span> <span id="s762">.</span> <span id="s763">uh...must be...some...somewhere...some...she wanted to know more about me.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">And...uh...she gave me cigarettes but she could not help me.</span> <span id="s765">I had to go back to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Everybody has to work and I had to go to the field again.</span> <span id="s767">There I fell asleep and I had some potatoes already prepared to take home and somebody that checked on me told them about me.</span> <span id="s768">That would be 5 or 10 years again for doing that.</span> <span id="s769">She got me out of it...got me out it, and I left that hospital.</span> <span id="s770">And I did not work.</span> <span id="s771">I went on the black market again.</span> <span id="s772">But there was a bookkeeper that gave me at that time what I had to come for that work and she was a Jewish woman from Kiev.</span> <span id="s773">Her husband was...uh...State Attorney in Kiev and he was sentenced for 10 years by Stalin as not reliable.</span> <span id="s774">And she had a daughter living with her 8 or 9 years and never heard from her husband again.</span> <span id="s775">We became friendly.</span> <span id="s776">I visited her.</span> <span id="s777">So what I got more from her was an onion or a garlic and a little bit more bread and we had talks.</span> <span id="s778">In the meantime, I had company with that Mr. Becker who became after then the conservative rabbi of Memphis that gave me the...the money...that gave me the money.</span> <span id="s779">I met him at services.</span> <span id="s780">He made a Minyan in 1944 in September at Sara's place because she had an extra room.</span> <span id="s781">Now he prayed the Musaf service and I pray...I prayed the Shofer service.</span> <span id="s782">And at that place we were four people, all foreign Jews but one.</span> <span id="s783">It was a Russian Jews.</span> <span id="s784">He was...name was Matowich.</span> <span id="s785">He was in his high 70s.</span> <span id="s786">He fled Ukraine, and he had a prayer book.</span> <span id="s787">Didn't take anything this prayer book, the Moosberg.</span> <span id="s788">And from that we prayed and all the other said, yes...yes...harman or.</span> <span id="s789">When he heard me pray...Becker, he decided he wants to be more friendly to me, wants to know about me.</span> <span id="s790">He was afraid of anybody because he was...uh...every 3 months checked if he can go to the front line again because he came from Rovno which not far away from Limburg and there they took him into the army and they retreated and you know where he in 14 days the Germans were before Moscow.</span> <span id="s791">And all of those people there that army, they're taken to camps.</span> <span id="s792">Not concentration camps, but not transports.</span> <span id="s793">And every 3 months he was checked for his health and he played the crazy one.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">So he could not tell me and he didn't have the con...I could be linked up with their men.</span> <span id="s795">He did not know.</span> <span id="s796">But then he got confidence in me.</span> <span id="s797">He told me that has from the Yeshiva in , and he was writing for The Moment in Warsaw and was a friend of Begin.</span> <span id="s798">Begin was retired the Youth Movment, and he wrote for The Moment articles.</span> <span id="s799">Now, he doesn't know about his family anymore and that was it.</span> <span id="s800">He is here.</span> <span id="s801">He became so friendly I told, "Why do you read the Russian paper.</span> <span id="s802">Learn English.</span> <span id="s803">One nice day we will be in Western Europe, the Western Hemisphere, and English will be it and not Russia.”</span> <span id="s804">So the girl where I lived had a book, an English book, was a first 2 years used.</span> <span id="s805">And we talked.</span> <span id="s806">I forgot to tell you that a man...man by the name of Smiger, a photographer, helped me more than anybody else.</span> <span id="s807">The butcher told me, "Go to Smiger.</span> <span id="s808">Tell him who you are.</span> <span id="s809">I told him already that you are here.”</span> <span id="s810">And he gave me, of course, something to eat.</span> <span id="s811">Bread and butter, and some fruit...fruit, had some fruit.</span> <span id="s812">He had...he was a photographer because, as I'd mentioned before, anybody after the age of 12 has to have a passport.</span> <span id="s813">So he was making these pictures for passports and had to give him for 5 rubles.</span> <span id="s814">But then...when you wanted more pictures, you had to give 50 or a hundred rubles and there where he has the money.</span> <span id="s815">Here he got money for more pictures or he got a piece of chicken or a piece of , or a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s816">I helped Smiger developing the pictures.</span> <span id="s817">So he set me up with an elderly woman that was on the black market and she had a room...an apartment...a room, and there I slept on the floor.</span> <span id="s818">It was summertime so it was not so bad.</span> <span id="s819">Then came, as I mentioned before, Rosh Hashanah and we prayed there and the next year...the whole year, there was a war over in May, but we did not know anything what to do and when we will be repatriated.</span> <span id="s820">So one nice day, Becker, who was not...not ...he was from the Army.</span> <span id="s821">He was .</span> <span id="s822">They were all, as we say, .</span> <span id="s823">They could...he said to...to Sara...she was...she was in addition, she was a dressmaker, and she made all the dresses for the women.</span> <span id="s824">So he told her, I got the puputska.</span> <span id="s825">That means the so-called passport to go home to Rovno to see where my parents are.</span> <span id="s826">But there is room.</span> <span id="s827">which will never get out of here.</span> <span id="s828">Can you see that the man there...we are a friend...write your name.</span> <span id="s829">There's room for both of us that we go on the same trip with her.</span> <span id="s830">She listened.</span> <span id="s831">The next day we came and she said, "You did me a very bad service.</span> <span id="s832">They wanted almost to kill me.</span> <span id="s833">To take someone with paragaraph 58 they had you...his papers, your papers there and...uh...want to smuggle him out from here?"</span> <span id="s834">So that was it.</span> <span id="s835">That was October 1945.</span> <span id="s836">And we said goodbye, but we made out he's going over Moscow and in case he can find out if I go, then he will let me...with one word, give me a cable, .</span> <span id="s837">That means okay.</span> <span id="s838">And that will mean that I go.</span> <span id="s839">Uh...He asked him...that was Gomulka.</span> <span id="s840">You heard about Gomulka?</span> <span id="s841">He was after then the main chief in the new government.</span> <span id="s842">He was the Secretary.</span> <span id="s843">He was in Moscow waiting for the...for the creation of the new Polish Posusky army against the London army army.</span> <span id="s844">During the time in Kotenich, in 45 Stalin made it that we had to come to meetings to know more about the new army that he is founding, and wanted our okay you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: Who is our...what do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: Posusky army?</span> <span id="s847">Our is Russia...Russian...uh...Russian...uh ....uh...the opposite the Russian regime in communism, the new army be considered fascist.</span> <span id="s848">And when...when...when Becker said to me, "Come on with me.</span> <span id="s849">What do you have to lose?"</span> <span id="s850">I said, "Aw, what shall I sit down there.”</span> <span id="s851">He said, "You know piece of choc you get and a piece of sugar.”</span> <span id="s852">So I went.</span> <span id="s853">I went with him two or three times.</span> <span id="s854">And you had to fill out your name like he told me, "Here sign.”</span> <span id="s855">And I signed my name.</span> <span id="s856">So when he asked Becker in Moscow...Gomulko asked him, "What did he do for Poland?</span> <span id="s857">Who is he?"</span> <span id="s858">So he gave him the name and do you know they had the register of everybody who came to the meetings.</span> <span id="s859">When he saw that I came three times, two or three times to the meeting he said to him, "He will go.”</span> <span id="s860">And I got the letter .</span> <span id="s861">I was very happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: Explain what that means?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: That means...not everybody was repatriated.</span> <span id="s864">I was sent not as a Pole.</span> <span id="s865">I was sent as a German.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Then to them I was a German.</span> <span id="s867">And only Polish people were repatriated.</span> <span id="s868">So...but we explained to him that my parents were born in Poland and I am not a German.</span> <span id="s869">I am a Jew.</span> <span id="s870">And when he saw that I was to these meetings, he said, "He will go.</span> <span id="s871">I put him on the list."</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: Gomulka himself?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: Gomulka himself but him on the list.</span> <span id="s874">That what he told me that he will say I wasn't there.</span> <span id="s875">That was somewhere November of 45.</span> <span id="s876">I went on with my life.</span> <span id="s877">Black market.</span> <span id="s878">I lived with Smiger.</span> <span id="s879">His wife went home to Leningrad, and he let me in.</span> <span id="s880">.</span> <span id="s881">in a place to sleep on the side there.</span> <span id="s882">And there we met this girl that had the English book, and there we met the woman that was...that was her house.</span> <span id="s883">Until the end she made...she told Becker where are you going.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: CAN'T MAKE THIS OUT.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: The...the...the one that protect the...uh...the apartment, so-called...uh...uh...house, two bed...two...two room house.</span> <span id="s886">And she said she has a daughter.</span> <span id="s887">She studies to be engineer.</span> <span id="s888">And when she comes back, she's a pretty girl.</span> <span id="s889">He shouldn't go.</span> <span id="s890">She explained it.</span> <span id="s891">She explained it.</span> <span id="s892">Her husband was a drunkard.</span> <span id="s893">And she did not know what Jews are.</span> <span id="s894">She looked at us for over a year.</span> <span id="s895">When I lived with Smiger she looked at us.</span> <span id="s896">And we had never come drunk, never beat the women up.</span> <span id="s897">These are Jews?</span> <span id="s898">And she said she knows only from her youth time that in Kotenich was a doctor and the pharmacist were Jewish, sent by the Czar because of not behaving.</span> <span id="s899">But otherwise she knows only from the holy writings that we killed Jesus.</span> <span id="s900">But these are Jews?</span> <span id="s901">She doesn't want us to go.</span> <span id="s902">She wants us to say.</span> <span id="s903">For me, she had her sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Well, we listened.</span> <span id="s905">What should we say?</span> <span id="s906">It was very nice.</span> <span id="s907">He went and he went over Moscow and he went to Rovno.</span> <span id="s908">There was nothing left.</span> <span id="s909">Everything burned and as you know from the history, there was everywhere Judenrein.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: Mrs. Becker ?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: Yal.</span> <span id="s912">Yal.</span> <span id="s913">But then he went from there to Katowice into a kibbutz of of Jews and Catholics.</span> <span id="s914">That's .</span> <span id="s915">And he wrote me a little card, and the card came where he is....to not to lose him where he is and what I do?</span> <span id="s916">So I answered him that I'm still here and I didn't get my...didn't get my card.</span> <span id="s917">After 2 or 3 months he didn't get it, but I'm still here.</span> <span id="s918">It's censored and then they don't...don't...didn't give it.</span> <span id="s919">His was different.</span> <span id="s920">So I went on with my black marketing to have butter and bread and a even a piece of meat.</span> <span id="s921">I didn't care.</span> <span id="s922">Then I went to Keof.</span> <span id="s923">Keof was the capital of that State, .</span> <span id="s924">And before Becker left, he got me a coat, a military coat and a cap.</span> <span id="s925">When I had that on, nobody bothered me.</span> <span id="s926">I went with a cane, they were saying he is bobby, police from the army.</span> <span id="s927">So I went into that train to buy newspaper because newspaper and matches were a black market item.</span> <span id="s928">And then I went to the office of the Polish...uh...government that was installed there for repatriating.</span> <span id="s929">And I went up there.</span> <span id="s930">There was a Jewish girl from Galicia, and...uh...I told her my story and she went back and she said, "You are on the list.</span> <span id="s931">You will go.”</span> <span id="s932">And she made me the man that takes back for all the people, leather goods.</span> <span id="s933">I mean...things that you...they have no value but what they country had that they gave them.</span> <span id="s934">They should prepare themselves that in...uh ...uh...April or May, when it gets warmer, we will go.</span> <span id="s935">It's the last transport because the big transport went already and during these strong winter months, they stopped it because they wouldn't survive under the circumstances and it took too long and I called up one day again, and she told me, "Good, go up to the and tell him for next week to have a car, you know, animal car for you to come to Keof to join in that transport.</span> <span id="s936">When I came home with the goods that she gave me...and somebody helped me to carry it.</span> <span id="s937">I couldn't carry it.</span> <span id="s938">At the station Koternish, the was there.</span> <span id="s939">And it was already dark, and they lit up there things there and to see who I am.</span> <span id="s940">They see so much goods in private hands.</span> <span id="s941">They took me to the police and there they kept me from 6 or 7 o'clock til 12 o'clock night and there were a lot of people there they got from the street and they started to open up and everybody wanted to take something.</span> <span id="s942">I warned them this is this and this, for those and those people and I'm not responsible.</span> <span id="s943">When I gave the address of the office, the office had no telephone.</span> <span id="s944">The office was closed, and then they sent a man on a bicycle to her apartment.</span> <span id="s945">And she confirmed that this is from her and I got two policemen that brought me home where I lived and I distributed all those things the next day.</span> <span id="s946">I who talked the worse Prussian was made as a leader of 30 or 40 people...I don't remember.</span> <span id="s947">When I came to the , to tell him I need the car, and to stamp the , they told me, "The car will be there.”</span> <span id="s948">But it wasn't.</span> <span id="s949">So I called her and complained and afternoon there was...it was there.</span> <span id="s950">And we went away.</span> <span id="s951">Of course, a few friends that I made cried, especially the bookkeeper that was in charge there of the hospital.</span> <span id="s952">She came out to see me off.</span> <span id="s953">Uh...Her brother...the landlady's brother there where Smiger and I lived...uh...told me that...uh...why I don't stay?</span> <span id="s954">They will me a..</span> <span id="s955">.</span> <span id="s956">uh...home and his daughter is not married.</span> <span id="s957">She was a teacher and a sergeant in the army.</span> <span id="s958">Very good looking and healthy, you know.</span> <span id="s959">And I did not know that she took an eye on me because she passed there.</span> <span id="s960">I..</span> <span id="s961">.</span> <span id="s962">I did live in the room and she passed there and saw me.</span> <span id="s963">But during that time, there was a law given out that anybody that is...that care...has a right to be repatriated when he is married from wherever she comes, she can go with.</span> <span id="s964">So there was a young lady.</span> <span id="s965">I can say really a lady.</span> <span id="s966">Her husband was the transport minister in Estonia.</span> <span id="s967">And her father was a banker.</span> <span id="s968">And they were taken the first day when the Russians came in and they never saw them again, and her mother and herself and several children, they sent to Kotenish.</span> <span id="s969">When she heard that I speak German...you know, these Lithuanian, Estonia, and Latvia, there...uh...the language was German.</span> <span id="s970">And she made my acquaintance and she told me that she has a lot of money in banks in Western Europe.</span> <span id="s971">If I take her out and get married to her, either we stay married if I want; otherwise...but she will help me with a lot in business as a businessman.</span> <span id="s972">So, of course, I denied it.</span> <span id="s973">I didn't want to go into perform a marriage.</span> <span id="s974">But was I myself considered myself very.</span> <span id="s975">.</span> <span id="s976">very weakly patriation man.</span> <span id="s977">.</span> <span id="s978">I was always a question...question mark if I go back not to connect myself with another dark person.</span> <span id="s979">I can endanger and I don't come out again.</span> <span id="s980">So I told her I cannot do it.</span> <span id="s981">Finally, when we came to Keof, very happy I have my paper with me, and I have some rubles from the black market and I went to buy some cigarettes on the market and other things, and my paper was stolen.</span> <span id="s982">I got so frightened and I went to that woman from the office there.</span> <span id="s983">Said, "Your fault.</span> <span id="s984">You will stay here.</span> <span id="s985">What you think?</span> <span id="s986">I can make paper for you?</span> <span id="s987">Why do you go on the black market?</span> <span id="s988">Aren't you glad to get out from here?"</span> <span id="s989">And shouted at me and all that.</span> <span id="s990">So I was told have to go to the office where they lose and find and that was closed and after 4 o'clock it opened, and she didn't have anything and I had to bring...uh...uh...uh ...uh...little piece of paper that I was there.</span> <span id="s991">If she had no paper, so I went without the paper and I went back to her.</span> <span id="s992">Broken!</span> <span id="s993">Heart broken!</span> <span id="s994">6 o'clock.</span> <span id="s995">And this is not just here, and there's a taxi or anything.</span> <span id="s996">All or a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s997">When you have to you have to.</span> <span id="s998">So she told me, "I'll tell you what.</span> <span id="s999">I go with you night to the .</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Maybe they give you another paper.”</span> <span id="s1001">I just called them and told them about.</span> <span id="s1002">She said, "Let me see.</span> <span id="s1003">Come over.</span> <span id="s1004">I don't promise you anything.”</span> <span id="s1005">So night at 10 I met her, and we went over there.</span> <span id="s1006">And I was sitting on the stairs of the , outside.</span> <span id="s1007">Told me to come in.</span> <span id="s1008">Took a look.</span> <span id="s1009">But she told me before to make pictures again, but the office was closed...the picture stores were closed, so I got on the black market a picture.</span> <span id="s1010">I have still this little picture at home.</span> <span id="s1011">One...one of them.</span> <span id="s1012">I paid a good price for it, and I got 4, 5 little pictures and I was afraid the passport will not accept it, will not be the right picture.</span> <span id="s1013">Somehow, midnight I was called in.</span> <span id="s1014">I gave him the picture and I was told to wait outside and in an hour I had a new paper with the picture on.</span> <span id="s1015">I thanked her and I made my way and I hitchhiked to the station.</span> <span id="s1016">That was far away.</span> <span id="s1017">So I was on one...on one car and then he set me off.</span> <span id="s1018">He cannot go farther.</span> <span id="s1019">And I got the second one and the third one.</span> <span id="s1020">I arrived at the station 5 o'clock in the morning and I didn't see the car where we were in the train where we were in.</span> <span id="s1021">So I met somebody that I was knowing from the train.</span> <span id="s1022">He said, "They changed...the last two days overnight on another...another...another line.”</span> <span id="s1023">When I came there most of the people had given money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1025">When I come back, they said I will not get out from here.</span> <span id="s1026">It can take a year or not...never, and they took all money together and gave it to me.</span> <span id="s1027">So I did not accept it.</span> <span id="s1028">I said, "I have papers.”</span> <span id="s1029">A day later I didn't go out anymore.</span> <span id="s1030">I stayed in the car.</span> <span id="s1031">Didn't even go out.</span> <span id="s1032">The next day we moved, and it took quite some time to get to the Polish border.</span> <span id="s1033">I think 14 days or something like that.</span> <span id="s1034">I arrived in July...in July.</span> <span id="s1035">We left...left in June...beginning of June.</span> <span id="s1036">I arrived in July.</span> <span id="s1037">Uh...There at the Polish border I went...the first station they let us out.</span> <span id="s1038">We wanted Bicksley, was Bresleytos.</span> <span id="s1039">And I remember from my school years during the war that Hindenberg made the first peace with the Russians in Bresleytos.</span> <span id="s1040">And I was curious to know how Bresleytos looked because there was .</span> <span id="s1041">It was very famous.</span> <span id="s1042">And I went to the...to the marketplace, and there I saw women with the as their hair...head gear, all around with the scarf and they had rings and they had watches.</span> <span id="s1043">You could buy everything if you had money.</span> <span id="s1044">So I said, "Where did you get it all from?"</span> <span id="s1045">"Oh, from the Jews.”</span> <span id="s1046">You know, Jews anymore.</span> <span id="s1047">I said...when I asked him if see anywhere a synagogue.</span> <span id="s1048">Synagogue?</span> <span id="s1049">All burned.”</span> <span id="s1050">So with a heavy heart...I didn't look at the watches.</span> <span id="s1051">I didn't look at what has happened.</span> <span id="s1052">I went back to the train and about a few hours later we were at the Polish border.</span> <span id="s1053">The Polish border was already an officer...Polish officer standing and he called out, "Who is Catholic in this train?"</span> <span id="s1054">We have for you help?</span> <span id="s1055">I said, "Who helps us?"</span> <span id="s1056">He said, "The Joint in German, not here.”</span> <span id="s1057">What do you say to that?</span> <span id="s1058">So we went on and in that train I made again the acquaintance of a man who was from Poland and he went there by , by free will and his two sons were in the Polish army and were officers even the army now.</span> <span id="s1059">And he married.</span> <span id="s1060">He was a widower and he married another young woman with a child and he took her with...one of these marriages to take out from Russia.</span> <span id="s1061">When we arrived in Breslow, now, well I as knowing Breslow, I was several times there during my youth time.</span> <span id="s1062">There was a famous...uh...rabbinical college, , interpreter of our thing.</span> <span id="s1063">Uh...The policeman didn't let us out.</span> <span id="s1064">Let him out with his wife and child because the son was waiting for him and the officer...uh...dressed in a Polish officer.</span> <span id="s1065">So I went down nevertheless and I told him that I was born in Germany.</span> <span id="s1066">All I wanted was get back to Germany and he should be so kind to tell the policeman to let me go.</span> <span id="s1067">I am not going into that new territory that is between Breslow, between Katowice, between Krakau and the Oder River, you know, that is now Polish.</span> <span id="s1068">And there they want us to settle.</span> <span id="s1069">The apartments were empty.</span> <span id="s1070">Furniture was there.</span> <span id="s1071">Everything!</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">The people they pushed out.</span> <span id="s1073">When I came to Breslow he took us in...into his apartment, not apartment.</span> <span id="s1074">Had a big balcony.</span> <span id="s1075">That balcony he let us live.</span> <span id="s1076">He said, "When you want to go to the washroom you can come in.</span> <span id="s1077">Otherwise you cannot come in.</span> <span id="s1078">If you come in, then I have to tell you to go.”</span> <span id="s1079">That was a Friday afternoon some day in July.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: very clear.</span> <span id="s1081">Who is taking you into the apartments?</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: The son of that man that married the Jewish woman.</span> <span id="s1083">He had two sons in the Polish army.</span> <span id="s1084">He lived very nice.</span> <span id="s1085">Half of the house was ruined but there was still some apartments in tact.</span> <span id="s1086">It was in the nicest neighborhood of Breslow.</span> <span id="s1087">I was in that...in that train of the 30 of us or even 40, but I was the manager of the 30...was a young man.</span> <span id="s1088">He was learned Yeshiva, and he was going back.</span> <span id="s1089">And the man by the Ginselman.</span> <span id="s1090">Ginselman lived in Kotenish and he had always a big .</span> <span id="s1091">And he didn't...didn't associate himself with...uh...the Jews.</span> <span id="s1092">In the train when he was already on the way back to Poland, he said he is Jewish?</span> <span id="s1093">I said, "What do you have the cross on?"</span> <span id="s1094">And he explained it.</span> <span id="s1095">They let him live.</span> <span id="s1096">He worked.</span> <span id="s1097">They let him live.</span> <span id="s1098">So the Yeshiva , and Ginselman and I were the three people that went in Breslow up on that balcony.</span> <span id="s1099">We prayed for each other that these are two people they let them come with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">And the other one said, " .”</span> <span id="s1101">Let me...as always Jews...Jews are...and he said, "Yes.”</span> <span id="s1102">That Friday evening we decided...we had bread, and the Yeshiva had honey.</span> <span id="s1103">How he had it I don't know.</span> <span id="s1104">And we ate honey and bread and we felt great.</span> <span id="s1105">And not...not the one time did they come out to ask us how we are, and only they watched us that we don't go farther than the outside there to the washroom.</span> <span id="s1106">Inside the apartment, but outside of the balcony.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Ginselman was not religious and he decided he's going to look on Sabbath morning what's going on in Breslow.</span> <span id="s1108">What do we need him, he said.</span> <span id="s1109">And the two of us said, "God had gotten a few months freedom in a way we will not violate the Sabbath.</span> <span id="s1110">We'll stay here till the Sabbath is out and tomorrow morning so God will be .</span> <span id="s1111">Ginselman came back evenings late.</span> <span id="s1112">He told us there is a so-called ghetto that the Jews were...uh.</span> <span id="s1113">.</span> <span id="s1114">were kept, but it's better for them that it would seem and the people they kept there, secure because there was always a Jewish...uh.</span> <span id="s1115">.</span> <span id="s1116">policeman ...uh...24 hours.</span> <span id="s1117">You couldn't get in.</span> <span id="s1118">There was still one synagogue left in the rear.</span> <span id="s1119">They didn't burn it because it was between buildings...an old, little synagogue and...uh...he got soup from the Joint.</span> <span id="s1120">I never got it.</span> <span id="s1121">When I came it was already out.</span> <span id="s1122">I have not quite such a good heart from that help to tell you the truth.</span> <span id="s1123">Tell you later about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">And...uh...on the marketplace, we met a man that wasn't looking quite normal.</span> <span id="s1125">And he had an apartment in a poor workers' neighborhood.</span> <span id="s1126">He was.</span> <span id="s1127">.</span> <span id="s1128">uh.</span> <span id="s1129">.</span> <span id="s1130">repatriated too.</span> <span id="s1131">He was...and his wife and he had two children.</span> <span id="s1132">And he had a room where we could sleep.</span> <span id="s1133">He said, "You can sleep.”</span> <span id="s1134">He had two beds.</span> <span id="s1135">Aw, come to get, but not on the streets, like in Russia.</span> <span id="s1136">So we took it.</span> <span id="s1137">But before I went to sleep, I went to the marketplace.</span> <span id="s1138">What did I find out and you will be surprised.</span> <span id="s1139">A man by the name of Rosenberg, who was born in Poland, as a child came to Homburg.</span> <span id="s1140">We went together to school, and he went to Russia by free will and his mother and his sister.</span> <span id="s1141">He said to me, "Max, you are born in Germany.</span> <span id="s1142">You have a good chance to get out of here.</span> <span id="s1143">I wish I had your birth certificate.”</span> <span id="s1144">I said, "I have no birth certificate.</span> <span id="s1145">I have no papers.</span> <span id="s1146">The paper I had was paragraph 58 and I threw it away that nobody should even know.</span> <span id="s1147">So what should I do?</span> <span id="s1148">I remembered I lived in Katowice.</span> <span id="s1149">And when you live in Poland or in Germany, within 24 hours you have to go to the office to register.</span> <span id="s1150">It's not the United States.</span> <span id="s1151">So I said, "I will get an certification that I was born in Germany.”</span> <span id="s1152">Because I went up to the man of the Jewish community...he was a German Jew and he told me, "You have to bring papers.”</span> <span id="s1153">I said so and so.</span> <span id="s1154">He said, "I cannot do anything for you unless you have a birth certificate.</span> <span id="s1155">And my birth certificate was in the French zone.</span> <span id="s1156">Essen on the Ruhr .</span> <span id="s1157">So I did not know what to do.</span> <span id="s1158">So Rosenberg in the meantime introduced me to a woman who had a ticket, a seat, number 64 in that train to go to Germany.</span> <span id="s1159">She was a German Jewess from Breslow and she has a right to go.</span> <span id="s1160">She has the papers.</span> <span id="s1161">Elderly woman.</span> <span id="s1162">She said she would like to go later.</span> <span id="s1163">She needs money.</span> <span id="s1164">She needs something to buy to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">And I had from the black market a suit.</span> <span id="s1166">You wouldn't put on today, but it was a suit.</span> <span id="s1167">I sold it for six thousand...six thousand slota on the black market.</span> <span id="s1168">I did this when I came back with the papers...with the papers already.</span> <span id="s1169">How did I get my papers?</span> <span id="s1170">The afternoon I took a train from Breslow to Katowice.</span> <span id="s1171">It was quite...uh...all night and it was Saturday, Friday evening when I arrived.</span> <span id="s1172">Friday evening I had the card from Becker that he is in a kibbutz and I was knowing the address.</span> <span id="s1173">I was knowing Katowice because I did business there.</span> <span id="s1174">And I went to that kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1175">Oh, was he surprised to see me.</span> <span id="s1176">And I got a good dinner.</span> <span id="s1177">Chicken and the traditional Jewish Friday evening dinner.</span> <span id="s1178">And how did I sleep?</span> <span id="s1179">We slept...they slept all over the floor, but clean in .</span> <span id="s1180">So I said...they had no room, so the other one said, "We'll push together.</span> <span id="s1181">One...one Jew more.</span> <span id="s1182">Oh...let him sleep there.”</span> <span id="s1183">But when they saw I had no .</span> <span id="s1184">You know what is?</span> <span id="s1185">I have it at home.</span> <span id="s1186">My wife told me to take it with me.</span> <span id="s1187">I'll give it to you tonight.</span> <span id="s1188">Uh...uh...they didn't want me to sleep without it.</span> <span id="s1189">So I got it...she washed it last week.</span> <span id="s1190">I was looking for something else for my brother.</span> <span id="s1191">Didn't find it, and I found that.</span> <span id="s1192">And I got the which I will give you and...uh...slept the night.</span> <span id="s1193">In the morning I had to wait for services, and then they honored me in lifting the Torah and I didn't do it the proper way because you should turn around at least three chapters...have to show the...the community.</span> <span id="s1194">I was not there for that.</span> <span id="s1195">I was for the paper to get out from here.</span> <span id="s1196">And they closed at 12 o'clock so I made...I got out.</span> <span id="s1197">I didn't wait for kiddish.</span> <span id="s1198">I got out and they were very polite.</span> <span id="s1199">I gave them 200 slota, and I got a paper this and this born, there and there, lived here from that and that time.</span> <span id="s1200">He's the son of that and that, and he came from Germany that and that day.</span> <span id="s1201">It was Saturday.</span> <span id="s1202">Took me a whole day to go back.</span> <span id="s1203">Saturday afternoon that I took the train back.</span> <span id="s1204">It was not yet night.</span> <span id="s1205">It was dangerous for Jews on the street.</span> <span id="s1206">It was 1946.</span> <span id="s1207">Two young man said, "He didn't kill them all.</span> <span id="s1208">There's another one.”</span> <span id="s1209">And I went among...mingled among the people.</span> <span id="s1210">Had no...no luggage.</span> <span id="s1211">I stood all night.</span> <span id="s1212">The train was crowded.</span> <span id="s1213">Had to stay...stand all night, and I arrived the next morning and I went with my paper and I was looking for the woman that wanted to sell me for 200 or three thousand dollars there the seat, and I found her and she got the 3...I sold the suit, and I gave her 3 thousand slota, and the other 3 thousand slota I used for food to keep me over until I get somewhere where I get something to eat.</span> <span id="s1214">He didn't want.</span> <span id="s1215">He said, "Why should this poor woman not stay here, and give it to you.</span> <span id="s1216">Give her the seat.”</span> <span id="s1217">The man from the that was in charge of letting people go.</span> <span id="s1218">And on the other hand, "This is not a birth certificate.”</span> <span id="s1219">I said, "You make me .”</span> <span id="s1220">This tells you I was from Germany and I speak to you in German.</span> <span id="s1221">I speak to you...let me to say today...in English it has a German accent, but my German had no accent.</span> <span id="s1222">You could see immediately from where I come and I gave you the paper and the picture to it.</span> <span id="s1223">Finally, he agreed and Monday morning I was on my way.</span> <span id="s1224">I quickly bought bread and something to eat and...uh... I must tell you it was salted bacon.</span> <span id="s1225">We couldn't have anything else.</span> <span id="s1226">And before I went into the train, three quarter of the bacon was taken away by the Polish checkpoint, and the bread I..</span> <span id="s1227">.</span> <span id="s1228">I could keep, and I went into the train and I was one Jew among...among all Germans who was...were pushed out from that territory to make room for the Poles to take it over.</span> <span id="s1229">Today, they don't think that way with Israel.</span> <span id="s1230">They make it the point not there.</span> <span id="s1231">Not there!</span> <span id="s1232">Because this is not given to you.</span> <span id="s1233">But they...they did it at that time.</span> <span id="s1234">I arrived at the...in the zone in the Amer...in the Russian zone in Berlin.</span> <span id="s1235">A German nurse was there.</span> <span id="s1236">Blonde, and of course, friendly, and I told the English man, "I don't want her to serve me.</span> <span id="s1237">I don't want that.”</span> <span id="s1238">And he insisted, "She is here in charge, and you will have to.”</span> <span id="s1239">First of all, papers...I gave you the papers.</span> <span id="s1240">Okay.</span> <span id="s1241">"You are one of them," he said, "Yal.”</span> <span id="s1242">I said, "I don't want any Germans.</span> <span id="s1243">I heard what they did, and what they did to me.”</span> <span id="s1244">So I was deloused with DDT, which is today forbidden as you know.</span> <span id="s1245">And I felt after that so fine, so relieved.</span> <span id="s1246">Never had any lice anymore.</span> <span id="s1247">Waiting on the other side, we decided to go to the English zone.</span> <span id="s1248">There were 5, 6, 7 people, quite intelligent Polish Jews.</span> <span id="s1249">Not those three Jews that talk only Yiddish, but educated with degrees and they were so glad to find a German.</span> <span id="s1250">Somebody that speaks German that they...they will make no trouble.</span> <span id="s1251">Said, "You will speak Polish and I will speak German.”</span> <span id="s1252">So we went to the English zone, and there they gave us.</span> <span id="s1253">.</span> <span id="s1254">they gave us a place... uh...if it wouldn't be summer, it would be very bad.</span> <span id="s1255">It was the dancing hall of a hotel.</span> <span id="s1256">And there we got our things and we laid down and then we went for ticket to get food.</span> <span id="s1257">As we were refugees, they gave us double rations.</span> <span id="s1258">Germans double ration.</span> <span id="s1259">The double ration was not enough either.</span> <span id="s1260">We put it together and the women started to cook.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: At this point we need to stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: Stop, and I have to go to the washroom.</span> <span id="s1263">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: What...what time is it?</span> <span id="s1265">So sorry.</span> <span id="s1266">Q: Okay, we have.....</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1268">Begin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: To make it short, as soon as I came to...to Germany, I went from the English zone to the American zone and that was the place where I was treated first as a humanbeing.</span> <span id="s1270">Uh...I had to decide what to do.</span> <span id="s1271">To wait to go to Palestine, to go to Cyrprus and not to Palestine so when I got a letter from my cousin of mine that lived in originally in Televiv but went afterward to Yonkers, New York, Dr. , Dr. Fred...Fred and he told me I should come to the United States.</span> <span id="s1272">And he sent me immediately papers which I did not need because I had the right as a displaced person to go without papers if I had the quota.</span> <span id="s1273">And the quota I had most of the people had to wait 10 to 12 years, and as I was in the German quarter, that start be good for me to be from Germany.</span> <span id="s1274">I waited only 4 months, and in 4 months I was on my way to the United States.</span> <span id="s1275">I arrived here 2nd of October, 1947, and then to friends in New York...uh...I was sent on a position to Chicago and that why I'm living...living today in Chicago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: How...uh...how did you feel about all this?</span> <span id="s1277">How did all this experience affect you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: Well, when I have sometimes days when I am not very happy then I go back and I say it could have very much worse.</span> <span id="s1279">Look where I got out from.</span> <span id="s1280">I get from this out too.</span> <span id="s1281">It...uh...I have no after affects.</span> <span id="s1282">The only after affect is the way my mother, my sister, my nephew, niece were killed and how they...uh...took the health from my brother away that he died earlier than it was necessary.</span> <span id="s1283">Otherwise, I..</span> <span id="s1284">.</span> <span id="s1285">uh...survived with the hope that we will have healthy State in Israel and...uh...I am busy with metals that concern Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: I thank you.</span> <span id="s1287">You wanted to tell us about your brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: My brother...my brother very seldom wanted to talk about it because it was hurting him so much.</span> <span id="s1289">He was an eye witness how our closest were killed.</span> <span id="s1290">Uh...He was a doctor and...uh... he had to flee Krakau where he was practicing ...uh...medicine when the war broke out in 1939, and he came to Kolomier, where he was born.</span> <span id="s1291">He was the oldest.</span> <span id="s1292">And...uh.</span> <span id="s1293">.</span> <span id="s1294">he...he described...he never wanted to talk about it but when he passed away among his...uh...papers, I found a letter reporting what has happened to the family and then... then one nice day, when he is not anymore here maybe I will have it and I will be the one that has to not let the world forget what has happened to us during the HItler time.</span> <span id="s1295">In the beginning when the Germans came in, after the Russians left, was occupied by the Russians, they...uh...took my... my sister's apartment away.</span> <span id="s1296">Uh...They...uh...they had to go to the ghetto and...uh...everything...everything was...uh... uh...taken...taken away.</span> <span id="s1297">Uh...They were left just with what they could carry in their hand.</span> <span id="s1298">And only one person, as my brother worked for the Germans in the hospital for infectious diseases, the Germans didn't want to put one of their doctors in for the danger, so they left there for the time being a Jew doing that work.</span> <span id="s1299">So he had the right to live outside of the ghetto, and one person with him who would take care of the things in case he isn't there.</span> <span id="s1300">So once my mother used to be there or my sister.</span> <span id="s1301">They came out in order to have a bigger piece of bread because it wasn't even allowed to put a piece of bread into the...into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1302">And...uh...he smuggled always a piece of bread in and he could risk his life that could be shot for that.</span> <span id="s1303">But so once my mother had something to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Once my mother had a little more...more bread.</span> <span id="s1305">And the children, it had to be smuggled in.</span> <span id="s1306">Then it didn't take very long and my sister was taken away under the...under the...that she will be....uh...uh...how do they call?</span> <span id="s1307">Resettled.</span> <span id="s1308">And never came back.</span> <span id="s1309">She was taken to Belzec.</span> <span id="s1310">Then one nice day, the 2nd of February, 1943, my sister was taken away Oshamaraba, 1942.</span> <span id="s1311">And then...the 2nd of February of...of 1943...uh... my mother was taken out with the last 2,000 taken to Sheparowitz not far away from Kolomier, ll kilometers as far as I know and there were already graves, mass graves prepared and she was shot and killed there.</span> <span id="s1312">When my brother came back evenings to this apartment where he had his so-called practice, Ukrainians were at the door and laughed him in his face.</span> <span id="s1313">What?</span> <span id="s1314">That's your apartment?</span> <span id="s1315">You must dream.</span> <span id="s1316">He had night service and he came in the morning.</span> <span id="s1317">And so they turned him back.</span> <span id="s1318">Few days later he heard that he should be replaced by a Polish woman doctor, should be finished up because there were only 4, 3 or 4 left of them in the whole city.</span> <span id="s1319">During the Russian occupation, he helped a Polish woman...uh...professor of a gymnasium...uh... She...her father was a rich man.</span> <span id="s1320">Had a lot of land, and her brother was a priest.</span> <span id="s1321">They were taken and never heard of them when the Russians came.</span> <span id="s1322">And she was...got out of that village in order to find work so that she wouldn't be taken without work into captivity.</span> <span id="s1323">And she came to him without knowing him, and he was the manager of the hospital under the Russians before the Germans came in, and cried before him what should she do?</span> <span id="s1324">So he asked her, "Can you be a cook?</span> <span id="s1325">We need a cook.”</span> <span id="s1326">And she start to be the cook for the hospital.</span> <span id="s1327">She never forgot that.</span> <span id="s1328">When the Germans came, she...uh...made...in her...in her apartment, they're living Italian officers.</span> <span id="s1329">One was a doctor with the same specialty, Dr.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">Rugoni, and she told him about my brother, that she heard that he is going to be replaced.</span> <span id="s1331">So he told her, "Let him come to me.”</span> <span id="s1332">And that same day, afternoon, he took all his things off from him, and went to the Italian...uh... to the Italian soldier, to the barracks of the Italians, and there he was hiding him and they...their conversation was in Latin...whatever was necessary.</span> <span id="s1333">And he said he should not talk and he should make he cannot speak, that he was for Stalingrad.</span> <span id="s1334">He will say he was Stalingrad, and came out numb and dumb.</span> <span id="s1335">Cannot hear, cannot talk, because he didn't talk Italian.</span> <span id="s1336">Smuggled him into Italy and he worked for him in Kosavecura, the doctor .</span> <span id="s1337">And from there, he started to look for me and I start look for him and through cousins in Israel, we were reunited in 1951.</span> <span id="s1338">My brother had trouble with the American doctors.</span> <span id="s1339">They said, "He probably has tuberculosis," and they kept him for 1 year back, and he was not on the German quota so I came in 1947.</span> <span id="s1340">He came in June 51 to the...to...to Chicago.</span> <span id="s1341">So we were reunited.</span> <span id="s1342">He lived with me for 20 years.</span> <span id="s1343">He wouldn't get married because of circumstances and...uh...and he...it took him 7 years again in Chicago to get a license.</span> <span id="s1344">He had to go all everything through and internship which we went through and...uh...he practiced for 10 years medicine in Chicago until...then he was retired for 1 and a half or 2 years and...uh...he had a heart condition, but that didn't kill him.</span> <span id="s1345">But he got cancer of the colon and he passed away in 1971, at the age of 73.</span> <span id="s1346">And...uh...more details about it...it is in his.</span> <span id="s1347">.</span> <span
