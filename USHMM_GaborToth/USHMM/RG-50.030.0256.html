and, uh, then the English King, Edward the VIIIth--the Duke of Windsor--lived, uh, first there, after he left England.</span> <span id="s23">In that town.</span> <span id="s24">It's a beautiful tourist, uh, town, a beautiful lake surrounded by mountains.</span> <span id="s25">And is visited by many tourists from all over the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Could you tell us a little bit about the size of your family, uh, the oldest to the youngest; and your mother and father?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: My father was, uh, born 1896 with the name of Gregor.</span> <span id="s28">And my mother, Betty--uh, born Strukl.</span> <span id="s29">And we had, uh, six children.</span> <span id="s30">I was the oldest.</span> <span id="s31">And my three brothers--uh, Greg, Christian, and Willibald--they were in the age group, uh, down to eleven years in 1939.</span> <span id="s32">And two sisters, Ida and Ann[a].</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s34">Could you tell us a little of what life, when it came to what...what your family did before 1933?</span> <span id="s35">What type of things were happening in Austria before '33, when Hitler took over in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: My parents had a little farm.</span> <span id="s37">And also my dad did some work on the road, and uh...beside the farm.</span> <span id="s38">And then great unemployment, uh, came, the Depression; and they had quite a great difficulties in keeping up with the payments for the home.</span> <span id="s39">And also the cost of living was quite high.</span> <span id="s40">So they had some difficulties, all the result from the First World War.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: That's right.</span> <span id="s42">Uh, you made mention that your father was in the First World War.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Yes, my father was a Catholic.</span> <span id="s44">He was called in the Army, and uh, was three and a half years on the Italian front, in the Isonzo.And there he got some injuries; and also over a half a 1 Serbo-Croatian and Slovenian: So_a.</span> <span id="s45">River which runs near the border between Yugoslavia (Slovenia) and Italy, in the vicinity of Gorizia and Monfalcone.</span> <span id="s46">Scene of fierce fighting during World War I.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">million men lost their lives in that part of the Dolomite Mountains.</span> <span id="s48">And when he came home he couldn't get over it, that what happened to them.</span> <span id="s49">And he discussed this with some of the war comrades.</span> <span id="s50">And also, he asked the priest why this was possible; that in the name of God, they were placing them to kill their fellow, uh, Catholics who were under the same church and same Pope.</span> <span id="s51">But he had no answer.</span> <span id="s52">And then a few years later, they...in the end...toward the end of the '20's, some Kolporteuren [Ger: door-to-door book salesmen] or missionaries of the Bible students came around.</span> <span id="s53">And they showed him from the Bible that true Christians would not take part in such a war, that they do believe in the word of Jesus that everyone who takes the sword will die by the sword.</span> <span id="s54">And the contrary, you should really love...love God and also their fellow man.</span> <span id="s55">And this really opened the eyes to my father, and he was so enthused.</span> <span id="s56">And one of the publications what they brought him was that booklet, Prosperity Sure.</span> <span id="s57">(Holding up booklet) It incidentally carries our family name, Wohlfahrt Sicher.</span> <span id="s58">And then he said that this must be made known in that area.</span> <span id="s59">And he started preaching the good news of that kingdom, what he believed in, what he prayed for.</span> <span id="s60">That through that kingdom, the problems of mankind will be solved.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s62">So then it was in that year that your father became one of Jehovah's Witnesses?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s64">And he got a assignment in, uh, vicinity for about, uh, sixty kilometers, right up to the mountains.</span> <span id="s65">You know, to call on people.</span> <span id="s66">And one of the next one what showed interest and became a Witness was, uh, a neighbor, Hans [NB: Johann] Stossier--which, uh, sister I later married, because she became one of Jehovah's Witnesses, too.</span> <span id="s67">And he helped him to preach in that big territory.</span> <span id="s68">He had sometime walk up to eight hours in one direction, because he was not able to pay the train fare to those outlying areas.</span> <span id="s69">And so a congregation was formed of about, uh, twenty-four, until, uh, Hitler came.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: So what began to happen then to your...your family, to your congregation then, in '33 to '38?</span> <span id="s71">A: In the beginning, when in Austria the dictator government was established under, uh, Dollfuss.He was then in '34 assassinated, and followed by Chancellor Schuschnigg.3 And uh, about, uh, 1936, in, uh, February, the work of Jehovah's Witnesses was banned.</span> <span id="s72">And my father was already jailed at that time under the peddling laws--peddling without a license.</span> <span id="s73">So he couldn't pay the fine; so he was then jailed for some days, just by preaching, uh, the good news.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: You mean, he was accused of peddling?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">2 Dr. Engelbert Dollfuss was the Austrian chancellor from 1932 until 1934, when he was murdered during a Nazi attempt to seize power in Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">3 Dr. Kurt Schuschnigg was the Austrian chancellor between 1934 and 1938.</span> <span id="s77">He was imprisoned in German concentration camps during the war, but survived and died at Innsbruck in 1977.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: For what reason?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: With literatures, that it was required--this was just the excuse--uh, he would need a license.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">For that reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: And then things developed, uh, uh, towards '38.</span> <span id="s84">There were quite some difficulties.</span> <span id="s85">Uh, also with this movement already, some Nazis started preparing; and there was the talk of a takeover of Austria.</span> <span id="s86">In that time, I start apprentice-time for painting; and it was even noticeable in that school.</span> <span id="s87">We were forced to obtain religious instruction.</span> <span id="s88">And when a priest came in, uh, there was some apprentice what were already over twenty before they got a job.</span> <span id="s89">And so they objected to the teaching and, uh, presence of the priest.</span> <span id="s90">And some in the background even hailed Hitler in his presence.</span> <span id="s91">He was very upset.</span> <span id="s92">And then the priest said, "What's wrong with our religion?</span> <span id="s93">You have no respect!</span> <span id="s94">Ask me questions."</span> <span id="s95">And so nobody, uh, want to ask, after, any questions.</span> <span id="s96">So I asked the priest, uh, "I would really like, uh, to have some of my questions answered, because, uh, I have some doubts about, uh, that teaching."</span> <span id="s97">And he said, "That's what I want!"</span> <span id="s98">And so I asked him for a whole hour the different questions.</span> <span id="s99">About, for example, the involvement of the war: how it was possible that in the name of the same religion they were placing the Austrians to kill the Italians.</span> <span id="s100">And, uh, he said that this was the greatest shame.</span> <span id="s101">It should never happen again.</span> <span id="s102">And at the end of that hour, he came to my desk.</span> <span id="s103">He said, "It never happened to me that anyone asked so many questions.</span> <span id="s104">And, for example, also about if the Catholic Church can really claim that they are the only true faith."</span> <span id="s105">So he said, "Believe me, I would rather have a handful Catholics what would die for their faith, but not so many millions what only on the paper."</span> <span id="s106">And then when he asked where I got this knowledge, uh, of the Bible and, uh, I was able to ask him such questions; so I explained to him that our father teach us from the Bible.</span> <span id="s107">And he said, "You are on the right road.</span> <span id="s108">Just continue."</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: So what were some of the...the pressures that you began to see from '33 to '38, when Hitler took over [in Austria]?</span> <span id="s110">What were some of the changes that were taking place in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Yes, the changes were a few months later [from] when I had that discussion.</span> <span id="s112">Uh, Hitler moved in.</span> <span id="s113">And then it became really such a, uh, uh, pressure and change.</span> <span id="s114">Uh, people were watched, uh, everything they did.</span> <span id="s115">They took account of everyone who did not salute it.</span> <span id="s116">And, for example, I had, uh, refused to answer the Hitler greeting.</span> <span id="s117">And it took...it took not too long and I was called before, uh, SA group--some of the party informations that I had refused twelve times the greetings.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: And what is that greeting?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Hail Hitler.</span> <span id="s120">And so they want to put me in the camp.</span> <span id="s121">But the master painter was avoiding, by excusing, uh, me that I should finish my training and that he needs me.</span> <span id="s122">And so I got still through without being taken to the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: You mean, other people were reporting you?</span> <span id="s124">On you, ... A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: ...that you wouldn't "Heil, Hitler"?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s127">There were, uh, papers asking me to answer with a Hitler greeting.</span> <span id="s128">But we explained to him that we never will hail a man.</span> <span id="s129">That this only belongs to our Creator, Jehovah God.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s131">So then all of this took place when you were still under twenty-one?</span> <span id="s132">A: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: And in Austria, what age is that--the age of twenty-one?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Twenty-one, when you are full responsible.</span> <span id="s135">Uh, like, uh, when you are called in the services, in the army.</span> <span id="s136">Then you are full responsible.</span> <span id="s137">But not before.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s139">OK.</span> <span id="s140">So then in the year 1938, when Hitler finally took over, what were the things that began to happen to you and to your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Yes, the first thing was that they called my father for registration.</span> <span id="s142">And in 1939 already, before the Polish War started and, uh, at that Commission, they said it was visible that my father was a invalid, partly from the First World War.</span> <span id="s143">He suffered [sublalian (ph)] arthritis; he lost all his teeth right in that time.</span> <span id="s144">And then they said, uh, he should be left alone and sent back, because he had enough from the First World War.</span> <span id="s145">But then there was some question put to him by some of the German officers.</span> <span id="s146">And he said that it would be also against his conscience as one of Jehovah's Witnesses to have anything to do with war.</span> <span id="s147">And despite that he was not eligible for war service, they kept him there.</span> <span id="s148">He was transferred in, uh, military jail.</span> <span id="s149">And there, uh, he had to wait about three months, uh, [to] be transferred from the, uh, Vienna Army jail to Berlin.</span> <span id="s150">And there he was put before the War Court, the Reichskriegsgericht [Ger: State War Court]; and there, he was sentenced with about twenty- eight other Witnesses to death.</span> <span id="s151">In the meantime, some of the town[s] people and the former mayor, uh, put up a petition; and, uh, they were signed by most of the people.</span> <span id="s152">Even some Nazis sent in letters of recommendations.</span> <span id="s153">And this was all ignored.</span> <span id="s154">And the one who had started that petition was nearly put to Dachau.</span> <span id="s155">And they warned him not to do anything like that anymore.</span> <span id="s156">There were still people favored; and they liked my father.</span> <span id="s157">In that letter was stated he was an example for the community, that he was a very loving neighbor and that he helped everyone.</span> <span id="s158">But this didn't help anything.</span> <span id="s159">They beheaded him.</span> <span id="s160">And it is really a coincidence that today is that very day.</span> <span id="s161">The 7th December of 1935 [1939]--fifty years since my father was beheaded.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: You mean, 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Yes, 1939.</span> <span id="s164">On the 7th...7th of December; that's right.</span> <span id="s165">Today [is] fifty years since that date.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Now, did you mention before that your two brothers were also there as well, in Berlin, at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: Uh, no.</span> <span id="s168">At...at that time, uh, there were some other, uh, uh, Witnesses from, uh...some from that area.</span> <span id="s169">But my...I was put uh, uh...three months later, uh, I was called up in the work services [NB: Arbeitsdienst].</span> <span id="s170">But my second oldest brother [Gregor Jr.] was, uh, called, after he became twenty-one, uh, to the air force [NB: Luftwaffe].</span> <span id="s171">And he took the stand of one of Jehovah's Witnesses; and he was sentenced to death.</span> <span id="s172">And they waited nearly five months with the execution.</span> <span id="s173">Because, uh, everyone had the chance to sign a form that he is not following anymore Jehovah's Witnesses; and also, that he breaks, uh, his oath to Jehovah God and is willing to serve Hitler.</span> <span id="s174">My father had one month time.</span> <span id="s175">And my brother--twenty- two year old brother--had two...uh, five months time; but he did not, uh, sign the paper.</span> <span id="s176">But this were ...this was very hard for him.</span> <span id="s177">I had the occasion to meet one of the barbers.</span> <span id="s178">He [the barber] was transferred from the execution chamber of uh...to our camp.</span> <span id="s179">And he was, uh, cutting his hair and shaving him.</span> <span id="s180">And he noticed that I had the same name; and he remembered that this was my brother what he was, uh, serving there in that area.</span> <span id="s181">And he said it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s182">He had, day and night, heavy chains on their arms and weights on their legs before the execution.</span> <span id="s183">Day and night.</span> <span id="s184">They only were taken off during mealtime, or when they used the toilet.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: What was the name of the camp, or the place your brother was at, before he was executed?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: This was...most were executed in Berlin--in [the] Plötzensee, where thousands were executed.</span> <span id="s187">And some were executed in Brandenburg, also in Berlin.</span> <span id="s188">And some were executed in other places; like, uh, from our congregation there were different ones.</span> <span id="s189">Uh, even some were gassed in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s191">Well, since Jehovah's Witnesses were such a small group, why was Hitler interested in killing them or destroying them?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Yes, uh, because of their firm stand that they were staying neutral and not taking part in Hitler's, uh, goal to rule the world.</span> <span id="s193">And they feared if more people would take that stand, so it would be very damaging.</span> <span id="s194">And that's why it came up, uh, even in all the churches.</span> <span id="s195">For example, Pastor Niemöllerwas saying in that connection, after the war in one of his big 4 Martin Niemöller was head of the anti-Nazi Confessing Church from 1937.</span> <span id="s196">He was interned in Sachsenhausen and Dachau--usually in solitary confinement--until liberated by the Americans in 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">gatherings, "If we had taken the stand with the Catholic Church as true Christians, Hitler could have never gone that far.</span> <span id="s198">And there's no excuse.</span> <span id="s199">Because many are saying, today, 'We were forced to take part in that war.</span> <span id="s200">We were forced by Hitler.'"</span> <span id="s201">He said--Pastor Niemöller-- "We have seen a group of Christians which were not only giving up their freedom.</span> <span id="s202">Many were giving up their lives, to keep faith alive in those dark days.</span> <span id="s203">These were Jehovah's Witnesses.</span> <span id="s204">And if they were able do it, we could have done it."</span> <span id="s205">And the same comment made even, uh, before, by Chancellor Adenauerin a letter, according to Der Spiegel.</span> <span id="s206">And Eisenhower, where he said the churches had a great responsibility in the concen...on the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s207">If they had spoken up, Hitler could have never, uh, be able to bring about these terrible things in the concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Now, why was it that they beheaded, uh, your father and brother and other Jehovah's Witnesses, instead of just shooting them?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: Yes, they did, uh, shoot only, uh, two brothers I know from Salzburg.</span> <span id="s210">But, uh, it was then changed, because they were not worth it being executed.</span> <span id="s211">This was a honorable way of execution.</span> <span id="s212">And beheading was dishonorable.</span> <span id="s213">This was the reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s215">OK, so then that's what happened to your family.</span> <span id="s216">Now, what happened to your two brothers who were young?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Yes, uh, after my second brother, uh, was, uh, executed, they took the other two, uh, younger brothers--they were about thirteen years old, one was fourteen--and the two sisters--one was, uh, also in the age of about fifteen; sixteen, the second.</span> <span id="s218">They took them away, so that she would...they would not be influenced, uh, by their mother.</span> <span id="s219">Because my mother was still raising them and teaching them in the spirit of, uh, the truth with the Bible.</span> <span id="s220">And so they tried to take them away from that influence.</span> <span id="s221">They even in a letter apologized that they have taken them away, because they know that they had a very good upbringing.</span> <span id="s222">And so the two sisters were taken to some homes, some...what were directed by nuns.</span> <span id="s223">And also, my two, uh, younger brothers were taken to the French border near Strasbourg, in the Landau.And there they were indoctrinated ...they tried to indoctrinate them with, uh, the Hitler teaching.</span> <span id="s224">There were some special instructors coming in.</span> <span id="s225">And because my little brothers refused to hail Hitler when they asked them, then they kicked them.</span> <span id="s226">Uh, one of the little brothers was once, uh, bleeding all over the face.</span> <span id="s227">Uh, they was kicked around, they landed in the gravel there behind this institutions.</span> <span id="s228">And then later, they forced them to that home defense.</span> <span id="s229">And that little brother was still shot.Uh, lost his life, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: He was shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">5 Konrad Adenauer was the Chancellor of West Germany from 1949 to 1963.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">6 Located in the Rhineland Palatinate, to the NW of Karlsruhe.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">7 This was Willibald Wohlfahrt.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s235">They were not aware that already, uh, fighting took place in that area.</span> <span id="s236">And he was shot, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s238">And how old was he at the time that he was shot?</span> <span id="s239">A: Sixteen.</span> <span id="s240">About sixteen.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Sixteen years old.</span> <span id="s242">And then what happened to your other brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: The other brother was taken down to the Russian border; and he was, uh, injured down there.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">And he was in quite bad shape during all this years, uh, kept in that home.</span> <span id="s245">And he did survive, but he died in a..</span> <span id="s246">.</span> <span id="s247">a accident later.</span> <span id="s248">But the two sisters, they...</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: What are their names now?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: This was Christian and Willie.</span> <span id="s251">And the two sisters--Anna and uh, Ida--they did survive the, uh, institutions there.</span> <span id="s252">And they were able to work on farms; but all under the supervision of, uh, that, uh, convent.</span> <span id="s253">And then, one was able to work on a other farm.</span> <span id="s254">And they survived, and they are still active Jehovah's Witnesses today.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s256">Now, let's go back to yourself, Franz.</span> <span id="s257">What happened to you, now?</span> <span id="s258">Let's...let's start with what happened to you in 1938, again.</span> <span id="s259">And maybe you can tell us what happened, the various incidents that happened to you, when you were put into jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s261">As I mentioned, we had always these difficulties from, uh, the Nazi organization.</span> <span id="s262">And we were watched.</span> <span id="s263">And, uh, I was staying at that time with...still with that master painter.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">And just occasionally, I was for a few hours able to see them and get some literatures, and get encouragement from my dad.</span> <span id="s265">And my dad always said, "Just prepare yourself."</span> <span id="s266">You know, because we didn't, uh, know, uh, all what went on.</span> <span id="s267">But he did mention that in Germany they have great difficulties, and they were informed.</span> <span id="s268">That but he didn't told us in details what really happened; but he encouraged us to be prepared.</span> <span id="s269">That the very difficults time...uh, difficult times are ahead.</span> <span id="s270">And this helped us.</span> <span id="s271">When I got after the call to the work service, after his execution, that I took the stand and refused to take part.</span> <span id="s272">Because I knew that this is just a cover-up.</span> <span id="s273">They called it "work service" but it was a real... such rough training, uh--what I mention later what incidents happened in that camp--just be prepared for the army.</span> <span id="s274">And I refused that.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: So the "work service" wasn't really a work service.</span> <span id="s276">It was preparing you for the military, you're trying to tell us?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s278">They...they were, before the war they were using that for building roads and so.</span> <span id="s279">So I thought this is nothing wrong.</span> <span id="s280">But when I was called up, the first thing they explained us: "Now we're going to use the spade instead [of] the gun.</span> <span id="s281">And we're going to make all this exercises with the gun...with that, uh, spade representing the gun.</span> <span id="s282">And then, in a few weeks when the training is over, you're going to get the real thing--a beautiful gun."</span> <span id="s283">They showed there in that, uh, compound, you know, where they had the exercises.</span> <span id="s284">And I refused then to take part also in the singing.</span> <span id="s285">They asked us to sing these, uh, Nazi songs: "And today, uh, Germany belongs to us.</span> <span id="s286">But what tomorrow, the whole world.</span> <span id="s287">And then we're going to march against England."</span> <span id="s288">And I refused it.</span> <span id="s289">And they were amazed at that, the officers.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Eespecially, some of the German officers.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: So how did they treat you then, as a result of you not doing that in front of all the troops?</span> <span id="s292">A: Yes, there was a other, uh, incident, too.</span> <span id="s293">And that evening, they gave me the last warning-- that I must be the first one tomorrow, and also dress in that uniform with the swastika.</span> <span id="s294">And so I told them ahead of time I will not take part.</span> <span id="s295">And then they told me to send my civilian clothing home.</span> <span id="s296">But during the night, I was talking to the other recruits of my stand.</span> <span id="s297">And in the morning, I had all the uniforms what we received the day before packed in a sheet.</span> <span id="s298">And then in the morning, I put my civilian clothing on.</span> <span id="s299">And they were warning me before.</span> <span id="s300">They were with me, the officers, first for hours threatening me.</span> <span id="s301">Threatening me that they're going to shoot me, and all kinds of, uh, threats.</span> <span id="s302">But in the morning, they told me I must be one of the first one in line out in the exercising grounds.</span> <span id="s303">And I didn't came out.</span> <span id="s304">And then the officer, the German officer, came in.</span> <span id="s305">And he was shocked.</span> <span id="s306">I was in civilian clothes; I had all the military stuff in that wrapped blanket.</span> <span id="s307">And he ordered me to change right away, you know, in the uniform.</span> <span id="s308">And I refused.</span> <span id="s309">I said, "I told you last night."</span> <span id="s310">And then he called for the commander, and with whom I had for hours discussions.</span> <span id="s311">And he said, "I respected that you very much.</span> <span id="s312">But you said you are willing to do work."</span> <span id="s313">And so I explained to him, "Yes, I would have worked.</span> <span id="s314">But yesterday, there was no work involved at all in the exercises.</span> <span id="s315">Only military training.</span> <span id="s316">And I told you ahead of time."</span> <span id="s317">And then he said, "Then, I understand."</span> <span id="s318">Then they had to put me in a dungeon.</span> <span id="s319">And from there, they threatened me.</span> <span id="s320">Especially these German officers.</span> <span id="s321">They didn't allow me to shave.</span> <span id="s322">They said, "If you believe in Christ Jesus, you should wear a beard."</span> <span id="s323">And made fun of me.</span> <span id="s324">And then midnight...after midnight, they came in.</span> <span id="s325">These heavy locks, you know, were moved that you just jumped up.</span> <span id="s326">I had to sleep on a board, and just got water and bread.</span> <span id="s327">And so they tried to soften [me].</span> <span id="s328">And they said, "I'm going to hit you there, that you're going to give up."</span> <span id="s329">And he was very, uh...a very rough, uh, officer.</span> <span id="s330">But I did not give in.</span> <span id="s331">The next day I supposed to, uh, go in front of all the recruits and salute the flag.</span> <span id="s332">If not, they said something terrible is going to happen to me.</span> <span id="s333">And they ...about four hundred recruits and all the officers were standing there; and I had to march by and greet that big flag in front of them.</span> <span id="s334">And so I walked by.</span> <span id="s335">And I just said, "Good day."</span> <span id="s336">And they were so mad that I had to walk back.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: You mean, you wouldn't salute the swastika.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: No.</span> <span id="s339">Because I was taken a..</span> <span id="s340">.</span> <span id="s341">Just like the three Hebrews, what, uh, supposed to bow down in front of the image of, uh, the King Nebuchadnezzar.</span> <span id="s342">So I refused that.</span> <span id="s343">And then I was put back in a dungeon.</span> <span id="s344">And those who were guarding me, they said, "We were so afraid that they going to shoot you."</span> <span id="s345">Because all evenings we are just discussing Jehovah's Witnesses and their stand.</span> <span id="s346">And they told me, "Yes, you are right.</span> <span id="s347">We...we would... We don't like to have any part in that, too.</span> <span id="s348">But where do you get this strength?</span> <span id="s349">You know, we...we just are not able to do it."</span> <span id="s350">So I explained to him that "Only through the spirit of Jehovah God, we are able to take the stand.</span> <span id="s351">We are not able from...to do anything from ourselves, because, uh, we are just like any of you--uh weak men.</span> <span id="s352">But with the spirit of God, we are able to take our stand.</span> <span id="s353">And we are not fearing death."</span> <span id="s354">And, uh, one of the soldiers said, uh...he said, "We were so amazed that you had no fear.</span> <span id="s355">That you had even a little smile on your face, when you walked by when they ordered you to salute that flag."</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Now, you...you were saying that an officer came to you and tried to force you.</span> <span id="s357">Now, he was the head of all the work camps or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Oh, yes, uh, there are different ones.</span> <span id="s359">But it was interesting, that, uh, in the meantime I watched, uh, through my dungeon.</span> <span id="s360">There was a little crack; and I could see how they were drilled, you know.</span> <span id="s361">These exercises were so hard that some of them, uh, uh, became so ill.</span> <span id="s362">Had pneumonia, some of them; and some died.</span> <span id="s363">And I witnessed myself when they were carrying them out in coffins.</span> <span id="s364">And, uh, can you imagine?</span> <span id="s365">There were two cases there what died.</span> <span id="s366">That was in the camp, uh, uh, [Dietersdorf (ph)], Arbeitsdienst Camp [Dietersdorf (ph)], uh, in Burgenland--in east, uh, Austria, close to the Hungarian border.</span> <span id="s367">And can you imagine?</span> <span id="s368">There were some, uh, high ranking officers--uh, like one of the higher ranking officers, uh, his name was, uh, Mayer--he came into my dungeon and said to me that he has a high respect for our stand.</span> <span id="s369">He said, "And I know there are even laws that you could refuse that, as conscientious objector.</span> <span id="s370">But all these laws are made...will be made, uh, invalid through new laws, what, uh, don't give you the chance to be a conscientious objector."</span> <span id="s371">And he was trying to influence me--and also some other officers--if I would run away.</span> <span id="s372">Just go over the border, so that they would save my life.</span> <span id="s373">And they even on purpose--I didn't know-- left the dungeon open during the night.</span> <span id="s374">But they honestly meant--these were Austrian officers--to save my life.</span> <span id="s375">But I told them that I would not do that, because, uh, we want, uh, to stand even if we loose the life.</span> <span id="s376">We want not to compromise.</span> <span id="s377">And also, we would have endangered our relatives--my mother.</span> <span id="s378">Also, we were planning to get married, uh, with, uh, Hans Stossier's sister.</span> <span id="s379">And they would have been taken to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s380">Because this was, uh, known all over the country: if anyone fled to another country or was hiding-- like some did, to hide from their responsibility as soldiers--all their relatives were taken to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s381">And we know personally some what were gassed there.</span> <span id="s382">Very few survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: Now, you said there was one officer in that camp that came to you particularly.</span> <span id="s384">And he was the head of all the camps.</span> <span id="s385">And he tried to pressure you in to saluting the swastika?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s387">Uh, this was, uh, closer to the end of my thirty-three days in that dungeon.</span> <span id="s388">From Berlin, uh, Doctor Mendinger.</span> <span id="s389">He was in charge of all the pre-military training of the troops; and, uh, he tried to persuade me, too.</span> <span id="s390">Uh, I was brought before him; and he said, "You are not aware what will happen to you."</span> <span id="s391">I said, "I am aware."</span> <span id="s392">"No, no!</span> <span id="s393">That's easy talk," he said.</span> <span id="s394">"You know what laws are in force now?"</span> <span id="s395">And so... And he said, uh, I should, uh, think what a big future is ahead for every young Germans.</span> <span id="s396">"We're going to rule the world.</span> <span id="s397">And you're going to be part in it.</span> <span id="s398">And you are very valuable, a valuable citizen.</span> <span id="s399">Uh, so far, we have information about you.</span> <span id="s400">And we do not want that you lose your life because just somebody has talked you in."</span> <span id="s401">I said, "No, that is my own conviction.</span> <span id="s402">And then, that we rather lay down our life for Jehovah God, for righteous principles.</span> <span id="s403">And that we don't become blood guilty."</span> <span id="s404">And he said, "No, you are not aware what, uh, lies ahead of you."</span> <span id="s405">And then I told him just a few weeks ago my father had been beheaded for similar reasons.</span> <span id="s406">Then he was shocked.</span> <span id="s407">He said then I know; he gave me still the order.</span> <span id="s408">And then he felt just exhausted.</span> <span id="s409">He was trying to convince me and [NB: to] give up my faith.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s411">So now, after the thirty-three days in this camp and in the dungeon.</span> <span id="s412">Where did they take you to next?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: I was taken then to a jail for investigation.</span> <span id="s414">And from there, I was transferred to the Gestapo in Graz--about sixty or seventy kilometres...kilometers, in the capital city of Styria [province].</span> <span id="s415">And there, I was threatened by the Gestapo men: "And, uh, then you're going to see what will happen, if you take a Führerless stand!"</span> <span id="s416">And I was charged with, uh, uh, demoralizing, you know, the spirit of the recruits--by making statements that I will never give an oath to Hitler, I will never fight for him, I will never wear the Nazi insignias and that I rather be willing to die than to serve Hitler.</span> <span id="s417">And for that reason, I was put before a special court of three judges.</span> <span id="s418">And, uh, they also, uh, assigned a lawyer what supposed to defend me; but he said, "What shall I do if you don't give up?</span> <span id="s419">You know, it will be not much use."</span> <span id="s420">And then the judges, uh, based their judgment on my uh faith.</span> <span id="s421">"And, uh, we respect your stand," uh, one of the judges said.</span> <span id="s422">"But because of the situation Germany is in, your statements before recruits is very damaging.</span> <span id="s423">And we must sentence you to five years hard labor."</span> <span id="s424">And so I was put after, uh, in one of these, uh, uh, security jails.</span> <span id="s425">I was put right beside some noted, uh, criminals.</span> <span id="s426">Murderers.</span> <span id="s427">One of, uh, other had big crimes committed; and in the middle of them I was placed.</span> <span id="s428">And the reception there was from that officer.</span> <span id="s429">He said, uh, "That is the greatest shame!</span> <span id="s430">If somebody breaks the law and doing something wrong--like, uh, stealing or even sometimes killing somebody.</span> <span id="s431">There are human weaknesses.</span> <span id="s432">But to refuse to serve our beloved Führer, that really is the greatest crime!</span> <span id="s433">And you deserve it [NB: imprisonment]."</span> <span id="s434">Then I was put in a dungeon there, again for reception.</span> <span id="s435">And dark holes; on water and bread.</span> <span id="s436">And then I was kept there for, uh, just for a while, until I was, uh, also, uh, interviewed from a professor of the Graz University, where they make studies on different cases of criminals.</span> <span id="s437">But they apologized.</span> <span id="s438">"I should not regard that this is a criminal case, but we just want to hear from you why you take that stand.</span> <span id="s439">Because we read through the papers, and it is, uh, remarked that in your faith are suicidal tendencies.</span> <span id="s440">You want to throw away your life to get so fast as possible to heaven."</span> <span id="s441">And I never made a statement.</span> <span id="s442">And so they want to find out.</span> <span id="s443">For hours, they were interviewing, me with, uh, about eight students from that university.</span> <span id="s444">And they came to the conclusion that we...that my faith is really based on the restoring of this earth to a paradise.</span> <span id="s445">That the prayer "Your kingdom come, and God's will be done"--that this is our faith.</span> <span id="s446">That we are standing with both feets on this earth; and that we never...that I never mentioned anything about, uh, going to heaven.</span> <span id="s447">I explained to him that there are some small number what have that heavenly hope, and what the Bible describes-- the 144,000.</span> <span id="s448">But before, uh, that interview was over, that professor said, "We had been asked not...at, uh, no occasion to show any of the papers to a prisoner what we interview.</span> <span id="s449">But I found here some remarks, and I just want to let you know.</span> <span id="s450">And read them yourselves."</span> <span id="s451">And can you imagine what they are told, this, uh, put under this...under...in my papers?</span> <span id="s452">A new law came out.</span> <span id="s453">Uh, they called it in Germany "Krieg state law.</span> <span id="s454">"This is a law which says if you are eligible for the army, you cannot serve that sentence.</span> <span id="s455">You have to be kept in a concentration camp, in a work camp, until the war is over.</span> <span id="s456">And then you have to serve this five-year sentence.</span> <span id="s457">And they knew already that I going be transferred in that camp.</span> <span id="s458">And that professor showed me that there were remarks [that] I am a very dangerous prisoner.</span> <span id="s459">I would try to escape.</span> <span id="s460">I would try to get in contact with out...with the outside, and do uh things against the law.</span> <span id="s461">They should be very hard on me, and they should isolate me from all other Witnesses.</span> <span id="s462">So that it would be easier to break me in my un faith than if I have association.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Can you imagine that that professor had such a confidence in me that he showed me these remarks?</span> <span id="s464">And really, uh, a few days later I noticed, uh, there was a military commission in there and looking over the prisoners.</span> <span id="s465">And that, uh, uh, official, what was...what was the head of that, uh, jail-- uh his name was uh, Hause (ph)--and he was the one who had made the remarks.</span> <span id="s466">And I was sort of put already in front of him before.</span> <span id="s467">And he said, uh, that, uh, he's going to try, you know, to break my faith and I should give up.</span> <span id="s468">And he was present when that commission of army officers and all looked us over.</span> <span id="s469">And when I was...was brought before that commission, he said, "See!</span> <span id="s470">That's the one!</span> <span id="s471">That's the one!</span> <span id="s472">That's that one, uh, Jehovah Witness, what does not want to serve!"</span> <span id="s473">And that officer just made the remark.</span> <span id="s474">You know, I was twenty years... hardly twenty years, then.</span> <span id="s475">He said, uh, "It's too bad that you still slipped through the executioner's hand.</span> <span id="s476">But we're going to make up that, if you continue that way."</span> <span id="s477">And then I was transferred from that institution, that jail, in a camp to Germany.</span> <span id="s478">He put me on that transport to that work camp Allweiter Rodgau,in Hessen-Nassau [province], where we had to work.</span> <span id="s479">And they did assign me really one of the worst jobs in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Now, this particular camp.</span> <span id="s481">Where is that found in Germany?</span> <span id="s482">Could you give us a location?</span> <span id="s483">A: Uh, that is, uh, a area between, uh, Frankfurt, uh, and, uh... Frankfurt, Darmstadt, Aschaffenburg.</span> <span id="s484">In that area.</span> <span id="s485">There was swamp land, uh, to be irrigated, and also we had to dig trenches and dig out trees.</span> <span id="s486">And also [we] cut down some of the trees.</span> <span id="s487">You know, to create, uh, some land where they planted different things to produce food.</span> <span id="s488">And there, I noticed for over three years I was standing in that swamp; and not proper...uh, very poor food, very poor clothing and, uh, shoes.</span> <span id="s489">Even when I had, uh, to testify a few years ago in Germany before historians on the Frankfurt newspapers, they found that was one of the worst treatments.</span> <span id="s490">When we came out from this swamp and had this, uh, swollen and, uh, sore feet.</span> <span id="s491">You know, spongy feet.</span> <span id="s492">We had to change in wooden Dutch clogs, without socks.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">8 This is probably a reference to the Kriegssonderstrafecht (Wartime Special Criminal Law) enacted in 1938, which authorized stiff punishments for political offenses.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">9 This was Strafgefangenenlager Rollwald, established near Dieburg (Germany) in 1937.</span> <span id="s495">Also known as Camp II of the Strafgefangenenlager Rodgau-Dieburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Just a little break, and that break in no time disappeared.</span> <span id="s497">And then we had to march four kilometers and goose-step with these big clogs.</span> <span id="s498">And this, uh, rubbed all our skin off.</span> <span id="s499">And this start inflammation, and, uh, pus developed; and literally our feet rotted away.</span> <span id="s500">When we tried to get relief, uh, in that so-called "Lazarett" [Ger: "military hospital" or "sick bay"], they just took some benzene, uh, and rubbed that sore legs that we were screaming from pain.</span> <span id="s501">Then they chased us back to work until I collapsed.</span> <span id="s502">Then one of the officers, uh, somehow, uh, he took interest in me.</span> <span id="s503">He said, "Is it really that bad?"</span> <span id="s504">And when I showed him the legs, you know, uh, he just felt sick.</span> <span id="s505">He said, "They really should do something for you."</span> <span id="s506">And he insisted that I was, uh, a time off from work, and I got some disinfecting, uh, materials.</span> <span id="s507">So that it healed up little bit.</span> <span id="s508">But I had years to deal with.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: Can we go back just to the time you were taken from that jail, to when you were first taken to this new camp?</span> <span id="s510">Uh, how did they transport you there, and what was your first day?</span> <span id="s511">And what...what happened at the very beginning?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s513">Uh, when we came uh we were transported in, uh, this, uh, cars, uh, were...uh, were little compartment just with full men.</span> <span id="s514">We had to stand in there upright.</span> <span id="s515">And they assaulted us, and we... You know, called us all kinds of names.</span> <span id="s516">And uh...and then we were, uh, transferred, first to Vienna; and from there again we were transferred to, uh, Munich.</span> <span id="s517">And in Linz, we were also transferred.</span> <span id="s518">And they wanted the publ...uh, the public to watch out for dangerous criminals that were being transported in chains.</span> <span id="s519">And then, when we did arrive at that camp, uh, they had a special reception from that camp commander, too.</span> <span id="s520">He said, uh...his name was, uh, Müller.</span> <span id="s521">He said, uh, "If you don't want to kill the English or the Frenchmen, you don't want to kill even parasite like lice or flea.</span> <span id="s522">You have to regard them as parasites.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">They have to be exterminated.</span> <span id="s524">And we going to make you to do that.</span> <span id="s525">Otherwise, you will not survive that camp."</span> <span id="s526">And on the way out, I was...I was, uh...also, we were, uh, watching how on the shoulders how some Austrians what tried to escape, how they were bitten by dogs, their faces ripped and, uh, shot at.</span> <span id="s527">They were all covered with blood, and they hardly moved there.</span> <span id="s528">This was a terrible reception.</span> <span id="s529">And we were about thirty-five men.</span> <span id="s530">And then when we had the reception for examination at the doctor in this Lazarett, one of the guards, he say that just we're transferred from the Dachau camp.</span> <span id="s531">And uh, he was the one what singled me out from all thirty-five; and he said, uh, "Why are you here?"</span> <span id="s532">And I told him, "I'm one of Jehovah's Witnesses."</span> <span id="s533">He said, "I knew that you have not committed a crime.</span> <span id="s534">But I just warn you, if you don't give up--like in Dachau and in other camps--you're going to go through the chimney."</span> <span id="s535">This was also that.</span> <span id="s536">Despite it was not, uh, such a type camp like, uh, Dachau or Mauthausen, but still they used similar methods in this camps.</span> <span id="s537">And I did not get away from that terrible job until we got a new commander.</span> <span id="s538">And all because of that remark, they must keep me also iso... isolated.</span> <span id="s539">There were different Witnesses in the branches of that camp, but I was always kept away, separated from them.</span> <span id="s540">So that we were not able to encourage each other.</span> <span id="s541">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s543">OK.</span> <span id="s544">So then, who were the other prisoners that were in that camp?</span> <span id="s545">What were some of the other groups besides [the Witnesses]?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: The majority were...like, uh, we came from Austria.</span> <span id="s547">And that interview in Germany was specially related toward testifying that we were not all criminals.</span> <span id="s548">And today the Germans, uh, claim--or some of the neo-Nazis--"They deserved being in the camp.</span> <span id="s549">They were criminals."</span> <span id="s550">And then I could testify that among this thirty-five, uh, what were transported from Austria to that camp, were all political prisoners.</span> <span id="s551">One among them was a Catholic priest.</span> <span id="s552">He was, uh, also jailed, put in a camp for listening to BBC and mentioning some of the points in his church.</span> <span id="s553">And that's why they put him in the camp.</span> <span id="s554">But there were no others.</span> <span id="s555">Uh, what there were among the other prisoners were some uh criminals with all kinds of records.</span> <span id="s556">And sometimes they used them in general, you know, to be hard on political or religious prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: Did you get a chance to talk to this Catholic priest?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Yes, I, uh, did had a chance.</span> <span id="s559">And he said, uh, "I am ashamed to be here for political reasons, because listening to the radio.</span> <span id="s560">I supposed to defend the faith.</span> <span id="s561">But you Witnesses are...uh, you are really true Christians."</span> <span id="s562">And uh, he appreciated.</span> <span id="s563">Because he had difficulties to work and get...reached a quota of, uh... We worked first in, uh, for a while in a factory, where they made some, uh, steel wire fences.</span> <span id="s564">And he got such sore fingers, and he couldn't reach that quota.</span> <span id="s565">So I was used to hard work, and I was able to do most of the job for him.</span> <span id="s566">And he appreciated that so much; where some of his brothers in the faith--uh, Catholics--said, "Now you just have to learn, to see where the bread comes from."</span> <span id="s567">But he appreciated really my help.</span> <span id="s568">And even later, in later years, when he was released already after one year, he was put back in his parish.</span> <span id="s569">And he promised me he's going to see my mother on .</span> <span id="s570">About three years later, he travelled about five hundred kilometers from eastern Austria, Styria [province], uh, to the place of my mother [and] my bride, Mary.</span> <span id="s571">And he supported, even, my mom.</span> <span id="s572">He offered her about five hundred, uh, marks, because my mother was without any support.</span> <span id="s573">And then he heard about that I am preparing to be executed.</span> <span id="s574">And he knew that already the family was so hard hit--my father, brother was executed, [and] my wife's, uh, brother.</span> <span id="s575">And also the children taken away.</span> <span id="s576">So he even wrote letters to some priests in Germany, to try to influence the commander--and even some of the Gestapo, if possible--that they would save my life.</span> <span id="s577">This was really a exception, how that priest respected Jehovah's Witnesses.</span> <span id="s578">Whereas, on the other hand, there were some, uh...according to some of the history books of Mr. Levy, there were quotations from German church papers where they encouraged, uh, Catholics, uh, to report any of the Witnesses what are still preaching to the people; so that they're going to be taken to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s579">So that priest was really a exception.</span> <span id="s580">He really respected.</span> <span id="s581">And I am still in contact with him, uh, today.</span> <span id="s582">And he just lately still thanked me for being so helpful to him in those hard days.</span> <span id="s583">And he is also reading our publications.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Well, let's stop there for just a moment.</span> <span id="s585">(Pause) [They're going to change the reels so when we resume we're going to go back to the camp again.]</span> <span id="s586">[TEXT IN PRECEDING BRACKETS NOT ON VIDEOTAPE]</span></p> <p><span id="s587">TAPE #2</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: Would you like to describe for us now a typical day of work, with, uh...what time it got started and what happened during the course of the day, evening?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s590">Uh, the most difficult, uh, time was when the winter came.</span> <span id="s591">The cold.</span> <span id="s592">The snow.</span> <span id="s593">We had to get up, uh, at least around five o'clock in the morning; and there was always a..</span> <span id="s594">.</span> <span id="s595">a rushing to get a little bit of that, uh, uh, breakfast, and then... Which consisted of a little bit black, uh, substitute coffee and, uh, some little bread; but, uh, you couldn't call it bread.</span> <span id="s596">It was really, uh... There were food what they had given us there, that kno...that came to us known for very poor food.</span> <span id="s597">There was turnips; and also some dead animals were grinded, uh, in that, uh, vegetable soup.</span> <span id="s598">And even some diseases developed from that.</span> <span id="s599">And we were sometimes covered--or for the bigger part during our camp time--with boils.</span> <span id="s600">And the odor of that food was even so bad, when some kommandos who worked in this bombed out cities that people were complaining--when some of these prisoners were transported in one of these uh, cattle cars to the jobs--that they became sick just smelling that type of food.</span> <span id="s601">So, [it] gives you some idea.</span> <span id="s602">But when you had hunger, you still had to eat something.</span> <span id="s603">And that's why we became, uh, quite weak, through that, uh, poor food.</span> <span id="s604">And some prisoners what came from Dachau, they always remarked, uh, this was a golden food--what they were getting in Dachau-- compared with ours.</span> <span id="s605">But the worst thing was in the morning, the Appell--as they called it: lining up the different working kommandos.</span> <span id="s606">And they took hours, until some were replaced what took sick or some what died, so that they had the full number through newcomers.</span> <span id="s607">And then they count...the counting.</span> <span id="s608">And in that time, they always commanded us to stand still; but when you were poorly dressed, and, uh, that wind and that snow, it was automatically that we were shivering.</span> <span id="s609">And, uh, there was really a difficult time.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: Hmm.</span> <span id="s611">OK.</span> <span id="s612">So that's how your day started.</span> <span id="s613">And from there, you went to where?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: Yes, then we were loaded on, uh...on trucks.</span> <span id="s615">On... Can you imagine?</span> <span id="s616">On open trucks.</span> <span id="s617">Some had to march to the different near working places; but some what had to work far away, they were put on trucks.</span> <span id="s618">And you know how cold they were in the winter; and we had to sit.</span> <span id="s619">And I was, uh, sometime assigned to some jobs; and it took quite a while to reach them.</span> <span id="s620">And you can imagine how hard it was on the prisoners, when they were in that, uh, open car.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s622">All right.</span> <span id="s623">So then, what did the work day consist of?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: Yah, we were digging trenches and, uh, irrigating land.</span> <span id="s625">Putting the pipes in, and then also, uh, making this, uh, big collector.</span> <span id="s626">You know, put this big collector pipes in, that are diameter of over one meter.</span> <span id="s627">And before, we had to load them on the trucks, all by hand.</span> <span id="s628">And sometimes they broke; and sometimes they nearly smashed our uh legs when they fell apart.</span> <span id="s629">You know, some were faulty in, uh, the pouring of cement.</span> <span id="s630">And so, uh, this was really under the condition that we had always wet feet.</span> <span id="s631">And then when we came home, we had no, uh, chance to dry the clothing.</span> <span id="s632">And practically, the next morning we had to dress ourselves again with the wet clothing.</span> <span id="s633">This was especially bad during the winter.</span> <span id="s634">And many got sick, and got pneumonia and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: Did you have heat in your barracks at nighttime?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: Uh, practically there was no heat.</span> <span id="s637">There was a little ovened areas; but, uh, there were some, uh, uh, poor constructed barracks.</span> <span id="s638">You know, the wind and snow blowed through.</span> <span id="s639">We were really shivering all the night through.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: And how many people were in a barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: There were about, uh, in that barrack, the average were at least one hundred.</span> <span id="s642">Q: And how many per bunk?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: Uh, we had, uh, about, uh, three in, uh...in this, uh, bunk bed.</span> <span id="s644">Q: Now, what began to happen to you as you began to work there?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s646">Uh, as I say, there was, uh, mainly assigned to this, uh, uh, uh, digging trenches and digging out trees and everything.</span> <span id="s647">And toward, uh, '43, they were...uh, there was a change.</span> <span id="s648">A new commander came; and he had, uh, occupied, uh, a new villa, and it needed painting.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">And they found out that I am a..</span> <span id="s650">.</span> <span id="s651">a tradesman.</span> <span id="s652">And so they called me out from that job.</span> <span id="s653">And I was uh able to do some work for that uh commander.</span> <span id="s654">And because of doing that work, uh, I was able, uh, to talk to him.</span> <span id="s655">And especially, uh, he was, uh, very, uh, surprised... There was no wallpaper available.</span> <span id="s656">And before, the painters just put some whitewash on; and this colored off.</span> <span id="s657">And I noticed in that camp where also experimented not only fertilizers, also from I. G. Farben, different paint materials--like, uh, latex sealers.</span> <span id="s658">And with these sealers, I imitated then wallpaper.</span> <span id="s659">And he was so surprised what, uh, I was able to do.</span> <span id="s660">There's still one of these few patterns, what I was making the rooms with.</span> <span id="s661">Uh... (Holding up samples) And this was the occasion, too, where the camp commander was, uh, asking me... They called me up for the military service, because they were short on man materials, to Africa.</span> <span id="s662">And then...</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Now, what was that year now that they called you up for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: This was, uh, the end of '43.</span> <span id="s665">And then the commander asked me what my stand is.</span> <span id="s666">And, uh, in the meantime, we... During my work, we already discussed some of our, uh, stand as Jehovah's Witnesses--about our neutrality.</span> <span id="s667">And even the wife [of] the commander made remark we really do not, uh, deserve that we are in such a place.</span> <span id="s668">And the commander said, yes, he doesn't regard me as a law-breaker--I'm just here because of my faith.</span> <span id="s669">And when I received the call, then I was preparing myself.</span> <span id="s670">Because I knew already from experience that everyone in our congregation was, uh, executed what, uh, refused, uh, the military services.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: Just to go back for a few moments, uh, to the wallpaper again-- or really, the paint.</span> <span id="s672">How did that happen to, uh...to help you with that commandant of the camp?</span> <span id="s673">That wallpaper--or that paint, I should say.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s675">Uh, when his wife came in, uh, she asked him.</span> <span id="s676">I really shouldn't... She couldn't imagine that I have done something wrong, that I, uh...why I am in there.</span> <span id="s677">And so the commander said, uh, "No, I don't regard, uh, that he has done anything wrong.</span> <span id="s678">He's just here because of that faith in Jehovah God."</span> <span id="s679">And so he was able to, uh, get a setting back of my call for six months.</span> <span id="s680">And he saved me being brought before the court in, uh, Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: You mean, all because you were able to...?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s683">And mainly... Uh, first of all, I was able to do the job not only for him; but they gave me some other job, even to high ranking government official.</span> <span id="s684">I even had to, uh, paint and, uh, repair, and restore as a wood finishing in some of the government offices in that city.</span> <span id="s685">They even, uh, put some other, uh, civilian, uh, overalls over my prisoner clothing.</span> <span id="s686">And this helped me, that I, uh, was spared from execution.</span> <span id="s687">And what I found out later, that this was all the work of that commander.</span> <span id="s688">Otherwise, I would have not survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: What was the impression that he first got when he saw that... that "wallpaper"--which he thought was wallpaper--on the walls, when he walked in with his wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: Yah, he thought that I got somewhere a wallpaper.</span> <span id="s691">But none was, uh, made, uh, during that time.</span> <span id="s692">And then he even looked how I closely, uh, joined the paper.</span> <span id="s693">He couldn't find, uh, the joints.</span> <span id="s694">So I explained him after; and then he was really amazed, and he really appreciated that type of work.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: And how about his wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: And his wife, she appreciated also.</span> <span id="s697">Because she had a lot of cleaning, uh, to do before.</span> <span id="s698">When they, uh, touched the walls, it was all over their clothing.</span> <span id="s699">There was just whitewash on.</span> <span id="s700">But this new material, latex paint, was washable and very durable.</span> <span id="s701">And then she realized, because I was so skinny.</span> <span id="s702">She disappeared and came back with a big plate of, uh, sandwiches.</span> <span id="s703">And you could see that there were still some people what had feeling and understanding for us, and they felt sorry.</span> <span id="s704">Or, sometime when we were walking to the different shops, marching, German people threw their apples and food, uh, stuff.</span> <span id="s705">But sometime the guards, you know, when they noticed that, they warned them they will take them with...uh, in the camp.</span> <span id="s706">But people were really, uh, seeing what has been done, you know, to German people, just because of their faith or their political views.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: So then, because of your ability to paint and make it look like wallpaper, it actually helped to save your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s709">That's right.</span> <span id="s710">And I had also opportunity in this experimental farms, which were designed and built after models from Jehovah's Witnesses.</span> <span id="s711">There were some very capable, uh, uh, model carpenters.</span> <span id="s712">And I had to work then in those farms.</span> <span id="s713">And there, I had the opportunity--because of orders from the commander--that I could move quite freely, and even, uh, talk to people.</span> <span id="s714">Uh, some were...uh, some lost their homes and were bombed out; and so, temporarily, they lived in that farm.</span> <span id="s715">Uh, some of the German people.</span> <span id="s716">And, uh, they asked me, uh, "How is it possible, uh, you, uh, still have a..</span> <span id="s717">.</span> <span id="s718">a..</span> <span id="s719">.</span> <span id="s720">?</span> <span id="s721">You behave so different than the others, and you have still a smile on your face--even in that misery what you are in.</span> <span id="s722">Why are you here?"</span> <span id="s723">And then I told them, "I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses."</span> <span id="s724">"What?!</span> <span id="s725">They are putting you in the camp just because of your faith?!</span> <span id="s726">What does your dad say, that...your mother, that you are in that condition?"</span> <span id="s727">I said, "Sure, it is very hard for my mother, because she lost already our father.</span> <span id="s728">He was beheaded.</span> <span id="s729">My brother was beheaded.</span> <span id="s730">And the children taken away."</span> <span id="s731">They couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s732">They start to cry.</span> <span id="s733">(Crying) They said, "What?!</span> <span id="s734">Such things are done in...in Germany?!"</span> <span id="s735">(Crying) You know, they try to... also to help me with food; or when I got this terrible dysentery and a touch of this typhoid fever, they were the ones what sent--through some guards and workers what were assigned to that camp--some charcoal tablets and, uh, uh, some medication, so that I've did survived.</span> <span id="s736">I just owe it to those people that they helped me.</span> <span id="s737">And can you imagine?</span> <span id="s738">And other thing, what I would never think of: because I told them that I have to prepare myself (pause -crying) for the execution, (crying) that it was a arrangement made... Can you imagine?</span> <span id="s739">One day, I come to work and I was comforted with my mother (crying) and Mary--my bride, my sister.</span> <span id="s740">They arranged--can you imagine?</span> <span id="s741">--that I had a special work to do in that experimental farm; and they called them from, uh, Austria, you know, that I would be able to see them before the execution.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: You mean, those people that lived there arranged this?</span> <span id="s743">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: So that you could be...?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s746">Yes.</span> <span id="s747">Can you imagine what the danger was involved?</span> <span id="s748">If they had found out, you know, they would have, uh, executed them right away, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: And so you, uh...when it came to Maria, she was able to come to see you?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: Yes, and my mother.</span> <span id="s751">And, uh, even, once, the uncle was there what was later gassed in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s753">Well, would you describe that meeting with your mother and with Maria?</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: Yah, it was just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s755">You can imagine that was also for me a great encouragement, because, uh, I was so cut off from other, uh, Witnesses.</span> <span id="s756">And, uh, my mother and Mary, they encouraged me.</span> <span id="s757">But, uh, you can imagine how we appreciated that.</span> <span id="s758">We could never forget that.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: Now, where was it you met?</span> <span id="s760">In a house?</span> <span id="s761">In a barn?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: In that, uh, in that farm house, where they were living; because ...uh, that experimental farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: Well, how was your mother and Maria able to get from Austria all the way over to this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: Yes, they were able to, uh, take the train still, you know.</span> <span id="s765">But later, this was very difficult; because they were bombed on the way.</span> <span id="s766">And again, for a number of times, uh, Mary was able to visit me; but under very great, uh, difficulties, because the bombing increased.</span> <span id="s767">And also it was the danger of, uh, of that, uh...you know, what was involved with the guards.</span> <span id="s768">If they had found out, you know.</span> <span id="s769">But I owe it just to the commander that I had that freedom without the guards, you know, uh [to] do these different jobs.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s771">You mean, the commander would permit you to go to different locations without any guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s773">That was, uh...I just owe it to him that he, uh, ordered the, uh, guards to leave me alone, despite that there were some protesting about this.</span> <span id="s774">And uh, they also, uh, toward the end of the war they tried to, to perse...prosecute him about those, uh, things.</span> <span id="s775">He was also in great danger.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: Himself?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s778">Because the guards, uh, felt, uh, that he is trying to make friends with the prisoners.</span> <span id="s779">But he really, uh, helped us in many ways, you know, to make our situation easier.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s781">All right.</span> <span id="s782">Now, as the war began to draw to a close then, how many times did he help to spare your life then?</span> <span id="s783">A total of how many times?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s785">Uh, he avoided my call, and so the execution, three times.</span> <span id="s786">The third time, he offered me civilian clothing.</span> <span id="s787">And he said to me, "Be very, very careful.</span> <span id="s788">I had, uh, great difficulties to keep you alive until this day."</span> <span id="s789">And so, he was, uh, doing everything he could, uh, what was possible.</span> <span id="s790">And he had the opportunity, you know, to hold back my call.</span> <span id="s791">And only I owe it to him that he was, uh, saving my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: Hmm.</span> <span id="s793">Very interesting.</span> <span id="s794">And at that time, how much did you weigh about at that time?</span> <span id="s795">How much did you weigh when you went in, and how much...?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: There was about at that time 150 pounds; and then I came down.</span> <span id="s797">So around, uh, 90...about uh, 88, 90 pounds.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: And you were saying that the foods that were being presented to you prisoners was experimental foods?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: Yes, they also had experimental foods.</span> <span id="s800">Uh, artificial margarine, and then artificial tomato soup.</span> <span id="s801">For example, it was such a sensation of, uh, burning that, uh, we had to drink by the quarts water after the meal.</span> <span id="s802">And also different, uh... different types of, uh, soups they produced there, they would try it on us.</span> <span id="s803">We had, for example, for days--when we had that soup--uh, uh, orange colored mouths.</span> <span id="s804">And the color didn't get away for days, when we had that soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: Was there any reaction to your body, when you took in that... that food that was prepared with chemicals?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: Yes, there's one thing I had.</span> <span id="s807">That, uh, quite a bit of stomach trouble developed.</span> <span id="s808">And we noticed, especially, toward the end when we were liberated and we got the first meal, I nearly died.</span> <span id="s809">I couldn't stand anything, and for many years.</span> <span id="s810">And even today, I have to be very careful in eating rich food or ...or certain drinks I have to avoid.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: You were saying that the potatoes they used to make with chemicals or chemical fertilizers?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: Yes, they used a lot of fertilizers.</span> <span id="s813">And they were just like an acid, you know.</span> <span id="s814">It was too much of the chemicals in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s816">Now let's go toward the end of the war now.</span> <span id="s817">And the commandant was able to keep you alive up to that point.</span> <span id="s818">What began to happen, as the American troops began to get closer?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: Yes, when the American troops came closer, also with the low flying planes they dropped leaflets over the camp and warned the guards not to harm us.</span> <span id="s820">That they are going to be brought to justice if they would, uh, do anything to us.</span> <span id="s821">Then they flew into the camp, right through the camp area.</span> <span id="s822">And they shot down the guards from the watch...from the surrounding watch towers.</span> <span id="s823">And, uh, there was quite a..</span> <span id="s824">.</span> <span id="s825">a situation, uh, through the bombing raids too, you know.</span> <span id="s826">We had to stand just in the barracks; and sometimes they were moving back and forth from the big bombings of the city and the surrounding areas.</span> <span id="s827">And also some bombs were dropped quite close to our camp.</span> <span id="s828">But we were never, uh, hit, or...or injured.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: Now, who came into the camp then to free you?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: Yes, uh, as I found out when the Americans came closer, the commander--what I found out later--uh, he got orders to defend that camp.</span> <span id="s831">Soon the Americans arrive to open fire; and they had a lot of...we were surprised how much munition and, uh, armaments they had in that camp.</span> <span id="s832">Piles of, uh, machine guns and ammunition and grenades, and all kinds of weapons.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">And the commander said, "Yes, yes."</span> <span id="s834">He will follow these orders.</span> <span id="s835">But when the Americans arrived, he put out a white flag.</span> <span id="s836">He tried to keep so many guards as possible there, so that, uh, the order was, uh, kept.</span> <span id="s837">But those who have committed crimes or murdered prisoners or tortured some, uh, they fled during the night.</span> <span id="s838">But still the bigger part of the guards, uh, stayed there.</span> <span id="s839">And we were then surrounded from all sides by General Patton's, uh, troops.</span> <span id="s840">And in that time, I was already in civilian clothing.</span> <span id="s841">And I was, uh, quite, uh, a friend of one of the Norwegian high-ranking officers from the air force.</span> <span id="s842">His name was [Videreu (ph)].</span> <span id="s843">And, uh, he was having experience with Jehovah's Witnesses in Norway already; and he said he respected us very much.</span> <span id="s844">And, uh, because he was such a high-ranking officer, they allowed him to get occasionally some parcel from the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s845">And even he shared some of the little food with us.</span> <span id="s846">And uh, he was the one what, uh, welcomed the American troops, because he spoke, uh, fluent English, German, and French.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: And they were really surprised, you know, what they found.</span> <span id="s849">Q: Now what happened to that commandant of that camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s851">When we, uh, were liberated, but they didn't let, uh, all, uh, prisoners out.</span> <span id="s852">Because there were also criminal prisoners.</span> <span id="s853">And the camp commander did not, uh, destroyed any records; so the political prisoners took care to sort them out, that only political or religious, uh, persecuted prisoners would go free.</span> <span id="s854">And so, uh, they offered me as the first one to walk out, the American, uh, officers.</span> <span id="s855">And, uh, they really couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s856">That English...uh this Norwegian officer explained them why I was in there as one of Jehovah's Witnesses, and that so many from our family were already, uh, executed, you know.</span> <span id="s857">And they couldn't believe in what state that we were in.</span> <span id="s858">And, uh, so the officer, or the commandant or the other officers, were were all jailed just in one of these barracks, and, uh, guarded by the American troops.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">And then we went straight to the American officers and testified.</span> <span id="s860">You know, about that he really tried to help us, you know.</span> <span id="s861">That he got even some extra food, and then that he avoided some of the executions and so forth.</span> <span id="s862">And in about three days, he was freed.</span> <span id="s863">But other, uh, guards and officers were brought before the courts.</span> <span id="s864">Some what were committing some crimes; but most of the dangerous ones, they all escaped.</span> <span id="s865">The majority escaped.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: Tell me, now... Now, when you got back to your home congregation, how many did you find alive?</span> <span id="s867">Or what had happened to your congregation?</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: Yes, when we came back there were twelve what were executed, gassed.</span> <span id="s869">And three still came out--survived, uh, and died after the...after having still some typhoid fever.</span> <span id="s870">But, uh, about, uh, three or four other Witnesses did survive, that they came also home quite sick, like, uh, Brother Bürger and some of my cousins.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: Now what happened with your cousin?</span> <span id="s872">Now that you got a chance to start talking to your cousin, what had he gone through and what did he tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: Yes, he was in the camp up in, uh, Flossenbürg.</span> <span id="s874">And in Flossenbürg, he was assigned to work in the crematory.</span> <span id="s875">And in a period of about three months, he had some terrible 10 Referring here to Anton Wohlfahrt.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">experiences.</span> <span id="s877">He related how Russian soldiers and officers were executed by the hundreds and hundreds.</span> <span id="s878">How they were begging, you know, to consider their families--their...their parents and, you know, wife and children.</span> <span id="s879">But they mercilessly killed them.</span> <span id="s880">Then, what was one of the worst things, uh, uh, Polish girls what became pregnant with Germans-- before they delivered, you know, and in the stage of nine months pregnancy--they made all kinds of experiments with them.</span> <span id="s881">And then they screamed at my cousin.</span> <span id="s882">In five minutes, he must clean up, you know, the operating tables for the next one.</span> <span id="s883">And he just couldn't see it.</span> <span id="s884">And Jewish girls, they made all kinds of, uh, operations.</span> <span id="s885">One...one writer of a book about this came, said, uh, it was just terrible.</span> <span id="s886">There were also eye-witnesses of, uh, this, uh, experimenting.</span> <span id="s887">And he said that only through the Bible students, Jehovah's Witnesses--who were assigned, you know, to burn the prisoners--that they could get some information what a mass murder, killing and experimenting went on.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: What did you cousin tell you as to the experiments?</span> <span id="s889">What...what type of experiments on the Polish and Jewish girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: Yah, they were making all kinds of experiments on...during the delivery of a child.</span> <span id="s891">And also, they were experimenting on different diseases;

and, you know, burn him too.</span> <span id="s900">Because, uh, he just couldn't stand it.</span> <span id="s901">Then they threatened him, that they're going to kill him if he refuses to do that work.</span> <span id="s902">And he did refuse.</span> <span id="s903">But he was then assigned to a Kommando.</span> <span id="s904">But he was still, uh, surviving; but he died after on typhoid fever.</span> <span id="s905">He also was a witness of that execution of that well-known Admiral Canaris,who was the chief of the German Secret Service.</span> <span id="s906">He was very badly beaten and tortured.</span> <span id="s907">Also others testified along that line, that he [NB: Anton Wohlfahrt] was an eye-witness of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: At this time now, you found out what happened to your uncle, as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: Yes, also in that, uh, period, uh, my uncle--who was a war veteran from the First World War, and, uh, was on the Russian front, lost one eye there and was kept for six years in Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">And he came back; he survived.</span> <span id="s911">And, uh, got married and raised a family.</span> <span id="s912">And his three boys--minor boys--and, uh, even the girl, was taken in a concentration camp, because of, uh, stand as Jehovah's Witnesses--also in connection with that "work service."</span> <span id="s913">And when he visit...tried to visit them, uh, they kept the father there, too--the Gestapo--and put him in the same camp.</span> <span id="s914">And told him he is responsible, that he didn't raise them in the spirit of Nazism.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">11 Admiral Wilhelm Canaris was head of the intelligence and espionage section of the Reich War Ministry (later the Abwehr Foreign Office of the Wehrmacht High Command) from January 1935 until July 23, 1944, when he was arrested for suspected complicity in the plot to assassinate Hitler.</span> <span id="s916">Canaris was sentenced by an SS court and hanged at Flossenbürg shortly before liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">And then, it happened because he was a invalid and older already, they ordered him to pack his belongings.</span> <span id="s918">And before his three boys, he was led to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s919">And you can imagine how they felt?</span> <span id="s920">(Crying) He was also a very loving father.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: And in what year did that take place then, that you found out?</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: This was about '44.</span> <span id="s923">1944.</span> <span id="s924">And to cover up the whole affair, they sent a condolence telegram- -the SS commander of Auschwitz--to my aunt.</span> <span id="s925">Who was also, uh, quite ill; and later she was also in the Gestapo jail, and took so serious ill and had no treatment.</span> <span id="s926">And she died, too.</span> <span id="s927">But just shortly before, you know, they sent here even a telegram: that they did everything, uh, for her husband, but his, uh, uh, stomach ulcer got so bad that he died.</span> <span id="s928">And that...that was the cause; and if she wanted to have his, uh, ashes sent.</span> <span id="s929">Just to cover up, you know, what they had really done.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: So then, now after the war and after you were freed, you went back home.</span> <span id="s931">And, well, what did you find at home?</span> <span id="s932">What were the conditions like at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: Yes, uh, you can imagine how many did not came back anymore.</span> <span id="s934">But, uh, those of the Witnesses what did survived, even in that state we were so glad that we did not, uh, compromise.</span> <span id="s935">And that anything, even the difficult life whatever--there's not much food around and all kinds of difficulties.</span> <span id="s936">But it was nothing, compared what we went through.</span> <span id="s937">And that we never regretted that we had, uh, spent such years in the concentration camp, or that so many died.</span> <span id="s938">Because we knew ahead of time.</span> <span id="s939">Even Jesus said when we will follow his example that we will have to expect persecution.</span> <span id="s940">The same when they persecuted him, they will persecute you also.</span> <span id="s941">And how true it really became, and how glad we were that we did not took the sword.</span> <span id="s942">Like Jesus said, "All those who take the sword will die by the sword."</span> <span id="s943">And that no problems in this world can be solved just by force.</span> <span id="s944">Even the former President, uh, Eisenhower, who was also so shocked liberating us; he made a comment in his last book that Jehovah's Witnesses are really true conscientious objectors.</span> <span id="s945">That he, as a military man, accept us; and that Jehovah's Witnesses never tried to solve problems by force, but all with love.</span> <span id="s946">And that is what we really firmly believe.</span> <span id="s947">That only through God's kingdom, the Creator will really bring about the restoration of all things, the earth to paradise.</span> <span id="s948">And where all this wickedness what went on in this concentration camps, and what still goes on all over the world, that this will come to an end--like, uh, Psalms 37, 10 and 11 shows that, uh, you will look around and the wicked one will be no more.</span> <span id="s949">But those who really trust in Jehovah God, the humble ones will possess this earth, and will really enjoy then happiness and peace.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s951">Now you have a Bible there that was sent back from one of the concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Would you like to tell us about that Bible?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: Yes, this Bible was, uh, sent back after my brother-in-law was executed in the Sachsenhausen camp.</span> <span id="s954">And uh, you can see it is quite worn out and beaten.</span> <span id="s955">Sometimes it was even in some water.</span> <span id="s956">But this was the miracle, that we were able to keep it what had given them strength through these difficult days.</span> <span id="s957">And, uh, we would like to donate that Bible, uh, to the Holocaust Museum, as a proof that God's word has helped and strengthened those who were really bearing witness for the great God, Jehovah, during these difficult times.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s959">We'd like to thank you very much for your experience and your expressions.</span> <span id="s960">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s961">DOCUMENTS AND ARTIFACTS This is the our Bible what was used by my brother-in-law, [Johann] Hans Stossier, in the Sachenhausen camp.</span> <span id="s962">And, uh, he used it already before, in different other camps--like, uh, Dachau, Neuengamme, Oranienburg.</span> <span id="s963">And this helped them to be encouraged, through the reading and studying of God's word.</span> <span id="s964">And, uh, this was after the execution sent back to, uh, his older parents.</span> <span id="s965">And we want to donate this to the Holocaust Museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">(a) This is a..</span> <span id="s967">.</span> <span id="s968">This is a imitation of wallpaper with, uh, design rollers and, uh, latex paint.</span> <span id="s969">This is just a more simple imitation, but sometimes it was done in four or five colors and very different designs.</span> <span id="s970">Some looked like materials.</span> <span id="s971">(b) And this is another one, also along that line.</span> <span id="s972">And this helped me to survive when I did the work for that camp commander.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">[Wall plaque, made of wood and painted.]</span> <span id="s974">This is a Bible verse from Proverbs, the third chapter, [verses] 5 and 6.</span> <span id="s975">And this I made, to send it through one of the workers and guards in that camp [to my family].</span> <span id="s976">That was in the time where I was waiting for the execution, and just to give my family encouragement.</span> <span id="s977">And it did came out, and they received it.</span> <span id="s978">And I still was in possession until today.</span> <span id="s979">And it is a reminder how really God's word has strengthened us under those most difficult days.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">And this is the only notification of the execution of my father to my mother.</span> <span id="s981">She never received any letters, or any proofs that my father had committed anything against the law, or that he was sentenced to death.</span> <span id="s982">And we inquired just lately, at that very place where he was executed, for some information; and there are no more records.</span> <span id="s983">They all disappeared.</span> <span id="s984">And this is still a living proof that this type of persecution and Holocaust really happened.</span> <span id="s985">And it is unbelievable that today many are having doubts about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: Would you please translate the notice for us, and the date on there?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: The notice says, "To, uh, Mrs. Gregor Wohlfahrt, Barbara born Strukl, in St. Martin-am- Techelsberg.</span> <span id="s988">The death sentence against your husband, Gregor Wohlfahrt, from the 8th of November, 1939, has been carried out this morning, December the 7th...7th December of 1939.</span> <span id="s989">From the Oberreichskriegsanwalt."</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: We'd like to thank you very much for your time and your experiences.</span> <span id="s991">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s992">And you're welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: OK.</span></p></body></html>
