was eight years old, about eight years, then was there a few older older young young young bochurim, young young people, and they were learning in the shul underground.</span> <span id="s192">Because the the yeshiva was already closed.</span> <span id="s193">It was after '27 Lubavitcha Rebbe was chased out from RussiA: He was arrested and this, and all yeshivas were closed.</span> <span id="s194">No no yeshivas.</span> <span id="s195">But two, three bochurim here, two, three young people here.</span> <span id="s196">And when they were in our town, Verones, you learned with me.</span> <span id="s197">You learned with me.</span> <span id="s198">Then my father was a bisel free from this work.</span> <span id="s199">And it was then three bochurim and a and two younger one, five, ten, and they were changing.</span> <span id="s200">And one month somebody learned with me, the other month another one.</span> <span id="s201">And it was going till I was 12 years old.</span> <span id="s202">But 12 years old it was already impossible, because we were not not going in the public schools and everybody, why the kids are not going in public school?</span> <span id="s203">It was very, very dangerous.</span> <span id="s204">If the if the the government would would know.</span> <span id="s205">You don't want to to learn your kids communism with all these things?</span> <span id="s206">So I I my my parents sent me out from my house.</span> <span id="s207">My sister, they sent her to my grandmother in Ukraine somewhere.</span> <span id="s208">Then that when somebody come,

moment, when did you first hear of the Nazis and the invasion that was to occur June 22nd, 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: The Naz the Nazis with the Russia were always the biggest enemies.</span> <span id="s225">You know?</span> <span id="s226">The the the Fascism, they called it, the Fascist.</span> <span id="s227">I don't know exactly what is the real word for Fascist.</span>

Germans because because they knew in this time it was all the people they knew from World War I. And then it was very good with the with the with the Deutsch, with the Na with the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">So it it can't be worse.</span> <span id="s231">Can't be worse than we are now

years, where that's one year, one year, three years and that's, you know</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Something that you said in one of our earlier talks, Mr. Wilschanski, really impressed me.</span> <span id="s404">That with the German invasion, and given this entire description that you are explaining, under Soviet rule, that when the Germans invaded, you mentioned to me that persecution, religious persecution, actually went down.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: I wonder if you could just elaborate on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: When you're saying that when the you mentioned to me when the Germans invaded, religious persecution actually diminished.</span> <span id="s409">It went down.</span> <span id="s410">I wonder if you could just speak to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: Yeah, because the government was occupied with the with the war.</span> <span id="s412">And they didn't look so much.</span> <span id="s413">First of all, the job was already very much done.</span> <span id="s414">Second of all, very very, very many, even religious people, Yiddin, were in the front, on the on the on the nu but the first lines of the of the war, and this.</span> <span id="s415">It didn't look like this in in another in another in another side of Russia, in Sommercant (ph).</span> <span id="s416">In that is in Azerbaijan, Asian.</span> <span id="s417">Then, because it was a bisel much better, the yeshiva was already a yeshivA: It was their cheder.</span> <span id="s418">It was das.</span> <span id="s419">Okay, it wasn't it wasn't official.</span> <span id="s420">But, they it was already 70, 80 students, little students, das.</span> <span id="s421">But it was much, much better.</span> <span id="s422">And one of the of the the reasons was because then, in these times, they made a pact with with Poland.</span> <span id="s423">And a lot, a lot, a lot of Polish Jews were in Siberian, in the in the time of the of the war.</span> <span id="s424">And then Russia made a a a a a contact with Poland to send out to much people is arrested arrested there in Siberian, tens and hundreds of thousands of Yiddin didn't come back.</span> <span id="s425">When they come back, they came where they came?</span> <span id="s426">They're in Asian and in a and in a and in a in a Georgia, in these places.</span> <span id="s427">And thousands, thousands, thousands, thousands of Yiddin was come from SiberiA: Nu, and they got with a contract with das and the Yiddin, the Polisha Yiddin, and they started to rebuild a little bit, to rebuild their life.</span> <span id="s428">So the government didn't look at them.</span> <span id="s429">Later, a little bit, when it was the the after after after the war, it started again.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s431">But during during</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: I wasn't there already.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: But during the period of the war, it seems that you were with with a group of boys in this underground yeshiva and moving around.</span> <span id="s434">And

remember, for example, something that placed you in a certain situation, where your education, where your religious beliefs, that helped you make a decision to go one way or to go another way; something that I would you were so you were you were in such an independent situation and you had to rely on your upbringing and you had to rely on your religious beliefs to make decisions for yourself.</span> <span id="s543">Is there one particular thing that stands out in your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: I'll tell you, it wasn't about any thought in these things.</span> <span

when they will go down, but to hold the religion we you have to go till the last the last drop of blood.</span> <span id="s555">Okay?</span> <span id="s556">And that was we know.</span> <span id="s557">We didn't know every everything, how it will be we didn't know.</span> <span id="s558">But every every time we gave him something, may HaShem help us, to see the Rebbe, to go in his ways, to do what he wants from us.</span> <span id="s559">And that's the the the general goal of the of the diasporA: That holds us, the diaspora, for thousands of years, not only in in in our little
