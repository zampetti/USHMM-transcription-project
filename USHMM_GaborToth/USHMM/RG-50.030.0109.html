And later, when they couldn't work no more because the Russians closed in, so they took us in there to the other camp, and got us away from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: You said in '43 that things changed.</span> <span id="s380">What camp were you in then?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: In '43, I was in Markstädt.</span> <span id="s382">Then they came and they took us to Fünfteichen.And there where they took us...you see, 'til then we were wearing uh civil clothes, you know.</span> <span id="s383">And then they took the old clothes; we had to take off, and they gave us them stripey clothes.</span> <span id="s384">Took us- -that was not far away from Markstädt--they took us in this camp.</span> <span id="s385">And that was already you know, electric wires.</span> <span id="s386">Them other camps were just, you know, the barbed wire.</span> <span id="s387">Over there, that was already the barbed wire with electric wires on it, you see.</span> <span id="s388">You couldn't get close to it.</span> <span id="s389">You'd just touch it and that was... And many people did commit.</span> <span id="s390">They jumped and they throw themselves on there, because they couldn't take it.</span> <span id="s391">I mean, it wasn't things... They'd throw themselves on the wires just to get it over with, you see.</span> <span id="s392">But I just don't know.</span> <span id="s393">Now I'm just thinking...

And then we hitch-hiked, you know, 'til we got to the border Poland.</span> <span id="s630">And I've seen some Jewish boy coming back.</span> <span id="s631">And I say, "What happened?"</span> <span id="s632">They say, "The Poles trying to take on to the Army."</span> <span id="s633">I say, "Oh, no.</span> <span id="s634">I never liked them before, and I don't like them now.</span> <span id="s635">So I'm staying right here where I am."</span> <span id="s636">Stayed in Germany.</span> <span id="s637">Didn't...didn't go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s638">Because I knew my whole family is gone, so I didn't have nothing to look for over there.</span> <span id="s639">So...and I wasn't ready to go to the Polish Army after the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s640">(Laughter) So I just stayed there in Germany; and then I stayed in a little town there in Germany, not far from one of them camps--Pölitz--what I was.</span> <span id="s641">So I went over there a few times to look at it after.</span> <span id="s642">And then I went to Berlin, met my wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Tell us about that.</span> <span id="s644">How did that happen?</span> <span id="s645">How did you get to go to Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: To Berlin?</span> <span id="s647">Because Berlin was the big city and I was young, you know.</span> <span id="s648">So I went over there, you know; and through somebody, I stayed with some people there in Berlin.</span> <span id="s649">And in the same house, two sisters were living there.</span> <span id="s650">They were in the concentration camp, too.</span> <span id="s651">So we start talking.</span> <span id="s652">So...and they knew, they were think... I think they knew my wife, that she was... And they introduced me to her.</span> <span id="s653">Again, so that...so we went together and then we got married.</span> <span id="s654">We had one child.</span> <span id="s655">Born in 1949.</span> <span id="s656">I mean, we were in East Germany; and from East Germany you couldn't go nowhere out to other country, except Israel.</span> <span id="s657">You see, I couldn't get no visa to America.</span> <span id="s658">None of the western countries.</span> <span id="s659">Only to Israel I could.</span> <span id="s660">So we went to Israel.</span> <span id="s661">But the climate wasn't good for my wife.</span> <span id="s662">She was sick all the time.</span> <span id="s663">So we had to look for a way out.</span> <span id="s664">It was kind of hard, but we got out.</span> <span id="s665">We went to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s666">From Switzerland, we went through the border, you know, to Germany...back to Germany.</span> <span id="s667">And then I find out my cousin is here in America.</span> <span id="s668">And he sent me the visa.</span> <span id="s669">And in '55 I came here, to Atlanta.</span> <span id="s670">And there I am since.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: Is there anything more you want to tell us about the camps or about your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: I think the most...the main thing is, you see another beating, another beating... It's...it's aren't things too much, all things.</span> <span id="s673">If you have to count all them beatings... I mean, it's like one time I felt my foot right here underneath had a sore; and it had gotten to be bigger and bigger.</span> <span id="s674">It had gotten so big I could put my finger in there.</span> <span id="s675">And I were limping.</span> <span id="s676">I couldn't walk; but I was scared to go to the doctor.</span> <span id="s677">So because I knew when I go... if you go in there, they make you disabled.</span> <span id="s678">And then you're disabled for good, you see.</span> <span id="s679">So I just held on, you know, to some friends when we went to work.</span> <span id="s680">You know, walking.</span> <span id="s681">Did the best I could.</span> <span id="s682">I mean, trying to hold on.</span> <span id="s683">And then it just start healing, so it was alright.</span> <span id="s684">Just luck, I don't know.</span> <span id="s685">It's just sheer luck.</span> <span id="s686">Like I say, some people got nine lives, and I'm the one of them.</span> <span id="s687">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: You've described a lot of beatings.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s690">I mean, there wasn't one came out without.</span> <span id="s691">I mean, for any little thing.</span> <span id="s692">If you moved your head wrong, if you turned wrong, you know, they went over.</span> <span id="s693">Because they walked around with billy-clubs.</span> <span id="s694">You see, they enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s695">And sometime if you did something wrong, they took you in the washroom--two of them.</span> <span id="s696">And the water were running; and they were beating on you 'til they carry you out.</span> <span id="s697">Lucky it didn't happen this incident to me.</span> <span id="s698">Because when they took you in the...in the washroom, you know, to beat, then that was it.</span> <span id="s699">They enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s700">So it's...it's... I don't know.</span> <span id="s701">I look back, I myself I couldn't believe that I am out after all this.</span> <span id="s702">(Pause)</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: By the time you got to Belsen, you had been through an awful lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s705">Belsen was already close...close to the end, you see.</span> <span id="s706">It was close to the end of Belsen.</span> <span id="s707">I mean, there... I mean, we couldn't...couldn't stay any longer, just a few days.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Because there was an extermination lager camp.</span> <span id="s709">Because it's all...when you looked around, that's all you seen.</span> <span id="s710">Mountains of things; and bulldozers, you know, digging and just pushed them in.</span> <span id="s711">That's all you've seen over there, you see.</span> <span id="s712">Because they couldn't ship to Auschwitz, because Auschwitz was already was going twenty-four hours a day.</span> <span id="s713">You know, the ovens were burning twenty-four hours a day.</span> <span id="s714">So whatever they could, they burned.</span> <span id="s715">But the others, they buried, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: Did you go through a selection when you arrived at Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: In Bel...no.</span> <span id="s718">No, no.</span> <span id="s719">This whole group we came, they just put in one thing.</span> <span id="s720">Just 'cause we were supposed to be shipped out, you know.</span> <span id="s721">So after few days, they shipped.</span> <span id="s722">(Pause) Because I don't think, I'm not sure but I don't even think that in Belsen they were working.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">There was just working in the camp, you know.</span> <span id="s724">People were put there.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: What else do you want to tell us about the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: I think I told all I could.</span> <span id="s727">Main...main...main things.</span> <span id="s728">And so...it's rough, rough, and rough.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">That's all.</span> <span id="s730">Because then...because every time when they shipped a transport from one camp to the other, so many they shipped was always just... Arrived less and less from every transport, you know.</span> <span id="s731">Because right away, they picked out...you know, if they see you weak, you couldn't work.</span> <span id="s732">And so they just put them in the side.</span> <span id="s733">Since they always picked out the most looked a little healthy, you know, able to work.</span> <span id="s734">And so they picked them out and put them to work; and the one who couldn't work, was no use for them.</span> <span id="s735">(Pause)</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: When you were in the labor camps, sub-camps, did you know what was going on at Gross Rosen?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: We heard.</span> <span id="s738">We heard, you see.</span> <span id="s739">We heard; because always came in some people from one camp to the other, you know.</span> <span id="s740">So we heard what was going on in the war.</span> <span id="s741">We knew everything from the...from Auschwitz, from Dachau.</span> <span id="s742">We heard; because they switched around, you know.</span> <span id="s743">They took from one camp, shift over here; you know, from here over there.</span> <span id="s744">So we knew everything.</span> <span id="s745">I mean, we didn't hear no news or no papers we had; but from the people coming in, you know, we...we heard all the things what was going on.</span> <span id="s746">That's the only thing we knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: At the end, when you left your last camp and you started on the march... A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: You were marching for how long?</span> <span id="s749">A: Three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: Three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: Three days.</span> <span id="s752">The third day, in the afternoon, the... I mean, the third day we seen already some of them SS went in the woods, you know.</span> <span id="s753">We could see they throwing their clothes off, putting some civilian clothes on.</span> <span id="s754">So we just ...late in the afternoon, we just disappeared then in the woods.</span> <span id="s755">Because we already seen what was going on, that they disappearing; so we was afraid if we not going to run and hide that they...some of them might kill us, you know, for evidence.</span> <span id="s756">Not to leave them evidence.</span> <span id="s757">So...but we went in; and at night it happened.</span> <span id="s758">In the morning, we had the Russians there.</span> <span id="s759">Because it...that was the only thing they would tell us.</span> <span id="s760">They were telling us all the time, "No matter we win or loose, we kill you all.</span> <span id="s761">And none of you will be alive."</span> <span id="s762">This...this...this song you heard every day from them.</span> <span id="s763">Yeah, but it changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: So...thank you very much.</span> <span id="s765">A: You're welcome.</span></p></body></html>
