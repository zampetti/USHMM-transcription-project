Snyderman, with Margaret Witkovsky (Sergey, you were born in Moscow in 1965.</span> <span id="s14">Can you tell me your earliest memories?)</span> <span id="s15">My earliest memories?</span> <span id="s16">(Who lived with you at that time?)</span> <span id="s17">My earliest memories go back to the time when I lived with my parents and my grandparents from my mother's side in their communal apartment in the center of Moscow.</span> <span id="s18">Then my grandparents were both alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">(What does communal apartment mean?)</span> <span id="s20">A communal apartment is where several families share the same apartment.</span> <span id="s21">Each of them have a room or two, but they have a common kitchen, bathroom, hall, if there is one.</span> <span id="s22">It's like living with roommates at the university with the only exception that you do not choose your roommates and you're assigned and registered at this address.</span> <span id="s23">There's nothing depending on you.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">(You can't change that apartment if you want to without government permission, is that right?)</span> <span id="s25">You cannot simply change it.</span> <span id="s26">You can swap it with somebody.</span> <span id="s27">If you both agree, you can file with the local authorities for their approval it's up to them and if they approve this exchange, you can change it.</span> <span id="s28">But usually it's subject to some heavy official regulations.</span> <span id="s29">There's a great deal of bureaucracy involved in this.</span> <span id="s30">Also, what I try to stress is that living in these communal apartments is common cultural heritage for residents of big cities.</span> <span id="s31">These communal apartments are a part of many people's background and culture.</span> <span id="s32">They can easily recall the atmosphere.</span> <span id="s33">Sometimes you get good neighbors, roommates, sometimes the roommates are extremely bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">(What is your recollection?</span> <span id="s35">How was it when you were little?)</span> <span id="s36">My grandparents had very warm and good relations with another family that lived in the same apartment.</span> <span id="s37">So I cannot say anything wrong.</span> <span id="s38">I cannot complain about them.</span> <span id="s39">But I also know that in the apartment where my father lived before he got married to my mom, there were several nasty people who were able to do a lot of bad things.</span> <span id="s40">There is a saying in Russian that an argument is on the level of that in a communal kitchen.</span> <span id="s41">So when you are spitting in someone else's soup, or [laughs]... (Oh, people really did things as bad as that?)</span> <span id="s42">Yeah!</span> <span id="s43">This is the level of what is called a communal kitchen argument.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">(What family stories do you remember hearing as a child?)</span> <span id="s45">I heard a great deal of family stories.</span> <span id="s46">My grandmom lived a very interesting life.</span> <span id="s47">She liked to tell stories.</span> <span id="s48">For instance, about how she was saved on several occasions when she was on the brink of death.</span> <span id="s49">For example, my grandfather worked in an airplane design bureau and he participated in the design of a big passenger airplane of that time, the middle '30s.</span> <span id="s50">That airplane was considered a big achievement for Soviet industry.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">(Do you know what plane it was?)</span> <span id="s52">It was called the 'Maxim Gorky'.</span> <span id="s53">It had seven engines, one of the biggest passenger airplanes of that time.</span> <span id="s54">There was only one machine actually built, and it was about to make an air cruise for the people in this design bureau and their families.</span> <span id="s55">The tickets were distributed.</span> <span id="s56">(Like a maiden voyage?)</span> <span id="s57">Yes.</span> <span id="s58">And a lot of people got those tickets.</span> <span id="s59">But my grandfather didn't.</span> <span id="s60">Either he was so lazy or he just didn't ask for them at the proper time and there was an argument at home and my grandmother was complaining to him that he's so slow and lazy, and he didn't manage to get her the tickets for this air show, and they would not be able to attend this maiden flight, as you say.</span> <span id="s61">It was a really big show on the outskirts of Moscow.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">This huge airplane took off and flew and was surrounded by small airplanes that escorted it in the air.</span> <span id="s63">One of those small airplanes came too close and hit the big one and it crashed, and all the people aboard died.</span> <span id="s64">On a big Moscow cemetery there is a huge memorial plaque with a picture of this airplane and the names of people who died in this crash.</span> <span id="s65">There were like fifty people aboard.</span> <span id="s66">It was in the mid '30s, and fifty people aboard was a big number.</span> <span id="s67">So this was one of the stories my grandmother told me, about how she was miraculously saved.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">(So she entertained you when you were small with stories?)</span> <span id="s69">Yeah.</span> <span id="s70">(Do you get a sense of what the family history was from the stories you grandmother told you?</span> <span id="s71">Sometimes the children don't listen to their parents' stories, but the grandchildren are fascinated, and you might have a different sense of the family history than your mother would...) Well, the family history is different from my father's side and my mother's side.</span> <span id="s72">And from my father's side, we have a wonderful man, my father's uncle, he's more than ninety years old, and he's strong, healthy, I hope...</span></p> <p><span id="s73">(Where is he living?)</span> <span id="s74">He's living in Moscow right now, and he's very religious.</span> <span id="s75">He attends synagogue almost every day.</span> <span id="s76">He's like a patriarch.</span> <span id="s77">He's the keeper of our family traditions.</span> <span id="s78">It is he who tries to bring the whole family together on different occasions.</span> <span id="s79">(What is his name?)</span> <span id="s80">His name is Samuil.</span> <span id="s81">His last name is Libenzon.</span> <span id="s82">That's my father's mother's maiden name.</span> <span id="s83">He and his sisters have different spelling of their name.</span> <span id="s84">They were registered, they got their papers in the '20s or '30s and it often happened that brothers got different spellings of their names on their papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">(So he kept the family together...) He kept the family together... (Would you say he imparted the religious feeling to your father...) No, the religious tradition broke entirely.</span> <span id="s86">At the generation of my father there was no passage of religious traditions from my grandparents to my parents.</span> <span id="s87">It might be that my dad told you the story about his parents speaking Yiddish at home, and his older brother shouting at them, telling them to stop, because it was the time of this rampant antisemitism in the Soviet Union after the second World War.</span> <span id="s88">It lasted into the terrible years '48 to '53.</span> <span id="s89">And so when the parents tried to speak Yiddish, my father's brother shouted at them, "Stop, you shouldn't do this!</span> <span id="s90">You have to forget it if you're going to survive!</span> <span id="s91">So stop speaking in the presence of Gennady!</span> <span id="s92">He's young and he can go out and tell that his parents speak Yiddish on the street and he'll bring harm upon us."</span> <span id="s93">So there was no religious traditions, no culture, almost no national feeling.</span> <span id="s94">It was all suppressed in the 1940's and early '50s.</span> <span id="s95">So my parents had to start again in the '80s.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">(Tell me when you became aware that you were Jewish?</span> <span id="s97">What effect did that have on you?)</span> <span id="s98">I was in kindergarten and kids were mocking and teasing one another.</span> <span id="s99">They were calling each other zhid.</span> <span id="s100">I'm sure you know this word.</span> <span id="s101">And I was participating in all of this and I didn't know what it meant.</span> <span id="s102">When my mom heard me telling to someone, "You are a dirty zhid," she was astonished and at home she explained to me that I should never ever call anyone by this name because we are Jews ourselves and this is a dirty word that is used to call us.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">For a long time I could not quite understand that we are different from other people.</span> <span id="s104">Because indeed we weren't different.</span> <span id="s105">We were the same.</span> <span id="s106">We didn't observe any traditions.</span> <span id="s107">We didn't observe Jewish holidays, at least as far as I know.</span> <span id="s108">Maybe my parents knew, but I didn't know any.</span> <span id="s109">The only thing that distinguished us from the rest of the population was the fifth line in our internal passports.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">(You didn't get to bring your internal passport with you, did you?)</span> <span id="s111">No, it's impossible.</span> <span id="s112">(You have to turn it in...) Yes, I had to turn it in, in order to receive my exit visa.</span> <span id="s113">(How old were you in kindergarten?)</span> <span id="s114">Five, six years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">(At home did you have responsibilities.</span> <span id="s116">For five years you were the only child at home, so maybe you were the baby the first five years.</span> <span id="s117">But after your brother was born, did you have any responsibilities?</span> <span id="s118">Or were you just supposed to concentrate on your studies?)</span> <span id="s119">Honestly, I don't think that I had any special responsibilities at home.</span> <span id="s120">We had a very supportive environment and we were all supporting and helping each other, but there was no sharing of responsibilities.</span> <span id="s121">My mom didn't work for some time after my brother Vladimir was born.</span> <span id="s122">And also my grandmother, who lived separately, visited us almost every day to help us with housekeeping.</span> <span id="s123">She did shopping and she kept the house...</span></p> <p><span id="s124">(So your mother's mother and your father's mother helped out with the family, or just your mother's mother?)</span> <span id="s125">No, just my mother's mom.</span> <span id="s126">My father's mom, she has very poor health, and she was not so energetic and industrious as my mother's mom was.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">(As you were growing up, were you aware of your parents' worries, their concerns.</span> <span id="s128">When did you first realize there were worries at home?)</span> <span id="s129">Do you mean this preemigration talks and concerns?</span> <span id="s130">There always were some worries, it is a normal course of things.</span> <span id="s131">I remember when I first became aware about the possibility of emigration.</span> <span id="s132">I can guess when my parents first became aware.</span> <span id="s133">Their friend emigrated in 1972.</span> <span id="s134">(So you were seven years old...) Yes.</span> <span id="s135">I didn't know anything at that time, but he was a very close friend of my father, and he didn't tell my father about his intentions and his plans.</span> <span id="s136">It was new and dangerous at that time, he just said to him once, "I'm going to emigrate to Israel."</span> <span id="s137">And my father tried to persuade him not to.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">(Why?)</span> <span id="s139">Well, they were both young, energetic upstart scientists, engineers.</span> <span id="s140">I think they worked for some time in the same organization, and my father believed that everything could be achieved in the Soviet Union, that he could have a good career, and he had a lot of opportunities lying ahead of him, that he could manage to rise to some high level position in this engineering establishment, to become a chief of a department or something like this, and that would secure him a good salary and everything, but his friend probably possessed a better vision of the situation.</span> <span id="s141">Anyway, he said that his decision is final, and he's going to leave.</span> <span id="s142">He applied, got permission, and left.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">(This was in 1972 that was pretty rare....) Yes, it was extremely rare!</span> <span id="s144">(How do you explain how he got out so easily?)</span> <span id="s145">Well, a few people got out.</span> <span id="s146">(Maybe because there wasn't a threat, it was so soon...) At that time, there was not yet a wave of emigration.</span> <span id="s147">Maybe they really considered cases on some personal basis and they found no personal objections to the emigration of that particular person.</span> <span id="s148">But I know that for many years to come, my father would repeat the same thing: that he's very angry at his friend because he didn't engage in that argument, and he didn't try to persuade him to leave.</span> <span id="s149">He just said, "I'm going to leave," and he left.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">(Because he might have been persuaded at that time...) He didn't make any effort to persuade my father at that time in 1972.</span> <span id="s151">And now this man lives in America.</span> <span id="s152">He first went to Israel and spent maybe ten years in Israel.</span> <span id="s153">He rose to become a prominent scientist and then went to Europe.</span> <span id="s154">He lived for several years in Europe, and then received an invitation from an American university.</span> <span id="s155">Now he teaches at some university.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">(While you were growing up, do you remember any Jewish rites of passage in your family, anything like a bar mitzvah, wedding, anything like that...) No, no.</span> <span id="s157">We were pretty ignorant of our Jewishness right until... Maybe I'm wrong.</span> <span id="s158">Maybe that was my impression, but I can tell clearly only about myself.</span> <span id="s159">I was absolutely ignorant about my Jewish heritage, about my Jewishness up until the late '70s, when we applied and became involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">(Nonetheless, were you different in some way from your Russian friends?</span> <span id="s161">You had Russian friends as well as Jewish friends, I assume, growing up...) Well, probably I had only Russian friends.</span> <span id="s162">We lived in a neighborhood on the outskirts of Moscow; it was a new development area, socalled "sleeping neighborhood" where there are only high rises, only high huge apartment buildings and people who live there work elsewhere in the city.</span> <span id="s163">(Bedroom communities?)</span> <span id="s164">It was a bedroom community.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">People who lived there were not all white collar.</span> <span id="s166">There were a lot of blue collar people.</span> <span id="s167">In the school I attended, I believe, there were quite a few students from white collar families.</span> <span id="s168">So at that time I had no Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s169">At least right now I can not recall anybody who was.</span> <span id="s170">Maybe somebody was.</span> <span id="s171">But first of all, I didn't pay attention to it.</span> <span id="s172">I knew that I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s173">I knew that I have to hide this and not expose it in order not to be beaten.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">(You feared attack by some of the tough kids....) They were not particularly antisemitic.</span> <span id="s175">They just needed a cause.</span> <span id="s176">(So this would have been enough of a cause?)</span> <span id="s177">Yes.</span> <span id="s178">I played the role of class scapegoat for several years.</span> <span id="s179">(So you were different from the others?)</span> <span id="s180">My achievements in sports were extremely poor.</span> <span id="s181">I was weak, and I could not defend myself.</span> <span id="s182">I was intelligent in the sense that I preferred reading to playing football outdoors.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">(Did the teacher make a distinction between you and the other students?)</span> <span id="s184">Some teachers did.</span> <span id="s185">Actually, this is not the best part of my memories because, in fact, I lived my life, but it was sort of unconscious in the sense that I didn't fully realize what I was doing and what it was and how it was.</span> <span id="s186">And now what I think when I recall my early school years, I didn't recall any emotions.</span> <span id="s187">It seems to me now that then I acted like a robot.</span> <span id="s188">(So you suppressed your feelings?)</span> <span id="s189">Yes.</span> <span id="s190">My feelings were quite underdeveloped at that time, and they began to develop in high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">(Did you tell your parents what was going on?)</span> <span id="s192">Yes, I usually told them.</span> <span id="s193">(What did they say to you?)</span> <span id="s194">Different messages.</span> <span id="s195">My father urged me to train, to become stronger.</span> <span id="s196">To do pushups and everything.</span> <span id="s197">My mom tried to defend me by going to school and talking to teachers and trying to bring the parents of these hooligans and have them punished.</span> <span id="s198">(Were you ever hurt?)</span> <span id="s199">Well.... (If you wanted them punished they must have done something....) There were a lot of fights.</span> <span id="s200">Three people in our class were from families with criminal background.</span> <span id="s201">The older brother of one of them was in jail at that time for a street fight with a knife.</span> <span id="s202">So they were normal, no, not normal, abnormal of course, but they were a typical Russian family where the parents are drunkards and do not pay attention to their children, and the children are brought up on the streets and inner yards of these big apartment buildings.</span> <span id="s203">So they start smoking at twelve.</span> <span id="s204">They start drinking alcohol at fourteen.</span> <span id="s205">They carry knives and cigarettes in their pockets, so you'd better not get into arguments with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">There were not many people, maybe two or three like this in my class, but there were situations when I was forced to confront them.</span> <span id="s207">I knew if I didn't perform well... (Was it oneonone?)</span> <span id="s208">Sometimes.</span> <span id="s209">I do not remember.</span> <span id="s210">(So you may have been beaten...) I was beaten on several occasions, but it was not pure anti-semitism.</span> <span id="s211">Just a general situation of scapegoat in a class.</span> <span id="s212">(But you were the scapegoat?)</span> <span id="s213">I was the scapegoat in my class for about nine years.</span> <span id="s214">(So from kindergarten on?)</span> <span id="s215">From first grade until the ninth grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">In ninth grade I got extremely tired of all of this.</span> <span id="s217">I persuaded my friend who used to say to me, "I like you despite the fact that you are Jewish."</span> <span id="s218">He was really a good friend for me at that time.</span> <span id="s219">He was very strong and he had trained in all possible martial arts, so he did wrestling and karate and everything.</span> <span id="s220">And I persuaded him to bring me to his karate class.</span> <span id="s221">He trained me personally everu dau for quite a time, for maybe half a year.</span> <span id="s222">We would get up early at 6:00 A.M., and go to the school yard where no one sees, and he would teach me karate.</span> <span id="s223">After that, after I picked up some of it, he brought me to his karate class and I trained there for about a year.</span> <span id="s224">Then once I was again challenged and I fought back, and pretty successfully.</span> <span id="s225">It was a kind of a miracle.</span> <span id="s226">A real scoop.</span> <span id="s227">"That guy struck Reznikov and Reznikov struck back and knocked him out!"</span> <span id="s228">So, that, for probably the last year in that school, people knew that I was able to stand up for myself.</span> <span id="s229">(How did you feel about that?)</span> <span id="s230">At that time I was very proud.</span> <span id="s231">I came home with bruises, but I was very proud that at least I showed to one of my old enemies who used to tease and offend me for many years, that I can strike him.</span> <span id="s232">(This was someone who had tormented you over a period of time...) Yes, for several years.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">And maybe my poor performance showed my brother, Vladimir, the negative model he decided he must avoid.</span> <span id="s234">He was quite the opposite.</span> <span id="s235">You saw him.</span> <span id="s236">He's a very strong person, and from the very beginning, from a very young age, he decided he must defend himself.</span> <span id="s237">He trained and trained.</span> <span id="s238">When he asked me something, I would tell him, "I'll give it to you if you make fifty pushups right now," and he would fall on his knuckles and make pushups on his knuckles to show me that he deserves it.</span> <span id="s239">I encouraged him to be strong, while not being very strong myself.</span> <span id="s240">He grew up very strong.</span> <span id="s241">He's much stronger than I.</span> <span id="s242">We used to argue when we were both younger, but it's very dangerous for me to argue with him now.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">(So as far as school goes, you seem to have had a successful career.</span> <span id="s244">What were your aspirations as far as your professional thoughts.</span> <span id="s245">What did you want to do?)</span> <span id="s246">In school I was interested in very many things.</span> <span id="s247">I was a great fan of science fiction for maybe seven years.</span> <span id="s248">I read nothing but science fiction.</span> <span id="s249">I was very interested in the sciences physics, chemistry and mathematics, especially chemistry.</span> <span id="s250">At that time, in seventh grade, I discovered chemistry.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">(Did you have any connection to Komsomol?)</span> <span id="s252">No.</span> <span id="s253">When I was in high school we were ready for application and probably had applied, and I knew very well that I should not join Komsomol.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">(Why do you say you should not have?)</span> <span id="s255">At first it was a practical consideration.</span> <span id="s256">Because when one applies for exit visa to OVIR, one has to leave Komsomol.</span> <span id="s257">If you leave Komsomol, you have to announce the reason - that you intend to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s258">So if I were a Komsomol member at the time when we applied for emigration, all people would know that we are applying.</span> <span id="s259">This is what we tried desperately to avoid.</span> <span id="s260">We managed to avoid it, somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">(Was that a hindrance to you, not to be in the Komsomol?)</span> <span id="s262">Not at early stages.</span> <span id="s263">If you are young, then the Komsomol membership sounds almost like a privilege.</span> <span id="s264">They decide if you deserve to be admitted to Komsomol.</span> <span id="s265">But when time passes and they discover that you do not strive for Komsomol, then the attitude changes and then they try to drag you in.</span> <span id="s266">They encourage you to apply for Komsomol.</span> <span id="s267">After all, what they're worrying about is the bureaucracy, the paperwork.</span> <span id="s268">They need to make reports.</span> <span id="s269">They are glad if they can report to the regional Komsomol committee that 100% of the students are Komsomol members.</span> <span id="s270">And this is often the case.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">(The Young Pioneers is really for younger children, right?)</span> <span id="s272">Yes.</span> <span id="s273">In the first grade they are called Oktjabrjata, Children of October.</span> <span id="s274">So they invite the students to a ceremony after classes and they give a badge that looks like a red star with a picture of young Lenin inside to each of them.</span> <span id="s275">So everybody gets admitted to this Oktjabrjata organization in the first grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">In the third grade, almost everybody gets admitted to Young Pioneers.</span> <span id="s277">This is also senseless, because there is no real distinction between being a member of the Pioneer organization and not being a member.</span> <span id="s278">But again they line up up students after classes one day and put these red neckties on and give smaller badges with a red star with flames.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">(What year did you enter the institute?)</span> <span id="s280">In 1982.</span> <span id="s281">In school I was interested in chemistry.</span> <span id="s282">I did pretty well.</span> <span id="s283">I was winner of city Olympiads in chemistry for high school students.</span> <span id="s284">I wanted to study chemistry and I prepared for the entrance examinations to Moscow State University.</span> <span id="s285">(So you did not want to go to an institute, you wanted to go directly to the University?)</span> <span id="s286">Yes.</span> <span id="s287">I wanted to go to M.S.U. to the Department of Chemistry.</span> <span id="s288">And this was where I applied first.</span> <span id="s289">(How old were you?)</span> <span id="s290">It was 1982, so I was sixteen at that time.</span> <span id="s291">I had just graduated from high school.</span> <span id="s292">(That's a typical age for graduation?)</span> <span id="s293">Usually people graduate at seventeen, but I got admitted to first grade a year earlier... (Because of your academic...) Yes, I was admitted at six years, of course I could read and write and do basic arithmetic while most of children go to the first grade at the age of seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">So I applied to Moscow State University.</span> <span id="s295">We were already refused visas at that time.</span> <span id="s296">So I was clearly aware that my chances to get into the University were low, so I had to design some backup plans.</span> <span id="s297">This was possible also because the exams at Moscow State University are given in July and the entrance exams to the other institutes are given in August, so if you fail at the university, you still have the chance to be admitted the same year to some other institute.</span> <span id="s298">This is crucial, because of the army.</span> <span id="s299">While I'm speaking about this admittance to the universities and institutes of the Soviet Union, you should keep in mind that this is not the question of prestige or profession.</span> <span id="s300">First it is the question of avoiding the draft into the Soviet army.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">(The army itself, even in peace time, was a bad place to be?)</span> <span id="s302">Sure.</span> <span id="s303">Especially for Jews.</span> <span id="s304">(What happened to Jews in the Soviet army during peace time?)</span> <span id="s305">They are discriminated and humiliated.</span> <span id="s306">That's normal, and this happens to everybody in the Soviet army, I believe, but to Jews it happens to a somewhat bigger extent.</span> <span id="s307">(So you were going to do your best to avoid it...) In order to avoid the army, and this was also the reason my parents hurried to get me enrolled in school early.</span> <span id="s308">People are drafted into the army at age 18.</span> <span id="s309">Since I graduated at 16, I had two years to try.</span> <span id="s310">So even if I failed to be admitted to an institute or university the first year after graduation, I still had the second chance.</span> <span id="s311">Only if I failed the second time I would be drafted to the army.</span> <span id="s312">All of this was consciously designed by my parents to give me more of a chance to avoid the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">So first I applied to Moscow State University to the Department of Chemistry and at that time I already had several Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s314">We monitored each other's successes and failures.</span> <span id="s315">I was told that this chemistry department is the most liberal department in the whole University and, as a Jew, I had a chance of being admitted there.</span> <span id="s316">I wouldn't dream of being admitted to any humanities or other school.</span> <span id="s317">There were just a few departments where a Jew's being admitted was possible at all.</span> <span id="s318">We took these entrance tests, and all my Jewish friends were admitted to the school, but I wasn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">I managed to meet a very antisemitic professor who gave me a very unfair exam which lasted for more than two hours, while the average time for an oral exam is ten to fifteen minutes.</span> <span id="s320">I was given questions clearly out of the range of the school program.</span> <span id="s321">I even managed to answer them, but nevertheless, he gave me the lowest grade he could.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">I went to appeal this grade and they told me that the grade I got was not yet the lowest one, (the lowest one would mean admitted failure, while the rest meant that I can still compete) and I am still eligible for admission.</span> <span id="s323">And they said that I exhibited bad manners on this appeal, and that if I don't stop, they will transform my grade to the lowest, so I will be out of the competition right away.</span> <span id="s324">"Listen young man, you still have a chance.</span> <span id="s325">This is not the lowest grade possible.</span> <span id="s326">You can still compete, so go on and..." [SIDE 2] I believe I performed at the top of my abilities.</span> <span id="s327">I trained hard for a year and a half before.</span> <span id="s328">I was clearly at the top.</span> <span id="s329">But nevertheless I failed because of this grade in physics, and... (You failed to be accepted at the University...) I failed.</span> <span id="s330">They didn't accept me.</span> <span id="s331">I performed very well, probably much better than I've performed since.</span> <span id="s332">I was absolutely at the top of my form.</span> <span id="s333">Just a few remarks: I remember the name of this professor who knocked me down on this test and just recently I discovered his name in one Western publication where he's described as one of the leading activists of Pamjat' Society.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Also, that was the examination in physics, and after that, when I was admitted to another institute, I was the captain of that institute's team in physics, and we made it to the Moscow City Olympiad in physics among undergraduate students, and we won the second place among nonmajoring undergraduates.</span> <span id="s335">So I believe I knew physics pretty well at that time for the level I was required to exhibit on this test.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">(So what was the institute you attended?)</span> <span id="s337">I attended the Moscow Institute of Oil and Gas Engineering.</span> <span id="s338">This is one of the wellknown Jewish refuges for refused students.</span> <span id="s339">Because there's no official gradation of course, but people know that the institutes and universities in Moscow, and there are about forty colleges and institutes, are divided into several clear categories.</span> <span id="s340">There are several institutes where no Jews can be accepted, ever.</span> <span id="s341">Jews know that and don't even try.</span> <span id="s342">And there are some institutes where Jews can be admitted exceptionally if they perform extremely well, or if they have some connections, some protection, and the Moscow State University is one of them.</span> <span id="s343">And there are also several institutes everyone knew where the policy was fair, and that resulted in incredible number of Jewish students.</span> <span id="s344">Jews just flooded these institutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">(So at the institute you were comfortably in contact with other Jewish students?)</span> <span id="s346">Yes.</span> <span id="s347">The institute I was in was well known for its fair policy of admissions and for this huge percentage of Jewish students.</span> <span id="s348">It was not a totally Jewish institute.</span> <span id="s349">There were just a few "Jewish" programs.</span> <span id="s350">In my program in mathematics, there were about 70 or 80% of Jews in every group.</span> <span id="s351">There were groups where just two people out of twenty would be nonJewish.</span> <span id="s352">While the average number of Jews in this institute was kept to a reasonable level, three or four percent, in order not to disturb the authorities, it was a wellknown "Jewish" program.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">(Were you a member of any student organizations?)</span> <span id="s354">There were none, except for Komsomol.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">(According to my notes here, in 1983 there was the creation of a Soviet Public AntiZionists Committee.</span> <span id="s356">Do you know anything about that?)</span> <span id="s357">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s358">It didn't affect my life much.</span> <span id="s359">We discussed that among those whom we trusted, and I have to say that in this, being refuseniks, we were very cautious not to let other people know that we are refuseniks.</span> <span id="s360">I had many Jewish friends, and very few of them knew that we intended to emigrate.</span> <span id="s361">To be Jewish meant just to have the fifth line in your Internal Passport saying that you're a Jew.</span> <span id="s362">To oppose the official ideology, to want to emigrate, was something entirely different.</span> <span id="s363">Of my Jewish friends in the institute, almost no one knew at that time that I am a refusenik, that I wanted to emigrate, that I read samizdat books, that I meet with other refuseniks.</span> <span id="s364">That was a forbidden thing for discussion and I tried to avoid it.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">I was not the only refusenik at the institute.</span> <span id="s366">There were other students who were from the refusenik families and we knew each other.</span> <span id="s367">We didn't discuss anything in public.</span> <span id="s368">We met in some private places and if we were sure that no one is hearing us, we would discuss something really important to us as politics, refusals.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">(Were you gaining access now to some of the forbidden books, samizdat?)</span> <span id="s370">At that time, I read a number of books that were forbidden to be published in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s371">Now I have, of course, more access to them.</span> <span id="s372">I do not think that samizdat is a big problem in the Soviet Union now.</span> <span id="s373">Many of these books were published since then.</span> <span id="s374">(But at that time was it a big deal for you to read those books?)</span> <span id="s375">Yes.</span> <span id="s376">We were afraid.</span> <span id="s377">We knew cases when people were thrown into jail just for having a copy of some forbidden book at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">(How did you get the books?</span> <span id="s379">Through your own family?)</span> <span id="s380">Mostly.</span> <span id="s381">My parents would get them somewhere from their friends and give them to me.</span> <span id="s382">And I almost never exchanged those books with my institute friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">(Aside from the secrecy that you observed except with a trusted friend, how did life as a refusenik work for you?</span> <span id="s384">What were the changes that occurred?)</span> <span id="s385">It was simply a double life.</span> <span id="s386">The life went on two different levels.</span> <span id="s387">On the public level it was normal, as usual, but I tried not to participate in political debates with my friends because, as I used to say, the empty barrel makes more noise.</span> <span id="s388">I thought I was not an empty barrel.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">(At this point, were there some traditional practices introduced into your home?)</span> <span id="s390">Yes.</span> <span id="s391">Historically, even when we applied for emigration, we were not so much aware of our Jewishness, but then we gradually got involved with the refusenik community.</span> <span id="s392">(This was about 1982?)</span> <span id="s393">It was about 1980.</span> <span id="s394">We applied in 1979.</span> <span id="s395">I believe my parents made the decision to emigrate around 1976.</span> <span id="s396">My father started looking for another job, because at that time he held a classified position.</span> <span id="s397">It was absolutely impossible for him to apply for emigration while still holding this position.</span> <span id="s398">At this time he was already the father of two, so he had some responsi-bility.</span> <span id="s399">He could not just leave this job, and he had to find a new one.</span> <span id="s400">For a Jew in the Soviet Union, it's very difficult to find a new job.</span> <span id="s401">Probably the only thing possible, is to get it by someone's recommendation, to use connections.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">But since he wanted to apply, he didn't want to do any harm to his friends who had to recommend him, or who had to take the responsibility of accepting him in their organizations.</span> <span id="s403">So he said openly to his friends that he's going to apply for emigration as soon as he gets his new position, so if they offer him a position, they should be aware of that.</span> <span id="s404">And no one could take responsibility for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">So finally, in 1978, I believe he managed to find a decent place with a salary only half of his previous one.</span> <span id="s406">So he took this position and he asked for Israeli invitation, and when the Israeli invitation came, we applied almost immediately.</span> <span id="s407">It was in October 1979.</span> <span id="s408">And at that time my parents already had several refusenik friends, and they became involved in the refusenik community in Moscow.</span> <span id="s409">It was then that we began receiving these books, the samizdat, and books published abroad, and started to read them.</span> <span id="s410">Only then, and in 1980, we really became aware of our Jewishness.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">I remember in 1980 there were Olympic games in Moscow.</span> <span id="s412">The authorities were very much afraid of unauthorized contacts of Soviet citizens with foreigners.</span> <span id="s413">So they demanded that people who can leave the capital do so.</span> <span id="s414">In particular, they demanded that all schoolchildren be taken away from Moscow at the time of these Olympic games.</span> <span id="s415">We had no dacha, but our friend who was a prominent refusenik had a dacha, and she invited us to her dacha to spend the whole summer there, two months.</span> <span id="s416">It was like a refusenik club because people would come and go and would discuss all these matters over and over again.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">(Can you tell us her name?)</span> <span id="s418">Her name is Tsilia Moiseevna Shwartzburd.</span> <span id="s419">She is in Israel now, so I can tell you her name without any fear for her.</span> <span id="s420">A lot of people from Moscow knew her because she was very supportive to everyone.</span> <span id="s421">There were always crowds of people in her living room.</span> <span id="s422">People would come and go and ask her for advice and consult with her on various different matters.</span> <span id="s423">She would provide us with samizdat books and she would introduce us to her friends, her refusenik friends, so we would establish contacts with them.</span> <span id="s424">(What was her occupation?)</span> <span id="s425">I don't know.</span> <span id="s426">Her husband worked with my father.</span> <span id="s427">They quit the work at this institute on the same day.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">(So there really was an impact on your life because of becoming a refusenik.)</span> <span id="s429">Yes.</span> <span id="s430">(In some ways, it sounds as if it became more exciting and enlightening...) Yes, it was very exciting.</span> <span id="s431">Even now I must confess that I miss some spiciness of that refusenik life.</span> <span id="s432">[laughs] (In Moscow, your mother became one of the leaders of the women's group...) But that was much later.</span> <span id="s433">That was only in the last years.</span> <span id="s434">(Was it 1982?)</span> <span id="s435">No.</span> <span id="s436">(1984?)</span> <span id="s437">She became involved around 1988.</span> <span id="s438">So she was actually on the surface of the movement for maybe two years.</span> <span id="s439">It was 1987.</span> <span id="s440">We knew a lot of active people.</span> <span id="s441">But we didn't take an active stand in terms of publicity until 1987 when I graduated from the institute.</span> <span id="s442">It's the same old reason.</span> <span id="s443">We were afraid that if we surfaced in the refusenik movement, I could be expelled from the institute and drafted into the army.</span> <span id="s444">So as soon as I returned from my camps, as soon as I am sure I am getting the rank, we changed our way of life.</span> <span id="s445">(So you're using the military as a metaphor here for school?)</span> <span id="s446">No.</span> <span id="s447">(You really went to military camp?)</span> <span id="s448">Yes.</span> <span id="s449">(I didn't catch that.)</span> <span id="s450">Actually, that's quite another story.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">(So you attended military camp with other students your age?)</span> <span id="s452">Yes.</span> <span id="s453">(And this was required of you?)</span> <span id="s454">Yes.</span> <span id="s455">If you do not object, I can digress and tell another story, because this is a common point of confusion.</span> <span id="s456">If you want to understand Soviet life, this is quite an important thing the relation to army.</span> <span id="s457">the role of army inside the society.</span> <span id="s458">The Soviet constitution says that army service is the holy duty of each Soviet citizen.</span> <span id="s459">In the commentary law, it's written that only males between the ages of 1828 are subject to draft.</span> <span id="s460">The draft is for two years in the army, or for three years in the navy, and it says that every young man can be drafted.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">In practice, they draft almost everybody, with virtually no exceptions.</span> <span id="s462">The only possible way to avoid the draft is to have some serious medical problems.</span> <span id="s463">And the medical problems should be really grave in order to get deferment.</span> <span id="s464">One has to be either a mental patient or literally crippled.</span> <span id="s465">Also, the fulltime students had the right to defer the draft until graduation.</span> <span id="s466">And then here comes the first interesting point, that in most technical institutes, there is an obligatory military training program, whick all male students must attend.</span> <span id="s467">This military program leads to the officer rank.</span> <span id="s468">So if you are admitted to an institute, at graduation you will be given a diploma of higher education, equivalent to an American B.A. or M.A., some degree, and also you will be given a military rank in reserves.</span> <span id="s469">So actually, I was a Soviet Lieutenant in the reserves.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Here's the second fine point, that the Soviet army needs privates in much more quantity than officers, and if you don't have an officer rank, you can be sure that you will be drafted as soon as you turn eighteen.</span> <span id="s471">But if you manage to defer the draft until graduation, and you manage to get your rank, there is some odd bet if you will be drafted or not.</span> <span id="s472">Not every institute graduate who gets his military rank is drafted.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">The third fine point is my Jewishness.</span> <span id="s474">When privates are drafted, no one cares what is their origin, because Jewish private or Russian private, it doesn't make any difference.</span> <span id="s475">But they clearly try to avoid having Jewish officers in the army.</span> <span id="s476">So if a Jewish boy managed to be admitted to an institute and get through and obtain a rank, he can be almost sure that he will not be drafted.</span> <span id="s477">Formally he can be drafted at any minute, but they just don't call him.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">The statistics show that if maybe one out of ten institute graduates must go to serve for two years, and if you are Jewish, it is virtually impossible that you will go... there are so many Russian graduates.</span> <span id="s479">So although I never had a guarantee, I was never secure that I will not be drafted, I was almost sure that I won't.</span> <span id="s480">So this was my relationship with the Soviet army.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">(During this same period, it must have been while you were at the institute, your mother told me that your brothers, if I have this right, your father had a circumcision.</span> <span id="s482">Is that correct?)</span> <span id="s483">Yes.</span> <span id="s484">First my father decided to get circumcised.</span> <span id="s485">It was very dangerous at that time.</span> <span id="s486">And it was really a great deal of conspiracy involved.</span> <span id="s487">So they changed places.</span> <span id="s488">They avoided saying on the telephone the exact words.</span> <span id="s489">They tried to use some other words to describe this.</span> <span id="s490">Still we don't know the name of the mohel who conducted the operation, because he was a doctor.</span> <span id="s491">He held some official position.</span> <span id="s492">He was a surgeon in some hospital.</span> <span id="s493">He was deathly afraid that if it becomes known that he makes these circumcisions, he could be imprisoned.</span> <span id="s494">So my father got circumcised.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">In a year, we decided that we wanted to be circumcised too.</span> <span id="s496">My brother Vladimir and I, were circumcised in April 1983.</span> <span id="s497">The funny story about that is the next day after the circumcision I had that military training at the institute when I had to be in the uniform and march.</span> <span id="s498">It was pretty painful the first day.</span> <span id="s499">But I managed to get through so no one suspected that there's anything wrong with me.</span> <span id="s500">[laughs] (That means that if you did this very extreme religious rite, that there were other religious practices now going on in your home?)</span> <span id="s501">Yes, at that time we became very interested in learning.</span> <span id="s502">Basically, what we were after was the knowledge.</span> <span id="s503">We had to know the difference between Menorah and mezzuzah.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">(Did you have access to the Bible?)</span> <span id="s505">Officially, of course, no.</span> <span id="s506">The Bible was, I wouldn't say forbidden, but it wasn't published officially.</span> <span id="s507">It was confiscated wherever possible.</span> <span id="s508">(Did you have an opportunity to read what is known as the Old Testament?)</span> <span id="s509">Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s510">Also, because my father's uncle was active in the Moscow synagogue, I believe he gave Torah to my father so we had a Torah in our home, and that was pretty rare.</span> <span id="s511">Honestly, I didn't read it at the time.</span> <span id="s512">It seemed to be a long and boring book.</span> <span id="s513">I was young.</span> <span id="s514">But then when we became interested, it was around 1983, I was just at the beginning of my studies at the institute, and we organized a group of study.</span> <span id="s515">First we began to study Torah and Judaism and traditions.</span> <span id="s516">(Were you studying in Hebrew?)</span> <span id="s517">No, in Russian.</span> <span id="s518">Later on we tried to study Hebrew.</span> <span id="s519">We all studied Hebrew for several months, but we abandoned the idea because it's a difficult language.</span> <span id="s520">I just didn't have enough time...</span></p> <p><span id="s521">(I'm curious as to what your reaction was when you did read the Bible for the first time, someone who's raised basically in the Russian tradition of Communism and atheism.</span> <span id="s522">What was your reaction to the creation, for example?)</span> <span id="s523">First, I was never raised in the traditions of Communism.</span> <span id="s524">Communism was around me, but I was taught not to let it in.</span> <span id="s525">So it's like if you are swimming in the dirt.</span> <span id="s526">You are dirty outside, but once you are home you take a hot shower, you are clean.</span> <span id="s527">It was the same with this Soviet ideology.</span> <span id="s528">While not opposing it openly in school and with friends, and in other public places, I always knew, not always, but from maybe the fifth grade, I knew that this is all complete propaganda and lie and nonsense.</span> <span id="s529">So I didn't believe in Communist ideals, probably after the age of ten or eleven.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">It was when my parents broke some early ideals that were inspired in school.</span> <span id="s531">I came home and gladly told my mom and dad that we were told such great stories in school, but they'd say, "Listen, this is all nonsense.</span> <span id="s532">Imagine this and try to analyze it critically and you'll see what they're trying to praise..." (Who were they talking about in school, Lenin?)</span> <span id="s533">Lenin and the Soviet heroes, not Stalin.</span> <span id="s534">The name of Stalin was erased completely.</span> <span id="s535">By then there was no mention of him either good or bad.</span> <span id="s536">The whole period of time was as if there was no history of the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s537">We knew the name Lenin, and the next name was Brezhnev.</span> <span id="s538">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">But when young schoolchildren are admitted to this Young Pioneer organization, they are usually told the story of young communist hero, Pavlik Morozov.</span> <span id="s540">This is a story which presumably happened in some Russian village in the early 1920s when there was a Young Pioneer, Pavlik Morozov, whose father was a kulak, and tried to hide grain from the authorities.</span> <span id="s541">Pavlik Morozov reported on him and his father was arrested, and then he was such a great hero and the whole village praised him, and the local authorities shook his hand.</span> <span id="s542">But then his relatives plotted against him and killed him in the forest, and so he is a great martyr.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">This is just a typical propaganda for young Soviet children.</span> <span id="s544">This guy's picture, and martyrdom, the ideal for Young Pioneers.</span> <span id="s545">When I came home and told my mom that we were told such a great story about Pavlik Morozov and they tried to make me analyze it logically.</span> <span id="s546">They didn't tell me this right from the beginning, but they made me arrive at the conclusion that his heroism was that he reported on his own father, and this is what they try to teach, this is what kind of role model they are trying to give us.</span> <span id="s547">This was probably one of the first holes in my Communist ideology.</span> <span id="s548">It happened for some time, but probably at the time when we decided to emigrate, I was not at all subject to this ideology, and I rebelled.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">(Let me bring you back to that question I hope it's not an embarrassing one when I asked you your reaction to reading the creation for the first time.)</span> <span id="s550">Well, you see.</span> <span id="s551">(Did it seem like, for example, a fairy tale to you, or did it strike a chord... or did it mean nothing at the time?)</span> <span id="s552">Well, I'm a mathematics student and I'm inclined to think mathematically.</span> <span id="s553">I was given the idea that something has to be considered as an axiom.</span> <span id="s554">If it is a good axiom or a bad axiom can be only shown by the future, by what can be derived from it.</span> <span id="s555">But you can not judge an axiom by itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">For example, if I say that the modern world is just 5,750 years old and you say that they discovered some fossils in the ground that look like they are three million years old, I can say that this is an axiom.</span> <span id="s557">Now we have 5,750 and these fossils in the earth were created 5,750 years ago, and they just look three million years old.</span> <span id="s558">So there is a logical escape from all of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">So the religion is a pretty logical thing.</span> <span id="s560">It doesn't lead to any logical nonsense.</span> <span id="s561">Judaism is built very much like mathematics.</span> <span id="s562">It axiomatizes something, the Torah, for example.</span> <span id="s563">If you believe that everything written there is true, than you can logically derive everything else.</span> <span id="s564">I believe for 4,000 years of Jewish practice, Jewish scholars didn't arrive at any contradiction, and this shows that this axiomatic system is not contradictory.</span> <span id="s565">So there was no big controversy for me to accept Judaism as something new for me.</span> <span id="s566">First of all, it didn't come to me in one day.</span> <span id="s567">It was like seven years, a period of gradual development.</span> <span id="s568">I started reading books.</span> <span id="s569">The first book I read on the subject was Herman Wouk's This Is My God.</span> <span id="s570">It was a translation from English, an American book, where he explains the very basics of Judaism to laymen.</span> <span id="s571">So it was not a big shock and a big surprise for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Also, we had a relatively good teacher, and he tried his best to read himself and to get educated.</span> <span id="s573">When he explained something to us it wasn't just the reading from the Torah or Tanakh, but he tried to read commentaries and he tried to discuss things with us and we gladly participated.</span> <span id="s574">It was a group of about ten people.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">We gathered once a week at someone's apartment for probably two years.</span> <span id="s576">It was a very strict conspiracy at that time.</span> <span id="s577">We didn't discuss anything with friends.</span> <span id="s578">It was very dangerous for him to do this.</span> <span id="s579">It was also dangerous for us, but his risk was much higher.</span> <span id="s580">(Was he also a refusenik?)</span> <span id="s581">Yes, he was also a refusenik.</span> <span id="s582">Then, as it often happens, we grew out of him, because he was not a big scholar, just an enthusiast.</span> <span id="s583">He read the same books that he gave us to read.</span> <span id="s584">So he was an enthusiast, and I'm very grateful to him that he pushed me down this road.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">But then we grew out of him and it was not more interesting to be there, and so this group dissolved.</span> <span id="s586">(What year was that?)</span> <span id="s587">Probably 1986; from 1984 to 1986.</span> <span id="s588">In the meantime, we had one failure, when one of our students told to someone that she attends.</span> <span id="s589">And somehow this information leaked to the authorities and our moreh was visited by the KGB.</span> <span id="s590">They warned him to stop, and he was courageous enough not to stop.</span> <span id="s591">We continued.</span> <span id="s592">We were of course a little afraid and a little shaky each time we gathered, but it was also some excitement about that, that we participated in some risky business.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">(So by the time you were able to leave, you were fairly welleducated as a Jew, probably as well as many students who go through Talmud and Torah here, if not more so.)</span> <span id="s594">No, I wouldn't say that.</span> <span id="s595">I know very little Hebrew.</span> <span id="s596">I just know the alphabet and a few words.</span> <span id="s597">My knowledge doesn't go beyond twenty lessons for beginners.</span> <span id="s598">I do not have systematic education.</span> <span id="s599">For example, he gave once a lecture on four different commentaries on the first two words in Genesis.</span> <span id="s600">He said that there are seventy pages of commentary in the Talmud to these two words, and he tried to give us a flavor of how it could be possible to write such a long commentary on just two words.</span> <span id="s601">He gave different aspects and views on this.</span> <span id="s602">But this was on just one topic.</span> <span id="s603">I feel that I clearly lack systematic education, so I wouldn't say that I am more knowledgeable than the regular Talmudic students.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">J.C.C. Women's Auxiliary Oral History Project Second Interview: SERGEY REZNIKOV DATE: January 21, 1991 INTERVIEWERS: E. Snyderman and M. Witkovsky (I'm going to ask you to repeat, Sergey, what you said about using axioms when you meet a new idea.</span> <span id="s605">We were talking in terms of when you first read about the Creation and read the samizdat or whatever kind of Bible.</span> <span id="s606">But the Bible wasn't easily obtained, is that right?)</span> <span id="s607">Well, I'm not exactly sure, but I think that the Moscow Synagogue is permitted to bring a limited number of copies of the Torah and distribute them among the members of the congregation, but this process is very heavily supervised by the authorities, and they want to make sure that the person is frightened to death before he or she can get these copies.</span> <span id="s608">So actually, I never saw copies on sale in the synagogue, but I can admit that this might be the case.</span> <span id="s609">If so, they should be pretty expensive.</span> <span id="s610">But it's not samizdat, anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">(That would actually have been manuscripts that were circulated underground.)</span> <span id="s612">Yes, manuscripts and photocopies and xerox copies of the photocopies of the manuscripts.</span> <span id="s613">(So you had said something about axioms...) If I understand correctly, the question is about the reconciliation of my previous knowledge with the new version of the world offered by Judaism and by the Torah.</span> <span id="s614">Maybe mathematical reasoning helped me, but the problem that an average person can have with that, he can say that this sounds reasonable or this sounds unreasonable so the idea that the world was created in six days sounds unreasonable to me, but as I understand this, this idea of being reasonable or unreasonable is based on our previous knowledge, and our previous knowledge is based on something, and continuing backward this way we will come to some axioms.</span> <span id="s615">So the idea of being reasonable or unreasonable in fact rests only on the fact if it contradicts something.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Well, in fact it doesn't contradict anything.</span> <span id="s617">It does not contradict our experience, because of course we didn't witness the creation, and it doesn't contradict our modern knowledge, because these are just two different systems of axioms, and so the real criteria for evaluating the seriousness of some idea is whether or not it contains some self contradiction, but not whether it looks reasonable or unreasonable to our sometimes, or rather often, incompetent view.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">(After our first interview, we observed how clear and organized your ideas were on presentation.</span> <span id="s619">You said, "I gave many such talks to visitors who came to Moscow."</span> <span id="s620">That would go back then, to the refusenik years that you started to tell us a little bit about.</span> <span id="s621">You made it sound as if the most intense portion of that time was between 1986 and 1988?)</span> <span id="s622">Yes.</span> <span id="s623">The most intense portion of our refusenik life, our socalled activity, yes, probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">(I know that each of you in some different way participated.</span> <span id="s625">You told us about the circumcisions that you and your brother, Vladimir, had, that your father had.</span> <span id="s626">It was very dangerous for the mohel, or the ritual surgeon.</span> <span id="s627">So your family had made a major commitment to Judaism by doing those things.</span> <span id="s628">But also, there were other things you were doing in a very organized, and you could say political, way.</span> <span id="s629">What was your role specifically?)</span> <span id="s630">Oh, I don't know.</span> <span id="s631">I've never thought of some specific role.</span> <span id="s632">I just participated in everything that was going on around!</span></p> <p><span id="s633">(Did you actually go to demonstrations, for example?)</span> <span id="s634">Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s635">I was detained once for three hours among the other demonstrators.</span> <span id="s636">(How big was the group that was detained?)</span> <span id="s637">It was difficult to estimate because people were forced into different buses and they were driven to different police stations.</span> <span id="s638">In our department there was a group of about twelve or thirteen people.</span> <span id="s639">So I can estimate that the total number of people participating in the demonstration was something between thirty and forty.</span> <span id="s640">And this was part of weekly demonstrations in Moscow that took place in 1988 for almost half a year, I think.</span> <span id="s641">Once a week, on Thursday afternoons, people would gather on the stairs of the Lenin Library, this is central Moscow and the biggest Soviet Library, it's a big building, and this place was chosen as the stage for the weekly refusenik demonstration.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">People would come weekly and at this time the militia would wait with their buses and people were sometimes beaten, sometimes not.</span> <span id="s643">People were thrown into buses and taken away to these police departments.</span> <span id="s644">They tried to interrogate us and sometimes, several times, they organized formal prosecution and there were administrative trials, but they never invoked criminal code as they used to do in the past.</span> <span id="s645">Basically that's why we were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">(You felt that because the world was aware of what was going on, you weren't likely to be put in a dungeon or something like that?)</span> <span id="s647">Yes, that's exactly right.</span> <span id="s648">So our best shield, and our best support and protection was the attention of the West.</span> <span id="s649">We knew that we are watched, that we are monitored, so we felt very safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">(Who were the leaders of this?</span> <span id="s651">Your mother said that she could not take the credit as the leader of a group of women who did the networking, who created the list of refuseniks from around the country.</span> <span id="s652">But she was one of the leaders ...) Well, maybe.</span> <span id="s653">You see, it was also, regretfully, a matter of politics.</span> <span id="s654">And not only politics in our relations with the Soviet authorities and the West, but also the politics between refuseniks themselves.</span> <span id="s655">And so there was some amount of struggle for leadership.</span> <span id="s656">In fact, when it became clear that the activity is not immediately punishable, then almost immediately, several refusenik groups and unions emerged.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">One of these women's groups was lead by Judith Ratner.</span> <span id="s658">She's now in Israel.</span> <span id="s659">She was clearly the sole leader of that group.</span> <span id="s660">And right at that time a second women's group organized, and there was an amount of competition, I believe, among those two.</span> <span id="s661">They tried to act separately, and they both did a lot of good things.</span> <span id="s662">But as I say, the group I am talking about is Judith Ratner's group.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">And then, later, Judith Ratner got permission.</span> <span id="s664">This was right immediately after my mom joined the group, so she attended the first meeting of the group maybe a week or two before Judith Ratner got permission.</span> <span id="s665">So then the question arose, where the group will gather in the future.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">There was another woman who offered her apartment, and then she also received permission to leave immediately.</span> <span id="s667">By the way, she is living in Chicago now.</span> <span id="s668">Her name is Nella Kleiner.</span> <span id="s669">Then my mom offered our apartment for the meetings of the group, and the group decided to meet at her apartment.</span> <span id="s670">She was given papers and the proceedings of the group, so in the beginning her role was more like that of a bookkeeper.</span> <span id="s671">Then she took a more and more active stand in the group.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">She was for several months, maybe half a year, very busy involved with the compilation of refusenik lists.</span> <span id="s673">She and several other women took this duty upon themselves, and I remember we were all very angry at her that she didn't... (Didn't what?)</span> <span id="s674">Basically we had to do dishes and wipe the floors.</span> <span id="s675">We had to cook our dinner because mom was speaking on the phone and typing and correcting records...</span></p> <p><span id="s676">(It was a good experience ...) That was also a very painful thing to do.</span> <span id="s677">I understand now that in America with modern technology, especially with computers, it's so easy to change everything.</span> <span id="s678">But we had no computers, only typewriters.</span> <span id="s679">And if something had to be changed, you had to retype the whole page.</span> <span id="s680">So she retyped those lists dozens of times.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">(So your mother described her role pretty well.</span> <span id="s682">Your father, we didn't have a chance to find out.</span> <span id="s683">We're supposed to complete his interview.</span> <span id="s684">What was his status in the group?</span> <span id="s685">Was he considered a leader also?)</span> <span id="s686">Well, he was not a member of this group, it was a women's group.</span> <span id="s687">(Right, but the refusenik group in general...) Well, there was no such thing as a refusenik group in general.</span> <span id="s688">There was a refusenik community.</span> <span id="s689">The people knew each other and maybe there was a refusenik network.</span> <span id="s690">But we avoided to use this word because it could allude to some kind of conspiracy and make the impression that we are going to do what in fact we did not intend to do.</span> <span id="s691">So it was a refusenik network.</span> <span id="s692">We knew each other and usually communicated privately, by phone or by inviting people to visit.</span> <span id="s693">So if more than five people gathered together, it was already an event.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">I believe my father was well known in this refusenik community, especially in the last years.</span> <span id="s695">(He had already written a book, hadn't he?)</span> <span id="s696">No, he doesn't write anything.</span> <span id="s697">(I don't know why I thought he had written a book....) No.</span> <span id="s698">He was in the initiative group of the Moscow Symposium.</span> <span id="s699">A group of refusenik scientists decided to organize a symposium on the problems of secrecy refusal.</span> <span id="s700">That was, I think, late in 1987.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">He had written a paper for the symposium.</span> <span id="s702">He analyzed the publications about refuseniks in the Soviet newspapers, and he tried to read between the lines.</span> <span id="s703">He also worked in the organizing committee and edited submitted papers.</span> <span id="s704">Some people brought articles to the symposium that were too sharp and biting.</span> <span id="s705">They had to be made less sharp and so openly directed against the government.</span> <span id="s706">Other people were just the opposite, they couldn't say anything specific about what they wanted to write.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">I was there.</span> <span id="s708">(Doorkeeper?)</span> <span id="s709">I was a doorkeeper.</span> <span id="s710">There were several.</span> <span id="s711">Young people were standing at the doors.</span> <span id="s712">We had to watch people coming.</span> <span id="s713">If the militia would come we would have to warn the people inside.</span> <span id="s714">I also answered telephone calls.</span> <span id="s715">There was the nowfamous Peter Arnett who is now the foreign correspondent in Baghdad.</span> <span id="s716">He was then in the Moscow Bureau of CNN.</span> <span id="s717">I met him in Moscow several times.</span> <span id="s718">He came with his camera people.</span> <span id="s719">Then also several big figures called from abroad.</span> <span id="s720">I remember Senator Edward Kennedy calling and speaking with refuseniks.</span> <span id="s721">So it was a big event.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">(How long did this symposium last?)</span> <span id="s723">It lasted for three days.</span> <span id="s724">There were several sections.</span> <span id="s725">There were about thirty reports prepared for this symposium, but it took several months to prepare, to select the papers, to select the speakers, to organize the meeting place, and to get in touch with foreign correspondents.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">My dad also participated in work teams of refuseniks like the Legal Seminar.</span> <span id="s727">It was a group of refuseniks organized to study the legal aspects of refusal.</span> <span id="s728">They tried to prove and document the fact that they are held illegally, that this is against the Soviet law to deny visas on the ground of secrecy.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">(You had during that period many visitors.</span> <span id="s730">I'm wondering, aside from the celebrities, were these people able to accomplish something for you?</span> <span id="s731">What were they able to do?</span> <span id="s732">Who were they?)</span> <span id="s733">Mostly they were Americans, but also a lot of British.</span> <span id="s734">Most of them were Jewish.</span> <span id="s735">They were given our names, addresses, and phone numbers by concerned support groups in the West.</span> <span id="s736">They would come and they would bring something; I'm not ashamed to say that we are very grateful for the material support they provided to us and probably it amounted to a fourth of our income at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">(Explain why that was important.)</span> <span id="s738">My father had to leave his position as an engineer before he could apply for emigration.</span> <span id="s739">He managed to find a position with a salary only half of what he had before, and he had a family of five at that time.</span> <span id="s740">We had a very big home library, several thousand volumes.</span> <span id="s741">We were selling it during all our years of refusal.</span> <span id="s742">That's how we survived.</span> <span id="s743">His salary was clearly not enough.</span> <span id="s744">Also there was this material help from the West.</span> <span id="s745">People brought small and simple things that were easy to sell in the Soviet Union, like cosmetics and magnetic tapes, sometimes recorders and books, pens, electronic watches and stuff like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">(Was there a black market where you could sell these things?)</span> <span id="s747">Several things were sold using this way, but generally there was much trouble and it required much effort to sell through the black market, so mom usually took these items to second hand shops in Moscow, and they readily accepted everything, especially foreignmade stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">(Was your mother working at this time?)</span> <span id="s749">No, she wasn't.</span> <span id="s750">(She stopped working when Michael was born.</span> <span id="s751">At that time, she told us exactly what the circumstances were... So now you're in school?</span> <span id="s752">You're missing some school for the symposium, let's say, but basically you're a student...) Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">(When did you meet Marina?)</span> <span id="s754">I met Marina right before we got permission to go.</span> <span id="s755">(Really?)</span> <span id="s756">Yes, it was two months before we got permission that I met Marina at the synagogue.</span> <span id="s757">(Was her family also a refusenik family?)</span> <span id="s758">No, not at all.</span> <span id="s759">Her family is in Moscow.</span> <span id="s760">Now they consider emigration.</span> <span id="s761">(What kind of work do her parents do?)</span> <span id="s762">Her father is an engineer and her mom is a music teacher.</span> <span id="s763">(So for them it was tolerable, whatever their life was there... So why was Marina at the synagogue?)</span> <span id="s764">She was in a group of her friends.</span> <span id="s765">After all, she's Jewish.</span> <span id="s766">One of her friends I knew was very active at that time in Jewish culture.</span> <span id="s767">She worked as a waitress in the first Jewish cafe in Moscow.</span> <span id="s768">She took Marina along and that's how we met.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">(So you must have known very quickly that you wanted to marry her?)</span> <span id="s770">Well, yes.</span> <span id="s771">(Is that what we call love at first sight?)</span> <span id="s772">Maybe.</span> <span id="s773">Probably.</span> <span id="s774">(So that complicated your departure somewhat...) Psychologically.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">(You met Marina the month before you received your papers.</span> <span id="s776">When did you receive your papers?)</span> <span id="s777">We were first telephoned in early October 1988, and we were told that we'll get permission soon.</span> <span id="s778">And in three weeks we got the postcard from OVIR notifying us that permission is given.</span> <span id="s779">Then for a month I was trying to quit my job.</span> <span id="s780">They didn't let me go.</span> <span id="s781">I had graduated a year before, and according to the Soviet regulations, I had to work at the same place for three years.</span> <span id="s782">Education is free, but in return, you are a slave of the State for three years.</span> <span id="s783">They don't say anything about emigration.</span> <span id="s784">They say that for three years you have no right to change your job.</span> <span id="s785">So you are assigned some position and you have to work there for three years.</span> <span id="s786">But I told them that I'm not going to change my job.</span> <span id="s787">I was changing my country!</span></p> <p><span id="s788">But they didn't dismiss me and for a month I fought.</span> <span id="s789">They had to sign a letter proving that I am fired.</span> <span id="s790">Only after this could I get my visa, proving to the authorities that I have severed all the ties with the Soviet life.</span> <span id="s791">I had to give up my Moscow residence.</span> <span id="s792">I had to obtain the paper that I am no longer employed anywhere.</span> <span id="s793">I had to bring reference from the military proving that I am not registered as a reservist, etc. (You never had to spend any time in military training at all...) No.</span> <span id="s794">(Not even our equivalent of the ROTC?)</span> <span id="s795">I don't know what that stands for, but I was in a military camp for a month, and it was part of my basic program.</span> <span id="s796">After all, I was given the military rank of Lieutenant.</span> <span id="s797">(That's right.</span> <span id="s798">I remember you had that wonderful experience...) I still remember the happiest moment of my life the moment when I crossed the gate of the military camp... coming out.</span> <span id="s799">We were all singing and dancing and chanting.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">(So in late November you severed your work relationship.</span> <span id="s801">And then when was it you were going to leave for Vienna?)</span> <span id="s802">We left Moscow on January 22, 1989.</span> <span id="s803">(So when were you married?)</span> <span id="s804">We were married four months ago, here in America.</span> <span id="s805">(So one of your tasks when you got here was to bring Marina for a visit?)</span> <span id="s806">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">(Now we have to go back.</span> <span id="s808">I will ask you what happened while you were at the university.</span> <span id="s809">You had some kindred spirits.</span> <span id="s810">There were other Jewish students like yourself.</span> <span id="s811">The degree you received was what, the equivalent of a B.A.?)</span> <span id="s812">It was a standard Soviet degree which is somewhere between Bachelor's and Master's, probably closer to Master's.</span> <span id="s813">It amounts to four and a half years of instruction after completion of high school.</span> <span id="s814">And then half a year of independent work on a thesis.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">(But you didn't complete a thesis, did you?)</span> <span id="s816">I did.</span> <span id="s817">(What was it?)</span> <span id="s818">I tried to optimize a work schedule for a large factory.</span> <span id="s819">I wrote my thesis and received my degree, and I worked for a year after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">(So this thesis did not engage your finest effort?)</span> <span id="s821">Pardon?</span> <span id="s822">(This thesis wasn't something you were inspired to do?)</span> <span id="s823">No, I was very much interested in that at the time.</span> <span id="s824">I realized that I had nothing better to do in the Soviet Union in the case we were to stay, so I was prepared to embrace it, and so I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">(Are there any highlights of your life at the institute, anything that you wish to recount, anything you remember that's noteworthy?)</span> <span id="s826">The thing I like most to tell is our refusenik activity, because this is what I believe makes me a little different from the rest.</span> <span id="s827">As for the institute, I had a lot of friends and I still keep in touch with many of them.</span> <span id="s828">We had a very good company.</span> <span id="s829">I hope we will meet sometime together outside the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s830">But many of them are still there.</span> <span id="s831">I can tell you how we spent our vacations.</span> <span id="s832">(So your vacations were spent in refusenik activities?)</span> <span id="s833">No, I meant my institute friends and our kayak trips.</span> <span id="s834">But the refusenik activities were something else.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">I said at some point that I used to live a double life.</span> <span id="s836">Until 1987, our main concerns were not to reveal that we are refuseniks to anyone who is not a refusenik himself, of course.</span> <span id="s837">In April 1987, there was an idea to organize a socalled second generation of refuseniks.</span> <span id="s838">I was part of it.</span> <span id="s839">We were children of refuseniks, sometimes very longterm refusenik families.</span> <span id="s840">We gathered and organized in order to consolidate our efforts to get out, and to promote awareness in the West and to attract attention to our situation.</span> <span id="s841">The most of the last year and a half in the Soviet Union was spent in this activity with the second generation refuseniks group.</span> <span id="s842">So we met with foreigners, with visitors.</span> <span id="s843">We had visitors from various Jewish organizations and groups.</span> <span id="s844">We fought for publicity.</span> <span id="s845">We tried to draw attention because we felt it was the only thing that would help us to get out...</span></p> <p><span id="s846">(What year were these activities taking place?)</span> <span id="s847">It started in early 1987, although I may be wrong.</span> <span id="s848">And it continued, well, probably to the departure of most of those who participated.</span> <span id="s849">(So were you able to get good publicity?)</span> <span id="s850">I do not know exactly of any major publicity.</span> <span id="s851">I know that letters that I signed appeared twice in the London Times, but of course I was not the only one who signed them.</span> <span id="s852">And we were monitored.</span> <span id="s853">That was very important.</span> <span id="s854">I had a support group in London.</span> <span id="s855">A girl from the group called me every week, once a week, just to make sure that I am alive and not in jail, that everything's fine.</span> <span id="s856">She would ask me about new developments and I would tell her everything I know.</span> <span id="s857">This was clearly designed not for me and not for her, but for those who were tapping my telephone.</span> <span id="s858">So they knew that I am monitored.</span> <span id="s859">So they cannot get away easily if they arrest me.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">And, they knew that I'm not afraid of speaking out, telling the details, naming names, and that I'm giving her all the local news: like the fact that some vandals broke tombstones in the Jewish cemetery, or some people got new refusals, or this person was humiliated in OVIR by officials, the news of this sort.</span> <span id="s861">So, we were all determined to make ourselves as much uncomfortable to the authorities as possible, so that we put them in the position so that they have to decide either to put us in jail, to arrest us, or to give us permission to go.</span> <span id="s862">That was the main stream of all the refusenik activity for all those years to make ourselves unbearable for the authorities, exactly to that extent, to make them willing to let us go.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">(So the second generation of refuseniks didn't mean the younger refuseniks, but those who wanted to get out in the next wave, is that it?)</span> <span id="s864">No, the name of "Second Generation of Refuseniks" referred to us as refusenik children.</span> <span id="s865">It was not us, but our parents who applied first.</span> <span id="s866">We had grown up in refusal.</span> <span id="s867">When we compiled an appeal to the Western organizations and support groups, we listed... I participated in this, I can probably recall most of that statement.</span> <span id="s868">The basic idea was that the West knows about the struggle of Soviet refuseniks, and all the details are highlighted, and there are many support groups and coalitions and they do fine, but this is not enough, until everybody who is willing to go can do this, this is not enough.</span> <span id="s869">We would like now to draw attention to the situation of second generation refuseniks, the children of longterm refuseniks.</span> <span id="s870">We claim that our situation is even worse than the situation of refuseniks in general, because in addition to the common refusenik problems, we have unique problems of our own.</span> <span id="s871">And then we would list the features that distinguished us from the bulk...</span></p> <p><span id="s872">For example, suppose I am a child in a family of secrecy refuseniks.</span> <span id="s873">My family was refused to go because my family had security clearance ten years ago, and ten years ago it expired.</span> <span id="s874">And so, now I'm grown up.</span> <span id="s875">I'm more than eighteen years old.</span> <span id="s876">I'm an adult according to Soviet law, and I want to apply by myself.</span> <span id="s877">I have no clearance of my own.</span> <span id="s878">And I apply for emigration to OVIR, and OVIR does not accept my papers.</span> <span id="s879">They say, "We cannot break your families.</span> <span id="s880">Our task is to reunify."</span> <span id="s881">They say they cannot accept my separate application because I am part of a family.</span> <span id="s882">So that is the first obstacle.</span> <span id="s883">The second obstacle was genetic refusal, socalled.</span> <span id="s884">(Hereditary?)</span> <span id="s885">Hereditary refusal.</span> <span id="s886">If they accept my papers, they refuse me on the secrecy grounds.</span> <span id="s887">I had no secrecy.</span> <span id="s888">I never had access to anything.</span> <span id="s889">I had no clearance.</span> <span id="s890">I had no classified job.</span> <span id="s891">But they say, you are refused because of secrecy.</span> <span id="s892">I ask whose secrecy?</span> <span id="s893">Sometimes they do not answer.</span> <span id="s894">Sometimes they say, because of the secrecy of your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">I applied by myself as part of my personal effort to get out.</span> <span id="s896">I applied alone, separately from the rest of the family.</span> <span id="s897">And I was refused, of course, because of this secrecy consideration.</span> <span id="s898">And I demanded that they give me details.</span> <span id="s899">Whose secrecy is this?</span> <span id="s900">Is this my own secrecy or my father's secrecy?</span> <span id="s901">But they didn't answer anything, they just gave me the letter: "Your application is refused because of security considerations."</span> <span id="s902">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">(To come back to how organized your replies were to some of the questions, which were obviously under topics that you had addressed in the past, like education or organized religion or persecution.</span> <span id="s904">You handled this very well.</span> <span id="s905">So I would like to ask you in what capacity you spoke of these matters.</span> <span id="s906">Was it as a member of your family speaking to visitors, or was it in this group the second generation of refuseniks, or both?)</span> <span id="s907">Both.</span> <span id="s908">We didn't give our group any organized structure.</span> <span id="s909">We even avoided to use the term "organization".</span> <span id="s910">There was something criminal in the way the word "organization" sounded.</span> <span id="s911">It implied some organized activity, and we were taught by the past that we should not call ourselves this way.</span> <span id="s912">We didn't have formal leaders and formal distribution of responsibilities.</span> <span id="s913">We called ourselves the "second generation of refusal movement", just as if we were a crowd of people running together in the same direction.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">(How old were the people in this group?)</span> <span id="s915">The youngest were probably sixteen, and the oldest were thirty, thirtyfive.</span> <span id="s916">(Did you actively recruit, or was it just...) We invited refuseniks.</span> <span id="s917">We had maybe sixty people on the list, and maybe twenty-five of them participated actively.</span> <span id="s918">Maybe ten of them gave their time to doing things like writing letters or preparing speeches, and I was among them.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">(Were you encouraged by the changes that were taking place in the country, by the ReaganGorbachev meeting.</span> <span id="s920">Were you encouraged by the release of Sakharov and Sharansky?</span> <span id="s921">Did these things have any impact or give any impetus to what you were doing?)</span> <span id="s922">We were encouraged by the belief that the times have changed, that we will not be arrested or drafted into the army immediately after taking any such action, and our belief of course grew out of many factors.</span> <span id="s923">These warm relations with America and the release of the prisoners of Zion, were just symptoms of this general thaw, as we saw it.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">(Is there anything else of significance from that period that you would like to discuss, because otherwise I'm going to go forward to your coming here...) I don't know.</span> <span id="s925">I still do not understand if this is a sociological project or historical project.</span> <span id="s926">(It's more historical.</span> <span id="s927">We're trying to get a picture of what your life was like there during these years.</span> <span id="s928">For example, I wondered how much the disaster at Chernobyl affected people in terms of their leaving.</span> <span id="s929">How did you react to that?)</span> <span id="s930">First of all, in the first several days, maybe the first week, there was such a confusion.</span> <span id="s931">No official news was announced, no official report.</span> <span id="s932">On the first day, the radio said there was an accident at some nuclear power plant in the Ukraine, and that was it.</span> <span id="s933">At first, we could not estimate the scale of this catastrophe.</span> <span id="s934">It came only later, several months later.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">The explosion took place, if I remember correctly, on April 26, and it was a week before the May Day vacation.</span> <span id="s936">I had a tradition to go on a kayak trip for several days outside Moscow on this May Day vacation.</span> <span id="s937">I remember that as we prepared and packed our bags we discussed that maybe it's better not to go because the rain could be radioactive.</span> <span id="s938">But then we dismissed all this, and we camped for four or five days outside Moscow.</span> <span id="s939">Then we returned and were told that the threat was so big that the special artillery was surrounding Moscow and they were given orders to shoot into the clouds with some special shells that induce rain, so the rain falls outside Moscow and not on the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">(That's the first I've heard of that.</span> <span id="s941">Because everyone in Moscow seemed to feel pretty safe.</span> <span id="s942">But you were aware that this had happened...) We did not understand the scale of it, and still I do not feel I can get the impression just by the number of people evacuated from the area.</span> <span id="s943">So clearly it was something more anecdotal.</span> <span id="s944">People used to joke.</span> <span id="s945">This is the typical reaction of the people, that if something happens, they try to make something funny out of it.</span> <span id="s946">They just mocked it.</span> <span id="s947">There were numerous jokes about the Chernobyl explosion.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">And one almost fairy tale I can tell in regard to this.</span> <span id="s949">The foreigners are usually forbidden to travel outside of Moscow.</span> <span id="s950">In Moscow there is the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language.</span> <span id="s951">It is a special institution for foreign students where they learn Russian language and literature.</span> <span id="s952">I had American friends there in this institute, and they stayed in Moscow for nine months or a year.</span> <span id="s953">We had a long friendship.</span> <span id="s954">And one girl told me the story that she agreed to be taken illegally by her friends in a car to Kiev and so she went with her friends and stayed in Kiev, and she planned to stay more, but suddenly something changed in her host's plans, and they drove her back from Kiev to Moscow, and it was right before the explosion.</span> <span id="s955">So she escaped the Chernobyl explosion by some eight hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">(I used the word samizdat in terms of the Bible which is, of course, inappropriate, but you did have access to samizdat literature.)</span> <span id="s957">Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s958">(Did we talk about that at all what you were able to read during that period?)</span> <span id="s959">No, probably.</span> <span id="s960">Let me think.</span> <span id="s961">They fall into several distinct categories.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">One is Jewish traditional and religious literature, supplied mostly by Chabad people.</span> <span id="s963">These are translations of canonical texts and commentaries to them, and books for beginners and literature like Magilat Esther, the story of Esther or of Passover, the Haggada.</span> <span id="s964">The second category would be the pure dissident samizdat.</span> <span id="s965">It focused mainly on the tragedy of Russia and the Soviet Union, especially during the Stalin years.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Before the truth about the labor camps and the extermination was published in the era of glasnost', all was documented and supplied in books that were distributed secretly, books like Gulag Archipelago by Solzhenitsyn and other books of the same type, and personal accounts of people who went through all of these horrors, and analysis of the history of politics and historical books on how Stalin rose to power.</span> <span id="s967">Clearly Stalin and his heritage was a point of fixation of this dissident movement, and I regard as an extremely clever step by Gorbachev that he made all this public.</span> <span id="s968">He let the steam out, and that reduced the pressure greatly, because it was almost half of what they wanted to say the truth about the past.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">There were also books about the current situation, and the Chronicle of Current Events... (Roy Medvedev?)</span> <span id="s970">No, he was a historian who wrote about the past.</span> <span id="s971">He wrote about Stalin, about Khrushchev.</span> <span id="s972">But the Chronicle was done by Sakharov and his friends.</span> <span id="s973">It was an account of the current violations of human rights and just other events in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s974">And there was also literature, the art that was banned in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s975">This way we read many books like Pasternak's Doctor Zhivago and 1984 by Orwell and other things.</span> <span id="s976">And also, samizdat published the work of Soviet writers who emigrated, and thus were prohibited from being published in the Soviet Union for a long time.</span> <span id="s977">The officials were not so much afraid of the contents as of the name of the author.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">(So this was another education that you were getting simultaneously?)</span> <span id="s979">Yes.</span> <span id="s980">(Maybe we should skip ahead now, because more important than your actual travel experiences from our point of view would be the reaction you had on coming here.</span> <span id="s981">Number one, I want to know if you felt you got the education you needed and wanted before you got here?)</span> <span id="s982">I got the best education in the Soviet Union, but that was clearly not enough.</span> <span id="s983">I could not get more in the Soviet Union because of the antisemitic bias that exists everywhere, so now I'm continuing my education.</span> <span id="s984">That shows that I was not completely satisfied with what I had there.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">(But it adequately prepared you, though, for your studies here.)</span> <span id="s986">Well, I was admitted to the University here.</span> <span id="s987">When I was there, I didn't have much choice, and my first concern was to be prepared for the work there and for life there, because I was not completely sure if we will get permission, and if so, when.</span> <span id="s988">I had to prepare myself for the long stay in the Soviet Union, and I got exactly that sort of education.</span> <span id="s989">This is why so many Russians coming to the United States are trained as engineers or computer programmers.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">(What was your biggest surprise when you arrived here?)</span> <span id="s991">Everything was a great surprise.</span> <span id="s992">In fact, there were so many surprises that I cannot say which one was the biggest.</span> <span id="s993">I can clearly remember the first cultural shock.</span> <span id="s994">It occurred in the airport in a public rest-room when I went there and discovered bathroom tissue and paper towels there in place.</span> <span id="s995">I was stunned.</span> <span id="s996">I was not prepared to see this.</span> <span id="s997">You see, in Russia, it is unbelievable, it's impossible to have such things.</span> <span id="s998">The first visitor would take them with him because they are free.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">(Were there some misconceptions you had before you got here?)</span> <span id="s1000">Yes, I imagined the West somehow before I came here, but the problem is that then I had the imagination, and now I have the information, and since the information is much more solid than those images that I had, the real knowledge just almost entirely replaced my images of what I thought America will look like.</span> <span id="s1001">(Was it better or worse than you thought it would be?)</span> <span id="s1002">Sometimes better, sometimes worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">(Did you go to another city before you came to Chicago?)</span> <span id="s1004">We landed in New York, of course.</span> <span id="s1005">We were driven from JFK to La Guardia airport.</span> <span id="s1006">We flew to Chicago from La Guardia.</span> <span id="s1007">So I had a glance of New York.</span> <span id="s1008">Before this we were almost four months in Europe... (In a way that was a transition that eased you into the United States...) Yes, in some way it was easier.</span> <span id="s1009">The difference between the United States and Europe is not as much as between Europe and the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">(In Chicago, what was your first impression of Chicago?)</span> <span id="s1011">Very miserable.</span> <span id="s1012">I rode the "El" downtown from Rogers Park.</span> <span id="s1013">When you look out of the window you see these poor houses, badly built and dirty and these old ads there.</span> <span id="s1014">Probably they weren't painted for the last halfcentury or so.</span> <span id="s1015">I almost had a depression when I first saw this, the backyard of America.</span> <span id="s1016">(So you were a little bit disappointed, then.</span> <span id="s1017">You didn't anticipate the seedier side of life here...) I was prepared to accept whatever it was going to be.</span> <span id="s1018">It just didn't correspond to my dreams.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">(Can you give us a notion of what your dreams were like about this country?)</span> <span id="s1020">I could imagine a beautiful street, but I could not imagine this back alley.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">(What do you miss of Russia?</span> <span id="s1022">Your friends?)</span> <span id="s1023">Most of all, and almost only I miss my friends and relatives, the people I knew.</span> <span id="s1024">I do not miss the landscapes and the views from windows.</span> <span id="s1025">In my opinion they're all decorations that can be changed.</span> <span id="s1026">First and almost only, the people.</span> <span id="s1027">I also miss the Russian countryside a little, because I'm a hikeaholic.</span> <span id="s1028">In Russia I used to hike and camp and go on kayak trips.</span> <span id="s1029">Also, just a little, I miss of course Russian language and culture.</span> <span id="s1030">Of course, I'm much more relaxed when I speak Russian.</span> <span id="s1031">I am dreaming now of the time when I will be able to chat with my American friends as easily and with as much relaxation as I do this in Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">(What was your reaction to the teaching at the University of Chicago?</span> <span id="s1033">Was there a big difference from your institute, or is it much the same?)</span> <span id="s1034">The teaching here is on a much higher level, so it's difficult to compare, but here it requires much more from the student.</span> <span id="s1035">I had a lot of spare time while I was a student in Russia.</span> <span id="s1036">I could go out every night and I could skip classes, but now if I skip a couple of classes I will then have a hard time catching up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">(Your family has been unusually strong in the wake of a lot of difficulties the period of being refuseniks, living from hand to mouth, what was it in your family that kept you all so buoyed up, in good spirits?)</span> <span id="s1038">That's a very difficult question to answer, mostly because I have nothing to compare.</span> <span id="s1039">If I had lived, for example, in two different families, then I could compare.</span> <span id="s1040">But this is my family.</span> <span id="s1041">In my view it is normal because I haven't seen anything else.</span> <span id="s1042">(But you know that American families aren't necessarily so strong...) We had this common goal and we felt that we must be together in order to accomplish anything, and there was also maybe a little paranoid idea that every split in the family will be used against us immediately by those who are watching us and listening to our conversations.</span> <span id="s1043">Also in America people can easily separate and find an apartment, after all [laughs], where in Moscow it's nearly impossible.</span> <span id="s1044">I was lucky enough to have my own separate apartment in Moscow, but I was clearly an exception.</span> <span id="s1045">My friends envied me, and when I got permission, I heard that some of my friends said, "Look at those Reznikovs, they're crazy they're emigrating and they're returning two apartments to the State!"</span> <span id="s1046">(Now you're here, and you have your own apartment here, so to speak.</span> <span id="s1047">You seemed pretty involved with your family even now.</span> <span id="s1048">Do you think that American life will weaken those bonds in some way?)</span> <span id="s1049">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1050">(Do you still feel that you're as together as you were when you first came?)</span> <span id="s1051">We came all the way together.</span> <span id="s1052">We were together in Europe.</span> <span id="s1053">We came together to America.</span> <span id="s1054">You can compare us to other families and say that we are maybe something unusual, but from my standpoint I don't see anything unusual in our family because it's my family!</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">(Did you have cousins in Moscow, other extended family ties?)</span> <span id="s1056">Yes.</span> <span id="s1057">(Are they emigrating or they still there?)</span> <span id="s1058">There are other members of the extended family still in Moscow.</span> <span id="s1059">Some of them will emigrate.</span> <span id="s1060">I don't know much about this.</span> <span id="s1061">(But they weren't part of the refusenik community?)</span> <span id="s1062">No.</span> <span id="s1063">(Because it sounded to me like the refusenik group became part of an extended family...) Sometimes, if they decide to go all together.</span> <span id="s1064">But in our case my parents decided to go, my father's parents refused to go, and my mother's mom agreed to go, but she didn't live to do so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">(You said you were married four months after you arrived here.)</span> <span id="s1066">Excuse me, I was married four months ago.</span> <span id="s1067">(What was the date?)</span> <span id="s1068">I was married on September 9, 1990.</span> <span id="s1069">(Was it difficult to bring Marina over for that visit?)</span> <span id="s1070">Yes.</span> <span id="s1071">It is difficult to obtain Soviet permission to leave, and it is difficult to obtain American permission to enter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">(Can you tell us about the wedding?</span> <span id="s1073">This would have been a Jewish wedding?)</span> <span id="s1074">Yes, we were married in a suburban synagogue here in Chicago.</span> <span id="s1075">(In Oak Park?)</span> <span id="s1076">No, it was in Northfield.</span> <span id="s1077">It was a Jewish wedding.</span> <span id="s1078">(Her parents could not be here.)</span> <span id="s1079">It was impossible.</span> <span id="s1080">But there were a lot of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">(Do you have any personal philosophy that you would like to share with us?)</span> <span id="s1082">You will be bored to death.</span> <span id="s1083">I have so much of it!</span> <span id="s1084">(We could talk maybe about your hopes for the future...) They're quite uncertain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">(What would be the best possible scenario?)</span> <span id="s1086">The best possible solution would be if Marina's parents come because she misses them very much.</span> <span id="s1087">(But you wouldn't make plans until that's for sure...) I have some small plans.</span> <span id="s1088">I have some professional plans.</span> <span id="s1089">I plan to obtain a Ph.D. in Mathematics in the graduate school here, and I plan to visit Israel as soon as I am able.</span> <span id="s1090">(Do you want to teach?)</span> <span id="s1091">Probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">The problem is that it looks like the major achievement of our lives we have already accomplished.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">(There's a letdown because that was such a..</span> <span id="s1094">.</span> <span id="s1095">experience...)

I never doubted that we must leave the Soviet Union as soon as we can.</span> <span id="s1122">It was crystal clear after all I'd read and watched around, after this dirty flood of propaganda falling on our heads every day.</span> <span id="s1123">I would like to see all of my friends out of there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">(Well, I think we've covered the ground, unless there's something more you'd like to say.)</span> <span id="s1125">If, for example, your were interested in the history of the refusenik movement, I could tell you in greater detail about that, if you're interested in a psychological perception of the world, I can probably tell about double life and double thinking and refusenik status as nine years of living with your suitcases packed and ready to go on first notice.</span> <span id="s1126">So when you try to start any new enterprise, when you meet a girl for the first time and you go to date her, you always had in mind, "What if I start to date her today, and tomorrow I'll get permission?"</span> <span id="s1127">And this is indeed what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">(Your worst fears came true...)
