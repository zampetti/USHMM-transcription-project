id="s11">B:My father is an apprentice to shoemaker.</span> <span id="s12">That gave him the right to go to high school, and my father went to high school and he was an excellent student.</span> <span id="s13">And the director of that high school was my father's protege.</span> <span id="s14">And he was en...always encouraged my father to continue higher education.</span> <span id="s15">My father finished the high school with the highest in...in Dorpet with the highest marks, and had a really new problem....a Jewish problem which was to enter a university.</span> <span id="s16">He wanted to study medicine.</span> <span id="s17">He wanted to study medicine and for a Jew to enter Dorpet university was one of the most difficult things.</span> <span id="s18">More difficult it was for me or anybody else to enter in the modern time in a medical school.</span> <span id="s19">And at that time my grandfather had a cousin who was one of the one who was kidnapped on the street, and was a Russian soldier for 25 years, enlisted.</span> <span id="s20">He had no children and he, the cousin of my grandfather, had a legal right to enroll his children to a Russian university.</span> <span id="s21">But he was not the father of my father.</span> <span id="s22">Therefore, it was worth my grandfather who was the Rabbi...Rabbi in the little town of Velendi did something which is really...I consider thinking about it, very humiliating for him.</span> <span id="s23">He had to declare himself mentally insane, not able to take care of his son, and legally transferred the right to his cousin to adopt him and take care of him.</span> <span id="s24">My grandfather who was a very learned man and a very sharp man did it for my father.</span> <span id="s25">As a result my father succeeded in enter university as a faculty of medicine.</span> <span id="s26">Uh...After a year or 2 at the university of Tarto, my father succeeded to be accepted to Cologne, the Cologne University in Germany, where he completed medicine and...uh...had a excellent education.</span> <span id="s27">He married my mother was was from Riga, and they both settled in Kaunas in 1940 and my ...excuse me...my father became...uh...interested in contagious diseases, and was in charge of the hospital, in the Jewish hospital of the contagious disease department.</span> <span id="s28">In 1940, approximately 6 weeks before the World War II started, a epidemic of typhus developed in the city of Vilnos.</span> <span id="s29">And my father was dispatched to be in charge of the epidemic in Vilnos where he...uh...directed the treatment of the thousands of people who got sick.</span> <span id="s30">On the day of the war in...in...he...on a Sunday when the war broke up, that was the day when he came to Kaunas.</span> <span id="s31">And when he traveled in the train he still did...didn't know that the war started.</span> <span id="s32">When the war started...uh...he again was in charge of the contagious disease hospital in...in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s33">In...in...I'm sorry, in...in...in Kaunas.</span> <span id="s34">And in August when the Germans have ordered the...uh...the Germans have ordered the movement of the Jews into the ghetto...uh...my father had the task in organizing the contagious disease hospital in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s35">Now, Avraham, as you know at that time, and you were the Secretary of the Judenrat, you probably know...</span></p> <p><span id="s36">T:There was no Judenrat.</span> <span id="s37">There was an Altestenrat, a Jewish Council.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">B:I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s39">A Jewish Council.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">T:In Vilna, there was a Judenrat.</span> <span id="s41">In Kovno, there was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">B:Okay.</span> <span id="s43">In the Altestenrat, how was the mechanism and what role my father played in the beginning in the ghetto, and later in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">T:Yes.</span> <span id="s45">Uh...I mentioned in many...in many occasions, the important role that...uh...your father, Dr. Moses Brauns, played in the ghetto from its very beginning because...uh...30,000 Jews were ordered to move in the small area of the suburb of Slobodka, which was inhabited about 8 thousand normally, and now 30 thousand Jews had to...to be squeezed in an un...impossible density, and this created the first...the first big problem of contagious diseases because Slobodka was a very famous...uh...a very famous suburb from the point of view of big scholars were world famous.</span> <span id="s46">But it was one of the most neglected suburbs.</span> <span id="s47">There was no...no sewage, no water, not any of the military installations and that's why there was no, for instances, toilets.</span> <span id="s48">There was not such houses....houses were small ones.</span> <span id="s49">One...one story... story houses of wooden.</span> <span id="s50">There were in...in all of Slobodka, were approximately two or three big...uh...houses of...of ...three story houses with bricks.</span> <span id="s51">Others were mostly wooden of...of one story or two stories.</span> <span id="s52">So this in itself brought about it that many Jews were...fled from Kovno to the ghetto, didn't find there housing.</span> <span id="s53">And the housing department was...was...uh...was in...was not able to ...to ...locate houses.</span> <span id="s54">When I talk about houses, we speak about a room.</span> <span id="s55">We speak about a part of a room, a dwelling.</span> <span id="s56">And this too was there were so many thousands were in the streets under the sky.</span> <span id="s57">And others...we used to... we used to house them the...the roofless we used to house them in previous synagogues or Yeshivites but they were packed to capacity and you to a former school as I did with the head of the department.</span> <span id="s58">At that time , we were looking for a place where we could install a hospital, a general hospital.</span> <span id="s59">So not only in the...in the rooms, the family sleep but only in the staircase.</span> <span id="s60">Only in the...in the...the toilets.</span> <span id="s61">In the...in the... in the...in the upper floor where it was only for storage, there also lived people.</span> <span id="s62">And this created immediately danger for contagious diseases.</span> <span id="s63">The...the Lithuanian sanitary department of Kovno was searching where they were spying in the ghetto just to look and pick up one case of a contagious diseases.</span> <span id="s64">It was typhus or something we've had.</span> <span id="s65">And there were such, because it was impossible, but also in this we called them reservats where hundreds of families lived in one place, a formal Shivot or formal synagogue.</span> <span id="s66">And when...the...happened such a thing, there was no possibility to...to isolate the sick one, so Doctor Brauns was the one who had two tasks in one time.</span> <span id="s67">First of all, to help give medical care to the contagious sick person.</span> <span id="s68">Second to isolate him from the rest of the people in the reservat, which was full packed, and where to put him...put him at a bed that there was no such a bed even on the...on the ground, but to isolate him from the others.</span> <span id="s69">Second, he was the one who served as address for those Lithuanians, municipal spies I say, medical spies or sanitary spies who came to Dr. Brauns, and they asked him how the situation...where are your contagious diseases.</span> <span id="s70">So he said, "We don't have any."</span> <span id="s71">And he was duty bound as head of the...of the...the Department for Contagious Diseases to report to the municipality in Kovno, to the health department of Kovno, and they would have come.</span> <span id="s72">In addition German Police, the Gestapo, on their own initiative, used to come to the ghetto and search.</span> <span id="s73">On the spot they used to go into the reservot.</span> <span id="s74">They used to go in...in...uh...they used to go in the...</span></p> <p><span id="s75">B:The houses?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">T:Private dwellings.</span> <span id="s77">Houses.</span> <span id="s78">Dwellings.</span> <span id="s79">Corridors.</span> <span id="s80">Court yards.</span> <span id="s81">They were packed.</span> <span id="s82">But Dr. Brauns used to take out of such places the diseases and found some other places in a very...in a small hut, and it was much like as if it is just a hut, but inside the court yard, he used to...he built with them, and this separated them from the others.</span> <span id="s83">Always the night, he was the buffer, I could say to...he was to rebuff...to rebuff the attacks of the Germans, of the Lithuanians, not less than the Germans from spying...from spying where the contagious ill people are.</span> <span id="s84">This was...this was supposed to be the motive to liquidate all the ghetto because if there is a contagious diseases in the ghetto, we wind on the other side of the...of the...of the free...free part of the barbed wire, there was a Lithuanian population, also in the...in the very same small suburb.</span> <span id="s85">So they...excuse that they would be a danger to the Lithuanian population.</span> <span id="s86">They would even be a danger for the German soldiers passing by.</span> <span id="s87">And he stood firm.</span> <span id="s88">First of all it was a very big morale responsibility to cure.</span> <span id="s89">There were excellent physicians in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s90">Surgery...and in out this is and out this is, and whatever not a very specialist in medicine.</span> <span id="s91">But not one of them was ready to take over the risk and deal with, cure this diseases of typhus and so on.</span> <span id="s92">The only who took it over and did hisself the very great, not only respect, but the trust of the Jewish Committee, the Council.</span> <span id="s93">Dr. Elkes, the head of the Jewish Council.</span> <span id="s94">We're great friends.</span> <span id="s95">They wrote for long years.</span> <span id="s96">It was a long standing, long year standing...uh...uh...friendship.</span> <span id="s97">And that's why they trusted him fully.</span> <span id="s98">He was the...the man, the doctor who was the only one whom the Jewish Council relied upon to protect the ghetto inmates from first of all contagious diseases in...in themselves a danger, and for the other one to stand courageous...courageous and steady right to...to reject and to...to buff back all these questions, sometimes cynical questions, sometimes provocative questions, some provocative unexpected visits.</span> <span id="s99">And when Dr. Brauns was...went in the ghetto and he met on...on the streets of this and he recognized...and he recognized the Lithuanian physicians who came and they knew what they came for.</span> <span id="s100">And immediately just interfered, they told them, "Please, where are you.</span> <span id="s101">What are you doing?</span> <span id="s102">Please come.</span> <span id="s103">You ought to see my hospital.</span> <span id="s104">Please and so on."</span> <span id="s105">But he knew them.</span> <span id="s106">They wanted sometimes to a avoid meeting with him, and to reach exactly...uh...the...the...uh...the itself, the sick man who was sick with typhus.</span> <span id="s107">And this is a task that will be written always in the annals of the three years of the Kovno Ghetto.</span> <span id="s108">I don't know of any other such person, physician, who took upon himself the daily risk of life, his own life, in fight from...from both parts.</span> <span id="s109">This, you know, the.</span> <span id="s110">.</span> <span id="s111">uh...the Czars emblem was a two...two heads...uh...two heads of a..</span> <span id="s112">.</span> <span id="s113">of a .</span></p> <p><span id="s114">B:Eagle.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">T:Eagle.</span> <span id="s116">Two of them.</span> <span id="s117">And Dr. Brauns, I could say he had...he had two parts of Dr. Brauns.</span> <span id="s118">One part they wrote it to his fellow inmates in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s119">Protect them from the very diseases.</span> <span id="s120">He's a doctor, a physician.</span> <span id="s121">And on the part, the second Dr. Brauns who stood on the outlook everyday against the Germans, spies, against the warnings, the threats that they used to say Dr. Brauns, "You are the person who are responsible to report to us and if you will not report you bear responsibility yourself."</span> <span id="s122">And you know what it means responsibility?</span> <span id="s123">This means just death.</span> <span id="s124">No compromise.</span> <span id="s125">And I'm not exaggerating.</span> <span id="s126">So this is the way you, Dr. Brauns, in the ghetto...he knew very well because on the...he used to come to the very...very urgent cases, the very especially hard cases.</span> <span id="s127">When four or five got sick with contagious diseases at one time, we used to find immediately to take them out from where they been and bring them in certain places we didn't know where.</span> <span id="s128">Because we didn't have such hotels or somewhere to bring them there.</span> <span id="s129">But then we used to take even a hut or something like that, take out the dwelling...the...the citizens, the inmates and put in these...uh...under very strong and sometimes we used to put on the outlook on this...on this hiding... hiding hospital you see, uh...the outlook, two or three policemen...Jewish policemen on the outlook so if somebody comes close, near to it.</span> <span id="s130">This I how I knew Dr. Brauns and I cannot but end this...uh...this characteristic that in the course of the years I knew Dr. Brauns from the from the Kovno Ghetto?</span> <span id="s131">He was the President, but the French was really...uh...really was developed in the ghetto and it was only nature that after the liberation when I was already in Israel and I got word that...uh...this Jew came to...we were in Dachau, we were in concentration camp, and then we were in Italy.</span> <span id="s132">We were...we were together in the 1945, 1947.</span> <span id="s133">You stayed there until later I..</span> <span id="s134">.</span> <span id="s135">I made my October 47.</span> <span id="s136">So that you came to...to America, you succeeded to...to...to study medicine and establish yourself as a well known physician in the United States and then to learn from you when you visited Israel, you came to me and told me that your father and mother were rescued.</span> <span id="s137">They survived and they are in... in Soviet Union and you are trying to bring them out and what can I do for you in this case?</span> <span id="s138">I while in Italy I was the Secretary of the clandestine Aleia to Palestine.</span> <span id="s139">But we at that time already used to send our messengers inside Russia to take out from there...uh...Zionist...former Zionist leaders and bring them to Italy and then to Israel.</span> <span id="s140">So I had all the connections how to take out from Russia to Palestine...to Palestine...to Israel.</span> <span id="s141">And it was a fact that I was the only one in Israel that dealt with it and when they used to come to...to...uh...we used to come to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for help, they told them go to Avraham Tory, the lawyer, and they thought they have to come to Tory and obey me.</span> <span id="s142">See and so on, I never took a penny for that.</span> <span id="s143">And mind you, the President of the State of Israel, Heil Weitzman, had a sister that remained in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s144">And then Vera Weitzman, who was a very you know a lady and she was with the all the Ambassadors over there, so she spoke with the Russian Ambassador, they're bringing in...in Washington and she was here and she spoke with the French Ambassador there and here.</span> <span id="s145">And they asked.</span> <span id="s146">Nothing came out.</span> <span id="s147">So then I don't know someway they got word that Avraham Tory is dealing with bring the...the...the Jews from Soviet Union to Israel.</span> <span id="s148">I was the first one to bring Pnina's father who was in Siberia, exiled, to bring him the first one in 52.</span> <span id="s149">To bring him in...from...from Siberia to Israel.</span> <span id="s150">And I had there...when I..</span> <span id="s151">.</span> <span id="s152">when I got word that he's already in Moscow, I..</span> <span id="s153">.</span> <span id="s154">I spoke to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and they called the Embassy in Moscow they shouldn't beat him because he is 70 years old man.</span> <span id="s155">Anyhow, so the...one of the family of the President came to my office and asked me could I do anything about this?</span> <span id="s156">And I told them...gave them one advice.</span> <span id="s157">If they want me to deal with to bring the sister of the President, Heim Weitzman, to Israel, they should not mention a word about the President, about Heim Weitzman, about Israel.</span> <span id="s158">Nothing!</span> <span id="s159">A plain woman comes...comes is...is in Russia.</span> <span id="s160">She has a sister.</span> <span id="s161">It's mention because in...in Israel.</span> <span id="s162">Only the sister should apply.</span> <span id="s163">And in their name I applied for a exit visa for this woman, and the...after 6 months she came to Israel.</span> <span id="s164">And then I got a very nice letter, nice but it so .</span> <span id="s165">But when your father came to Israel, came to...to...came to Russia, I told you the same thing.</span> <span id="s166">You cannot get your father out of the Soviet Union and bring him straight from the Soviet Union to America.</span> <span id="s167">I suggest to you you formerly be...live in Israel.</span> <span id="s168">And I took your card and I put it on my private home as if you lived together with me in Israel.</span> <span id="s169">And they gave you the ...the...the aerograms...Israeli post office and you used to write the aerograms and send them in a closed envelope to me, and I used to put it in the...in the post office in Tele Aviv.</span> <span id="s170">And the same thing your parents used to write the letters to you, but send it to...to Jacob Brauns, Tele Aviv, 17 Aldair Street, Tele Aviv, Israel.</span> <span id="s171">And I used to send it to you.</span> <span id="s172">And by so doing I succeeded to get the permit for your parents to come to Israel.</span> <span id="s173">And it happens so that when my wife went to Berkeley where our oldest daughter was studying at University and she was...was to give birth to a..</span> <span id="s174">.</span> <span id="s175">to a child, that wife was visiting you and you were host, and you took her to Los Vegas and I don't know where.</span> <span id="s176">And that date I got...I went to the airport of Lud to meet your father and mother and took them to my home.</span> <span id="s177">They were speaking very slow because they shouldn't hear...somebody wouldn't hear this way...how they...they way they were frightened to talk to somebody.</span> <span id="s178">And, of course, after several months or so there, you...you...you took them over to the United States.</span> <span id="s179">And this is the happy end of Dr. Moses Brauns with his father and with his father, and of course the...the friendship continued with Dr. Brauns and his wife when they were here in Los Angeles, and this friendship grows on with you, and with your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">B:I want to add something.</span> <span id="s181">Being...we have two topics.</span> <span id="s182">We have topic of the ghetto, and topic of getting my parents out.</span> <span id="s183">I like to add an interesting story to that.</span> <span id="s184">When Mrs. Kruschev happened to be in the United States, I was lucky enough to be introduced to Vice President Nixon.</span> <span id="s185">I wrote a very passionate letter to Mrs. Nixon.</span> <span id="s186">I compared two mothers.</span> <span id="s187">She is a mother who has two sons and lost her son and my mother who unfortunate lost my brother, one of her sons.</span> <span id="s188">And this passionate letter was given by President Nixon to Mrs. Krushev, and within one week we got a permit.</span> <span id="s189">However, what you have done, we have really together deceived and covered because my father always said when the mailman used to come, he used to scream loud on the staircase, "Dr. Brauns, I have a letter from your son from Israel."</span> <span id="s190">So the , the KBG, at that time has not...</span></p> <p><span id="s191">T:Had no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">B:Had no idea the big deception.</span> <span id="s193">But the morale of the story is with your help, with President Nixon's help, with Mrs. Krushev's generosity and interest we succeeded it, in this big project to get my parents out.</span> <span id="s194">Going back to the ghetto thing, I am recollecting a few things about the ghetto which was about about...about the period you said.</span> <span id="s195">First of all, my father was heart broken when he had to take the patients from the contagious disease hospital and bring them to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s196">They were transported on open trucks.</span> <span id="s197">They were sick people with high temperature and they were dumped on the street.</span> <span id="s198">It was at that time when my father had helped to organize or I mean help...with the help of the people because he made a small hospital of 50 beds which was called the contagious disease hospital.</span> <span id="s199">The people everyone was very generous in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s200">They had nothing, but each found a little sheet, a little pillow, an extra bed to fill a 50 bed hospital, which I personally was working in the hospital.</span> <span id="s201">And I..</span> <span id="s202">.</span> <span id="s203">the hospital become a symbol of security for the people.</span> <span id="s204">The people when the hospital felt that they feel secure.</span> <span id="s205">And you know better Dr. Elkes got a warning about three days before the tragedy in the...in the hospital that they're planning to do something with the hospital.</span> <span id="s206">My father went to the hospital and tried to discharge everybody.</span> <span id="s207">And fort...I mean unfortunate...fortunately, the people in the hospital were not very sick.</span> <span id="s208">They used it mostly as a shelter not to go to work.</span> <span id="s209">But nobody wanted to leave the hospital.</span> <span id="s210">And you described what happened on October 4th, 1941, with this hospital which was one of the big tragedies.</span> <span id="s211">My own life was and my father's life was saved by the fact there was a bridge to cross to the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">T:Up a bridge.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">B:An upper bridge I recall went over the highway, over the street or highway which was not part of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s214">And for some reason my father never know who it was, there was a man who stopped him.</span> <span id="s215">And my father...</span></p> <p><span id="s216">T:On his way to the...near the...near the bridge?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">B:Near the bridge.</span> <span id="s218">And delayed us by 5 minutes.</span> <span id="s219">That was the 5 minutes that gave my father and me life.</span> <span id="s220">Why don't you describe what happened that time at the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">T:Well, I told already...spoke about it all I want.</span> <span id="s222">But what happened that Dr. Brauns usually at 6 o'clock, he was already walked to the ghetto, to the...to his hospital.</span> <span id="s223">And they when they came to the...when they came to this day at this 4th of October 1941, he came to pass the bridge, they was already closed.</span> <span id="s224">Nobody comes into this small ghetto and nobody goes out.</span> <span id="s225">In the small ghetto was the...the contagious disease hospital headed by Dr. Brauns and they didn't let him in.</span> <span id="s226">He says, "I am the doctor of the...of the hospital.</span> <span id="s227">I must be there.</span> <span id="s228">The people are waiting."</span> <span id="s229">Not nothing.</span> <span id="s230">And you accompanied him.</span> <span id="s231">You were at the age of 14 at time.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">...16.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">...Pardon.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">...16.</span> <span id="s235">Well, I thought you were younger.</span> <span id="s236">Anyhow, it doesn't make really...uh...so...uh...both of you and your father was in great distress.</span> <span id="s237">To leave a hospital that he is heading just to the fate of the people.</span> <span id="s238">And...and very short after 6 the...the hospital was put on fire with the patients, with the doctors, with administering personnel and also with the adjacent home of orphans of about 400, 300 orphans registered to the .</span> <span id="s239">And the ghetto...the was on fire.</span> <span id="s240">The...uh...people...the children were taken to the ninth fortress together with another thousand of the small ghetto and the ghetto, small ghetto, was liquidated.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">B:At that time my father made a solemn commitment that the word of contagious diseases did not exist in the vocabulary.</span> <span id="s242">And that what led in the clandestine treatment of things.</span> <span id="s243">There were two people, as far as I know, you and...and ...uh...and Elkes that knew about it.</span> <span id="s244">I happened to know about it too, and I tell you a little about what happened.</span> <span id="s245">Uh...The...it's a very interesting thing and my father described it in his memoirs.</span> <span id="s246">For some reason that we don't know many of the contagious diseases, like dysentery completed disappeared from the ghetto, inspite of the terrible sanitary conditions.</span> <span id="s247">My father's nightmare at that time was the excrement that were used...the winter was very cold.</span> <span id="s248">It was the...the coldest winter in the history, actually since Napoleon time, and my father was always saying, "What will happen in the spring when all this excrements will start melting?"</span> <span id="s249">But in spite of this, dysentery disappeared.</span> <span id="s250">Diphtheria.</span> <span id="s251">Diphtheria is a disease that is curable provided you use serum in the proper time.</span> <span id="s252">As you are aware, we didn't have diphtheria serum.</span> <span id="s253">And if we succeeded by clandestine methods...my father succeeded or you succeeded in the...from the ghetto, you...Altestenrat to get serum, it was always given too late.</span> <span id="s254">In spite of that, in all the records that my father kept, there was not one child that died of diphtheria and other diseases.</span> <span id="s255">But the really tragedy in the ghetto, for my father, was in 1942.</span> <span id="s256">When the Germans were defeated in Moscow, there were a lot of Spanish troops who didn't have proper clothes.</span> <span id="s257">The blue brigade.</span> <span id="s258">There were Germans who didn't have clothes and they were amputees sick and by train they were sent by the Red Cross train of...German Red Cross train, they were sent to...back to Germany.</span> <span id="s259">However, the German...being this people, full of life because the hy...hygienic conditions were worse in the German army of that part than it was in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s260">And being them full lice and having typhus which is a little different type is from the typhus of the , which is typhus of the is translated through life.</span> <span id="s261">So in Kaunas, they established an , which means they delice.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">T:Delousing.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">B:Delousing.</span> <span id="s264">So the train would arrive and the patient would be taken out from the train, taken off, stripped from the clothes, shaven their hair and their clothes were disinfected, and the train was disinfected.</span> <span id="s265">There were two teams working.</span> <span id="s266">There was the Jewish team working on the dirty side and there was a Lithuanian team working on the clean side.</span> <span id="s267">I don't know if was by providence or whatever happened, the Lithuanian side...people workers there developed typhus.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">T:I don't know.</span> <span id="s269">I know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">B:No.</span> <span id="s271">Well, developed a epidemic, and many Lithuanians died.</span> <span id="s272">As a result, the Lithuanian health department immediately flooded the ghetto, and it is in your book written the dates they came and flooded because they justifiable looked for the...for the cause of the...of the disease.</span> <span id="s273">But in the... on the Jewish side, they were 74 cases of typhus that my father treated them, hid them, and he got from the Altestenrat extra soap, extra consideration in moving the patient to certain parts, but he succeeded in...in treating the patients.</span> <span id="s274">Now if you take an American textbook, , which is a top text book and you write...look up the page on typhus , you will find that the morality rate on people who are not treated with any medicine is 60 plus percent.</span> <span id="s275">My father in the 74 patients had only 3 deaths, and the only three people were people who begged him to die.</span> <span id="s276">They said they would like...love to die in a bed.</span> <span id="s277">They are too tired to continue their life.</span> <span id="s278">And the Godless in medicine that I practiced for 40 years, I learned that when a patient does not...when a patient does not have...uh... the will to live, he doesn't live.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">T:That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">B:This was the job of my father.</span> <span id="s281">Now I would like to mention a few recollections of my father's.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">T:Too late.</span> <span id="s283">It's too late.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">B:A few recollections...</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q:You're fine.</span> <span id="s286">You have 10 minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">B:Of my father.</span> <span id="s288">What the recollection.</span> <span id="s289">What do I remember of my father?</span> <span id="s290">I remember my father teaching me the morality of life, which the logic in life morality which I greatly appreciate.</span> <span id="s291">I also remember of few things of my father.</span> <span id="s292">My father practiced medicine for 40 years, like myself, and never sent a bill to a patient.</span> <span id="s293">And I always was wondering how he survived.</span> <span id="s294">But he did survive.</span> <span id="s295">And he always told me that the last...that the last bill he got paid was the heaviest payment he got.</span> <span id="s296">And the...I have to mention it because it's very important.</span> <span id="s297">That was...there was a patient in 1938 a woman was brought to the Jewish hospital.</span> <span id="s298">She was very poor.</span> <span id="s299">The husband was working as a clean...horse cleaner in the Jewish brewer in Lithuanian, which happened to be a Jewish brewery.</span> <span id="s300">My father took care of her in 38.</span> <span id="s301">My mother put packages of clothes for her, and I remember the house calls that my father used to make and take me because it was in and I loved to go.</span> <span id="s302">I loved to go for a ride.</span> <span id="s303">In 1939, as you recall...uh... the Germans took away the...uh...the port of Clipedell.</span> <span id="s304">The Lithuanians got very upset.</span> <span id="s305">They took all the Lithuanians of German descent to...uh.</span> <span id="s306">.</span> <span id="s307">and send them to...uh...Germany.</span> <span id="s308">This man knew only to clean horses, and in 1944 when my father and I and Dr. , and Dr. and...and got to...lager...Dachau, lager 2, this man was the chief of command of the SS.</span> <span id="s309">He recognized my father and he extend the most unbelievable courtesy.</span> <span id="s310">In fact, he risked his life to help us.</span> <span id="s311">One of the things he did outside of helping us in food and I have to mention later a few things, but basically he...uh...when my...when the first patient... person died in lager 2, I wrote in the report 'Died of starvation.'</span> <span id="s312">Well, to make a long story short, this... this report went to Dachau...to Berlin, to send the Commission, and the chief doctor of Dachau who later was hung in the Nuremberg trial was looking for my father to kill him because he wrote a report and a commission came to investigate.</span> <span id="s313">At that time the German SS were stealing food, and they were investigating exactly that problem.</span> <span id="s314">This SS man of my father's friend took my father out, and my father lived for 6 week in his house til the storm was over.</span> <span id="s315">And...uh...I..</span> <span id="s316">.</span> <span id="s317">I..</span> <span id="s318">.</span> <span id="s319">after the war, letters were written by Dr. Nobliski and Dr. Pepsico to save this man from the gallow because he helped.</span> <span id="s320">The other thing I want to tell to tell I was in Israel one day and I went into a famous bakery kaposki.</span> <span id="s321">And I didn't know about it, but I recognized...he recognized me...Kaposki, the son.</span> <span id="s322">And he immediately called his father and he kissed me and hugged me and said, "You don't know what your father did for me."</span> <span id="s323">At that time, the son was dying.</span> <span id="s324">He had no meat, no protein and needed meat.</span> <span id="s325">My father asked this man to provide meat.</span> <span id="s326">He didn't...and the German obliged him.</span> <span id="s327">He brought meat for Kaposki's son to save him.</span> <span id="s328">But I was a muscleman myself and I didn't have meat, and my father did not worry about me because I was not in the medical condition...medical physical condition that he...so this is the character of my father.</span> <span id="s329">That one of the dramatic things of my father which took me many years to understand is when my...when the Russian left Lithuanian and the Germans

the hospital.</span> <span id="s340">Uh...I have...I cannot...I feel that my father...his morality, his philosophy, he lived by it and he taught me the way of life.</span> <span id="s341">Sometimes I listened to him.</span> <span id="s342">Sometimes I deviated a little from it, but I am very grateful to his being him and teaching me the things that I..</span> <span id="s343">.</span> <span
