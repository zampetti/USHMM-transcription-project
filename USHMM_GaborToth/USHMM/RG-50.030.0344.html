you begin by telling me your name and your name at the time of the war, where you were born and when you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Answer: Okay.</span> <span id="s13">My name is Emily Schleissner now.</span> <span id="s14">My maiden was Tausek.</span> <span id="s15">I was born in Prague.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: When?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: September 22, 1914.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: Tell me a little bit about your family in Prague when you were a girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: Well, we were just simple people.</span> <span id="s20">My father was working and my mother was at home.</span> <span id="s21">And we didn't do anything special.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: What kind of work did your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: He was a company representative, a salesman, in .</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: Did you have any brothers or sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: I had a sister, yes.</span> <span id="s26">She was two years younger than I.</span> <span id="s27">We didn't do anything special.</span> <span id="s28">We just went to school and that was about all.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: Was your family religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s31">We went to the temple on high holy days and we belonged to a temple, but we were not religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Was your school mixed, or was it a Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: The first five years I went to a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s34">Just for Jewish children.</span> <span id="s35">It was a regular school, but just for Jewish children.</span> <span id="s36">And then I had to go to the regular school from the sixth grade on.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: So your friends were both Jews and Christians?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s39">But mostly Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: In Prague, do you feel like you lived in a Jewish world, or was everybody pretty well mixed?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: Pretty well mixed.</span> <span id="s42">I went to a Jewish school, but just through the fifth grade.</span> <span id="s43">But then it was pretty mixed.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: And everyone got along?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: More or less, yes.</span> <span id="s46">I mean there might have been some single people or so.</span> <span id="s47">But pretty much okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Do you remember any antisemitism before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s50">I mean you never trusted everybody, but it wasn't really enticing or anything.</span> <span id="s51">Maybe felt it more because he was from a German speaking area.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: But it was pretty comfortable?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: For me it was pretty comfortable, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Now, as a girl were you involved in any political organizations or Zionist organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Once in a while I went to some Zionist meetings or so, but not really as a rule.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: And your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Neither.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: What were you doing at the time of the beginning of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: I had a job with a lawyer who was married to a Jewish woman, so he kept me because he wasn't enticing me and I think he needed me because I knew Czech and German with both shorthand and that was useful.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Prior to the German occupation, did you know much about what was happening in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Well we heard about it, but we didn't like it so we didn't want to have it too.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Were there refugees coming in to Prague who told you things?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: They were, yeah, but not too many that I was in contact with.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: So you were working at the time when the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s65">Can you tell me what you remember about that day and when was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Well we didn't feel comfortable, but since it did not affect me personally, I was pretty indifferent.</span> <span id="s67">We didn't like it, but since I could go on working and could stay in my home, we were pretty indifferent; let's put it this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Naive?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Maybe naive, yeah.</span> <span id="s70">Because, as I say, it was hard to believe so; it was easy enough to believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: So when did the Germans come into Prague -- what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: To me personally, not too much.</span> <span id="s73">The only thing, I was working for the lawyer and we had German clients.</span> <span id="s74">But they behaved towards me okay.</span> <span id="s75">They needed me more or less.</span> <span id="s76">I was working for them.</span> <span id="s77">I was typing their things because the other girls in the office didn't know how to type German, so I didn't feel too much personally.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Did the clients know that you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Yes, most of them.</span> <span id="s80">The ones we were working with did know it and the new ones, when Germans came, we didn't say it.</span> <span id="s81">They probably suspected it, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s83">But what I would like to learn more about is -- the Germans occupied Prague in March of 1939, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: What happened the day they came in?</span> <span id="s86">What did you see?</span> <span id="s87">What was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: They were marching through the streets.</span> <span id="s89">Look today.</span> <span id="s90">Let's put it this way, it was simpler.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Was it frightening?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: Maybe people were afraid.</span> <span id="s93">But I wasn't -- personally, I wasn't too much afraid.</span> <span id="s94">I know I speak German and what can they do to me.</span> <span id="s95">If they need something from me they will come, but I think, what can they do to me?</span> <span id="s96">I was naive, but it was easier to think this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Were they hurting people?</span> <span id="s98">Were they beating people?</span> <span id="s99">Were they shooting -- anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: They might have, but I didn't know it and even if there was something going on close, I probably looked away.</span> <span id="s101">It was simple.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: And your parents too?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: My parents too.</span> <span id="s104">As long as they let us work.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Now in the beginning did the Germans take any people away or -- you know, like they did in some places?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: They did, but they did not take away people that I knew or that I knew well.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: But you knew they were taking people away?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s109">We knew it, but what could we do?</span> <span id="s110">Not too much.</span> <span id="s111">If anything, maybe look away.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Who were they taking away?</span> <span id="s113">Was it a particular group of people?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: I don't know whether it was a particular group.</span> <span id="s115">Someone was in their way or someone wanted his work, or so, they found an excuse to take him away.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: So it wasn't rounding up the Intelligencia or something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Not really like this, no.</span> <span id="s118">Not in Prague, at least.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: So after the Germans came in, did they establish a number of rules for the Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: They might have, but they didn't touch me too much.</span> <span id="s121">So I didn't care too much.</span> <span id="s122">No, they're not against me too much.</span> <span id="s123">The rules were not applying to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: Do you remember what some of the rules were?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Not really by now.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Did you have to wear a Jewish star?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s128">I wore it in the office and when we had no Jewish clients it was covered.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Was your father able to continue his work?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s131">He was working on -- he was a salesman and getting commissions, so it wasn't so terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: And your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: My sister went to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Were Jewish people allowed to continue studying and in business as a rule?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: Not at the university.</span> <span id="s136">In business, more or less.</span> <span id="s137">Because it wasn't public so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: What about --</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: I couldn't continue my studies at the university, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: What about continuing to temple, that sort of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Yeah, we could, more or less.</span> <span id="s142">It wasn't so open.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: So they didn't close anything down.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: Not that I know of.</span> <span id="s145">In some places it might have.</span> <span id="s146">But not where we went.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: One more question about when they were starting to send the people away.</span> <span id="s148">Did you know where they were going, or what was the rumor?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: The rumor was that it's a concentration camp, but we wouldn't want to believe it.</span> <span id="s150">I mean, it was unpleasant to believe it, so we just took it -- "what can we do?"</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Now, did they ever establish in Prague sort of a group of Jewish leaders who would help maintain order or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: They did, but I didn't know them.</span> <span id="s153">As I say, I was working for a lawyer who was married to a Jewish woman, but it didn't concern him that he is employing me.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: So what you're telling me is that for you personally, life didn't change too terribly much?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: No.</span> <span id="s156">For me personally not.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Were a lot of people trying to get out of Prague at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: I don't know about a lot, but the ones who had somebody who could help them tried and went.</span> <span id="s159">But I didn't have anywhere to go, so I didn't even try.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Were people going to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: People were going to Israel, but I didn't want to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s162">I said "I am not Zionist and I don't want to take place of people who belong there".</span> <span id="s163">It was funny, but that was my etiquette</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: So when did everything change for you from this normal life?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: I think when they sent me to the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: It was in '49.</span> <span id="s168">It was pretty early after they came about, I would say about eight months after they came in.</span> <span id="s169">But they sent me to Theresienstadt and I didn't believe that's terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s171">Let me just backtrack a little.</span> <span id="s172">Now I have a note -- I don't know if this is correct -- that you went to Theresienstadt in December of 1941.</span> <span id="s173">Does that sound about right?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s175">Also it's a beginning of Theresienstadt, almost.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: And how did this deportation come about?</span> <span id="s177">Do you remember what happened that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: They told me be there at 8:00 in the morning on this and this day at the place where they assembled us and they registered us and they took God knows what kind of -- take as they wanted from us and they sent us in the train, and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Were you with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Did they tell you where you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: Well, we heard us go to Theresienstadt and since it was in Bohemia, we were not so scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Did you take things with you?</span> <span id="s184">Did they give you any instructions?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: Well we could take 50 kilo, including our bed spread and these things.</span> <span id="s186">We took what we could.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: What did you take?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: My clothes and -- mostly clothes.</span> <span id="s189">Maybe some food, but not too much because it was heavy and spoiled.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Do you remember -- I guess at this point you're talking about the German authorities or the Nazi's who were taking care of this process?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Were they polite to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: I didn't have too much to do with them.</span> <span id="s194">They sent me an invitation to be at that time at this place, and that was about all.</span> <span id="s195">I went.</span> <span id="s196">I didn't try to escape.</span> <span id="s197">I didn't try to get out.</span> <span id="s198">From today's point of view, it was the correct thing.</span> <span id="s199">But at that time we didn't know what was going on anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: Did you and your parents talk about it, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: No.</span> <span id="s202">We just took it as it came.</span> <span id="s203">We were simple people.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: What was the train ride like?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: Regular.</span> <span id="s206">At my time we still went in regular, personal wagons.</span> <span id="s207">Not in cattle wagons.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: So it all must have seemed somewhat normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: To me, I never complained.</span> <span id="s210">I did what I was told and that was it.</span> <span id="s211">It was simple.</span> <span id="s212">When I came there, there was somebody who I knew, and he said "do you want to work?"</span> <span id="s213">and I said "what else would I do?"</span> <span id="s214">and he said "they are looking for somebody in this office".</span> <span id="s215">It was on top.</span> <span id="s216">And that saved my life, more or less.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: Okay, we'll get to that.</span> <span id="s218">When you arrived at Theresienstadt it was about how far from Prague?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Not too far.</span> <span id="s220">It was three hours train ride about.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: What were your first impressions when you got off the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: I didn't think.</span> <span id="s223">I just took things as they came.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: What did it look like though?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Well when I came off the train there was nothing there, and when I came there, there were those places, or how you would call it, and they said "you go into this category, and you go into that one", and I was lucky.</span> <span id="s226">They told me you are assigned to this room and it happened to be a small house, and in my room, we were seven people.</span> <span id="s227">Sleeping on three or four mattresses from next to the other.</span> <span id="s228">And that was it.</span> <span id="s229">I didn't think too much.</span> <span id="s230">I just took things as they came.</span> <span id="s231">It's silly from today's point of view.</span> <span id="s232">But I did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: I'm just trying to get as much detail as possible.</span> <span id="s234">So you were sent to this room.</span> <span id="s235">Were you registered first?</span> <span id="s236">Was there some process, or were you just --</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: We were registered before we went onto the train.</span> <span id="s238">You know, so they had all our data already.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: And you were allowed to keep your regular clothes and wear them.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s241">At that time still, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: So did you share this house with your parents and other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Well my father had to go to the men's thing.</span> <span id="s244">The men's quarters.</span> <span id="s245">But that was in the big what-do-you-call-it -- and I went to the small place, to the small house.</span> <span id="s246">We were just seven people in a small room which was an advantage.</span> <span id="s247">We had three mattresses and we slept one next to the other, and the three mattresses filled the whole side of the room.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: And you were with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: I was with my mother, yes.</span> <span id="s250">Because I knew somebody and that somebody said "where's your mother?"</span> <span id="s251">I said "over here".</span> <span id="s252">He said "you take her with you."</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Now did you have your own bathrooms?</span> <span id="s254">What was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: It wasn't that .</span> <span id="s256">It was in this way .</span> <span id="s257">You know, and for -- and there were bathrooms there in the whole place for everybody, these showers, and you could take a bath every day under the shower, which was an advantage.</span> <span id="s258">We could keep clean.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: What about food?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: You had to go and -- at meal time we had to go with our small plate or shistle (ph) and get whatever they gave us.</span> <span id="s261">It was mostly soup and a little something extra.</span> <span id="s262">We survived on it.</span> <span id="s263">Let's put it this way.</span> <span id="s264">If somebody had somebody who worked in the kitchen, they stole.</span> <span id="s265">They got some.</span> <span id="s266">My mother worked in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s267">She didn't steal too much, but we had something extra.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: In terms of food, were people allowed to get packages from outside the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: Did people have gardens?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: Yes, they were allowed to get packages.</span> <span id="s272">Not too many.</span> <span id="s273">I think once every month or so, or two months.</span> <span id="s274">Brown package.</span> <span id="s275">And most of them were opened and half of the things were stolen probably, but we could get packages.</span> <span id="s276">Of course, I didn't have anybody to send me packages.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: Did you all have gardens, or you just had to rely on what the kitchen gave you?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: What the kitchen gave us.</span> <span id="s279">I mean, somebody worked in gardens, so they stole and got some more.</span> <span id="s280">At one time I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: But you had enough or you were hungry, or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: I, personally, was not hungry.</span> <span id="s283">Because, as I say, my mother worked in the kitchen and then I was married to the chief physician, and he had extra.</span> <span id="s284">He got extra assigned so that he wouldn't steal, or people around him wouldn't steal.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Tell me a little bit about what the daily life was like.</span> <span id="s286">Were there roll calls, were there things like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: Not really where I worked.</span> <span id="s288">I just got up in the morning and had to get ready and get to my office.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: And what was the work that you did in the office?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Regular office work.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: What was the purpose of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: I'd write reports that were submitted to the Germans and reports that were submitted to the other Jewish agencies.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: What kind of reports?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: I couldn't tell exactly.</span> <span id="s295">What we have done, what was supposed to be done, and things like that, but I don't dream about any more what those reports really were about.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Was somebody basically directing or writing these reports and then you would process them and you would type them?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: I would type them.</span> <span id="s298">They were dictated to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: Was it a large office?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Well, that depends on what you compare it with, but it was a regular office, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: About how many people worked with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: About ten.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: And who was your supervisor or your director.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: You ask me something different.</span> <span id="s305">I don't know any more.</span> <span id="s306">I mean, I know his name.</span> <span id="s307">He was .</span> <span id="s308">But he was assigned to be the leader of one department and I worked under him.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: He was Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: So you were all preparing reports about the administration of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s313">To the administration.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: Now was this a pretty good job?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Considering from today, it was the best I could have gotten because I was more or less protected.</span> <span id="s316">They wouldn't send me away because they needed me.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Did you have access to any special information by working in there?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Once in a while maybe they brought something.</span> <span id="s319">But I couldn't use it anyway, so I wouldn't say I had a special possibilities or special things.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: But did you just have more information maybe than the average person?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s322">Definitely.</span> <span id="s323">But if I could use it somehow -- from today's point of view, I wouldn't be able to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: Do you remember what kind of information?</span> <span id="s325">You worked in there a long time, so that's why I'm wondering.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: Whatever the Germans wanted us to know or to do, we got it first.</span> <span id="s327">I can't remember any more what information was .</span> <span id="s328">The only thing I know since I was working there, I was some how protected.</span> <span id="s329">Not to be sent away.</span> <span id="s330">And since I was married at that time, my parents were protected by me, so they wouldn't be by the terrorists.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: They didn't divide families on the deportations too much?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: The Jews were mostly putting the transports together, so, you know, this way they did not divide families unless somebody did something that wasn't supposed to be done.</span> <span id="s333">Steal or something.</span> <span id="s334">You know, that they found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Well you bring up something interesting, which is the internal administration of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s336">Who ran the ghetto and how organized was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: .</span> <span id="s338">First it was just the Czech Jews.</span> <span id="s339">And then came the Germans, so the top men were from Germany.</span> <span id="s340">But otherwise --</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: So you're saying that the camp was run really by the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: Yeah, but it was pretty well organized.</span> <span id="s343">I mean, the Germans would talk to it if they didn't like something and give some general orders, but to do it, to comply, it was a Jewish business.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: And were the Germans around a lot in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: They had their quarters which were inside the camp.</span> <span id="s346">But if somebody saw a German, he tried to go around them as far as possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: They weren't too threatening though?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s349">Maybe someone did something or some of the fellows felt bad, he might have hurt the Jew when he saw him and the Jew did not get out of the way quickly enough, or so, he might have hit him, or something.</span> <span id="s350">But not in our camp.</span> <span id="s351">Let's put it this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: So when we're talking about this Jewish administration, what were they in charge of?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: Well, what an administration would do.</span> <span id="s354">You know, give jobs, or say this and that has to be done, or complied with the Germans order that has to be done, but mostly it was the orders from the Germans that we got, or that they got to comply.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: You said they were also responsible for the transports?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Yes and no.</span> <span id="s357">An order came from the Germans, for instance, on this and this date, one thousand Jews have to be going east.</span> <span id="s358">We didn't know where east was, or we didn't want to know where east was.</span> <span id="s359">Everybody was afraid that it's worse than from where we are coming.</span> <span id="s360">And a thousand Jews had to go.</span> <span id="s361">No matter what.</span> <span id="s362">And they sent them and we were afraid it's worse -- in Terezin we heard some rumors where they are going to, but it was so terrible that nobody wanted to believe it.</span> <span id="s363">Nobody would have believed that there were gas chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Who had to make that list of the thousand people.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Well the Jews really.</span> <span id="s366">But they were instructions, for instance, everybody over 55 years, or under 25, or everybody who has done this work, or that work has to go.</span> <span id="s367">And it was always bad feelings about it.</span> <span id="s368">Among the Jews too, because everybody thought "if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't have to go" or things like that.</span> <span id="s369">It was a very sad business.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Did that come through your office?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: Sometimes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: The orders?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: I understand that within Terezin there was a whole court system and everything, is that true?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: If you want to call it that, yes.</span> <span id="s376">If someone did something we had a court and he was set before the court, and was maybe sentenced to spend a few days somewhere locked up, or so, but I don't know too much about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: What I'm trying to understand is that it sounds like there was this semblance of a whole city -- all the regular functions and activities of a city there.</span> <span id="s378">Is that --</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: Well, as much as the Jews could do it, yes.</span> <span id="s380">But we were supervised by the Germans and if the Germans didn't like something it couldn't be done.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: Was this ghetto or camp enclosed?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s383">You couldn't get out.</span> <span id="s384">You can flee somehow.</span> <span id="s385">Hide and go somewhere but if they caught us, and where to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Did people escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: A few might have, but it wasn't made public.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Could you move around pretty much within the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s390">After it was closed, yes.</span> <span id="s391">Before, not.</span> <span id="s392">We had to have passes to get from one building to the other or things like that.</span> <span id="s393">But after it was closed, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: How soon after the beginning was it enclosed, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: I would say about a year, a year and a half.</span> <span id="s396">As long as they got the non-Jews out.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: So in the beginning there were non-Jews living there?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Well, they couldn't move everyone.</span> <span id="s399">And those people didn't want to go because they were living in their houses, you know, that they owned and they didn't want to leave it.</span> <span id="s400">So in the beginning there were non-Jews there.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: And then eventually they moved away.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Yeah, they moved them out.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: So I'm trying to get a picture of this because this is different than many other places.</span> <span id="s404">Basically, you moved in and took over a city?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s406">After a while, not at the beginning, but little by little, and about a year after it was started we had the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: So all kinds of buildings that are in a normal city?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Not buildings, these were big casernan (ph.), if you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s409">So there were some houses and people who were lucky got assigned to live in a house after they evacuated the civilians.</span> <span id="s410">But that was a big advantage, and they lived in the upstairs without --</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: Do you remember some of the leaders of the ghetto</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: I knew them all.</span> <span id="s413">I was working with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Well -- the first one was --</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Edelstein and , and then came the Germans.</span> <span id="s416">Epstein was the name of the German Jew who took them over.</span> <span id="s417">I mean from Germany.</span> <span id="s418">In the beginning, we were just from Czechoslovakia or from Bohemia and Moravia, but then they came, the ones from Germany, and they were assigned the top job, for instance.</span> <span id="s419">After the Germans came, the top leader was a German.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: What kind of leaders were they; were they good men?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s422">When they could help they would help.</span> <span id="s423">Otherwise they would have to do what they were told by the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: In general, did you and the other people living there respect them?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: We did not disrespect them.</span> <span id="s426">We took them for granted.</span> <span id="s427">Maybe somebody did respect them, you know, one of them or the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: But there must have been a big difference between the way one would run the camp and another one would; there must have been a difference between Edelstein and Mermelstein (ph.)?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Yeah, but they did not really have to run it by themselves.</span> <span id="s430">They had to run it together.</span> <span id="s431">Mermelstein we didn't like, but not because he was bad but because personally.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Why, what do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s434">He was a funny fellow, let's put it this way.</span> <span id="s435">I couldn't say why.</span> <span id="s436">I, personally, didn't like him.</span> <span id="s437">That's for sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: Were they corrupt?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: I don't think so.</span> <span id="s440">They couldn't have been too much corrupt if they accepted from somebody something sometimes, it's possible, but there wasn't too much to be corrupted by.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Did you have any contact from the outside world?</span> <span id="s442">Did you have radios or letters?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: I think somebody had radios.</span> <span id="s444">Some people who smuggled them in somehow or had some relatives who smuggled them in for them and -- I didn't have any personally.</span> <span id="s445">Not a radio, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: So you didn't know too much about what was going on with the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Well, we heard something, of course.</span> <span id="s448">You know, rumors were always coming and they had deliveries and the delivery men would tell us.</span> <span id="s449">Not me personally, but if you tell one, everybody else almost knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: So what were you earning?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: What were you earning.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Not too much.</span> <span id="s454">Just live and know how to live and get by.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: You mentioned your work.</span> <span id="s456">Were there a lot of other type of jobs?</span> <span id="s457">Your mother worked in the kitchen, what about your dad?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: My dad.</span> <span id="s459">It was the funniest thing what he could have done.</span> <span id="s460">They sent him to the sewing machines.</span> <span id="s461">Before he came to the camp he never saw a sewing machine in his life.</span> <span id="s462">But he could and they told him he should do so.</span> <span id="s463">I still can't believe that he was working on that.</span> <span id="s464">It's beyond the point.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: Was there a lot of industry, I mean, was there all kinds of different work?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: It wasn't all kinds of different work, but they came -- some of the Germans wanted to have something done for himself maybe even.</span> <span id="s467">So he supplied the means.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Was the ghetto making things for the war effort or was it basically trying to keep itself going?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: Well, whenever they had something they let us do something for the war effort, but I don't remember right now what it would have been.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: Was the ghetto self-supporting?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: More or less, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: So you mentioned a few times your husband.</span> <span id="s473">How did this come about and who was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: He was a chief physician and I met him and we liked each other and he had a room for himself, so it was much more comfortable to live together and then, officially, I had my bed three rooms away from him, but we lived together.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: And?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: Nobody objected.</span> <span id="s477">There wasn't anybody to report it to.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: Did most people have this kind of freedom?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: Most couldn't have because there were not so many rooms available.</span> <span id="s480">But if they could, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: What was his name, this chief physician.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: Monk (ph).</span> <span id="s483">Dr. Erich Monk (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: And you met him early on?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s486">I was working and I had to work during the night and he was working too, so we met this way.</span> <span id="s487">So when I had a chance to go and sleep somewhere, I had a boss who had a room with him together and when my boss was working I could sleep in my boss' bed.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: Now, you said you got married there.</span> <span id="s489">Was there some sort of official ceremony?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Yeah, there was.</span> <span id="s491">They were wise enough there that they performed.</span> <span id="s492">It wasn't married to the outside, but it was married in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: I'm going to ask you maybe a strange question, but I --</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: Whatever you want to ask.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: I'm curious.</span> <span id="s496">When people like you got married in a camp or in a ghetto, would you -- I guess you were in love -- but did you do it thinking that you would have some future together?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: We figured that much.</span> <span id="s498">The only thing is that they sent him away and I wanted to go with him, but he knew more than I.</span> <span id="s499">He was going to go not to come back.</span> <span id="s500">And he didn't want, as he said, three people on his conscience because my parents would have had to go with me.</span> <span id="s501">His mother had to go too when he was sent.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: He was sent later on?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: When was he sent?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: It was at the end when the people still could go -- be sent to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: So you got married and though, well you'll get through this and --</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: Well, we'd be together, but he didn't survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: Tell me a little bit about him.</span> <span id="s509">He had a very important position there?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: He was a leading physician; he was the chief physician.</span> <span id="s511">But ask what you want to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: Was there a big medical operation there?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s514">It was pretty big.</span> <span id="s515">There was a hospital.</span> <span id="s516">There was a hospital there before and they turned it over to the Jews.</span> <span id="s517">So at the regular hospital we had good physicians.</span> <span id="s518">Better than on the outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: A lot of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: Enough, yes.</span> <span id="s521">Some of them were sent away or some attorney was sent away and they went with them, but we had -- considering what were, and where we were, we had lots of physicians.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: What about medical supplies and equipment?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: The Germans wanted -- were afraid if something breaks out in the camp, it will go outside and they will be affected.</span> <span id="s524">So they supplied us this equipment and these supplies.</span> <span id="s525">Medicines and things like that.</span> <span id="s526">Because of that.</span> <span id="s527">Not because they liked the Jews.</span> <span id="s528">They liked to help the Jews, but they were afraid for themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: Was there a lot of illness at the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: Comparatively not.</span> <span id="s531">Because the Jews took care of themselves.</span> <span id="s532">But there was, of course, you know, enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Was there disease?</span> <span id="s534">Did people die there?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s536">We had a cemetery even.</span> <span id="s537">Because they had to put the Jews somewhere and they didn't want them outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: No crematorium?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: There was one, but I don't think it was used too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: So people had a proper burial there, or a mass grave</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: Whatever they could find.</span> <span id="s542">The family made some arrangements.</span> <span id="s543">It was a mass grave sometimes.</span> <span id="s544">They found a place where to bury them or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: I understand that there were a lot of different specialists in the medical community.</span> <span id="s546">Did they take all kinds of operations?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Operations -- no, they put the Jews -- the Jewish doctors were there, so there were all kinds of specialties.</span> <span id="s548">And if they could make an operation, if the doctor would think it would be good and he could learn something from it too on top of it, he would do an operation.</span> <span id="s549">We got the supplies.</span> <span id="s550">The Germans gave us supplies because they didn't want an epidemic.</span> <span id="s551">They were afraid for themselves, mostly.</span> <span id="s552">Not for the Jews.</span> <span id="s553">But, you know, how can you confine an epidemic in a small place?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Did the Germans get treated by these Jewish doctors also?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: Not as a rule, but some of them preferred them from the German doctors.</span> <span id="s556">They came on the sly.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Were there a lot of nurses?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Well, yes.</span> <span id="s559">As many as we needed were there.</span> <span id="s560">Some of them came as nurses and some of them learned.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: And your husband basically ran the whole operation or he actually worked on patients.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Both.</span> <span id="s563">He worked on patients whom he knew and who he could treat.</span> <span id="s564">But normally he was assigned to people to treat or to work in this place or that.</span> <span id="s565">We had more doctors than we needed and we had better doctors than the people outside.</span> <span id="s566">Let's put it this way.</span> <span id="s567">Because we had doctors who were something and somebody before they came to the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: Did your husband ever talk to you about special concerns with what he was trying to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Yes and no.</span> <span id="s570">We all felt -- everybody feared to get out of Theresienstadt because everybody was afraid it's worse than Theresienstadt itself.</span> <span id="s571">How much worse and how much other people knew than I did, I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: But did he talk about special problems in even running the hospital, or things he needed?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: It was running by itself more or less.</span> <span id="s574">We had more doctors than we needed and better doctors than they had on the outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: Now what about -- I would think for some people maybe they would need some kind of social -- psychiatric counseling.</span> <span id="s576">Was that ever done there.</span> <span id="s577">I don' know whether it was done as, you know, just to help to it as specialty or what.</span> <span id="s578">But there were people who did it.</span> <span id="s579">They were doctors who did it.</span> <span id="s580">It was for their own better.</span> <span id="s581">You know, so to be able to practice and to see how it works.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: It was also a bit of a laboratory is what you're saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Now you mentioned -- well I think -- wasn't there a famous psychiatrist there?</span> <span id="s585">Wasn't there a Dr. Frankel?</span> <span id="s586">Did you know him?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: I don't remember.</span> <span id="s588">We had better doctors than the people on the outside.</span> <span id="s589">Let's put it this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: Do you remember whether there was much of a problem with suicide?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s592">I mean, I don't remember, but I don't think there were many people who committed suicide.</span> <span id="s593">There might have been some.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: You had mentioned the Germans coming in.</span> <span id="s595">Tell me a little bit about who were the other prisoners or inmates or whatever you want to call yourself.</span> <span id="s596">Who you were.</span> <span id="s597">It started off with people from Prague and --</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: Well, I was working for a lawyer and he kept me for as long as they let me work.</span> <span id="s599">As long as I was someone to go to the camp.</span> <span id="s600">So I wasn't affected too much.</span> <span id="s601">But I know that many people could not work any more because the employers didn't want to be accused that they were helping Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: This was back in Prague?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: Okay, but when you went to the camp, the ghetto, at that time it was mostly Czech Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s606">Mostly, but then they started to send people from Germany there too.</span> <span id="s607">And even from the ones that were in Holland.</span> <span id="s608">Some people succeeded to get out to Holland and when they got hold of them, they took them also.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: So all these different groups that came in, was everybody mixed together?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: They tried to stay together.</span> <span id="s611">The groups that came in tried to stay together because they knew each other.</span> <span id="s612">But how long could they stay -- they sent half of them or how many out of the group.</span> <span id="s613">They were sent to Poland because Theresienstadt wasn't such a big town.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: So you all had to mix together eventually?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Now when the Germans and Austrians arrived -- you don't remember when that is, do you?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: When they arrived, did they seem different than you?</span> <span id="s619">Did they have different expectations?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: They had different expectations, and it went even that far that even some time or one time a German said "if our Fuhrer knew how you treat us, if our Fuhrer".</span> <span id="s621">Because they thought, you know, since they are Germans, Hitler would take care of them better than of the Czechs.</span> <span id="s622">But that was what some of them said, "if our Fuhrer knew".</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: How did the Czech people react to the Germans who came in -- what did they think of them?</span> <span id="s624">How did you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: We took them for granted.</span> <span id="s626">They came the same as we, and the German Jews, they expected to be treated better which is true because "our Fuhrer", but they were not.</span> <span id="s627">And they got assigned the same as the others and then came an order, a thousand Jews have to go, so how do you select a thousand Jews and don't make a mistake, let's put it this way, or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: Were there ever tensions between the Germans and the Czechs and the people from Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: Oh, sure, sure.</span> <span id="s630">From Holland, not.</span> <span id="s631">Dutch people were nice, but the Germans were saying to the Czechs, "if our Fuhrer knew how you treat us", that you don't treat us better.</span> <span id="s632">That was tensions.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: Did that cause problems?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s635">It caused problem not to me personally, but I am sure there were bases where it was a problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: And didn't some Danish people also come?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: They were separate.</span> <span id="s638">They were not allowed -- Denmark -- since they had to go they made a rule that they may not be sent to Poland and they even got them out of Theresienstadt shortly before the war ended.</span> <span id="s639">Because they were working for them.</span> <span id="s640">They were our citizens and we were responsible for them and they were protecting them.</span> <span id="s641">I mean, there were not so terribly many, but Denmark took care of their Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Were there a lot of children in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: Well, the regular family has children and they were sent to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s644">The children came along.</span> <span id="s645">And there were children born in Theresienstadt, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: That was allowed?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: That was allowed.</span> <span id="s648">Well what can you do.</span> <span id="s649">We were human beings, and what can you do?</span> <span id="s650">I mean the people who had them were human beings.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: But the Germans allowed children to be born?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: Once they were born they didn't do anything to them.</span> <span id="s653">They didn't like it, but what could they do?</span> <span id="s654">Sometimes they sent the parents with the children, but that wasn't as a rule.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: So women were getting pregnant in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: And that was allowed?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: It wasn't allowed officially.</span> <span id="s659">When she wanted to have an abortion, she could have it.</span> <span id="s660">And if she did not, they didn't do too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: So they didn't force women to have abortions?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: No, not really, but who wanted to have a child in a camp like that.</span> <span id="s663">So most of them did have abortions on their own really.</span> <span id="s664">On their own will.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Did you ever get pregnant?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: Did the children live separately?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Sometimes.</span> <span id="s668">They had some camps where they had the children separately if the parents were working, both of them.</span> <span id="s669">And sometimes no.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: I understand that when the Germans came in, the Austrian Jews, they sent a lot of older people, a lot of people from hospitals.</span> <span id="s671">Is that true?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: Well they sent the other ones to Poland.</span> <span id="s673">So what they had to send the usually sick or older people.</span> <span id="s674">It came by itself, let's put it this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: That probably changed the balance in the camps in terms of working people.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s677">But as I say, they came from Austria or so, and they came.</span> <span id="s678">The people who work they were sending to work and the older people remained and they sent them to Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: When they began deporting when they'd make the list of a thousand Jews, or whatever, to the east, were there certain categories of people who went first?</span> <span id="s680">Did they send --</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s682">They were sending everybody over 65 or everybody with this and this condition has to be sent or so.</span> <span id="s683">There were some instructions.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: What about women?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: The same.</span> <span id="s686">I mean they said over 65 whether they were female or male, it didn't matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: What I'm wondering is if they would keep the men around longer because they thought they were better workers or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: They might in some cases.</span> <span id="s689">If somebody knew something special they wouldn't let him go because they needed his work.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: Did you feel that women were treated the same as men there?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: I would say from a Jewish point of view, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: Who were the guards there?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: The Germans mostly, but they took some Jewish people to do this or this as guards.</span> <span id="s694">But nothing extra.</span> <span id="s695">Any Czech guards.</span> <span id="s696">The same as the Germans.</span> <span id="s697">They didn't make any distinctions between the Germans or the Czechs.</span> <span id="s698">If they needed them they took them.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: What about all of the prominent Citizens who were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: There were some that were by the Germans designated; that they cannot be moved away or have be in special quarters.</span> <span id="s701">But there were not too many compared to the whole population.</span> <span id="s702">But they had some extra people that the Germans wanted to protect because they thought they would need them more.</span> <span id="s703">If they know something.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: What kind of people were they; what kind of people are we talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: I couldn't tell you.</span> <span id="s706">Some scientists.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: And they had special privileges.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: Not special privileges, but they lived in better quarters.</span> <span id="s709">They had a house assigned where they lived together more or less.</span> <span id="s710">To be available when the Germans wanted something from them.</span> <span id="s711">Some advice or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: Were these people resented or were they respected?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: I don't think people cared too much.</span> <span id="s714">There were not so many and so I don't think people cared too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: Now Theresienstadt was thought of as a modern camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: That is what they said, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: And what does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: They didn't send people away immediately.</span> <span id="s719">They had some extra food sometimes.</span> <span id="s720">They treated us nicer than maybe somewhere else.</span> <span id="s721">I don't know much more.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Tell me about the cultural life there.</span> <span id="s723">Was there much?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s725">Because everybody who knew something tried to apply it for his own sake and for the sake of the others.</span> <span id="s726">So I don't know everything, but we had pretty much to be proud of.</span> <span id="s727">Let's put it this way.</span> <span id="s728">Because of the people who were there and said about those things, were talking about those things.</span> <span id="s729">I don't think I could tell you too much about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: Let me ask you some questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: We're talking about music, poetry, theater.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s734">Music we had if somebody was a musician who was writing music, he wrote it, and he had a chance to have it worked on Poetry, it was a personal thing.</span> <span id="s735">Yes.</span> <span id="s736">If he wanted to write he was allowed to write, whether he would use it somewhere or not it was up to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: Theater?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: Theater, yes we had some.</span> <span id="s739">We had some.</span> <span id="s740">But we were better than the outside because we had actors and we had seamstresses who maybe sometimes did some things for them to wear, but we were lucky that we had a cultural life.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: Do you thing that helped sustain people?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: I would say yes.</span> <span id="s743">In many cases, yes.</span> <span id="s744">They didn't feel like being enemies.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Was there a lot of this; were there a lot of musicians and concerts?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: I know there were some.</span> <span id="s747">I don't know .</span> <span id="s748">Because they did it hidden or so.</span> <span id="s749">You know, if they could perform somewhere and the Germans wouldn't have to see it, they would do it.</span> <span id="s750">And if the Germans couldn't see it we couldn't see it either at many times.</span> <span id="s751">But we had pretty good cultural life.</span> <span id="s752">Thank God.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: Did you go to a lot of these performances?</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: I went.</span> <span id="s755">I didn't go to a lot but I was allowed to go.</span> <span id="s756">And being on the top I went -- I knew where they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: So did the Germans allow this; did they encourage it?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: They didn't encourage it but they did not prohibit it expressly.</span> <span id="s759">And I believe some of them even went to see it because they didn't have it on the outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: Were there certain things that were not allowed politically or --</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: Well politically maybe, but I don't know which they were.</span> <span id="s762">Others maybe too but I don't know about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: Where would the performers perform?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: Well in the camp we had rooms enough and they could be guarded.</span> <span id="s765">Let's put it this way.</span> <span id="s766">If the Germans were close, the lights went out.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: Unless it was one of these that was allowed?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s769">But otherwise, the lights went out and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: What about educational activities?</span> <span id="s771">Was there any kind of teaching or instruction?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s773">Oh yes.</span> <span id="s774">Hidden, but it was.</span> <span id="s775">We had teachers enough.</span> <span id="s776">We had experienced people enough.</span> <span id="s777">And they did teach the children and even the grown-ups.</span> <span id="s778">We had more than the outside.</span> <span id="s779">Because we had the people outside.</span> <span id="s780">They were not allowed or they didn't have them.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: Do you think the children had a pretty reasonable life in there?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: Yes and no.</span> <span id="s783">I mean, what do you say about reasonable?</span> <span id="s784">They were allowed to sing, to gather together, to -- I think they had pretty reasonable life as a whole.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: Were they treated special?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: I don't know whether they were treated special because they were children, but whatever could be done for the children was done.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: What about the old people?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: That was sad.</span> <span id="s789">They couldn't take care of themselves and the old people was a sad story.</span> <span id="s790">If they didn't have any relatives who would bring them something extra to eat or so, it wasn't enough to eat and things like that.</span> <span id="s791">To be old in Theresienstadt without having family was very sad I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: Was there a kind of a system for taking care of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: There was, but not everybody could get in and there were too many to be taken care of by too few and things like that.</span> <span id="s794">That was sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: Were some of the musicians or artists given any kind of a special treatment or did they have more time to practice, or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: They could practice.</span> <span id="s797">Whether they had more time or not, I don't know.</span> <span id="s798">They could practice and if they had special treatment it was from the Jews, not from the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: Did you have to have tickets to go to these performances?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: I didn't, but maybe some had.</span> <span id="s801">I was, you know, a relative of the leading physician, so I didn't have to.</span> <span id="s802">I could go wherever I felt like, or could, or when I had time.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Was there money exchanged in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: Not officially, but there were people who exchanged money for some reason among themselves.</span> <span id="s805">I couldn't tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: Wasn't there a national currency from that ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: Yes, there was.</span> <span id="s808">But I don't remember too much about it.</span> <span id="s809">We got assigned at the beginning a certain amount.</span> <span id="s810">It wasn't too much, and what we did with it, they didn't care.</span> <span id="s811">So some people probably did something and some people didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: One more question about all this activity with schools or music -- and there was political activity as well was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: It wasn't officially allowed, let's put it this way; political.</span> <span id="s814">Music and that was, you know, we were better musicians and we had better musicians inside than there were outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: Did all of this culture kind of seem at odds with the situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: I couldn't tell.</span> <span id="s817">We had to take it as it came, and whether it was or not I couldn't tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: You didn't seem strange to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: No, not to me because I had access to those things, so I wouldn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: I guess what I'm wondering is that in the midst of this horrible war it's interesting that there was so much vitality.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: We didn't look outside.</span> <span id="s822">We took it as it came inside the ghetto, and what happened outside didn't have any influence any way.</span> <span id="s823">So as long as they didn't come to beat us or to take away things from us, we didn't know.</span> <span id="s824">We didn't want to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: Do you think that this represented kind of a spiritual resistance in a way?</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: Maybe to some people, yes.</span> <span id="s827">But I couldn't tell.</span> <span id="s828">I took things as they came.</span> <span id="s829">I was lucky.</span> <span id="s830">Because I came there early and someone asked me if I wanted to work, and I said "what else would I do" and I got where I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Now since this was supposed to be a model camp, were there visitors?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: They brought us some sometimes, but they prepared us and they said what we can say and what we can't, or how well they treated the Jews.</span> <span id="s833">To show how well they treated the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: How else did they prepare the camp for these visits?</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: Clean up everything and they gave us some things to show like some more food or some things like that.</span> <span id="s836">But unfortunately they did not come to often, and because what they gave us they took it then away -- they gave to one part and they took it away from the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: Who were these visitors?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: I couldn't tell.</span> <span id="s839">They were some Germans or some Dutch people.</span> <span id="s840">Some from Denmark.</span> <span id="s841">There were Genish (ph) Jews there.</span> <span id="s842">They treated the Genish Jews better.</span> <span id="s843">They gave them more to eat and when the Genish came they put them in their place, you know, told them what they may say or what they may not say.</span> <span id="s844">Or took them outside to talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: Do you remember the Red Cross visits?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: Not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: Did things change as time went on?</span> <span id="s848">You were there a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: Well in the beginning, we didn't have too much to eat, and we didn't have -- we couldn't go anywhere, and then they gave us more to eat and they let us go visit each other or things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: So you had more freedom after a while?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s852">Inside the ghetto we could move around freely.</span> <span id="s853">After they took all the not-Jews out of the town.</span> <span id="s854">We could move freely.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: Did it ever get really crowded?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: It depends what you feel like crowded.</span> <span id="s857">You know, if you think five people in a small room is crowded then it was crowded.</span> <span id="s858">Less was not crowded.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: So it didn't change that much in terms of housing or the population.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: No.</span> <span id="s861">Except when they moved the other people out we lived in the whole town and we could move around.</span> <span id="s862">Before that we had to have passes to go from one caserna (ph) to the other or if we had to work somewhere we had to have passes.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: Now do you remember there was some fortress where people were taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: Yes, but it was outside Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s865">The name was Terezin but it was outside Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: What was this fortress, what happened there?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: It was a prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: Why would somebody be sent there?</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: For reasons you go to prison.</span> <span id="s870">The only thing is they didn't send Jews there as a rule.</span> <span id="s871">Because they had for the Jews enough places.</span> <span id="s872">Theresienstadt and Thurzor (ph), which was worse than the fortress.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: What was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: Theresienstadt to the east of the camps.</span> <span id="s875">Extermination camps where they didn't have to have anything extra.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: So there wasn't too much of punishments and beatings or hangings, any of that horrible stuff that went on elsewhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: Well inside Theresienstadt, not too much.</span> <span id="s878">There were some hangings at the beginning.</span> <span id="s879">I think they hanged about nine people.</span> <span id="s880">And they'd make big propaganda with it.</span> <span id="s881">But then they didn't do it any more.</span> <span id="s882">It was too much problems and it was easier to send them to Poland and then do with them what they wanted to, .</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: Were the supervisors or the guards when you were working -- they mostly treated the people pretty well?</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: Regularly.</span> <span id="s885">They didn't beat us unless somebody did something.</span> <span id="s886">They didn't do too much bad things to us.</span> <span id="s887">Because they were afraid if we should survive they might get it after it.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: What else can you remember about life in the camp or something that might be important to remember in history?</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: Well I wouldn't know.</span> <span id="s890">Since I didn't live there a regular life I can't tell you exactly what bothered other people mostly.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: But you must have had friends who knew what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: Yes, but they didn't talk too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: Your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: My mother was the same as I, more or less, privileged.</span> <span id="s895">Because she was my mother she live in a small room with seven people.</span> <span id="s896">She had regular food like the others, but just to live in a small place was an advantage.</span> <span id="s897">My father lived in a big place but he didn't feel it that bad.</span> <span id="s898">What he did -- he was repairing sewing machines.</span> <span id="s899">Never in his life before did he see a sewing machine.</span> <span id="s900">They put him there so he did what he could and it saved his life.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: Was there any effort at resistance or any underground activity like --</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: I am sure there were, but I don't know about it.</span> <span id="s903">If I knew I didn't know not any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: So because of this relationship you had --</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: I was protected.</span> <span id="s906">They couldn't send me away without him and they didn't send him.</span> <span id="s907">They sent him and he said "if they don't call you separately I don't want you to come at all" because here I know where I leave you in and there he don't know what's happening.</span> <span id="s908">But he didn't come.</span> <span id="s909">He was sent directly to the gas chamber because he knew too much.</span> <span id="s910">He could have told the outside Germany what was going on more than I.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: He didn't share a lot of that with you though?</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: Well I think I knew about everything, but the Germans didn't know how much I knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: So you did know what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: I knew more or less what was going on.</span> <span id="s915">I mean, I didn't want to believe what I heard.</span> <span id="s916">That's another thing.</span> <span id="s917">They were saying they put people in gas chambers and they killed them there or God knows what.</span> <span id="s918">But it couldn't be true.</span> <span id="s919">It was so horrible that it couldn't be true in my way of thinking.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: This relationship must have really helped you cope with your life there a lot better?</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s922">First of all, I had somebody whom I loved.</span> <span id="s923">Since he was the leading physician he had a room for himself which I could share with him.</span> <span id="s924">I had an extra bed to move away, but I could share the room with him so I can't compare my life with anybody else's.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: Towards the end were there a lot more deportations out?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: I think so because they tried to get as many people away so they wouldn't have so many people to tell about them; you know, about the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: So it was more regular?</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: Close to the end of the war didn't they start bringing people from the camps west and sometimes camp survivors would come into Terezin?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: Yes, they would, but they said it wasn't true.</span> <span id="s931">It was so horrible that they were trying to say, but I didn't believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: Where were they coming from?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: When they were in Poland, for instance, and escaped some way or another, or the camp was liberated and they could get out and came to Terezin.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: From which camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: In Poland.</span> <span id="s936">The extermination camps or so.</span> <span id="s937">Some people survived.</span> <span id="s938">They didn't put everybody in the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s939">When they came and were telling us I wouldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s940">I thought it was so terrible, I couldn't believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: What did they look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: By the time they came to Terezin they had something to eat and they looked -- to me, they didn't look too terrible because I saw in Terezin terrible looking people too.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: Were they shaved and they were in uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: They were not in uniform, but they were shaved.</span> <span id="s945">If someone wanted to grow a beard he did it, but it didn't impress me or it didn't seem funny to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: So these people who came out, they didn't look too bad?</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: By the time they came to Terezin they were not so bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: These people certainly weren't that emaciated in Terezin?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: No.</span> <span id="s950">We had to eat.</span> <span id="s951">They gave us sometimes not too much, but we had our meals and Terezin was a camp that they showed off how well they treat Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: That's why I was wondering, because it would seem that the people who came from the east must have looked very different from you people.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s954">But as I say, by the time they came, they had something to eat or the Germans let them eat some.</span> <span id="s955">But I was lucky.</span> <span id="s956">I came there early and someone who knew me said "do you want to work" and that saved my life and my parents survived with me which was unusual, but thank God.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: So tell me, what happened at the end?</span> <span id="s958">How were you liberated, what were the circumstances?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: Well they came and say that the war is over and since I didn't have anywhere to go, I stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Who came and said that?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: I don't know who came and said it, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: Who liberated you?</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s964">The war was over and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: You don't remember that the last week or so the Red Cross took over?</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: No.</span> <span id="s967">I mean, you say took over.</span> <span id="s968">It didn't concern me too much.</span> <span id="s969">I didn't have anywhere to go so I was waiting for my parents to get established a little and in the meantime, I was very content in making my living.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: You stayed at the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s972">I stayed at the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: How long?</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: I thing about two months.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: What were you doing there?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: I was working in the office trying to -- sort of the things that still had to be done still or what -- I don't remember anymore what was to be done.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: Were you helping people find families?</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: Well not even that.</span> <span id="s979">The families, when they were outside, they came in and otherwise, they were together anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: Had your parents gone back to Prague</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: They went with me back to Prague, yes.</span> <span id="s982">We survived all three in Theresienstadt, thank God.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: When you went back to Prague what was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: It's hard to say.</span> <span id="s985">Someone said we were assigned an apartment and we moved in and my boss whom I worked for before I went to the camp said if you want to come back to work you are welcome, so I had my job and I had somewhere to sleep, and my parents were with me so I took it just for granted.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: Were the people you knew before the war there?</span> <span id="s987">Were a lot of them there still?</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: Some of them were and some of them -- well we didn't know what's going on which is, of course, not true, but they didn't want to so they wouldn't be blamed that they didn't help anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: So here you had been away for about four years?</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: Did it seem strange to come back like nothing had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: Well I took it for granted.</span> <span id="s993">I got an apartment and my parents were with me so I took it somehow for granted.</span> <span id="s994">I was thankful that I survived but it seemed strange to people who didn't go through that.</span> <span id="s995">But I just took it for granted.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: Did a lot of the Jewish community return to Prague?</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: Not a lot, but some did.</span> <span id="s998">I mean, they even returned when they were in England because they couldn't find nice jobs in England and they had still their properties in Prague so they came to claim that.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: Did you think a lot about Dr. Monk at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: What could I do?</span> <span id="s1001">I knew he was not alive.</span> <span id="s1002">What could I do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: I meant to ask you one other question about the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1005">Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: Was there much religion going on in there?</span> <span id="s1007">Were people observing Shabbat?</span> <span id="s1008">Were they celebrating holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: The ones who were religious outside were religious inside.</span> <span id="s1010">And the ones like me who took things for granted, we just lived on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: It was allowed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: It was allowed, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: So here you were in Prague working for the lawyer again.</span> <span id="s1014">How long did that last?</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: Until I left Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: Why did you leave Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: Because I met my husband.</span> <span id="s1018">We were married and he went so I went with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: So you met another man and got married in Prague.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: My husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: Your husband today.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: So he went away so I went too.</span> <span id="s1023">He went out.</span> <span id="s1024">He said I won't stay in this place any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: Venezuela.</span> <span id="s1027">I think we went to Venezuela first, to Paris, I think, then we went to Venezuela because he had his relatives there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: Was it at all difficult starting anew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: I didn't think.</span> <span id="s1030">As long as I was getting just for myself, I didn't care.</span> <span id="s1031">The main thing, I had somewhere to sleep and then the population 450 the first day I went out of the house, the neighbor came and said "welcome".</span> <span id="s1032">So it was a nice thing to start.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: Do you remember what year you went to Venezuela?</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: 1939 I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: To Venezuela?</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: No, I think --</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: A few years after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: No, I think it was -- I don't know.</span> <span id="s1039">I went to the refugee camp and someone came there and said we are going to Venezuela.</span> <span id="s1040">I said "where is that?"</span> <span id="s1041">They showed me and said to come so that if we find up to 50 people we grant them visas, so I went.</span> <span id="s1042">That simple.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">SHORT BREAK IN TAPE</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: I am confused myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: So we're confused together</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: Good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1048">So you went back to Prague, your parents were there and you worked for the lawyer, you stayed there awhile.</span> <span id="s1049">Do you remember what the next transition was?</span> <span id="s1050">What happened next?</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: I didn't want to stay there because I was afraid that something like that will again happen and I crossed the border into Germany, of all places, into the refugee camp and someone came there and said "we are going to Venezuela".</span> <span id="s1052">I said "where is that?"</span> <span id="s1053">and they said "the console told us we need people like you".</span> <span id="s1054">If you signed up to -- I don't know -- 20 people, we get some visas.</span> <span id="s1055">So I went there to get a visa.</span> <span id="s1056">I had nobody else to care about and I knew if I worked somewhere I will have somewhere to sleep and something to eat.</span> <span id="s1057">So why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: Your parents went with you or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: No.</span> <span id="s1060">Not at that time.</span> <span id="s1061">They were not with me.</span> <span id="s1062">I let them then later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: Do you remember the name of that refugee camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: No, not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: So then you went to Venezuela?</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1067">And I got a job from the newspaper.</span> <span id="s1068">It was my husband's cousin and he came there after I worked there about two years or two and a half years.</span> <span id="s1069">He came there to visit his cousin and since he was country doctor in Hugh (ph), Illinois, population 450, he proposed to me and I said yes.</span> <span id="s1070">Very simple.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: So you met your present husband in Venezuela?</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: And was he living -- where was he living at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: In Hugh (ph), Illinois, population 450.</span> <span id="s1075">He was a country doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: So that was that and you moved to Illinois?</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: I moved to Illinois.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: How was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: Very nice.</span> <span id="s1080">Very pleasant.</span> <span id="s1081">The first day I came out of the house the neighbor came and said "Welcome, you must me Mrs. Schleissner."</span> <span id="s1082">So how much better can you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: So your first impressions of America were pretty nice?</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: Yes, I can say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: Anything surprising that you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A: It has been a long time ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: What, when you look back on this period of time -- are there certain images that stick in your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: What do you mean by this period?</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: This period during the war when you were in Prague and then in Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: Not really, I took things as they came and somehow I said, well, that's the only thing I can say.</span> <span id="s1091">My parents were right with me, we came all three back to Prague and the good Lord was good to me.</span> <span id="s1092">I can say the only thing I can explain things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: Did it strengthen your belief in God at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s1095">I never was religious God knows me.</span> <span id="s1096">But believe there is something.</span> <span id="s1097">Direct the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: And you still do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: I still do because if I look outside, for instance, what else can I do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: Do you think that these experiences during the war had any sort of long term impact on you?</span> <span id="s1101">The way you think or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: How couldn't they?</span> <span id="s1103">But I don't think about it as I said.</span> <span id="s1104">I take it as it as it comes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: You never think about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: It was too hard sometimes to think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: Do you think that what we learned during those years, what happened, has any relevance today?</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: To some people, maybe.</span> <span id="s1109">Some people forget immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: Do you think this could ever happen again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: I hope not, but you never know.</span> <span id="s1112">The world is crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: Do you ever wonder why you were lucky?</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: The good Lord was good to me.</span> <span id="s1115">That's the only thing I can say, and I believe.</span> <span id="s1116">When my sister went to Israel I didn't want to go to Israel because I wasn't Jewish enough, or I wasn't -- I said other people who believe in it should go first, I don't want to take anybody's place, and things like that.</span> <span id="s1117">Today I think it was crazy, but it turned out to be okay so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: Is there anything else you want to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s1120">If you want to ask something ask anything you want to, but I don't have any extra to say.</span> <span id="s1121">I am lucky I am here.</span> <span id="s1122">That's the only thing I can say.</span> <span id="s1123">I am lucky I met my husband, although he studied in my home town and I didn't know him then.</span> <span id="s1124">I had to go to Venezuela to meet him.</span> <span id="s1125">When I went to Venezuela I didn't know where it was.</span> <span id="s1126">They had to show me on the map.</span> <span id="s1127">The good Lord, that's the only thing I can say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">END OF INTERVIEW USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0344 PAGE 3</span></p></body></html>
