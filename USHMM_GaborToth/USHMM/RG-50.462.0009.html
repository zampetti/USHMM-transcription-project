Gerry Schneeberg, interviewer Tape one, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">GS: It is April the 14th, 1986, and I'm talking with Alexandra Gorko about her experiences during the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1003">Alexandra, on a tape you made earlier for the Oral History project at Gratz, I had the impression that your experience was that first in the Lodz ghetto you worked as a nurse in the hospital, and then when you went to Auschwitz you were placed in a hospital there to work with Dr. Mengele.</span> <span id="s1004">There you refused to inject preg nant women with some substance that may have been gasoline, for an experiment, and as a result Dr. Mengele ordered that you would be beaten before the entire camp, after which you were left unconscious on a pile of cadavers and survived because of friends who rescued you.</span> <span id="s1005">You were then transferred to Ravensbrü ck, do I pronounce this correctly?</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">AG: Ravensbrü ck ["Rah", not "Ray"].</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">GS: Ravensbrü ck, to Mü hlhausen, and to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1008">And from there you were liberated.</span> <span id="s1009">I have the date April, '44, but I think that's a mistake.</span> <span id="s1010">It must have been '45.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">AG: '45.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">GS: '45, so I made a mistake.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">AG: 15 of April.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">GS: 1945, right.</span> <span id="s1015">After that you returned to Lodz, now I'm not going to go over that portion of it because I particularly am interested in the experiences before the war ended.</span> <span id="s1016">Now, I found in reading about other people and their experiences, a woman named Vira Laskis from Czechoslovakia who wrote about her involvement with a resistance move ment and then she ended up in, in, she had an experience in Ravensbrü ck and then in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1017">In Bergen-Belsen she mentions the Star Camp, which I believe was a camp of families.</span> <span id="s1018">Some families were together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">AG: We didn't have families.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">GS: No.</span> <span id="s1021">All right.</span> <span id="s1022">There may have been...</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">AG: Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">GS: But there may have, was there more than one camp perhaps at Bergen-Bel sen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">AG: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">GS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">AG: There was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">GS: All right.</span> <span id="s1029">She compared the two, and I wondered if your experience would confirm this.</span> <span id="s1030">She said at Ravensbrü ck there was mostly cooperation among the people who were there as inmates, whereas at Bergen-Belsen, there were constant quarrels.</span> <span id="s1031">She said the people seemed to be reduced to the lowest level of their humanity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">AG: Yes.</span> <span id="s1033">In Ravensbrü ck we were in transfer, in transfer.</span> <span id="s1034">Nobody stayed in Ravensbrü ck.</span> <span id="s1035">They killed them or they transferred them to another place, so they trans ferred us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">GS: And how long were you there?</span> <span id="s1037">Do you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">AG: I was there about three weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">GS: Where, in Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">AG: Bergen I was six weeks, I was six weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">GS: And of course that was at the very end of the war period when things must have been the most difficult...</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">AG: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">GS: For everyone.</span> <span id="s1044">Did you have this, would you say the same thing, that people were driven to the lowest level of behavior, fighting over food, she related.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">AG: You do have to have a very, very strong character.</span> <span id="s1046">That's true.</span> <span id="s1047">Or you don't care.</span> <span id="s1048">Because if you care, you didn't fight for it.</span> <span id="s1049">Food?</span> <span id="s1050">There was no food.</span> <span id="s1051">There was a piece of bread which was given to us once a day and a bowl of hot soup made out of pota to skins.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">GS: The people who didn't care, I suspect, were people who had just given up on living.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">AG: Giving up, giving up on living, giving up on everything, old people very, very strong.</span> <span id="s1054">I know, I never touched the food.</span> <span id="s1055">I never touched from there anything, anything.</span> <span id="s1056">I wasn't sick, but I was very...</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">GS: You weren't in a hospital...</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">AG: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">GS: Because of illness...</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">AG: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">GS: At any time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">AG: I do remember.</span> <span id="s1063">I think I know two days I think.</span> <span id="s1064">I can't remember what it was at the time, a stomach, a kind of diarrhea [unclear] two days and I came back [unclear] but I worked I worked in an ammunitions factory.</span> <span id="s1065">I had to walk four miles [unclear] in snow.</span> <span id="s1066">I had, I was given a pair of wooden shoes, Dutch wooden shoes, were a size too small for me.</span> <span id="s1067">I had very small feet, but they gave me children’s shoes [unclear].</span> <span id="s1068">And I didn’t catch a cold; I didn't even sneeze.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">GS: And you didn't have the problem that I read, some people had a frozen, feet or toes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">AG: No.</span> <span id="s1071">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">GS: You were fortunate.</span> <span id="s1073">All right, now, the main thing I'm really interested in, because I am researching the subject of resistance in different forms.</span> <span id="s1074">I've read, the state ment that, from this same woman, that during the period when she was there, was from the summer of 1944, until liberation in April of '45, that she claimed very few would stand up to the enemy with dignity and without cowardice.</span> <span id="s1075">Now, there were two instances that you have related where you stood up to Dr. Mengele at Auschwitz, and earlier in Lodz when you were in the hospital there and had been ordered to...</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">AG: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">GS: Throw babies out of a window and refused.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">AG: This was in the beginning.</span> <span id="s1079">This was the beginning.</span> <span id="s1080">In Auschwitz was, in the ghetto I didn't know much about what was going on in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1081">I was like in enclosure.</span> <span id="s1082">The hospital was a unit in itself, so I didn't know much about.</span> <span id="s1083">I only knew if someone told me who was out, not a nurse, cause I hear now that there were theaters in the ghetto, there were concerts.</span> <span id="s1084">I don't know nothing about it, because I never went out.</span> <span id="s1085">I was always, I was working so many hours that after work I wasn't even trying to go out even if I could go out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">GS: There was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">AG: So I don't know what was in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1088">So, Auschwitz, in Auschwitz I still had this feeling that I should do something.</span> <span id="s1089">I shouldn't give in, because for five years I didn't give in.</span> <span id="s1090">I was fighting.</span> <span id="s1091">I was saving lives.</span> <span id="s1092">I was doing what I could, and what I know how to.</span> <span id="s1093">So, in Auschwitz I lost already my father and my mother, and my brother too.</span> <span id="s1094">So I didn't really care and I told myself.</span> <span id="s1095">I will not give in to him.</span> <span id="s1096">If he will kill me that’s O.K. with me too.</span> <span id="s1097">So it was, it was not active resistance, it was more like a passive resistance, ‘cause I really didn't care any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">GS: Well, I guess you've answered in part my question that was going to come next, and that was, weren't you afraid that your life would be taken whenever you would refuse...</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">AG: No, I didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">GS: To carry out an order?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">AG: In this certain, certain moment, I will think of it, and I didn't care.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">GS: You were aware that other people who refused an order they were killed, I'm sure?</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">AG: Yes.</span> <span id="s1104">I was aware.</span> <span id="s1105">I was aware.</span> <span id="s1106">But this was, this was not in my character to do a thing like he told me to do, not asked.</span> <span id="s1107">I couldn't say that he asked me.</span> <span id="s1108">He gave me an order.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">GS: You were told.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">AG: I was ordered.</span> <span id="s1111">And I knew that's not in my, I don't have enough strength to do a thing like that.</span> <span id="s1112">It’s not in my character.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">GS: So that doing such a thing would be worse than losing your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">AG: Than losing my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">GS: And you had already had such great loss as you said, of your family.</span> <span id="s1116">You mentioned your friends, several friends, who were with you at different times, and who actually saved your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">AG: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">GS: I have a sense, from reading other people's experience, that even if it wasn't a life saving situation as dramatic as yours, that having a close friend, perhaps made the dif ference between holding on and resisting and enduring and continuing to live, and giv ing up.</span> <span id="s1119">As you said, there were many people who just gave up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">AG: Well we, we felt, all of us felt that nobody cares about us.</span> <span id="s1121">We felt that we are the only Jews left in the world.</span> <span id="s1122">Nobody cares about us.</span> <span id="s1123">So, if someone was close to you and cared about you, and you had someone to care for, this was already a, something to bind yourself to.</span> <span id="s1124">To hold yourself with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">GS: It was a reason to go on living, wasn't it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">AG: Yes.</span> <span id="s1127">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">GS: In your experiences, Alexandra, were there any other people whom you knew personally, who were either involved with any underground resistance movement, or who on their own were acting in any way as you did, as you called it, passive resistance, but to me it was a very active thing to say, "No, I refuse to carry out an order."</span> <span id="s1129">Were there any other experiences of other people that...</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">AG: Of course.</span> <span id="s1131">My brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">GS: Oh yes, with his involvement with the radio...</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">AG: With the radio.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">GS: The illegal radio.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">AG: [Unclear] not only the radio, they printed.</span> <span id="s1136">They wrote a resumé s of the radio, the BBC, and they carry it to the factories.</span> <span id="s1137">And he did it until the day they sent him away.</span> <span id="s1138">And this was only because of Rumkowski, because nobody else had any, [unclear] with my brother, nobody else but Rum kowski took revenge of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">GS: Well, it was illegal, was it not, to use the, to have a radio transmitter...</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">AG: Of course it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">GS: In, the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">AG: Of course.</span> <span id="s1143">Someone from, someone knew about it and the [unclear] got paid for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">GS: Uh, there was a lot of terrible betrayal, wasn't there?</span> <span id="s1145">Was your brother and this group of friends who were involved with this hidden radio part of a group, a youth group?</span> <span id="s1146">Or they were just a few friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">AG: There were thirteen of them, and they weren't youth, they were all in, in late twenties.</span> <span id="s1148">They were...</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">GS: Were they part, or were they in touch with any resistance move ment that you were aware of?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">AG: I couldn't tell you.</span> <span id="s1151">I didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">GS: If they were, they didn't tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">AG: I didn't even know that this was going on.</span> <span id="s1154">While it was going on, I didn't know.</span> <span id="s1155">Neither did my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">GS: They couldn't, reveal it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">AG: I only knew they were thirteen men and they did it for about a year-and-a-half, from the beginning, where we were enclosed in the ghetto, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">GS: Excuse me, that was 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">AG: It was 1940, and ‘41.</span> <span id="s1160">And January 31 [?]</span> <span

id="s1178">The names, our name was only one so they only took me and my mother [unclear], but the others had relatives.</span> <span id="s1179">And even people by the same name were sent away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">GS: How did your mother and you escape being sent at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">AG: I was needed in the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">GS: Ah, so that gave you an exemption.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">AG: I was, first I was head nurse.</span> <span id="s1184">Then I was supervisor at least later in the hospital.</span> <span

don't know if there's anything else that comes to mind that you want to talk about.</span> <span id="s1196">Remember that my particular interest is in researching resistance in different forms.</span>

how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">GS: You mean that first day in Auschwitz when you confronted?</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">AG: It wasn't the first day.</span> <span id="s1244">It was about like three, four days until that day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">GS: When you were selected...</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">AG: When I was,</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">GS: To work in the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">AG: I volunteered.</span> <span id="s1249">They asked for nurses.</span> <span id="s1250">So I volunteered.</span> <span id="s1251">I, it didn't occur to me that he’s doing such—.</span> <span id="s1252">See, we didn't know nothing about what was going on.</span> <span id="s1253">For five years we didn't know anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">GS: No, because they practiced such deception and lies about everything, and kept the truth hidden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">AG: Kept the truth hidden.</span> <span id="s1256">And even if someone knew and came, there were people who came from different camps and told other people about it, but nobody believed it.</span> <span id="s1257">Nobody believed it.</span> <span id="s1258">Such a culture.</span> <span id="s1259">This was one of the most cultured, nations in Europe!</span> <span id="s1260">The Germans.</span> <span id="s1261">That they could be such beasts.</span> <span id="s1262">Because it wasn't, nothing what they did was human.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">GS: And then we've found accounts of how when people were taken from a western area, say the western part of Poland and sent to Auschwitz, cards or letters would be sent back.</span> <span id="s1264">They'd be forced to write to family or friends still back in the west, reporting that things were good, or at least tolerable.</span> <span id="s1265">That there was enough food to eat and these were letters or cards written just before these people were taken to the gas chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">AG: Not to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1267">Nobody in the ghetto got one letter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">GS: Never received any mail in Lodz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">AG: Because in the ghetto they took people and, like first time in '42, January in '42, to Chelmno, and they shot them right away.</span> <span id="s1270">We only knew that something is going on if we saw the clothes coming.</span> <span id="s1271">What was the clothes coming back?</span> <span id="s1272">The hospital got some clothes too.</span> <span id="s1273">We had children.</span> <span id="s1274">We had friends [unclear] in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1275">We had to have something for the children to wear.</span> <span id="s1276">And we got them back, and we knew that it's not from Germany.</span> <span id="s1277">These are our clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">GS: You recognized the clothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">AG: And if I told I recognized my brother's coat, it gave us food for thought.</span> <span id="s1280">Where is that coat coming?</span> <span id="s1281">Something must be going on.</span> <span id="s1282">They didn't give them new clothes and send the old ones to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1283">Something worse.</span> <span id="s1284">But we pushed away all the bad thoughts, because we wanted to hope.</span> <span id="s1285">And mostly it was kept up, this hope, for instance, my hope was that my husband, who wasn't Jewish, would survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">GS: You had reason to believe that he had a good chance...</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">AG: Yes.</span> <span id="s1288">That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">GS: To survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">AG: He had a chance.</span> <span id="s1291">He was in the war.</span> <span id="s1292">The war didn't last long so maybe he's, he ran away.</span> <span id="s1293">Maybe he's in a prisoner’s camp, officers were in different camps.</span> <span id="s1294">We didn't know about this.</span> <span id="s1295">But it's how it was.</span> <span id="s1296">So this was hope.</span> <span id="s1297">When after the war, I think I talked about it, an English major came to see me.</span> <span id="s1298">And I was called into the office in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1299">I was sure that this was my husband.</span> <span id="s1300">He was a captain, so now he's a major, and it wasn't.</span> <span id="s1301">I think I told you...</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">GS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">AG: That I fainted.</span> <span id="s1304">The hope was a big part of surviving, was hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">GS: And another part of that picture was having a close friend with whom...</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">AG: Who cared...</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">GS: You endured.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">AG: About you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">GS: Right.</span> <span id="s1310">And who you felt some responsibility and helped care for.</span> <span id="s1311">All right, thank you very much Alexandra.</span> <span id="s1312">I appreciate your talking with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">AG: This is not important.</span> <span id="s1314">Now I rem- [unclear].</span> <span id="s1315">They were all young Hungarian girls.</span> <span id="s1316">There were very boisterous and they were very, we couldn't understand what they were saying, but they were very religious.</span> <span id="s1317">So maybe religion was one of the factors what kept people.</span> <span id="s1318">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1319">I wasn't religious.</span> <span id="s1320">I was never, I wasn't brought up religious.</span> <span id="s1321">My help was from the home [?]</span> <span id="s1322">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">GS: All right, I thank you again.</span></p></body></html>
