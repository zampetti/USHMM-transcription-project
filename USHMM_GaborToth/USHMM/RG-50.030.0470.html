24, 2002</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: Good afternoon, Dora.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: Good afternoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: It’s nice to see you.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: It’s nice to see you, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Dora, what was your name at birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: Teodora Basch.</span> <span id="s17">Teodora Rachela Basch.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: Teodora – T-e-o or T-h?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: T-e-o.</span> <span id="s20">It got changed much later on when I got American citizenship.</span> <span id="s21">Once I came to the States, I got tired of telling everybody that my name was just like Theodora, but without the “h”.</span> <span id="s22">So, when I got my citizenship, and was asked if I would like to change anything in my name, I said, “Yes, please give me an ‘h’.”</span> <span id="s23">[Laughs.]</span> <span id="s24">So, that’s how, but I did not change-</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: So, that’s how the “h” came.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: That’s how the “h” came.</span> <span id="s27">The Rachela part I kept as is, even though, of course, it’s Rachel, but it wasn’t important to change, and since I mostly just use my initials, so I didn’t change that.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: And your name now is?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: My name now is Theodora Rachela Klayman.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: But you use Dora.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: I have had a variety of nicknames.</span> <span id="s32">I use Dora.</span> <span id="s33">I noticed that in the pictures during my childhood, that sometimes there is a photograph when I was like six months old that was sent by my mother to my grandparents, and it says, “Tea”.</span> <span id="s34">So, at one point, I had the nickname Tea from Thea, but I don’t remember being called that.</span> <span id="s35">Then, in Croatia, Dora is a rather sort of, a name, a very folksy name used usually sort of used for old ladies, and that’s not what I was ever called.</span> <span id="s36">I was called “Dorica” as a child.</span> <span id="s37">So, if we go back now, I’m still called Dorica, and at home, I often was also called “Dorek”, and when I came here, I became “Dora”, and that’s how it’s – it’s sticking to that one now.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: So, no one here calls you Dorica?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: No, no, just my – my Croatian – well, Lucie sometimes does.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Do you like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: It’s very – it’s sort of very – it’s – its, diminutive names are used a lot in all Slavic countries.</span> <span id="s42">So, it’s very normal for someone from a Slavic country to use that, but it’s really not – it sounds very strange, I think, in English.</span> <span id="s43">I know a young woman who lives here who’s from Belgrade, and she’s called Bekica, and it’s Becky, and to me it’s like sounds very strange.</span> <span id="s44">It’s sort of like, you know, Dolly or something like that, and you don’t use those names very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: When were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: January 31, 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: And, you were born-</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: In Zagreb.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: In Zagreb?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: I was born in Zagreb.</span> <span id="s51">I was born in Zagreb, apparently.</span> <span id="s52">I checked that about two years after my parents were married, and I lived there only the first two and a half, three years of my life.</span> <span id="s53">My mother was not originally Zagreb.</span> <span id="s54">My father’s family lived in Zagreb, and that not for a very long time in history.</span> <span id="s55">I mean, they came, I think, when my father was already in his early teens or so.</span> <span id="s56">They came mostly from Bosnia.</span> <span id="s57">They were not however Sefardi.</span> <span id="s58">They had come there from, I think, elsewhere in Europe.</span> <span id="s59">And then came to live in Zagreb, and my father’s family tended to be cantors.</span> <span id="s60">They were very – it was a very religious family, and they studied cantorial music and one of them, one of my uncles, Arnold, was actually a cantor and had studied very seriously.</span> <span id="s61">Another uncle, Joseph, also studied seriously.</span> <span id="s62">My father, I think, went to Ludbreg, to another little town, to – also to be a cantor at times, and met my mother.</span> <span id="s63">So, my mother’s family was from a different town.</span> <span id="s64">They were from the town, a very small town called Ludbreg; it’s further north from Zagreb on the Hungarian border, really very close to Hungary, but that town, in contrast to others, did not have a Hungarian population.</span> <span id="s65">I never learned Hungarian.</span> <span id="s66">My mother apparently did.</span> <span id="s67">My grandfather on my mother’s side was the rabbi of that town, Ludbreg.</span> <span id="s68">There were some 30 plus Jewish families.</span> <span id="s69">I think about, according to some books that I’ve seen, about 37 Jewish families.</span> <span id="s70">And my grandfather, I believe, was invited to come and be a rabbi there, and they came from Czechoslovakia, and he – he came from Bratislava already with his – with the family, and so I don’t know exactly how old he was, but from what I gather, most of his writing, he did quite a bit of writing, published, was in German, though he did learn Croatian, spoke in Croatian, but I think all of his writing is in German.</span> <span id="s71">I have papers where he wrote by hand and you can see that.</span> <span id="s72">Though his publications are in Croatian – I have some of the stuff that he published mostly treaties on the Torah and so on, so I don’t know exactly.</span> <span id="s73">I’ve only been told all these things, and I don’t know really if he wrote in German and someone translated, or whether he wrote directly in Croatian.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: What was your father’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: My father’s name is Salamon – Shlomo, Salamon, and my mother’s name was Silva, which is Silvia, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: And her maiden name was Deutsch?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Deutsch.</span> <span id="s78">So, my grandfather, my maternal grandfather was Leopold Deutsch.</span> <span id="s79">My grandmother was Katarina, and they had three children.</span> <span id="s80">I’m sorry, they had three daughters and a son, four children.</span> <span id="s81">The oldest – the oldest daughter was Giza, then Blanka, and then Silva, and the son was Erne.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: And Giza plays an important role in your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: Giza plays an important role in my life.</span> <span id="s84">Well, Blanka does too in some sense because basically they lived sort of together.</span> <span id="s85">The family lived together.</span> <span id="s86">It was a small town.</span> <span id="s87">Giza was ten years, I’m sorry, fifteen years older than my mother.</span> <span id="s88">So, she often was sort of active as my mother’s mother in they – I see pictures that they had traveled together, for example, all three sisters to the seashore.</span> <span id="s89">The middle sister got married fairly young and had two children, two daughters – Zdenka and Vera.</span> <span id="s90">Their name was Appler, and the youngest – the youngest daughter, my mother, was eventually sent to a school in Cakovec which is another small town, much larger town actually than Ludbreg, much closer even to the Hungarian border, and she went there to a teacher’s – a teacher’s school, became an elementary school teacher.</span> <span id="s91">The middle sister who was married, was married to Rudi Appler, who came to Ludbreg, opened a store, and that’s – and that’s where they had two children.</span> <span id="s92">The oldest of the three, Giza, worked in the bank, in the Ludbreg Bank, and there she met a person who was to play a large part in my life and that was Ludva Vrancic.</span> <span id="s93">Ljudevit is actually his real name.</span> <span id="s94">I’ll get back to him.</span> <span id="s95">The brother Erne worked in Zagreb, worked early in Zagreb, and I’m not exactly sure what he did there.</span> <span id="s96">I think clerical work of some sort.</span> <span id="s97">I’m not sure of what he did.</span> <span id="s98">And the – my mother eventually finished the teacher’s school and worked as a teacher in a small village near Ludbreg for a short period of time.</span> <span id="s99">Then my father and she met and married and left to live in Zagreb, and that’s how I happened to have been born in Zagreb.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: So, let me ask you something, you were a very, very young child when the war came in 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: So, what I need you to try to do is to distinguish what you’ve learned from other people and what you actually remember, because you were so little.</span> <span id="s103">So, if you can, as you speak, make that distinction, it might be very helpful.</span> <span id="s104">So, this is what my first question is for you.</span> <span id="s105">What is your – do you have any memories before 1941, before you leave Zagreb to go to Ludbreg?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: Images.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Images?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Yes, I have in my head an image of my mother, but it’s very hard to really tell because I was fortunate to have a lot of pictures of my parents, which I think a lot of children that lived through the Holocaust never got to have.</span> <span id="s109">And so it’s very difficult because I’ve seen those pictures all my life.</span> <span id="s110">It’s very difficult to really distinguish what’s memory and what’s a photograph that you have in your head.</span> <span id="s111">So, I think I have an image in my head, but I can’t really tell you whether I do or don’t.</span> <span id="s112">I think I have an image of myself leaving on a train, because I left apparently when I was three years old.</span> <span id="s113">I left Zagreb with friends of my grandparents and went to Ludbreg, and that happened before, just before, the war started, from what I understand.</span> <span id="s114">And, again, I don’t have any idea whether – because people often ask me whether I remember whether I was sent away because my parents were afraid of what’s going to happen, or whether I was just going to visit my family just to visit my family or whether my mother, who already – my brother had already been born, he was three years younger than I – whether, you know, she said, you know, why not have this kid go away while she has a baby?</span> <span id="s115">I have no – no idea why I was sent except there was an opportunity.</span> <span id="s116">These neighbors came and I went with them, and I don’t remember being tearful or I don’t remember the farewell.</span> <span id="s117">I don’t remember any of that, but that was the last time I saw my parents.</span> <span id="s118">I don’t remember any farewells.</span> <span id="s119">I remember sort of being on the train and there being fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: It was fun?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Was that the first time you were on a train?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Oh, I think so, probably.</span> <span id="s124">Well, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s125">It’s very hard to tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Do you remember the birth of your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: You don’t remember him as this tiny little baby?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: No.</span> <span id="s130">No.</span> <span id="s131">I mean, I remember him, however, when I do remember him very well is when he was brought to Ludbreg.</span> <span id="s132">That I remember.</span> <span id="s133">That I really do remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: So, were you told about your mother going to school, because clearly you were too young.</span> <span id="s135">Your mother wouldn’t have explained to you that she was a teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: No, none of that.</span> <span id="s137">I’m just saying the background of what really – of what this family was all about, who was who.</span> <span id="s138">I have not the foggiest.</span> <span id="s139">No, of course not, because all of that happened before I was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: What did your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: My father had apparently learned the trade of brushmaking, and had opened a workshop to make brushes.</span> <span id="s142">From what I am told by his surviving brother, he was very good at it, and by the time that I was born, I can tell from, again, from the pictures of him, what people told me, there was a small workshop with, I don’t know, ten or so workmen, and there was machinery and they made brushes and was very successful at it.</span> <span id="s143">But, I, again, don’t have any memory of it.</span> <span id="s144">I only know pictures and stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: Is this difficult for you as an adult person thinking about who were these parents and what you have are paper pictures?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: It’s not actually that difficult.</span> <span id="s147">The reason for it is that it was not a new discovery that I made as an adult.</span> <span id="s148">If I had known nothing of that, and all of a sudden as an adult it came upon me, yes, of course, it would have been difficult.</span> <span id="s149">But I grew up with all of that.</span> <span id="s150">It’s – it’s just part and parcel of my growing up.</span> <span id="s151">I always heard stories and always knew who I was and I always had these pictures so that, you know, it’s, you know, you just to grow up with stories.</span> <span id="s152">That’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: So, you go to Ludberg-</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Ludbreg, which actually has a meaning.</span> <span id="s155">The word “lud” in Croatian means crazy or mad.</span> <span id="s156">This is kind of crazy.</span> <span id="s157">And “breg”, I think, means a mountain, but it also could be the words got transposed and it was “berg” which means town.</span> <span id="s158">So, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s159">Nobody ever explained why this is called that, but it’s Ludbreg.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Do you have a first memory of Ludbreg?</span> <span id="s161">Remember arriving?</span> <span id="s162">You don’t remember -</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: No, I don’t remember arriving.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: With your grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: I remember very well being with my grandparents.</span> <span id="s166">That I do remember, and again, I have certain images like I remember sitting with my grandfather in a room and playing at his feet, and he was paralyzed already on one side because he had a stroke.</span> <span id="s167">And he was trying to pick up the toys that I was playing with, something like that, and he fell.</span> <span id="s168">It was a traumatic experience for me.</span> <span id="s169">So, I remember that, and I remember Hanukkah.</span> <span id="s170">I remember the-</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: What happened after he fell?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: Oh, someone came – he couldn’t pick himself up.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: You just--</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: I just remember that I was guilty of throwing the toys around or something.</span> <span id="s175">So, I remember being upset and crying.</span> <span id="s176">So, that’s why I remember that.</span> <span id="s177">I remember Hanukkah for example, but not the whole thing.</span> <span id="s178">I remember candles and I remember getting an orange, which was very exciting.</span> <span id="s179">Oranges were not to be had.</span> <span id="s180">I remember at Pesach, or before Pesach.</span> <span id="s181">I remember that they were burying silverware, and I thought that was a very strange thing to do, but that’s apparently what can be done.</span> <span id="s182">I found that much later.</span> <span id="s183">I had no idea of that.</span> <span id="s184">I remember my grandfather sitting in the garden with all of us playing around and he used to – he used to have his little table in front.</span> <span id="s185">This was, mind you, we were living in the house that was attached to the synagogue, and it was also – and everything – all the Jewish community matters played themselves out there.</span> <span id="s186">So, there was also the school and there were some kind of classrooms, and, of course, that was there much later.</span> <span id="s187">It’s been destroyed now, but – so, he would sit in the garden with the little table and he had little piles of money in front of him and there were beggars that were sort of like professional beggars in that town, and they would come Wednesdays and Saturdays because those were market days in Ludbreg, and on Saturdays, of course, he wouldn’t do that, but – that’s Shabbat, but on Wednesdays they would sit and they would come and take their little piles.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: They, as far as you knew, they were specifically for these particular people?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Yes, yes, there was specific people.</span> <span id="s190">There was a specific beggar that used to come to our – to the house where I lived much, much later and he would come every Wednesday and would always get alms, and I remember seeing him later on on the train and being like a normal person, you know?</span> <span id="s191">It was very strange, but they were characters.</span> <span id="s192">Ludbreg’s a very small town, and especially was, and everybody sort of knew everybody and there were all these sort of different routines that were going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Since you said there were about 30 families who lived here, how much larger was the town?</span> <span id="s194">A couple of hundred families?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Yes, and all of these families did not live in Ludbreg proper, either.</span> <span id="s196">Some of them were in surrounding villages.</span> <span id="s197">Ludbreg is sort of like the county seat, and there were many surrounding villages, and those villages did not have either their own Jewish anything, nor did they have even middle schools.</span> <span id="s198">For example, later on when I went to middle school, people, kids from those villages would come to school, and that was also the place where market that was happening, and any kind of official papers were held and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s199">So, it was sort of a – basically like a county seat.</span> <span id="s200">So, anyway, back to the images of my grandfather.</span> <span id="s201">Those are the images that I have my grandparents, but of course-</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: You only mentioned -</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: My grandfather – yes, I know.</span> <span id="s204">I remember my grandmother less.</span> <span id="s205">I think I remember her more from pictures than I remember anything that went on in the house, strangely enough.</span> <span id="s206">No meals, no nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: No playing?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: I don’t remember that, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Peeling potatoes or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: No, I don’t remember any of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: It’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: It’s interesting, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Maybe you actually spent more time with your grandfather.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: It’s possible.</span> <span id="s215">It’s possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Do you have any recollection of wondering who you parents are after a while?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: No.</span> <span id="s218">I know-</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: You’re there probably the end of March-</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: I’m there visiting.</span> <span id="s221">The next memory I have in my grandparents’ house, I remember one evening, being lots of commotion, lots of unhappiness, and then, lo and behold, there arrives a baby, and that – a child, a young child.</span> <span id="s222">That was my brother.</span> <span id="s223">I remember his arrival because he looked very strange.</span> <span id="s224">He had lines, like brown lines on his face, and I thought, “What’s with the brown lines?”</span> <span id="s225">I know now that basically he was crying and there was dirt on the road until they washed him up and so on.</span> <span id="s226">I know now what had happened, but I don’t have a memory of that.</span> <span id="s227">I only know what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: So, what did happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: What happened-</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: What were you told?</span> <span id="s231">Your grandparents told you or do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: I was constantly surrounded by this extended family.</span> <span id="s233">So, there was my grand – there were my grandparents and then only about two blocks away lived the middle sister, my mother’s middle sister of the three sisters, Blanka with her husband and two of my cousins Vera and Zdenka, and then there was also Giza, who by that time was also married, and her husband Ludva, the Vrancic family.</span> <span id="s234">So, there was constant comings and goings, so that I don’t know who said what, and in fact, I remember that evening in particular when my brother arrived, and then I remember also being sort of distracted later on the next day by my two cousins who took me away.</span> <span id="s235">I spent much time with them.</span> <span id="s236">So, I was just sort of floating between these families.</span> <span id="s237">I don’t remember being particularly rooted in one place or another.</span> <span id="s238">But, anyway, the reason – what happened with my brother.</span> <span id="s239">That must have after the fall of Yugoslavia, April ’41.</span> <span id="s240">My parents were apparently almost immediately taken into jail, led and my mother had my brother with me.</span> <span id="s241">We had – I don’t know if it was a housekeeper or somebody who lived nearby, a non-Jewish woman, and she went and was able to get my brother out.</span> <span id="s242">So, he was in jail with my parents for a very short period of time.</span> <span id="s243">Then she got him out, and she must have phoned Ludbreg, I mean, I know she did because I went through that story before, and they immediately – the oldest sister, Giza and her husband who was not Jewish, Ludva Vrancic, they went immediately to Zagreb and they got my brother, and they brought him back to Ludbreg.</span> <span id="s244">And that’s – that’s what happened that night, and that’s – they brought him and he was there.</span> <span id="s245">He was nine months old at that time, and so he was crying and carrying on, and that’s about what I remember of that.</span> <span id="s246">And I remember everybody being nervous and upset and-</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: You do?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: But, nobody sits down and tries to explain to this little girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: No, if they did, I don’t remember it.</span> <span id="s251">They may have, but I don’t remember it.</span> <span id="s252">I remember, you know, lots of conversations and things and commotions and then just going off with my cousins to play.</span> <span id="s253">I remember being, at one point, that they were pulling me on a sled.</span> <span id="s254">So, it must have been winter time by then, and so it must have been later.</span> <span id="s255">I don’t know when.</span> <span id="s256">But, I remember being on a sled and their telling me something about a war.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: So, if your brother was nine months old?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: So, that must have been later than that.</span> <span id="s259">Yeah, that image of being on a sled must have been later.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: But if your brother was born in January of ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: He was.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: War came in April ’45.</span> <span id="s263">So, it’s in the fall.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: It’s in the fall.</span> <span id="s265">It must have been in the fall.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: November or December.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Mm-hmm, which is very likely that in Ludbreg there might be snow already.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: September, October?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: Not September, October, but by November there might be snow.</span> <span id="s270">Some snow – so, it might not have been all at the same time, that I have that image from.</span> <span id="s271">It’s just like the images are often not connected.</span> <span id="s272">They kind of live in my head, but they’re not necessarily – the chronological order is off.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Of course, I understand, but is that your first recollection of seeing your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: Yes, yes, it is, and then we were together from then on.</span> <span id="s275">We were always together from then on until his death.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Were you glad he was there?</span> <span id="s277">Or did it take something away from you when he came?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: When he came, I don’t know whether I paid that much attention.</span> <span id="s279">Eventually, it was kind of nice having him around sometimes, but sometimes I was – with time, as he got to be bigger, he played a large role in everybody’s life.</span> <span id="s280">He was very cute and very smart and I was often very jealous, especially later on, he got to be – he was very personable and both of us were very redhead.</span> <span id="s281">This is very muted now.</span> <span id="s282">I mean, I was flaming red and so was he, and he was very cute and he had a very good memory.</span> <span id="s283">He’d memorize very long poems, and he would stand up and recite them, and I was like, “Ugh, there he goes again.”</span> <span id="s284">But, the whole town was very fond of him, and he – he somehow acquired a nickname “Lovrek” which wasn’t his name, and everybody thought it was his name, but it wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: What does Lovrek mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: Nothing, I don’t know how that came about, actually.</span> <span id="s287">I have no idea how that came about.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: From Zdrav?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: His name was Zdravko, which is very hard for you I’m sure to pronounce, but it’s actually means hime (ph), because zdravlje is health.</span> <span id="s290">Apparently, my – from what I was told, again, I was told that my mother wanted us to have very Croatian names.</span> <span id="s291">People were very, very much into being Croat, and Nationalists, and so on.</span> <span id="s292">So, those two names were supposed to be, you know, real Croatian names.</span> <span id="s293">We weren’t going to have such names as who knows what.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: So, Teodora is very Croat?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: Dorica is.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Dorica?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s298">There is a thing “Dorica pjeva, zemlja se trese”, which means “Dorica sings and the earth is shaking”, and I’ve been told a zillion times, every time someone hears my name.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: We’re going to stop now and change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Dora, do you have your first recollection of the effect of a war or something, anything that has to do with this chaos that obviously encumbering Croatia?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Well, I – I have memories that have to do with what must have then been become a persecution, with the issuing of lists, et cetera, et cetera, and you know, historically we know what happened.</span> <span id="s304">There were lists, and they, you know, the Ustashe came to Ludbreg and, they – people were being rounded up.</span> <span id="s305">I was not aware of that as such, but I do remember people leaving and I remember being left behind, and I didn’t know exactly what was happening.</span> <span id="s306">Perhaps, again, they told me, but I didn’t understand what they were telling me.</span> <span id="s307">But, as I mentioned, my Aunt Blanka and her family lived next door to Aunt Giza and Ludjevit, and basically I remember at one point people coming and we were all in one room and they came with satchels or small suitcases in their hands and pillows under their arms and saying goodbye and leaving.</span> <span id="s308">And I didn’t know exactly what was going on and why were they leaving and who was crying, and I was sad because these were my cousins, but that’s the image that I have in my head of their leaving.</span> <span id="s309">And I had the sense that it was, there was something that was dangerous and bad and that people were being taken away.</span> <span id="s310">I don’t have the image of my grandparents leaving.</span> <span id="s311">I don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s312">I remember my cousins.</span> <span id="s313">I know that my grandparents were taken at the same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: At the same time?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s316">Fairly early, they all left.</span> <span id="s317">I also know that my cousins, I know that now, that my favorite cousins with whom I stayed quite a bit of time and the middle aunt, Blanka, the middle aunt and her husband, that they had left for awhile and went to the Italian part of the country, that they were someplace in Dalmatia.</span> <span id="s318">And then there was a proclamation by Pavelic that people who had left, Jews who had left, should return, and if they return they will be spared, nothing will happen to them, and they stupidly returned.</span> <span id="s319">I have a very good friend of mine who still lives in Zagreb now.</span> <span id="s320">Her family, which was another family in Ludbreg left also, and had left before this proclamation and they cleverly did not return.</span> <span id="s321">They were the only Jewish family, in fact, that returned after the war intact because they were smart enough not to return, actually because the mother in the family said she was absolutely not returning, and so they stayed with the Partisans in Partisan-held territory in Kordun.</span> <span id="s322">But, people who returned believing that this was going, you know, that they were going to be okay, they were gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Is it possible that it was – there was a list, and people knew they were supposed to go so they didn’t have to be rounded up, they went, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: I think somebody must have come and gotten them and had the list, and I – I tried to reconstruct why I wasn’t taken, and I hadn’t thought about it before even to ask my ___ with whom I eventually grew up, “Why wasn’t I taken ever?”</span> <span id="s325">Besides having been hidden here and there, which I know I was, because people would warn us that there would be a raid.</span> <span id="s326">I have a feeling that I was not on the list.</span> <span id="s327">I had seen one of those lists.</span> <span id="s328">One of them is published in a book on Ludbreg, which I have, and it lists Ludbreg Jews, and my aunts are there, and everybody’s listed, and I’m not on the list, neither is my brother.</span> <span id="s329">I have a feeling that the must have gotten the list maybe from the synagogue, from the community center, and of course, I was not, since I was not born in Ludbreg and I was not considered a, you know, a member of the Ludbreg Jews, I was from Zagreb, I was not on that list.</span> <span id="s330">That’s a possibility.</span> <span id="s331">But the other thing is that I know that many times we were warned that there would be a raid, and perhaps I – if they had been warned, they would have hidden someplace, but I always wondered why in the world were they sitting there?</span> <span id="s332">Like sitting ducks.</span> <span id="s333">Even I – I mean I didn’t have a choice, of course, I was a child – but I’m thinking, “Why in the world were we there?”</span> <span id="s334">I recently, my aunt made a tape of her experiences-</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: This is Magda?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Magda, and she was in Zagreb this whole time.</span> <span id="s337">They stayed until the bitter end and they could barely escape at that point.</span> <span id="s338">I was like, “Why were you there?”</span> <span id="s339">You know, it’s very hard for me to understand.</span> <span id="s340">It’s not hard to understand why they didn’t – why in some places there was no place to go, but I think in Ludbreg, one of the things about Ludbreg, it was a town that was very close to the – to where the Partisans where.</span> <span id="s341">It’s at the foot of the mountains, and of course, it was very difficult and Partisans had a very difficult life, but for those of us who were so vulnerable, why we didn’t you go someplace into a small village or smaller village.</span> <span id="s342">I mean, this was small, but it wasn’t really small, not by Croatian standards.</span> <span id="s343">Why we stayed there, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s344">Faith that we would not be wanted?</span> <span id="s345">Or something?</span> <span id="s346">I don’t really know.</span> <span id="s347">But I know that often with my Aunt Giza, we would – we would go places.</span> <span id="s348">I remember one time going to Varazdin, which is a larger town nearby, and staying with a relative, and I think this was the time that I understood that it was dangerous to stay and that we had to hide for a few days.</span> <span id="s349">The other – all the other hiding that I did was sort of nearby with – mostly with friends, and there were a number of families.</span> <span id="s350">There was the Ziza, the Runjak family, my brother and I would spend some time with, especially Ludbreg – Ludbreg experienced a lot of fighting.</span> <span id="s351">We were really not so much in a concentration camp kind of situation.</span> <span id="s352">We were in a war – we were in a war zone.</span> <span id="s353">So, when it was – when it was time to hide because the Ustashe took town, then I spent, for example, time with this Runjak family, and they had rented from this other house which was now empty.</span> <span id="s354">They had rented that apartment, and we stayed with them.</span> <span id="s355">And I called Mrs. Runjak “Mother” when I knew that it was dangerous, and I understood at that point what was dangerous, and my brother called her “Mother” all the time because he wouldn’t know how to distinguish from when it was dangerous and when it wasn’t.</span> <span id="s356">So, I lived with them, and they had three teenage children, and it’s thoroughly amazing because I remember Ustashe making camp in our backyard, and we were there, and just pretending that we were part of this other family.</span> <span id="s357">And it’s amazing sometimes because the whole town essentially knew who we were.</span> <span id="s358">That’s the most amazing part of all.</span> <span id="s359">In a small town like that, everybody knew that we were the rabbi’s grandchildren, and at no point did anybody say, “What about these kids?”</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: So, is there some way in which the town is protecting you?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: It wasn’t organized.</span> <span id="s362">Yeah, definitely.</span> <span id="s363">It wasn’t an organized kind of thing, but a lot of people in that town were really Partisan sympathizers, and I know a number of people who lost, who perished, who lost their lives as Partisans during the war.</span> <span id="s364">People across the street lost their one and only son.</span> <span id="s365">So, I think -- unwittingly, I mean, not in an organized manner, but it just was not a kind of town that would – that would say, “Oh, well, go some place else.”</span> <span id="s366">Or, “You’re endangering us.”</span> <span id="s367">I was endangering some of these people, and – but, they took us in anyway.</span> <span id="s368">So, but, anyway, our bad experiences during the war really had to do with the fighting, which everybody experienced, not just the Jews.</span> <span id="s369">Just there was only brother and I and my aunt that were left at the end.</span> <span id="s370">Because there were fights especially at night.</span> <span id="s371">There would be terrible fights.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: In the streets?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: In the streets, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: Yeah, oh yeah.</span> <span id="s376">There were – the street that I lived on was after the war called, “The Street of the 17th Udarna Brigada”.</span> <span id="s377">I don’t know how to translate – Brigade is Brigada, of course.</span> <span id="s378">Udarna means – it’s striking, one who can strike well, particularly well.</span> <span id="s379">And the reason it’s called that is because the members of that brigade, the remnant of that brigade lost their lives.</span> <span id="s380">They killed themselves at the end of the battle in a house that was down my street because they were totally surrounded.</span> <span id="s381">They had fought all night, and they were totally surrounded, and in the end, they just threw a bomb among themselves because they didn’t want to be captured.</span> <span id="s382">But there were fights and we would spend – we spent a lot of time in the basement.</span> <span id="s383">We had a cellar, not a basement in an American sense.</span> <span id="s384">It was a cellar.</span> <span id="s385">We had a vineyard, and we had wine, and there were big barrels down there, and shelves and shelves full of apples that were there for the winter.</span> <span id="s386">And at one point, we had beds down there, rollaway beds.</span> <span id="s387">And we spent every night there because we knew that there would be bad fighting.</span> <span id="s388">Sometimes, but sometimes, we would forget to go down there on time, and – not forget – I’m sorry, we didn’t know that we should go down there on time.</span> <span id="s389">So, then if a fight – if a battle started, there was no way to get there because you had to get out of the house to get – to go into the cellar, and so it was too dangerous already to do that.</span> <span id="s390">So, we stayed in the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Where would you stay?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: We – yeah, I remember.</span> <span id="s393">That I remember very well.</span> <span id="s394">Sometimes the bullets were flying like crazy through the house.</span> <span id="s395">There was one night, I won’t forget, where the house across the street was a two-story house and ours was a one-story house, and they were shooting from our backyard into that house across the street back and forth.</span> <span id="s396">The bullets were flying through our windows, and I was sleeping on the sofa in a corner.</span> <span id="s397">So, if you can imagine a corner and then window-window.</span> <span id="s398">So, I was fairly well protected, but I was scared to death and I don’t have any recollection of where my brother, but my aunt and uncle were sleeping in the room next to my room, and for some strange reason, I think everybody was kind of paralyzed that no one left there, but there was a window that was – that was right facing out from this bedroom, and I remember crying and asking for somebody to come, and finally my uncle got up and came, and no sooner did he come to comfort me than a bullet landed on the pillow of his bed.</span> <span id="s399">He would’ve been killed if not for the fact that I had been crying.</span> <span id="s400">But in the morning sometimes, you looked out the window – I remember one time it was a horrible battle, and we looked – in Croatia you have these – they’re not shades in our sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Shutters?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: No, not even shutters.</span> <span id="s403">They’re more like our Venetian blinds, but they are on the outside and they are wooden, and you pull them up like that, but so, you can also turn them so that you can kind of peer out.</span> <span id="s404">I remember peering out, and that is a recollection I definitely have of carriages going by our windows full of dead – nude, dead bodies because they had collected them and then just stripped them of clothes and were taking them someplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: Were these horse drawn?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: Horse-drawn.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Like a cart?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Horse-drawn carts, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Did you see that often?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: No, not often.</span> <span id="s411">I remember that one very well.</span> <span id="s412">We lived on a main – pretty much main street on the corner of two very important main streets so that when things went by, we saw them.</span> <span id="s413">And, also, often – well, as these bullets would come through, I mean, after the war, our living room and one of the bedrooms were riddled with bullets, and the – we had these armoires and cabinets of books and they had bullet holes through them, and if you opened the tablecloths, it looked like a doily, you know, all full of beautifully separated.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: If you couldn’t get into the cellar, would you lie on the floor so that you wouldn’t be by a window?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Sometimes, yes, and we would sometimes also go into the side of the house that didn’t have windows to the street.</span> <span id="s416">There was one side of the house into the hallway, except that one night that I remember so well, when we stupidly stayed where we shouldn’t have stayed.</span> <span id="s417">I think sometimes it was so bad that nobody wanted to move.</span> <span id="s418">But most of the time, -- most of the – it’s very – it’s horrible, I hate to say that, but I remember being quite exhilarated by it all at times.</span> <span id="s419">I should have been – instead of being afraid, I used to think it was sort of very exciting to have these battles going on, and thinking it was quite great fun to sleep down in the cellar where there were always some frogs jumping around.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Maybe as a child -</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: As a child, it is so much better.</span> <span id="s422">I mean, I’m sure the adults were totally, totally traumatized, but as a child, it’s very interesting looking back, and I’m looking now at my granddaughter who is now about the age that I was at the end of the war, and I’m thinking, “Can you imagine what something like that would do to her?”</span> <span id="s423">And, yet, when I think of myself at the time, I don’t think I was so horribly scared at many of the points.</span> <span id="s424">I was more – I think there were some things that were just very scary, like seeing all these bodies going by.</span> <span id="s425">And there was a time that – an image that I have very much in my head again, that was another thing that happened in Ludbreg.</span> <span id="s426">There were – the Ustashe would take people who were thought to be sympathizers of the Partisans, which they were, many of them, and if they – sometimes they would catch them, some of them were sent to concentration camp and that includes my uncle, but my uncle who eventually married my aunt and he wasn’t Jewish.</span> <span id="s427">I didn’t explain that part, but at any rate, he ended up in concentration camp at one point in Jasenovac, and they would take them either to camp and sometimes they would hang them or kill them in some other way just in town, and I do have a very vivid image of going with one of our cleaning ladies to the main square and I wasn’t supposed to see it.</span> <span id="s428">She was holding her hand on my eyes, but I saw it.</span> <span id="s429">There was a body hanging on every one of the trees around the square, and I remember people saying – they were – because they were Partisans, that’s why.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: Now, when you saw something like that, and you saw the dead body, was that different for you then when you were in the midst of this fighting?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: Well, yeah, that – because the fighting was sort of like a “Star War” kind of thing like a game, and I didn’t really – I don’t think I understood too well at the time what is the result of all this shooting, but I was scared to death when nobody was with me, and I cried a lot.</span> <span id="s432">So, there were times when I was very scared.</span> <span id="s433">But, we played war so much, you know, when I was a child, that’s the game we played.</span> <span id="s434">You played – you played with, like I remember playing with dried corn stalks.</span> <span id="s435">You would – you know when they were cut off?</span> <span id="s436">And they were supposed to be fed to the cows, and we use those to battle each other in play war.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: And what kind of war was it?</span> <span id="s438">Middle age war or contemporary war?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: No, no, it was contemporary war.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: So, you used guns?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: These were guns, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: And were you Germans and Croatians or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: No, we were not Germans and Croatians.</span> <span id="s444">We were Ustashe and Partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: Ah-ha!</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: No, we didn’t have anything to do with Germans.</span> <span id="s447">The Germans – I never saw a German.</span> <span id="s448">All during the war, I never saw a German.</span> <span id="s449">We had our own Germans, our own Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: What side did you play on?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Oh, well, you always wanted to be the Partisans.</span> <span id="s452">Somebody had to lose, and somebody had to win.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: And did the Partisans win all the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: In our games, yes, in our games, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: And how did the games work?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: Well…</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: Did you go “bang-bang, you’re dead” or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: Yeah, and the boys would usually take the upper hand and the girls would lose.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: Was it girls against boys?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Sometimes, sometimes.</span> <span id="s463">There was an empty space across the street which belonged to the church, and it was – they just started building it, but they never finished building it.</span> <span id="s464">So, it was sort of empty, and you could hide inside there, and that’s where we often played our games, and also in our backyard we had sort of a shed.</span> <span id="s465">It was built rather than a shed.</span> <span id="s466">It was sort of attached to the structure, and in that structure we had a press for pressing grapes to get wine, and that was otherwise pretty empty.</span> <span id="s467">That was also a good place to play.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Now, this is not your grandfather’s place.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: This is the neighbor’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: No, no, that belonged to the Vrancic family.</span> <span id="s472">The Vrancic family had a house that was built by my uncle’s father, and they came to Ludbreg when he was – when that father was very young.</span> <span id="s473">So, it was in the mid-1800s.</span> <span id="s474">They were well educated and very old Croatian family.</span> <span id="s475">They count their ancestors to something like the 12th century where there were two famous Vrancic people.</span> <span id="s476">There was the Cardinal, and then there was an inventor, a fairly famous inventor by that name, and then the mother’s family was called Svagel, and they were nobility, minor nobility, nevertheless, they had the PL, which is the approval of a _______ in their name, and the silver has that and so on.</span> <span id="s477">And they established themselves in this town, and they had a dozen children, none of whom survived who remarried.</span> <span id="s478">They all died fairly young, not the children necessarily, some yes, but fairly – sort of as teenagers or young people, and as my memory goes, there were only two survivors and they were already in their fairly old age.</span> <span id="s479">One of them was Vika and the other was Ludva, and Vika remained single and died in the middle of the war, and I remember her quite well.</span> <span id="s480">Ludva was the person who was extremely well-known in that town.</span> <span id="s481">He was – he had been a mayor.</span> <span id="s482">He was a organizer of the sports club.</span> <span id="s483">He was the organizer of – he was the head of the soccer club even though he never played soccer.</span> <span id="s484">He organized everything in that town.</span> <span id="s485">He was especially having to do with music.</span> <span id="s486">He loved music.</span> <span id="s487">He played the violin.</span> <span id="s488">He organized two different kinds of orchestras.</span> <span id="s489">He was the heart of that town in terms of any kind of cultural life.</span> <span id="s490">When he fell in love with my aunt, and he, of course, this was a Croatian Catholic family, and my aunt was the daughter of the rabbi, not exactly the right combination for the times, forever, but certainly not for that time.</span> <span id="s491">And he was ten years older than she, and they knew each other especially from the bank because he was a director of a part of another bank, and she worked there.</span> <span id="s492">And, again, I know that only from stories.</span> <span id="s493">I asked him many times afterwards, “So, why didn’t you get married for such a long time?”</span> <span id="s494">Because they got married in 1937, I think, or 1939, I’m not too sure.</span> <span id="s495">I should know that, but anyway, and he always told me, “Well, she was very happy living with her family, with her parents, and I was fine living with my sister and my mother.</span> <span id="s496">There was no need to get married.”</span> <span id="s497">Well, I rather doubted that was how it was, but that’s how he always said it.</span> <span id="s498">But I’m sure that my grandparents did not – were not thrilled their daughter going with a Catholic person.</span> <span id="s499">However, in all the pictures of the family for a very long time, he’s always present.</span> <span id="s500">So, it wasn’t like he wasn’t accepted totally, and I think by the time the war was imminent in Europe, and they knew what was happening, they decided to get married.</span> <span id="s501">So, they got married.</span> <span id="s502">They actually had to go to Hungary to get married because you couldn’t get married in a civil ceremony in Croatia or Yugoslavia, that is, and neither of them was converting to anything.</span> <span id="s503">So, they got married in a civil ceremony.</span> <span id="s504">So, the house that we basically had lived was the Vrancic house, and then they and my other aunt, the Appler family, decided to build a house of their own, but it was within the same compound, the same land base.</span> <span id="s505">So, that’s how we ended up having these two houses that were next to one another, and the other one was supposed to be a big two-story house with a store on the bottom for my uncle, a small apartment in the back, which is we ended up living and these people who often hid me lived there, and then there was supposed to be two apartments upstairs, and that never got finished, of course, before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: Is this why there’s a kind of confusion in you about where you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: Because everything was so close that you can’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: Exactly, exactly.</span> <span id="s510">So, I sort of have memories of Vika living by herself in that big house, in that one house.</span> <span id="s511">We were living in an apartment, and I don’t know at one point that was.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: So, it’s confusing?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: It’s very confusing as to where I was living at what time because we did move around, but only within those three houses sort of, and my grandfather, I think, I spent the least time there, and of course, I was the youngest so that I remember that the least, and I remember the Vrancic house the best, because Vika eventually died during the war, and she died I think while my uncle was in concentration camp, and I remember seeing her dead, that was more scary than some of the battles because I ran into the house and nobody told me she was dead and there she was.</span> <span id="s514">But then once she died and was buried and we were always in that house from then on, and that’s, you know, I remember, that’s – we were set then in that house from then on.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: We have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: Do you have any recollection of your Uncle Ludva being taken or going or leaving or not being there?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: Not being there, very much.</span> <span id="s520">Being taken away, no.</span> <span id="s521">I must not have been present.</span> <span id="s522">But not being there, yes.</span> <span id="s523">I remember that Giza was very sad and very upset much of the time.</span> <span id="s524">I remember that we were allowed to make packages and send them, and I remember very well that she was making packages.</span> <span id="s525">I remember her making sort of vats of this roux.</span> <span id="s526">This was what was being sent, roux.</span> <span id="s527">And so you – you made this brown mass which would then congeal and solidify, and then he would put – he would use that to put in the water to make sort of a soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: He was where?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: He was in Jasenovac.</span> <span id="s530">He was Jasenovac, and eventually when he would return – luckily I found out, I mean, he was lucky that he returned, but he saw my father there.</span> <span id="s531">So, my father was there for also for quite awhile.</span> <span id="s532">He was taken with a number of other non-Jews from Ludbreg, and they were there, I can’t remember for how long, but at least a year, I think, and I don’t know why, I’ve forgotten, but certainly I talked to him afterwards, but I don’t have a good memory of how long he was there.</span> <span id="s533">But I do know all the stories he told me when he returned of how and why he survived, and basically they found out that – well, they knew – that he was a banker, and so they put him to work in an office in Jasenovac to balance their books, to work on the books, and so that he didn’t have to be out in the rain and snow and people, there was one person in the office who was an Ustashe but not one of those – not one of those that went around killing people necessarily, and he was reasonably kind to him.</span> <span id="s534">In fact, after the war, I have definite memories of Stricek sending packages to him because later on, he was in jail, I mean, yeah, in jail for many years after the war.</span> <span id="s535">But this is so – the one thing that saved him was that.</span> <span id="s536">The other thing that saved him was that he was always, as I told you, an organizer of things cultural, and they wanted to have, the Ustashe wanted to have entertainment.</span> <span id="s537">So, he organized a chorus, and he collected anybody that he knew.</span> <span id="s538">So, there were some nieces of his – second niece because he didn’t have brothers and sisters, cousins, two cousins’ daughters were there – he collected all these people and they created a chorus.</span> <span id="s539">So, of course, he claimed to have to practice if they wanted to have a good performance.</span> <span id="s540">So, that saved them also from having to work so hard, and they’d sometimes allow them access to some more food.</span> <span id="s541">He said my father, on the other hand, worked very hard.</span> <span id="s542">Nevertheless, my father survived until the very end.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: He did?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: But didn’t your father sing?</span> <span id="s546">So, how come he didn’t get into the chorus?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Well, he, yeah, he may have, but that’s – I think, in fact, he did, but there were people that they didn’t want to – that didn’t allow them to be collected because people who were young and strong, they made them work.</span> <span id="s548">I think that my – Stricek remembers my father working with bricks, and carrying stones and bricks and things, but he was much, much younger.</span> <span id="s549">Stricek at that point, he was born in 1885, he was old, and he had this family of people who were dying with weak lungs at a moment’s notice, and he was – he would have never made it.</span> <span id="s550">So, anyway, at one point, they released that group and they all came back to Ludbreg.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Now, was that surprising?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Yes and no.</span> <span id="s553">I was very surprised at that for much of my life until very recently when I was working on the Jasenovac files.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: At the Holocaust Museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: Yes, at the Holocaust Museum, and I found out that that was – that was very much a norm, that a lot of people especially those who were not Jews or Serbs, but were Croats who were just thought to be Partisan sympathizers and so on, that they were coming and going.</span> <span id="s556">There are many testimonies that I have listened to now, and much material that I had seen, that people would say that they were released, and even Magda, we were talking to Magda.</span> <span id="s557">She was saying how people were collected to a camp in Zagreb and they were released to go home and get their clothes or something, and it seems that while they were extremely cruel, within Jasenovac, that they were also very disorganized, and sometimes people would come and go and they were constantly sending people from one place to another.</span> <span id="s558">I believe that was the most amazing thing that I found in reading the Jasenovac material, to what extent people were constantly being moved from Radiska to Jasenovac to Lepoglava, spending times on trains going back and forth, sometimes being released.</span> <span id="s559">It’s amazing, and we haven’t quite figured out.</span> <span id="s560">Lucie and I are both very surprised, and we haven’t quite figured out what is the basis of that except that we feel that there was not a total organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Now, did your uncle come back before Giza was deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: They were able to spend some time together.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Spend some time together, but then I don’t know why he wasn’t – I don’t know where exactly he was physically when somebody – when somebody came to get her.</span> <span id="s565">She was apparently denounced.</span> <span id="s566">As I told you, that whole town was very good about not denouncing anybody, but there was one person, and Stricek knew who that was, and I wish for history’s sake that I could remember his name now, but I can’t, who denounced her, and they came and got her.</span> <span id="s567">Somebody did warn her.</span> <span id="s568">I think she hid in the attic of that unfinished house, but they found her.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: She was denounced as what?</span> <span id="s570">As a sympathizer?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: As a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: As a Jew?</span> <span id="s573">But wouldn’t she have been listed as a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: She was, but people weren’t paying that much attention to that.</span> <span id="s575">She’s on the list because the picture I have of the list, she’s on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: They weren’t doing very much with it?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: No, they weren’t doing anything, but at that moment, I don’t know whether it was a particular person, a particular person who was in charge, even – it was towards the end, they were already losing the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: This was late, this was 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: It was very late, 1944, right.</span> <span id="s580">It was very, very late, and then Stricek tried to go after her.</span> <span id="s581">He did go after her.</span> <span id="s582">He followed her and went all the way to the border and tried desperately to get her out, and was unable to get her out.</span> <span id="s583">We think that she was shipped to Auschwitz, but we don’t know exactly.</span> <span id="s584">We never found any records, and that was the end of her, unfortunately.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: When he came back, did you stay with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: Yeah, I stayed with him.</span> <span id="s587">I stayed with him.</span> <span id="s588">That was pretty much already almost the end of the war.</span> <span id="s589">And…</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: But your brother’s with you the whole time?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: Yes, my brother’s with me all the time.</span> <span id="s592">And, then came liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: Let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s594">You’re now a little bit older.</span> <span id="s595">You’re like five.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: In 1944.</span> <span id="s598">So, as people are leaving and Giza is clearly an important person to you, you have some sense of who she is, her disappearance, does that…?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: That was very upsetting.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: Does that bother you in a way that the others would not because you were so little?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: Yeah, they all bothered me that they would be going away.</span> <span id="s602">I just didn’t know how going away, you know, what – you know, you go away, you come back.</span> <span id="s603">I think with her, I already had a sense that perhaps she won’t come back, that bad things were going on, that people die.</span> <span id="s604">I think at that point, I-</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Do you think you understood what death was?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: I think, well, yeah, I’ve seen – I saw a lot of death since then, all the battles, all the dead people.</span> <span id="s607">You know, living nights – oh, I didn’t tell you about one night when there was a big battle and the big mill which was just a little bit more than a block from us was set on fire by the Partisans.</span> <span id="s608">That was awful.</span> <span id="s609">People crying because – all over the street – because everything, all the wheat or corn, whatever they had that was to sustain them for the year was in the mill ready to be milled and it all burned down.</span> <span id="s610">The smell in the town for a long time, the smell hung around of this burnt stuff, and people who were, you know, I, at the point, I understood – I understood what it means to die, or to be dead.</span> <span id="s611">So, I remember being upset, and I remember Stricek being very upset for a long time afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: Did he say anything to you?</span> <span id="s613">Does he tell you that he has tried to find her?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: He did.</span> <span id="s616">At that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: I think so, Again, you know, do I remember it then, or do I remember it a year later or in 1956?</span> <span id="s618">It is very hard to tell, but I think I had the sense of what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: Was he a loving person to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: Very, very, he was one of the sweetest people that you could imagine.</span> <span id="s621">Not only to me, he was Stricek, which is dimunitive [sic] for uncle, to the entire town, and because I called him that, everybody called him that.</span> <span id="s622">He is referred to as Stricek Ludva by everybody, and there is – there is a monograph, well, there is a history of Ludbreg published by a Mrs. Winter, and it came out about two years ago, and there are sections on a variety of topics including Jews of Croatia, oh, Jews of Ludbreg, but there is a few people have their own chapter, and there is a chapter on him with pictures, and it’s Nas Stricek Ludva, which means “Our Uncle Ludva”, that’s what he was.</span> <span id="s623">Our house was always open and full of people and company and he was – he was – he was the most loving person you could imagine.</span> <span id="s624">I was extremely lucky, extremely lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Was Giza like that, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: She was much quieter.</span> <span id="s627">He was, you know-</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: He was the social one.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: He was the social one, yeah.</span> <span id="s630">She was much quieter, and, of course, she – I only knew her in really bad times, where I knew him afterwards, after the war, when his true self came forth, you know?</span> <span id="s631">So, it’s interesting because one of the things that this Mrs. Winters says, she says, “All the good things…”, she was, by the way, very famous, a very well-known person in the Partisans during the war, and she considered herself a historian, and I am sorry, very sorry that she died before I could talk to her because she writes very nice things including about him, including the fact that he adopted me and my brother after the war, and then she says things like, in one sentence she says that even that was not, that he lost so much during the war, and then in the end he even lost me because I married this in quotes: “rich Jew”, which made me just wrinkle because my husband was anything but rich, and that I left and left him there, which of course wasn’t the case.</span> <span id="s632">Yes, I left, but very much with his – with his approval, and he knew he was quite elderly and he knew that he wanted me to have as good a life as I possibly could.</span> <span id="s633">And he did everything in his life to make my life as good as possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: So, do you remember liberation as liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: Yes, yes, I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: What was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: What I remember most is columns and columns of Ustashe being marched through the town and being taken who knows where, and all of us standing outside and looking at these people and these forced marches that they were on.</span> <span id="s638">I don’t know where they were going and to where they were going, and there wasn’t anybody that knew, but everybody sort of standing around and these people were hungry and they were thirsty and here and there people gave them a little water, but other than that, people just stared as they were walking by, and so all of a sudden the tables were reversed and everybody was saying, “They deserve it.”</span> <span id="s639">And that is what I remember most is this, you know, the conquered people walking by.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Were they yelling at them?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: I don’t remember yelling.</span> <span id="s642">I think, in fact, there was quite a lot of silence, sort of, we were just staring at them.</span> <span id="s643">There were huge number, there were thousands of people being marched by, what looked to me like thousands.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: Were they going north?</span> <span id="s645">Do you have any recollection?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: They were going – I remember which way they were going in Ludbreg, and they were going east.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: East?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: East.</span> <span id="s649">So, because I mean, we were between – Ludbreg is between two larger towns, Koprivnica and Varazdin, and Varazdin’s to the west, and Koprivnica to the east, and they were going across the bridge, across the river toward Koprivnica.</span> <span id="s650">What happened after that, I don’t know, but you know, that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: But, you knew from your war games at the very least-</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Who was the enemy and who wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: Oh, boy did we know who was the enemy all of the time, yes.</span> <span id="s655">We knew who the enemy was.</span> <span id="s656">We were free when the Partisans were there.</span> <span id="s657">You know, I didn’t have to pretend.</span> <span id="s658">At anytime that the Ustashe were in charge of the town, I had to – well, I had this red hair, flaming red hair.</span> <span id="s659">I was extremely noticeable because there isn’t a Croat almost anywhere with red hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: Only Jewish Croats?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: Yes, I did not know any red heads, and so there was a time that Pavelic came to town.</span> <span id="s662">I think it was towards the end sometime, I don’t know exactly why he was invited – he was a speaker.</span> <span id="s663">Well, all my friends were going.</span> <span id="s664">I wanted to go too, to see, and I was told absolutely not, and I remember that I was told I could look – we had a stone fence, and I could look across the stone fence, peer out.</span> <span id="s665">It was in the summertime I think, but I had to wear a hat on my head because you don’t want any strangers not noticing you with this red hair, and my brother also had red hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: I was going to ask you if he had red hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Yes, the two of us had red hair, and we kept waiting for someone in the family to have red hair, but my grandson has slightly reddish, but it’s my – the males in my family seem to have red beards, but I’m the only redhead female so far.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: It was really flaming red?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: Yeah, very red hair yeah.</span> <span id="s670">So, that was a real liability, and peasant women would come into town and tell me horrible stories.</span> <span id="s671">I remember one telling me, one time – I don’t know if it was during the war or not, but I remember she told me, “If you ever go to Varazdin”, the bigger town, “be very”, or Zagreb, my goodness, “be very careful not to go near any kind of a place where there is a pharmacy because, you know, they might catch you and press you and make medicine out of you.”</span> <span id="s672">You know, there were – in the small towns, these kind of prejudices and misinformation are rampant.</span> <span id="s673">So, I knew that my red hair was some kind of a liability and I was to hide it all times, and I hated it, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: You didn’t like it?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: I did not like it at all.</span> <span id="s676">I just hated it.</span> <span id="s677">I felt like, “Okay, so maybe I’m redhead because I’m Jewish, I’m different.”</span> <span id="s678">And, I didn’t like being Jewish.</span> <span id="s679">I mean, it was a liability, and anyway, at that point, I really didn’t know that Jewish was anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: But, you knew Jewish was bad in terms of the Ustashe, not in terms of being Croatian, or could you not make that distinction?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: I don’t think I could make that distinction.</span> <span id="s682">Again, you know, I knew that this was something that they could catch me for and I would be in trouble, but no one told me, you know, no one told me why it was bad being Jewish, or why it was – or maybe if they told me I did not understand or I didn’t understand, but I just knew that nobody ever said bad things to me about it.</span> <span id="s683">No one said, “Oh, you’re a Jew, therefore” or “it’s bad.”</span> <span id="s684">I mean I knew from being in school, we had to go to churches in school.</span> <span id="s685">I just started school.</span> <span id="s686">I was, really, in first grade before the war, and we had to go to church on Sunday and we would line up and go to church, and I knew that I didn’t know some of their songs.</span> <span id="s687">I was inventing.</span> <span id="s688">I remember inventing songs.</span> <span id="s689">They would be singing something like, and I knew the melodies but I sometimes didn’t know the words, and I would be inventing something about birds singing or something.</span> <span id="s690">But, you know, I lived across from the church, and I’d go there with my friends.</span> <span id="s691">And I knew very – I knew very early that Jews – that there were Jews who killed Jesus, and that that was bad, and I didn’t want to be part of that.</span> <span id="s692">But that’s what I knew, and I didn’t have any idea after the war what Jewish was, but of course, after the war, it didn’t matter because nobody followed any religion after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: Were you asked or trained in some way to be a little Catholic girl so that in case-</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: So, did you go to catechism?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: Mm-hmm, but we had it in school.</span> <span id="s699">We had it in school the first year that I was in school, we had catechism in school, which is interesting because before the war, there was – there was – religion was taught apparently in schools, and I have this picture of my grandfather teaching Jewish children, and then there was – there was a Russian – there was an Orthodox priest teaching whatever.</span> <span id="s700">There were Orthodox children, there were Serbian children, and then there was the Catholic priest, but of course, during the war there was only Catholic, but I don’t remember so much any priests.</span> <span id="s701">Somehow I’ve don’t – but, I – I do remember the book of catechism in school.</span> <span id="s702">I don’t remember who was teaching it.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: Was this after Giza was taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: That I can’t tell.</span> <span id="s705">That I can’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Do you think it was when you were five years old or six?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: It must have been at the same time.</span> <span id="s708">I did not go to school at five.</span> <span id="s709">In Croatia, in Yugoslavia, you didn’t go to school until you were seven, and they smuggled me into school early.</span> <span id="s710">I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s711">I think my uncle felt like, “What are you doing here?</span> <span id="s712">She’s already starting to read, let her to go to school.”</span> <span id="s713">And because of his position in town, or their position in town, and we were friends with all the teachers, they just let me go.</span> <span id="s714">I was the youngest as it is even when I finished school later on.</span> <span id="s715">I was the youngest, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: Did you like church?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: I liked church because it was sort of like, there was music and pomp and circumstance, you know, there, you know, you got dressed up and there were holidays, but I don’t know so much, I mean, you know, because I remember girls having to get dressed up and you would go in a procession and throwing rose petals around.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: Now, did you go to synagogue when you’re at grandfather’s?</span> <span id="s719">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: No synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: Right, so, your physical experience with religion is Catholicism.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: Yes, as a child, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: You know that you’re Jewish, but it’s not your experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: Right.</span> <span id="s727">That was not my experience until I was 16 years old, but, of course, I had no experience with any, you know, and I knew who – I mean, I knew who I was because I had my own – my grandfather’s books were saved.</span> <span id="s728">Again, I don’t know exactly who must have been Ludva Vrancic’s teacher who somehow facilitated for the books, the main books, to be taken out of the synagogue that my grandfather built, lived, and being brought to the Vrancic household and being put in the attic.</span> <span id="s729">So, that is how I end up having a lot of my grandfather’s books, not my grandfather’s, but the synagogue’s books, some of my grandfather’s books.</span> <span id="s730">So, they were all stored there.</span> <span id="s731">So, I knew, you know, what Hebrew looked like, and that, but that was the language that was used.</span> <span id="s732">I have pictures of my grandfather, you know, wearing different kind of clothes.</span> <span id="s733">I remember things like my Aunt Giza when one time when we escaped together, because there was going to be a raid and we went to another town to the town of Varazdin, and I remember that she wasn’t going to eat in that house.</span> <span id="s734">I used to eat, but she opened a can of sardines.</span> <span id="s735">I remember that so well.</span> <span id="s736">I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s737">I remember her can of sardines.</span> <span id="s738">So, she was obviously keeping kosher.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: Kosher.</span> <span id="s740">In some way.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s742">But, you know, I was, you know, I was eating everything everywhere.</span> <span id="s743">When I think about eating, the thing that I remember the best is when I was staying with the Runjak family, sometimes when the Ustashe were there, and we stayed – Mr. Runjak was a painter.</span> <span id="s744">I don’t mean art.</span> <span id="s745">I mean walls.</span> <span id="s746">And she was a nurse.</span> <span id="s747">She took care of cataracts.</span> <span id="s748">Everybody seemed to have cataracts, not cataracts, I’m sorry, trachoma.</span> <span id="s749">There was a lot of trachoma, and she was-</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: What’s that?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: It’s – trachoma is a, I think it’s also the word in English, but it’s a disease of the eye.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: Glucoma?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: No, no, not glaucoma.</span> <span id="s754">We have to look that up, but I think it’s trachoma, and I think it’s – it’s a transmittable disease and a lot of peasants had it, and she was – she had a little clinic of sorts that she ran and they all came to her for her to take care of the eyes, but there was very little money in that family.</span> <span id="s755">I mean, there were three, you know, three teenage kids.</span> <span id="s756">I think one, or maybe two of them still survive and I see them when I go back, and so, food was precious, right?</span> <span id="s757">Though I was never hungry, really hungry at all.</span> <span id="s758">That comes from living in the village where everybody had land and chickens and things, but I remember that Mr. Runjak because he was going to work, he could have scrambled eggs for breakfast, and we all had to take turns, who was going to get the empty pan and a piece of bread to eat – to rub the bread in the fat and eat it, or maybe have a crumb or two of the egg left.</span> <span id="s759">I remember that very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: Okay why don’t we stop the tape?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">End of Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: When there was liberation, were you expecting Giza to come back?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: People were – I don’t know what I expected, but everybody kept asking me this question.</span> <span id="s765">Like, you would be on the street, and some stranger would come and say, “Are you expecting your mother and father to come back?”</span> <span id="s766">Lots of people asked me that question, and not only at the time of liberation, but much later on, and people would concoct stories, you know, and say, well, they heard so-and-so was in Russia for such-and-such a time, and they returned, and am I expected somebody to come back?</span> <span id="s767">And I may have expected somebody to come back, but not terribly actively.</span> <span id="s768">Some people, of course, came back.</span> <span id="s769">Two of my uncles returned, but of all the family, that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: And did they want to adopt you?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: Yes, they came to Ludbreg looking for me, looking to – not just for me; looking to see who was there, who survived of my mother’s family.</span> <span id="s772">One of them was my mother’s brother.</span> <span id="s773">He’s the only one actually of the entire Deutsch family who survived.</span> <span id="s774">On my father’s side of the family, a few siblings survived, half of them.</span> <span id="s775">And this uncle, my Uncle Bernard, who goes now by Dov and lives in Israel, he survived because he was prisoner of war.</span> <span id="s776">He remained – he was in the Yugoslav Army, and became prisoner – actually, Erne was also prisoner of war.</span> <span id="s777">They both were in the army.</span> <span id="s778">They became prisoners of war, and so survived.</span> <span id="s779">It was a much easier survival from what – I just spoke to Bernard very recently and he was telling me stories, how they basically lived the same way like the rest of the prisoners of war, and they were able to get packages and they were fed reasonably decently, et cetera, et cetera.</span> <span id="s780">So, the two of them returned.</span> <span id="s781">Both of them asked me to go with them, and I absolutely refused.</span> <span id="s782">When I think about, at the age of seven, I was totally aghast that I would go with these people whom I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s783">And my Uncle Bernard, Dov, got married to another survivor, this survivor of the camps, to Estie (ph), she survived Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s784">They left Yugoslavia, and went to France, to the south of France, and then eventually to Israel where they still live.</span> <span id="s785">My other uncle, Erne, got remarried.</span> <span id="s786">His wife, Irma (ph), and daughter, Edita (ph), were killed.</span> <span id="s787">By the way, that’s one of my really vivid memories – his daughter was at one point released from a concentration camp, and I remember her coming to my grandfather’s house and being totally skin and bones, full of lice, and I remember that she looked weird, and they put tar on her head, and she just looked so crazy to me.</span> <span id="s788">And I was, obviously, a little girl, and again, she then continued to live in Ludbreg and not in total and absolute Anne Frank-style hiding, and then she was taken away again.</span> <span id="s789">But, anyway, she then was taken away and was killed.</span> <span id="s790">But he remarried, Erne remarried, and married a woman who became a widow and had two children, and they eventually left for Israel, and I remained behind.</span> <span id="s791">I think that from the date of the adoption – I was adopted by my uncle, and my brother also, almost immediately after the war in ’46.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: This is before the came – before the brother-</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: I have a feeling that it was before they came, and so, you know, there was a great tug of war, and I never heard from either for a very long time.</span> <span id="s794">I think they were very angry and upset.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: Now, were they angry at you?</span> <span id="s796">They were angry at-?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: Well, they were angry at my uncle, but it – it manifested itself with the fact that I never heard from them again.</span> <span id="s798">However, the person that I did hear from eventually, but I don’t remember how soon after the war, I heard from another uncle who survived, another of my father’s brothers.</span> <span id="s799">So, in my father’s family, there were six children, and one sister and two brothers survived, and this one brother was in Bergen-Belsen and then was rescued out of Bergen-Belsen and went to Switzerland, and he married Magda, and they had one child a seven-year-old child or so when I heard from them.</span> <span id="s800">So, maybe he was – maybe he was about five, six at the time.</span> <span id="s801">So, it must have been, I think that child was born sort of ’45, ’46.</span> <span id="s802">So, I heard sort of into the ‘50s more or less continually from them, and remember very vividly getting a package from them, a ball point pen where you could see through the plastic.</span> <span id="s803">That was so exciting, and a red plastic little purse like that, and a box of Frigor chocolates, my box of Frigor chocolates, very exciting.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: Frigor?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: Frigor, the Swiss brand.</span> <span id="s806">They were living in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s807">Of course, we had no – after the war we had so little, and we, as a family, had more.</span> <span id="s808">I mean Stricek and I and my brother, had more than many families.</span> <span id="s809">But, anyway, this whole chocolates and stuff came much later.</span> <span id="s810">It came after my brother was no longer in the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: Let’s talk a little bit just about this tragedy with-</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: With my brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: With your brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: Now, there we were having survived the war, and it was September and everything was going fine, and it was time to go and have – and collect grapes, have a grape harvest, and we were at the grape harvest, and the day after my brother was sick, and it just seemed to be sick like children get sick.</span> <span id="s815">And then his temperature went up and up and up, and then it turned out that two other children in town apparently had scarlet fever, and it turned out it was scarlet fever, but it really wasn’t diagnosed in time, and – in time for the doctor to say, “Go to the nearest town,” which was 25 kilometers from us, or “Let’s go get penicillin someplace,” and apparently he had a weak heart, and he was sick for three days and he died.</span> <span id="s816">It was quite a tragedy.</span> <span id="s817">It was a tragedy for me, even then, and I was old enough to realize it, I don’t think I was nearly as affected as Stricek was.</span> <span id="s818">I don’t think he ever got over his death.</span> <span id="s819">He just adored that child.</span> <span id="s820">He adored me, too, but I think he really adored my brother.</span> <span id="s821">And I was – the whole town mourned.</span> <span id="s822">It was really sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s825">It was very sad.</span> <span id="s826">It was just, you know, I think scarlet fever is a bad disease even now, and at that time I think there was just no – we had no antibiotics.</span> <span id="s827">It was right after the war, and nobody was alert enough to realize that you could die that fast from something like that, you know?</span> <span id="s828">You just go, “Oh, the kid is sick.</span> <span id="s829">He has a high fever.”</span> <span id="s830">So, it was bad.</span> <span id="s831">It was tragic.</span> <span id="s832">So, after that, I was an only child, and with not a single blood relative remaining within Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s833">So-</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: Did you feel almost like Ludva was as good as a blood relative?</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s836">I never – no, I’m only making a statement, a general statement, but it wasn’t that I felt that he was any different then a blood relative.</span> <span id="s837">I really felt like he was my father.</span> <span id="s838">And the only time that I used to think how sad it was that I didn’t have my parents, and I know that sounds terrible because people often ask me that, you know, “How did you feel about your parents?”</span> <span id="s839">but, because I didn’t know them, and I didn’t have that experience, it was only theoretically that I missed my parents.</span> <span id="s840">Aunt Magda gets very upset when I say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: It makes perfect sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: It makes sense.</span> <span id="s843">The only time that I would, you know, feel sorry for myself, was when something would happen that I would get punished for something, and then I would say, “If my mother were alive she wouldn’t do XYZ,” you know, like I don’t know.</span> <span id="s844">If we had succession of cleaning ladies and housekeepers.</span> <span id="s845">We had some very nice housekeepers, some people who were very nice to me.</span> <span id="s846">But if I would get punished or had to clean my room or whatever I had to do, I would say, “If my mother was alive, I wouldn’t have to be doing this.”</span> <span id="s847">Of course, I would have.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: Yes, would you say that out loud?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: No, but I would think that to myself, feeling sorry for myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: Now, you said at some point this afternoon, that your father actually survived the war.</span> <span id="s851">Is that the case?</span> <span id="s852">Or up to the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: From what I was told by people – a person who apparently witnessed my father’s death, is that at the end – at the end of Jasenovac, there were many outbreaks.</span> <span id="s854">There was a major one at one point.</span> <span id="s855">I keep reading about that in all the records.</span> <span id="s856">But, apparently, there was confusion and they were killing people en masse and so, people were trying to escape and there was – it seems that my father and a few other people escaped at the very end, and that they went someplace into the woods, and then came down – came close to a village looking for the food, and that they were surprised by a German, I think, German patrol, or Ustashe patrol, I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s857">And, then he was shot.</span> <span id="s858">So, that’s the most unfortunate, that he was able to survive until the very end, and then not make it.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: This is going to sound like an odd question, but do you think that if your parents had come back, you would have felt about them the way that you did about the two brothers who came?</span> <span id="s860">Just like, “Who are you?”</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: Possibly, but I think I understood parents.</span> <span id="s862">I understood -</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: You understood?</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: Yeah, I understood the concept.</span> <span id="s865">I understood that, and I think Stricek would have understood and would have – would have given me away.</span> <span id="s866">Yeah, given me away, I mean, he could have kept me.</span> <span id="s867">You know, I was, to him, basically a grandchild because my aunt – my aunt, who was his wife, as I said, was 15 years older, then he was 10 years older than my aunt.</span> <span id="s868">So, there was a 25 year gap.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: Between your parents and him?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: So, how old do you think he was at the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: So, he was born in 1885.</span> <span id="s873">I’m very bad at math.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: So, he’s 45 or 50?</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: In his 50s, right, and so – oh, when did I feel sorry for myself for not have had my parents?</span> <span id="s876">For example, he was fairly strict.</span> <span id="s877">When I was a very little child, I could do anything.</span> <span id="s878">I could climb walls if I wanted to, but as I got older and older, then restrictions remained, you know.</span> <span id="s879">I had to be careful about this and that, and boys and so on, and then I was always – I would always say, “Well, you see, he’s so old, he doesn’t understand anything.</span> <span id="s880">If I had younger parents, they would have understood.”</span> <span id="s881">Nonsense, of course, but, you know, that’s – it’s a good way of looking at it.</span> <span id="s882">So, I always used to say, “I’m going to have my children very young so that I’ll understand them better.”</span> <span id="s883">We’d have to ask my children how I did.</span> <span id="s884">I did have my children very young, but I don’t think that that was necessarily what happened, but I always worried about him getting married, for example.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: And what would happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: And what would happen, and there was some possibilities.</span> <span id="s887">We had some very appropriate housekeepers at times.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: What did you think would happen?</span> <span id="s889">That they would not want you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: No, no, no, I didn’t think that.</span> <span id="s891">I was just jealous.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: You liked having him to yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: Oh, yes, you know, I was in charge.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: When you think back now, does it surprise you that someone who is 55 years old would want to adopt a little girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: Well, I don’t -</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: Or, was he just very special?</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: He was just very special.</span> <span id="s898">I – I don’t think, I’ve never thought about it in that way.</span> <span id="s899">Of course, if I think now, I find a 55 – I mean, I remained a widow at the age of 54.</span> <span id="s900">That’s about the same age, and I certainly wouldn’t think about starting at this point to adopt a child.</span> <span id="s901">So, I can imagine that age very much, but I think I was there all along.</span> <span id="s902">It was just, you know, it was just a paper thing.</span> <span id="s903">It wasn’t a – it was just continuing status quo rather than creating something new.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: Clearly, he loved Giza so much and the family, that there was no way that he was going to abandon you.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: Or your brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: No, no, no, I was just part of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: And, he – from your description, he was such a social person -</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: That privacy was not the big issue for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: Oh, it wasn’t an issue at all.</span> <span id="s912">There was no privacy in that house.</span> <span id="s913">No, there was somebody there from morning, noon ‘til night, there were always people in the house, and there was always something being served.</span> <span id="s914">And people were always visiting.</span> <span id="s915">So, that wasn’t an issue.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: Did he tell you about your parents, what he remembered about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: He told me, but he didn’t know my parents all that well.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: He didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: No, I mean, he knew – he knew my mother, but he barely knew my father, because my parents were married about two years or so when I was born, and my father never lived in Ludbreg, and Stricek never lived in Zagreb.</span> <span id="s920">So, I mean, you know it was – he knew my mother as a young woman growing up, and she was away at school, of course, because there was, you know, in Ludbreg, there were only eight grades of school, and so, my mother already was sent to Cakovec to go to school at the age of 13 or 14, whenever it was.</span> <span id="s921">So, I’m sure he didn’t know her all that well to be able to tell me very much about her.</span> <span id="s922">I mean, there were always things he told me.</span> <span id="s923">I mean, music was extremely important to him.</span> <span id="s924">I was always told I needed to study music, and my mother sang very well apparently.</span> <span id="s925">So, that was always told me.</span> <span id="s926">I was always told that she was very good with languages, which I inherited somehow and also I could sing, so that was always, “That’s what you have from your mother.”</span> <span id="s927">Well, both my parents.</span> <span id="s928">My mother lived in Cakovec for a bit of time, and apparently learned Hungarian while she was there, just as a side thing.</span> <span id="s929">So, it was a big thing, you know.</span> <span id="s930">To study languages was very important, and I was always given all the opportunities, but, you know, I was given a lot of opportunities and I was aware of that because we lived surrounded by in this world of farms and farming families, and there were very few so-called “intellectuals” families in town, and you know, I was one of those, and I had more than most people, and I was made aware, you know, of, you know, noblesse oblige, and I had to behave well, and I was told I had to learn how to do things in the house, so that I can tell maids what to do, those kinds of things.</span> <span id="s931">So, I knew I sort of lived in sort of semi-privileged world, and I enjoyed it all.</span> <span id="s932">I liked to learn, and I, you know, there were books everywhere, and for fun I was reading Dante’s Trilogy.</span> <span id="s933">I love to look at the pictures of the Inferno.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: It must have reminded you of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s936">[Laughs.]</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: How does he earn a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: He was back to being a bank director.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: Oh, he was.</span> <span id="s940">So, he was doing very well?</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s942">Well, you know, in that world, comparatively.</span> <span id="s943">Yes, we – we still had, of course, our house, and then we were – there were – he was constantly working on getting some of the other things back, like the vineyard was left to us, but, of course, that was always an outlay of money, because we had to pay somebody to work it and then nobody ever sold anything practically.</span> <span id="s944">We only sold wood – there was a little forest and we could sell wood and gravel, and then there was stuff in the house that we were able to sell.</span> <span id="s945">There was jewelry left from before the war, and slowly we sold quite a bit of that.</span> <span id="s946">I have a very vivid memory of taking some chains which I liked very much, gold chains, and having to – somebody came and put them on the scale, and that was the money.</span> <span id="s947">But, that is how – oh, and there were clothes from his sisters and so on that we slowly sold, and extra furniture, and we traded for things like potatoes and whatever, you know, else we needed to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: What happened in terms of religion?</span> <span id="s949">Was he an observant Catholic?</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: No.</span> <span id="s953">He was not an observant Catholic, but I don’t remember him ever going to church.</span> <span id="s954">There was sometimes things that we did do in the house.</span> <span id="s955">I remember that we did have a Christmas tree, mainly because the maids or the housekeepers or whoever they were put one up, and I would, of course, couldn’t help but love it, and I’d get presents.</span> <span id="s956">And, the only other thing that I have a memory of besides that holiday, was that the day – Three Kings Day, whatever it’s called now.</span> <span id="s957">You know, it’s the last day of Christmas, after Christmas.</span> <span id="s958">The custom in Ludbreg was for the priest to come through the houses and do -</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: Bless?</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: Yeah, bless the house and put some chalk marks, I think, I think, of the saints or something like that on the – and, of course, Stricek, who was very welcoming of everybody, allowed the priest to come, too.</span> <span id="s961">So, the priest came.</span> <span id="s962">We sat down.</span> <span id="s963">We had a good talk, and religion at that time was so frowned upon.</span> <span id="s964">No one went to church anymore, and that priest was sort of, you know, he didn’t push it.</span> <span id="s965">That was the only thing that happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: And, what happened to you knowing that you were at least born Jewish?</span> <span id="s967">There are very few Jews left in Yugoslavia.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: There was this one family that returned, the Weinrebe family, whom I adored and they were Stricek’s best friends.</span> <span id="s969">But they didn’t do anything either, and so, I just knew that they were Jewish and what had happened during the war, and eventually, their daughter, the younger daughter, is five years older than I am.</span> <span id="s970">So, when – and, she wasn’t living in that town.</span> <span id="s971">They sent her to Zagreb to go to school.</span> <span id="s972">So, I saw very little of her.</span> <span id="s973">But as we got older, we got closer and closer, and still now we’re very good friends.</span> <span id="s974">I talked to her on the phone yesterday.</span> <span id="s975">But, I was – I was hoping to meet somebody because I was becoming a little curious about the whole thing.</span> <span id="s976">But, at the age of 13, I finished school in Ludbreg and I went off to Varazdin to go to high school.</span> <span id="s977">And there wasn’t a Jew left there either that I knew, nobody, nobody in my high school.</span> <span id="s978">By the time I got to the university, there may have been some, but I was not aware of it.</span> <span id="s979">I remember hearing a name that I thought, “Well, she might be Jewish,” but by that time, I had been to Switzerland, and that was a whole – and then all of a sudden, I started to understand what Jewish meant.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: Because you went to see the -?</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: To my uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: To your uncle, and they were Orthodox?</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: They were Orthodox.</span> <span id="s984">They were Orthodox.</span> <span id="s985">I went from like nothing to a totally Orthodox household.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: Was that comfortable?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: I was fine with that.</span> <span id="s988">I seem to be fine with -</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: You’re very flexible.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: I think I’m a bit.</span> <span id="s991">I think that’s probably what the war did to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: Yeah, because you keep changing.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: Yeah, it’s okay.</span> <span id="s994">So, this is the thing now.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: So, let me ask you something about the politics.</span> <span id="s996">What happens – now, there’s a Communist regime.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: There.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: There?</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: So, you’re living there, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: So,</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: At that time, I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: What’s ____?</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: So, I’m thinking now, no, not now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: No, but then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: Yes, historical present, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: Historical present.</span> <span id="s1009">So, are you feeling very ideologically sympathetic?</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A: Boy, am I, yes because this is the people that won the war.</span> <span id="s1011">I mean, we are gung-ho Partisan.</span> <span id="s1012">My uncles wearing the, you know, he’s a – I’m a victim of fascism and so is he.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: That was your privilege?</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: That gives me some – well, eventually it gives me – it gives me the privilege of going to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1015">I would not have been able to go otherwise.</span> <span id="s1016">No, absolutely not.</span> <span id="s1017">I mean, absolutely not.</span> <span id="s1018">There are pictures of my uncle, you know, wearing a red star.</span> <span id="s1019">I mean, we were really very much and that’s how he was able to go back to being in a position – to being in a position of power because he had suffered during the war.</span> <span id="s1020">So, even though they were very strange people that had come to power.</span> <span id="s1021">I mean, people from outside whom we didn’t know, who weren’t quite as well-educated as we would have liked them to have been, but happen to have been in the Partisans, and therefore they were assuming positions of the Chief of Police, et cetera, et cetera, but we were very good friends of theirs.</span> <span id="s1022">And, ideologically, we were to that side.</span> <span id="s1023">I mean, I especially, as a young person, I think my uncle eventually understood that some of this was not good as time went on and, you know, we were under repressed and the Russian rule, and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s1024">I remember having fights with him about the Suez Canal, which I thought was a wonderful thing that it was being taken over by the Egyptians, and I remember having fights over the fact that, you know, I certainly thought I would go and build a road between Zagreb and Belgrade with the rest of the student body, which, of course, he thought that I was out of my mind, and I’m not going anywhere.</span> <span id="s1025">Those kinds of things, but he was, you know, he was obviously in favor of the new regime, but then the regime turned out not to be exactly what we hoped it’d be.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: Now, what did it mean to be a victim -</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: Of fascism.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: It meant that you had been on the, basically, on the side on which you were deprived of liberty or limb or whatever, just exactly what happened to me.</span> <span id="s1030">I was a victim of fascism, so was he, because he was in a concentration camp, and when I wanted to go to Switzerland to visit my relatives and I applied for the visa, I was given the visa as a victim of fascism because I had suffered, therefore I could be trusted.</span> <span id="s1031">I was not on the wrong side, and therefore could be trusted to be given this visa, which was, at that time, no one went.</span> <span id="s1032">When I came back from Switzerland, I went through every class in my high school telling people what it was like.</span> <span id="s1033">I didn’t know – nobody knew anybody who had been abroad.</span> <span id="s1034">Of course, I didn’t tell them about the Jewish parts of it.</span> <span id="s1035">That was for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: We have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">End of Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Tape #5</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: When you came back, after visiting Switzerland, and you’re talking to everybody about what it was like, but you don’t talk about being Jewish.</span> <span id="s1040">Do you then talk to your uncle and say, “I want to pursue this”?</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: You talk to nobody?</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: So, this is all in your head?</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: It’s all in my head.</span> <span id="s1046">I don’t know – I don’t know what I’m going to do with that.</span> <span id="s1047">It doesn’t really have that much meaning.</span> <span id="s1048">I mean, it’s something I learned.</span> <span id="s1049">I learned something what that was like, being Jewish, but I don’t feel like I want to do one thing or another.</span> <span id="s1050">It took, you know, I don’t think that at that point I was considering religion one way or another.</span> <span id="s1051">It was just sort of a new knowledge, but I didn’t think anybody was interested in that part.</span> <span id="s1052">I mean, no one was interested in any religion anyway.</span> <span id="s1053">I don’t think my uncle asked me, I mean, he asked me anything about that.</span> <span id="s1054">I mean, he knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: He knew they were Orthodox?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: Oh, he knew they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1057">I don’t think he knew what it meant to be Orthodox.</span> <span id="s1058">I don’t think – I mean, he knew my grand – obviously he knew my grandparents, and you know, they were sort of like my grandparents.</span> <span id="s1059">They weren’t – anyway, there aren’t Orthodox.</span> <span id="s1060">Well, there was Orthodox by American – in an American sense.</span> <span id="s1061">They are not orthodox in when you think now of like the Heredi in Israel or something like that.</span> <span id="s1062">I mean, they, at that time, mother’s now wearing something on her head, but at that time, she wasn’t.</span> <span id="s1063">But, they really were observant.</span> <span id="s1064">The men always wore something on their head.</span> <span id="s1065">They followed all the laws of Kashrut.</span> <span id="s1066">The Shabbat, you didn’t do anything except go to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s1067">And, they lived in a small Orthodox community in Montreux, and basically there were no other kinds of Jews.</span> <span id="s1068">I, at that time, I didn’t even know of the possibility of other kinds of Jews.</span> <span id="s1069">It was all so sudden, and so out of nowhere with no background to speak of.</span> <span id="s1070">And I was there a month.</span> <span id="s1071">So, it’s – it was sort of -</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: Now, did he talk about his brother to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: Yeah, they talked a lot about – they were – to this day, they were very much imbued with everything that happened during the war before the war, talk about the family, talk about what happened to them during the war, after the war.</span> <span id="s1074">They were still recovering from – even though to me, it looked like they were living in this fairy land, their life really wasn’t easy at all.</span> <span id="s1075">But, I only – at the age of 16, it’s just so much, you know.</span> <span id="s1076">I mean, I was more impressed with things like, you know, you go to a supermarket and the doors open by themselves.</span> <span id="s1077">I mean, you know, that was very important.</span> <span id="s1078">And all the food, I mean, in the supermarkets.</span> <span id="s1079">And so this was still ’54 in Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s1080">I mean, you know, we had still very little.</span> <span id="s1081">We had just emerged, sort of, from really, not having anything in the stores, and you know, we had emerged from the time that we were getting UNRRA packages, you know, and with crazy foods from America, and my memory of that is all of the foods that we couldn’t eat like – that we didn’t like, like canned orange juice, and there were some clothes that we got, and I got a sweater from school, because there was piles of things, and I brought home this sweater, and my uncle made me take it back, because we weren’t as poor as other people who could have this sweater.</span> <span id="s1082">And I’m to consider other people.</span> <span id="s1083">I was taught well to be compassionate and to understand who we were, and who I was.</span> <span id="s1084">So, you know, all of that and then all of a sudden coming to Switzerland and seeing a lot of things in the stores, and beautifully arranged shops with jewelry and people well-dressed walking by Lake Geneva.</span> <span id="s1085">All of that mixed in with this little thing of Jewishness, it was just too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: It’s interesting, of course, that they were in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1087">If you’d been in other European countries, you’d have seen much more devastation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: So, you saw nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: I saw nothing.</span> <span id="s1091">It was all perfect, you know, perfect land.</span> <span id="s1092">Of course, there were extremely nice to me and, you know, took me and my aunt tells the story, I think she told it on tape, that she remembers very well that I – she remembers it better than I do, that at one point, we were doing something and there was a little discussion in the family about what to do, and I put my two cents in and I said something.</span> <span id="s1093">I said, “Oh, I don’t want to get into it, after all I’m not family.”</span> <span id="s1094">And they said, “Yes, you are.</span> <span id="s1095">You’re a member of the family.”</span> <span id="s1096">And I cried.</span> <span id="s1097">So, there were so many different emotions, and so much new to see and learn and do.</span> <span id="s1098">It, you know, and I knew that they were concerned about – they were concerned about my not knowing any other Jews and not knowing what Jewish meant, and being happy that I’m with someone who really cared about me.</span> <span id="s1099">They understood that, but at the same time, they were, you know, I was 16, and I think they were mostly worrying about who am I going to marry, you know, and how is this going to go on, and I’m going to be lost to the family forever, and that kind of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: Dora, did you somehow feel closer to them, I don’t know, closer to them than to your uncle, but the fact that they were blood, did this make an impression on you that was surprising?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: Yeah, in a way, in a way.</span> <span id="s1102">I understand what you’re saying.</span> <span id="s1103">It’s not that I feel closer to them than to my uncle, but the fact that I felt close to them was interesting to me.</span> <span id="s1104">It’s not that that’s a comparison, but almost total strangers, and I remember that my uncle came to get me, Uncle Jozi, came to get me at the border.</span> <span id="s1105">I was on the Orient Express and just coming through Simplon, and I was obviously nervous all by myself traveling, and he said he would come and meet me at the border in Brigg, and I’m looking out the window, and I’m thinking, “How am I going to recognize him?”</span> <span id="s1106">I had a picture; they sent me one.</span> <span id="s1107">I had a picture, but how am I going to recognize him, and it was such a feeling when I saw him.</span> <span id="s1108">I knew it – first of all, I knew that that was him, and I that was a really, very special feeling of some overwhelming emotional connection.</span> <span id="s1109">And, of course, after, you know, later on when I went to live with them for a year, and studied in Switzerland, I realized they were really very good people, and they did – they did a lot to enable me to be there.</span> <span id="s1110">And, of course, Stricek did, too, because it costs money for me to go.</span> <span id="s1111">My relatives in Switzerland didn’t have any, and I didn’t even realize that.</span> <span id="s1112">We all thought, you know, just like people who would think money grows on trees in America, well, you know, we all thought, “There’s lots of money in Switzerland.”</span> <span id="s1113">Well, of course, they had very little.</span> <span id="s1114">They had come from a concentration camp and they had nothing, and I lived better in many ways where I was.</span> <span id="s1115">I was able to bring my aunt, as a present, a gold bracelet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: Yes, because Stricek felt that we had to pay for whatever what I got.</span> <span id="s1118">So, I got a ticket bought and I had the bracelet to give her, and had some toys for the kids.</span> <span id="s1119">Toys were hard to get.</span> <span id="s1120">I had some kind of a rubber toy that I had bought, because that you couldn’t get in Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s1121">I had one of the gold bracelets, she still has it, that I brought her.</span> <span id="s1122">And, you know, so, it was – it was a very kind of a strange experience in so many ways.</span> <span id="s1123">I lost my thread.</span> <span id="s1124">Where was I?</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: Let me ask you, was your uncle jealous?</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: My uncle in Croatia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: It’s interesting.</span> <span id="s1129">He was – he was, I mean, he was really a saint in so many ways, but you know, he had – he had – he could not have sent me.</span> <span id="s1130">He could’ve squashed that whole relationship.</span> <span id="s1131">On the contrary, he did send me, plus he sent me another time, you know, to go and study there for a year.</span> <span id="s1132">And, then I happened to meet my husband on the way, at that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: That was the second trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: The second trip, right, and then I wasn’t coming back.</span> <span id="s1135">I was getting married and going to America, and through all that, I mean, I have a letter which he wrote in which I wrote to him that I met my husband, this person that I want to marry, and he, in his letter, said, “If Jozi and Magda think that that’s okay, then it’s okay with me.”</span> <span id="s1136">And that was very generous on his part.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: Was this your first boyfriend?</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: No, I had other boyfriends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: You had other boyfriends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: But, they aren’t important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: None of them mattered to you in the same way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: No.</span> <span id="s1143">I mean, yeah, they were boyfriends, you know, they were boyfriends, but, you know, I was young.</span> <span id="s1144">I was 19 when I met my husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: Yeah, I understand that.</span> <span id="s1146">So, when did you start having boyfriends?</span> <span id="s1147">As an early teenager?</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: Yeah, as an early teenager, all forbidden, all forbidden, constantly fighting with my uncle.</span> <span id="s1149">That’s what I mean when I said, you know, when he was strict, that’s because he’s so old, and he doesn’t understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">Q: It’s interesting given his relationship with Giza, which was also forbidden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: In a certain way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: Yes, well this was sort of has to do with morays of the place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: I see, and you’re a girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: And I’m a girl.</span> <span id="s1156">I have to be protected, you know, what’s going to happen to me.</span> <span id="s1157">You don’t want to marry – and the business that I was going to marry this person, and it was extremely important, and he said it in the letter, and I just recently read another letter where he mentions it after the children were born, that I had promised that I would finish school, because here I was finishing my sophomore year in college and getting married, you know.</span> <span id="s1158">That was not good.</span> <span id="s1159">I was to finish university.</span> <span id="s1160">I was to be – have a profession.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: So you could take care of yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: Yes, so that was the only issue – that was the issue, but I promised, I promised solemnly that I would finish school, that I would go back to school, and when I came to the States, I thought, oh, God, starting all over again.</span> <span id="s1163">I started university in Zagreb, first I had a year.</span> <span id="s1164">Then, I started in Switzerland, and I had a hard time because I was having to study in French and I had studied English and German before and Russian but very little French.</span> <span id="s1165">I learned French, and I came here, and I thought, “Goodness, now what?”</span> <span id="s1166">And, so I got pregnant instead.</span> <span id="s1167">So, I had my daughter, and that was nice because I was sometimes feeling lonely.</span> <span id="s1168">I mean, then, my husband was a super-wonderful person, the very best, but I went from one wonderful person who took care of me, to my aunt and uncle in Switzerland, to Dan, who could’ve been – who was everything that my uncle had been, just really nurturing and he was nine years older than I and had had his PhD and he was marrying this sophomore who doesn’t know from beans and coming to this new country.</span> <span id="s1169">So, it was quite an experience to me.</span> <span id="s1170">And so, sometimes – and there was nobody else here – so sometimes I was lonely.</span> <span id="s1171">It was good to have my daughter.</span> <span id="s1172">Then, when, Elliott, my son, was born a year and a half later, when he started going to school, I did go back to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">A: Yes, I did go back to school, and I did finish, and I had a long teaching career.</span> <span id="s1175">So, I did accomplish that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: And, when you left Switzerland to come to the United States, how long was it before you saw Uncle Ludva again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: It was, let me think when I was born in – I think it was something like six years.</span> <span id="s1178">I could not go back earlier because, even if I had had money, because I didn’t – did not want to return without the American citizenship, maybe it was less than that, and I applied for it as soon as I could, which I was three years after I was here.</span> <span id="s1179">So, I had a year in Switzerland, and then I had three years here before I could apply, and then it took them a year to give it to me because I came from a Communist country and we were in the post-McCarthy era and they investigated me to no end, demanding why I hadn’t protested when I had to join the Communist Youth of Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s1180">Can you imagine?</span> <span id="s1181">If I’d protested, I’d be in jail.</span> <span id="s1182">So -</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: You were also a kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: I was also a kid, right.</span> <span id="s1185">So, it took them a year, and as soon as I got it, then I asked for a release from the Yugoslav citizenship, which I got.</span> <span id="s1186">Then, I went back because it was still very, very difficult to leave the country, and then I went to back and went already with the two kids and my husband and it was wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: And is this the first time they’ve met your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: He met my husband, yes.</span> <span id="s1189">He couldn’t come to the wedding.</span> <span id="s1190">I mean, he could have – he could have possibly come.</span> <span id="s1191">He could’ve gotten a visa, et cetera, et cetera.</span> <span id="s1192">It would’ve taken time.</span> <span id="s1193">It took me six months every time to get a visa, but he was really, at that time, feeling his age.</span> <span id="s1194">He was not ever strong particularly, and at that point he was barely leaving the house anymore, and he really felt like he could not leave the house, I mean, go on such a trip.</span> <span id="s1195">And so, he wasn’t at my wedding, which of course, was a pity, but it’s sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: It must have been wonderful for him to see the grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: Yes, yes, yes, that was wonderful.</span> <span id="s1198">We had a super time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: Did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: Yeah, really a good time, and we stayed a few months.</span> <span id="s1201">It was really nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s1203">Fabulous!</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1205">Not Dan, but the kids and I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: So, the kids got a sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A: The kids, yes, and Wanda still has a good sense of it.</span> <span id="s1208">Elliott was a little too young to remember a lot, but Wanda, I think, does remember.</span> <span id="s1209">She was then in kindergarten.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: Now, a lot of people think the Holocaust changed them.</span> <span id="s1211">In a way, I suppose you think you didn’t go through the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">A: Sometimes, yes.</span> <span id="s1213">It took me a long time to understand that I’m a Holocaust survivor.</span> <span id="s1214">I never classified myself as such until very recently, when people told me, “Of course you are a Holocaust survivor.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: And, what does that – does it mean something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: Right now, it does.</span> <span id="s1217">It means – it mean more and more.</span> <span id="s1218">I understand – I’ve met now other people who didn’t go to camp, and, you know, we think of them now as Holocaust survivors.</span> <span id="s1219">I used to think that a Holocaust survivor means someone who has gone through a concentration camp, which I was extremely lucky not to have gone through.</span> <span id="s1220">On the other hand, how do you define Holocaust?</span> <span id="s1221">There was Holocaust all around me.</span> <span id="s1222">I just have happened to have been at the right place at the right time, or all the wrong time I was in the right place not to be swept – swept up with the rest.</span> <span id="s1223">So, I was just super-lucky in every way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: Except for the losses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">A: Except for the losses, people losses.</span> <span id="s1226">The losses, the losses, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: Even though you were little it was -</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A: There’s a sense of loss, and you realize it more after I had children, I became much more aware of the losses.</span> <span id="s1229">And I think at that point, you can put yourself in the other shoes – not what it did to me, but what must it have done to my mother and my father to have your child taken away, to not know what’s going to happen to that child, to be stuck some place and you don’t know where your children are, whether they’re dead or alive, all of that – you become aware of that and internalize it, and think of it in a different way.</span> <span id="s1230">So, that’s, you know, that’s – you can understand what it means to lose a child, and now I can understand what it means to lose a spouse, which is the saddest thing for me right now, still.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Q: Dan died in ’54?</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">A: No, Dan died in ’92.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: Oh, I’m sorry in ’92.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: In ’92, right, and that was a hard loss.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: It still is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">A: Yeah, yeah, and that’s a kind of loss that I think I can understand sometimes people who – I was a child, so, I can see the child-parent relationship and what it would be like for my parents, but then, you know, Stricek mourned Giza forever and ever, and I can understand that very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">Q: Now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">A: Yeah, and he mourned my brother terribly forever.</span> <span id="s1239">So, later on, you realize it, and yeah, I suppose, I now understand it what it means to be a survivor, and it’s not the easiest place either.</span> <span id="s1240">I think I cope well, but that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: You also seem to have enjoyed life in many ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1243">I had a very good life in many ways, have good colleagues, good work – I love my work, I still do.</span> <span id="s1244">I think – I think I’ve had a sort of joie de vivre built in that is not – it’s not easily extinguishable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: Well, thank you so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">A: Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s1247">It’s been very pleasant talking to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: Oh, you, too.</span> <span id="s1249">What we’re going to do is top the tape, and we’ll do the photographs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A: Okay, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: And this photo’s what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">[Photo shown]</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: That’s my parents at their wedding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: Do you know about when they were married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A: ’36, 1936.</span> <span id="s1256">I’m not sure of the date.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">Q: And, who’s this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">A: That’s my parents – Silva and Salamon Basch, and I in Zagreb.</span> <span id="s1259">This is in front of the zoolog-, zoologic- in front of the zoo.</span> <span id="s1260">They called it the zoloski park, zoological park, called Maksimir.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: And about how old are you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: I think I’m two, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">Q: [new photo shown] Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">A: This is my grandparents, my maternal grandparents.</span> <span id="s1265">This is grandma and grandpa, Katarina and Leopold Deutsch on my grandmother’s lap is my mother, Silva.</span> <span id="s1266">Standing next to her is middle daughter Blanka, and next to my grandfather is Giza.</span> <span id="s1267">That’s the three daughters.</span> <span id="s1268">The son is missing, Erne.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q: [new photo shown] This picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">A: This is a picture of my mother, yes, Silva, and my father Salamon Basche and then next to him is my mother’s brother’s wife.</span> <span id="s1271">So, this is Irma Deutsche, and standing in front of my father is her daughter, Edita (ph) Deutsche, and the interesting thing about this picture, it’s taken in Zagreb, that it’s picture is in black and white, but the photographer has seemed to taken it upon himself to hand color the signs that they had to wear that said, “Jew”, and this is what they had to wear during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">Q: [new photo shown] Is that you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">A: Yes, I think it’s me and not my brother.</span> <span id="s1274">I think so.</span> <span id="s1275">This -</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: This is a picture of my father, my mother there in the center -</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: Is that your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: Yes, and my mother has my brother in her lap.</span> <span id="s1280">The rest of the people are people who worked in my father’s workshop where they produced – sort of a small factory where they produced brushes of all sorts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q: [new photo shown] Do you see how much like that picture is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">A: Yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s1283">This is taken in Ludbreg in September of 1941, so, my brother and I are already both at my grandparents’ and uncles’ and aunts’.</span> <span id="s1284">We have left Zagreb.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: And do you know what this is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: This is a baby carriage.</span> <span id="s1287">It must have been for my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: [new photo shown] Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: This is taken in Ludbreg, in the yard in front of the house that Stricek Ludva and Rudi Appler were building together.</span> <span id="s1290">This is the other girls, the two of them to the left.</span> <span id="s1291">Yes, this Zdenka and Vera Appler, my aunt Blanka’s daughters, and the other one is Erne Deutsche’s daughter Edita.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">A: This is Stricek Ludva.</span> <span id="s1294">This is Ludva Vrancic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">Q: [new photo shown] This?</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">A: Both of those pictures – this picture was taken in 1943, I think, at the time when Stricek Ludva was in Jasenovac.</span> <span id="s1297">This is Giza, his wife, Giza Deutsche, formerly Deutsche, and I and my brother, and the picture was taken at the photographers so that it could be sent to Jasenovac to Stricek.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: So, both of these pictures were sent?</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: Yes, both of these pictures were sent, yes.</span> <span id="s1300">The other one is just the two of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: [new photo shown] Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: This is my brother and I in 1943 in Ludbreg, 1944, yeah, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: How old were you here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: I would be six, and my brother’s three years younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">Q: [new photo shown] Who is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A: This is Ljudevit Vrancic, my Stricek Ludva in – on the steps of his house, which was built by his parents, and this is more or less where I saw him when I saw him for the last time, and that’s how I think of him much of the time.</span> <span id="s1307">It was taken probably in the 1970s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: [new photo shown] Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: This is in our house in Ludbreg, and Stricek and I often played the piano and violin together.</span> <span id="s1310">There were people in the house.</span> <span id="s1311">I think you see from the left, somebody’s elbow, and so we were entertaining, playing something together, almost always classical music, and that’s the old piano that belonged to his family on which I learned how to play.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">Q: What kind of piano was it?</span> <span id="s1313">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">A: I don’t remember the brand.</span> <span id="s1315">It was Austrian, though, and Stricek had a violin which he thought was Galliano.</span> <span id="s1316">He was very fond of it, but I do – I did have it looked at it, and it was a fake, but it was a reasonably good violin.</span> <span id="s1317">He used to go and take lessons in Hungary and of course, in Varazdin, and I had my first lessons from one of our housekeepers who was actually a very well-versed lady but lost everything after the war, came to be our housekeeper, Marija Velovir, and she taught me German and piano, but later on I went to music school in Varazdin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: This is my wedding.</span> <span id="s1320">This is Dan, Dan Klayman, and Dora getting married in an Orthodox wedding in the mountains of Switzerland above Montreux and Chateau d’Oex.</span> <span id="s1321">We were being married by the Grand Rabbi of Luxembourg, who was a family friend and going to the left – this is Uncle Jozi, and then Auntie Lena, my father’s sister who came from Israel for the wedding, and Leon, my husband’s brother, and his mother Clara.</span> <span id="s1322">This is Aunt Magda, Jozi’s wife, and this is Bernard, Dov, who also came from Israel for my wedding, and this is Dan’s uncle and aunt who came from France.</span> <span id="s1323">They lived in France – his mother’s brother and sister-in-law, and -</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">Q: These two?</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">A: Yes, these two.</span> <span id="s1326">So, that’s Dan’s family.</span> <span id="s1327">And crouching down there is my cousin Donny and my cousin Jakov, Donny, yes, Jakov, and Dan’s cousin Charlie, who came from France, and they other two were, of course, in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1328">That’s Jozi and Magda’s children who now live in Israel and have many children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: [new photo shown] Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: That was 1990.</span> <span id="s1331">And this is Dan and I and that’s one of the last pictures of the two of us before Dan died in 1992.</span> <span id="s1332">It was taken in ’91 at the cousin’s wedding in Vermont.</span> <span id="s1333">It was very lovely there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">End of Tape #5</span></p> <p><span
