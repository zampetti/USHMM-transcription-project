I was in a mostly mixed area.</span> <span id="s41">Another - O had come to Honolulu to have my birth certificate authenticated, and that was early December.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">00:05:00 ITR - Mr. Ryoko, where were you at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">I was in bed at the time.</span> <span id="s44">Someone yelled, "Battleship on fire."</span> <span id="s45">So we all ran out and could see the flames.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">00:05:30 We could see black smoke.</span> <span id="s47">We didn't realize there was a war on.</span> <span id="s48">We thought of maneuvers.</span> <span id="s49">We all ran to the seashore.</span> <span id="s50">But because of the black smoke, it seemed something was the matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">00:06:00 About nine o'clock, the National Guard came and said it was the real thing and we should go up to the heights.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">00:06:30 There was a lot of people watching.</span> <span id="s53">It was the first time we saw a battleship on fire.</span> <span id="s54">We could see the Rising Sun insignia and the heads looking out.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">00:07:00 (Mr K ) I got up LATE THAT MORNING.</span> <span id="s56">There was a lot of traffic.</span> <span id="s57">So, I went out to the road and I saw a policeman I knew and asked him what was going on.</span> <span id="s58">When he told me the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor I couldn't believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">00:07:30 Big army trucks were going back and forth.</span> <span id="s60">I wanted to volunteer for the Home Guard.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">00:08;00 I approached George Bennett who was very active in community affairs.</span> <span id="s62">He said, "Why, they'll shoot you down.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">00:08:30 At that time, there were mainly mainland soldiers on Oahu.</span> <span id="s64">He figures that if I approached one with a rifle, he would take me for a Jap.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">00:09:00 (Mr Obayashi) I was on the mainland, and there were only Japanese going to this school.</span> <span id="s66">When I heard the news, I had a great feeling of being alone.</span> <span id="s67">I thought of my family too.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">00:09:30 I was fortunate that the people around me in the school were very supportive.</span> <span id="s69">I spent the Xmas with a professor and decided to call the draft board and ask to be drafted right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">00:10:00 Soon after Xmas vacation, they drafted me.</span> <span id="s71">I didn't know what was going on back home on Maui.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">00:10:30 I worried about my father, my brother, who was already drafted into the Army.</span> <span id="s73">My father was not an American citizen; I lost my mother when I was young.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">00:11:00 My father WAS AN ALIEN: HE COULDN'T become a citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">ITR: Did any of you have the same fear for parents who were not</span></p> <p><span id="s76">American citizens.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">00:11:30 Yes, with all the excitement, and all the news we had was from the radio.</span> <span id="s78">We felt real lonely, knowing our parents were from</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Japan.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">00:12:00 As far as my parents were concerned, they said that I was American, and I shouldn't worry about Japan.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">00:12:30 It was a lonely feeling.</span> <span id="s82">As far as the bombing of Pearl Harbor, I was on Maui at the time.</span> <span id="s83">But we did have shelling from submarines at night.</span> <span id="s84">We watched that.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">00 13:00 At that time, one of my buddies was Caucasian, the other Japanese.</span> <span id="s86">It didn't affect our relationship while we were going to</span></p> <p><span id="s87">school.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">00:13:30 ITR - How about the feelings of your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Mr. .</span> <span id="s90">We were fishing and when we got back, the guard said to get home and listen to the radio.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">00:14:00 So we did, and found out there was a war on.</span> <span id="s92">We decided we couldn't just sit back.</span> <span id="s93">I felt we had to volunteer or do</span></p> <p><span id="s94">something.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">00:14:30 I couldn't travel from Kavai to Oahu.</span> <span id="s96">I was restricted because I was a welder.</span> <span id="s97">That kind of job was restricted; you needed a special pass.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">00:15:00 I said I wanted to get to Honolulu to work or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">I signed a petition that we Japanese could be drafted and served</span></p> <p><span id="s100">our country overseas.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">00:15:30 About six months later the opportunity came and I talked with my father.</span> <span id="s102">My brother wanted to go too, but he was younger and I said I would go and he could stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">00:16:00 My father wanted me to go too.</span> <span id="s104">(Tears) We wanted to serve our country but felt there was no sense two of us go.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">00:16:30 I found out about a year later that he volunteered too.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">We never met up.</span> <span id="s107">Fortunately he didn't go through the thick of things like I did, and we came out clean.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">00:17:00 My father is not much of a talker - he didn't say much about what it was like for the family.</span> <span id="s109">He managed to get along</span></p> <p><span id="s110">with people.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">00:17:30 It's not much of a story to talk about - they got along.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">00:18:00 ITR: Mr. S was living on the mainland.</span> <span id="s113">We heard about the bombing.</span> <span id="s114">We were just appalled about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">00:18:30 We didn't know how to react.</span> <span id="s116">We had a certain amount of fear.</span> <span id="s117">We were a small minority but large enough to evoke reaction.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">00:19:00 I lived in student housing and the adjacent building were apartments.</span> <span id="s119">In the middle of the night we would get catcalls.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Even prior to that there was a certain amount</span></p> <p><span id="s121">00:19:30 Of anti-Japanese sentiment in the press so we had an uncomfortable time at that point.</span> <span id="s122">But school was to last just a little longer, so we stuck it out.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">00:20:00 In one of the classes there was a very courageous young lady, an instructor, a Caucasian, who spoke up and said we should be treated as Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">00:20:30 Not as the Japanese enemy.</span> <span id="s125">I thought that was courageous I have always been thankful.</span> <span id="s126">I was embarrassed to be the focus of the class at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">00:21:00 I didn't say anything to her and I regret that.</span> <span id="s128">Since I was away from home, I can't give the reaction of the family just</span></p> <p><span id="s129">after Pearl Harbor.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">00:21:30 After the semester, I went home to be with the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">In February, the order for the evacuation of Japanese from the west</span></p> <p><span id="s132">coast was issued.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">00:22:00 We weren't evacuated until May because they had to allow time for the camps to be built.</span> <span id="s134">I grew up in a farm area about 30 miles south of Seattle.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">00:22:30 Time was allowed for the construction of the assembly centers.</span> <span id="s136">In my area, the exhibition center was converted to the</span></p> <p><span id="s137">area.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">00:23:00 In the parking lots they built barracks which were divided into rooms which were assigned one to 1 family.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">00:23:30 Army coats and blankets were about all they gave us.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Those in the cities were loaded onto buses and taken to the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">But we were more scattered.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">00:24:00 When the time came we loaded up our one or two suitcases that we were allowed, and we drove ourselves to the camp in our farm truck.</span> <span id="s143">I don't know what happened to the truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">00:24:30 We had to inventory our crops and things for the people who might take over.</span> <span id="s145">As I recall, after the order was issued, nothing much happened for a number of weeks, until the government</span></p> <p><span id="s146">was organized.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">00:25:00 So we had two weeks to a month.</span> <span id="s148">Whereas in the city, I understand they actually had little time.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">ITR: How did you feel about the evacuation from your family farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">00:25:30 Resentment.</span> <span id="s151">But by that time, the West Coast community had agreed to comply.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">00:26:00 So we went along without creating too much of a disturbance.</span> <span id="s153">A few brave souls took the matter to court.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">00:26:30 ITR: Do you remember talking with your parents about what</span></p> <p><span id="s155">you should do?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: At that stage, especially in rural areas, we didn't get into any discussion about volunteering.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">00:27:00 We complied, thinking more of staying with the family units.</span> <span id="s158">Things could have gotten ugly; fortunately, they didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">00:27:30 In certain pockets, a certain amount of ugliness was present and you couldn't tell when it might flare up.</span> <span id="s160">So it seemed best to stay with the family unit and see what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">00:28:00 ITR - The evacuation experience was something we didn't have to deal with on Oahi or the outer islands.</span> <span id="s162">But we have heard of Buddhist ministers who were picked up.</span> <span id="s163">Anyone care to talk</span></p> <p><span id="s164">about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">00:28:30 We knew a Japanese school teacher who lived across from my home.</span> <span id="s166">And a priest.</span> <span id="s167">I asked where they were and was told they had been called in by the FBI.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">00:29:00 My father-in-law was picked up - That was because he was active in community affairs on Maui.</span> <span id="s169">He was set, I think to Santa Fe as an alien.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">00:29:30 Eventually he was released and went to a cousin in Spokane and stayed there until the end of the war.</span> <span id="s171">My mother- in-law ran a drug store.</span> <span id="s172">Two of her children were at school on the mainland, the other two were at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">00:30:00 She kept the drug store open.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">00:30:30 It was a tough time and they had to do what they could.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">I think they had some communication.</span> <span id="s176">And my wife and her sister visited him in Spokane.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">00:31:00 We didn't talk too much about that situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">ITR - Anyone else?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">00:31:30 My Japanese school principal was another one who was pulled in.</span> <span id="s180">In his family there were many boys, and they served in</span></p> <p><span id="s181">the military.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">00:32:00 But in spite of everything, they did what they thought they had to do.</span> <span id="s183">Didn't talk to any family members about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">00:32:30 I didn't talk to my family until after I volunteered.</span> <span id="s185">All we did was shake hands.</span> <span id="s186">We didn't say a word.</span> <span id="s187">But everything was there in his eyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">00:33:00 I volunteered first then went home to tell them.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: ITR - Anyone else?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">00:33:30 Those who were interned immediately were often leasers of the community -,school teachers, priests.</span> <span id="s191">I think it was ironic because prior to the war and ever during the war</span></p> <p><span id="s192">00:34:00 Teachers and schools were the subject of abuse, but it was only through their efforts that there existed a pool of somewhat trained, loyal Japanese Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">00:34:30 Who could be put into the intelligence services for the Asian and European theaters, and is known now, these linguists came to be known as "the secret weapon."</span></p> <p><span id="s194">00:35:00 In spite of all the abuse they got, it seems to me these schools should get recognition for their contribution to the war</span></p> <p><span id="s195">effort.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Mr. Kuba: It was pretty long after Pearl Harbor that we found out</span></p> <p><span id="s197">about the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">00:35:30 Our school teacher was picked up by the FBI.</span> <span id="s199">He was also the teacher of judo, and any broken bones, he mended.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">00:36:00 We owed a lot to him.</span> <span id="s201">Yes, we knew about it at the time he was picked up.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">00:36:30 The news went around pretty fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: ITR - What was the reaction of the community?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">00:37:00 I don't know because we never had a chance to get together.</span> <span id="s205">After the war, we couldn't get together, like before.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">00:37:30 I think aliens were barred from getting together.</span> <span id="s207">You don't know.</span> <span id="s208">I remember there was one time we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">00:38:00 Gov. Burns (PH) he was from Kailva, and he got us together.</span> <span id="s210">I don't remember what he talked about, by I remember one question that he asked me</span></p> <p><span id="s211">00:38:30 He asked me why I was going to volunteer.</span> <span id="s212">I said to prove our loyalty and to protect democracy.</span> <span id="s213">But at the same time, I wanted to see what the mainland was like.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">00:39:00 ITR: Some of you may hot have heard each other's stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Now want to get into more individual experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">00:39:30 Susan: When I was growing up my parents and grand PARENTS USED TO TALK ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES.</span> <span id="s217">They were on a plantation on the big island, and they used to tell stories about neighbor turning against neighbor.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">00:40:00 Non-oriental used to listen under the floor to hear if Japanese was being spoken and turn people in to the authorities.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Also, about the military people, according to my grandmother, they used to force them to dig up their patches to see if anything was buried there, and they confiscated all their kimonos with</span></p> <p><span id="s220">family crests.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">00:40:30 No one was allowed to carry more than four dollars or the money was taken away.</span> <span id="s222">I was wondering if any of you heard similar</span></p> <p><span id="s223">stories?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">00:41:00 Either during the war, or after you came back.</span> <span id="s225">I never asked them what happened when I got back.</span> <span id="s226">We just were happy to be back and wanted to forget what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">00:41:30 When others came in, we just clammed shut.</span> <span id="s228">Among the veterans, it was different.</span> <span id="s229">Even my wife was not aware that such</span></p> <p><span id="s230">things were happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">00:42:00 Susan: So basically, no one spoke to their parents about what happened to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">(Another) Long after we did.</span> <span id="s233">I found out that some works of art they had were confiscated.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">00:42:30 I could swear I saw some of the things in some ____(ph) years later.</span> <span id="s235">But apparently all homes were visited to confiscate</span></p> <p><span id="s236">things considered contraband.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">00:43:00 (Another) Yes, I remember, they came to my house, they took an old rifle, a classic, IF WE STILL HAD IT.</span> <span id="s238">It was used to shoot birds.</span> <span id="s239">It was old - you pumped the powder in.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">00:43:30 Used it to scare the rice birds.</span> <span id="s241">They tried to pull my dad IN, BUT HE HAD A stroke.</span> <span id="s242">He was completely paralyzed.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">00:44:00 They searched the house, took the rifle, we never got it</span></p> <p><span id="s244">back.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">ITR: Did anyone ever ask for things to be returned?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">00:44:30 (Another) They took my phonograph radio, and it never</span></p> <p><span id="s247">came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">ITR: Who came in and did these things?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">00:45:00 (Another) I don't know.</span> <span id="s250">Federal people.</span> <span id="s251">The FBI maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">They never told me who came.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">(Another) Most things were probably put in storage and taken by</span></p> <p><span id="s254">staff people.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">00:45:30 (Another) We had a 15 foot boat in dry-dock and we never saw it again.</span> <span id="s256">Somebody used it.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">00:46:00 During the war.</span> <span id="s258">you wouldn't make a claim because they would consider you a spy.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Susan and another exchange information - where did you live.</span> <span id="s260">She says her grandparents were interned several times.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">00:46:30 We should have asked our parents while they were still young.</span> <span id="s262">Now they are senile.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">(Another) I think there was an effort by the Japanese community and leadership to get of Japanese things to show their loyalty.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">ITR You're saying that much of this was done voluntarily?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">00:47:00 ITR Mr Naga I understand you learned only recently about your family being removed from the plantation.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: What happened to my family was not as cruel as what happened to ________ family.</span> <span id="s267">Four months AFTER I volunteered, I was in Camp Shelby.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">00:47:30 My school aged brother died and the family was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s269">Another brother was ordered to report to a manager's</span></p> <p><span id="s270">office.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">00:48:00 He was told that since I was not working, but in service they had 30 days to get out of the home.</span> <span id="s272">I didn't know about this until about two years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">00:48:30 ITR: Sounds like lot of other families didn't share these experiences.</span> <span id="s274">Have most of you shared these experiences with</span></p> <p><span id="s275">you own families?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">00:49:00 Its a spur of the moment kind of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Mr. --- I wrote up some notes and showed them to my wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">00:49:30 She said she had never heard of those things and said that we should make copies and send then to our children.</span> <span id="s279">So I have sent of copies to my two children on the mainland, but the one here hasn't seen it yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">00:50:00 ITR: What about you Mr. Nagata, you were a school teacher; what happened?</span> <span id="s281">I talked to my father, being all alone, and with my brother in the 100th infantry battalion.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">00:50:30 I was away at Camp Shelby.</span> <span id="s283">It was tough on him all alone.</span> <span id="s284">He was working on a tug, and because he was an enemy alien, they moved him out of there.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">00:51:00 He became a bartender at the country club, which was a good thing because he had regular hours and didn't have to get up early.</span> <span id="s286">The tubs used to have to go out to meet the steamers, and during the war he would have been busy.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">00:51:30 To me it was a blessing to have him out of the war zone, but it hurt his dignity that he was not a sailor anymore.</span> <span id="s288">He was a lonesome person, that's all I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">00:52:00 ITR: Q: I keep hearing the term, "enemy alien.''</span> <span id="s290">I was wondering how you felt about having your families labelled that</span></p> <p><span id="s291">way.</span> <span id="s292">Mr Shimazu?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: That was a fact and they knew they had no opportunity to</span></p> <p><span id="s294">become American citizens.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">00:52:30 There was nothing they could do but obey the local authorities.</span> <span id="s296">But there's no way of getting away from it - they</span></p> <p><span id="s297">were enemy aliens.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">00:53:00 (Another) My mother became a naturalized citizen long after the war.</span> <span id="s299">I think she suffered the most because my father was an invalid and she carried the burden along with my eldest brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">00:53:30 My two other brothers were in the service also.</span> <span id="s301">Women are very strong.</span> <span id="s302">She died at 94 and was active until the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">00:54:00 She had arthritis but was able to hobble around with a</span></p> <p><span id="s304">cane.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">ITR: Q: I wanted to move to more recent events, this is 1988, of course.</span> <span id="s306">From time to time we see things in the paper which suggest that there still is not recognition that these were people who were</span></p> <p><span id="s307">loyal to Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">00:54:30 What is your reaction when you read that kind of letter and you see that kind of racism?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: I feel a certain amount of disgust at the ignorance of people who are writing in this manner.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">00:55:00 Moving back, I think an important factor that helps build up the racism is that all the immigrants from Europe came with the Statue of Liberty holding up the flame of promise.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">00:55:30 And with full opportunity to become citizens.</span> <span id="s312">But in the case of our parents and all oriental, as I recall, they were shut off from that opportunity and a lot of people don't understand why they didn't become citizens.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">00:56:00 Certainly there was injustice there.</span> <span id="s314">Just recently a fellow raised a question relating to the reparations, as to dual citizenship.</span> <span id="s315">Yes, early on, they were closer to their homeland and they were precluded from becoming citizens.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">00:56:30 Their only hope was to go back to Japan when they made their fortune - the typical dream of immigrants.</span> <span id="s317">I read somewhere that European immigrants, with full citizenship, some 40 percent did, over time, though that figure seems high.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">00:57:00 For people precluded from citizenship, it seems reasonable to me that they would retain their old ties.</span> <span id="s319">This business of dual citizenship, I believe it was just a custom that every newborn would be added to the family register.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">00:57:30 In Japan, that was handled by local government officials and that automatically made them dual citizens.</span> <span id="s321">It wasn't as though anyone made an affirmative statement at some point in time that he was a dual citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">00:58:00 That criticism was unjustified in that it was the result of following old customs.</span> <span id="s323">What was the original question?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">00:58:30 I was wondering about your reaction to the recent raising of racism.</span> <span id="s325">How do you feel when you read of these people whose interpretation of life is very different from how you know it?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">00:59:00 A: There was a recent incident - a 3-star general retired here and he put a letter in the paper - he couldn't see why the Japanese were entitled to reparations when they were given the privilege to wander around wherever</span></p> <p><span id="s327">00:00:00 Repeat of above</span></p> <p><span id="s328">00:01:00 Repeat.</span> <span id="s329">He claimed they wandered around freely, without</span></p> <p><span id="s330">guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">00:01:30 It was in the military press and well-circulated.</span> <span id="s332">When I read that, I just couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s333">That they weren't forced out at the point of a gun.</span> <span id="s334">It's hard to believe, but there are</span></p> <p><span id="s335">people like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">00:02:00 Recently, when the diaries were published, people said they weren't supposed to keep diaries.</span> <span id="s337">But people scribble things, and we had to run them in.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">00:02:30 But there are elements.</span> <span id="s339">Maybe one in a thousand.</span> <span id="s340">But you can't deny these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">ITR: Q What do we do about things like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">00:03:00 (Another) There isn't much you can do.</span> <span id="s343">In any community you'll have these people with some kind of axe to grind.</span> <span id="s344">The extreme is when sone loca, citizens say that the Holocaust never happened.</span> <span id="s345">But we were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">00:03:30 In Germany, they talk that there was no such thing as the</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">ITR: What do you think we can do about something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">00:04:00 Publicity.</span> <span id="s350">As was mentioned, there always will be an element in society, there will be people who point their fingers at others to satisfy their own ego.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">00:04:30 Education.</span> <span id="s352">As far as the preparations, I think they are justified but I don't know what the amount should be.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">00:05:00 I visited two camps when I was in military camp in Arkansas, before I went to the 522nd, their sense of deprivation, where before they were living in their own homes and now they were</span></p> <p><span id="s354">in barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">00:05:30 Gang bathrooms, gang showers, dining rooms, no privacy.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">As far as discrimination, we get mad once in a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">00:06:00 I think that, hopefully these are the oddballs, and the majority doesn't feel that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">(Another) I agree, education might minimize the problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">00:06:30 And TV could help to educate the public, instead of having these rotten movies.</span> <span id="s360">Once in a while, I watch PBS, and they have good movies.</span> <span id="s361">I think the churches can play a role.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">00:07:00 But even among churches, they have this division.</span> <span id="s363">Rely on education to minimize this.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">ITR: Anyone write letters to the editor in response.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: I thought about it but I never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">00:07:30 If we had written diaries, we could have written many things to remember.</span> <span id="s367">When I had a diary, I wrote every day on that ship, and when I read it, it was amazing what I had written.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">00:08:00 ITR: Did everyone get their diaries back?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: (a confusion of responses).</span> <span id="s370">(one person) Well, when Fred called me, he said it was one And he thought it was mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">00:08:30 He asked me my serial number and I told him and he said it was my diary.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">ITR: How did you get the diaries?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">00:09:00 It all started at a Board of Director's meeting, Obayashi was asked what happened with the diaries.</span> <span id="s374">I was delegated to find out and I found they were on the mainland.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">00:09:30 We had to find a way to bring them back.</span> <span id="s376">The diaries were confiscated April 9, after we left Scofield and were brought into B .</span> <span id="s377">That was '43.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">00:10:00 The army confiscated them, and after 40 years or so the National Japanese Historical Society found out that they were in a storehouse near the Presidio.</span> <span id="s379">They found out they were scattered around in the warehouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">00:10:30 He used his influence.</span> <span id="s381">No need to keep it there.</span> <span id="s382">The diary writers were the lawful owners.</span> <span id="s383">So the Customs transferred it to the Japanese American Historical Society.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">00:11:00 It took two years, because they didn't know who to distribute them to.</span> <span id="s385">I called the executive director and he gave us the names and we tracked down the addresses here.</span> <span id="s386">Those who were</span></p> <p><span id="s387">left</span></p> <p><span id="s388">00:11:30 he took back.</span> <span id="s389">Those who were in the mainland, about 30, the rest scattered on various islands.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">00:12:00 From here to the mainland, we were recruits and we scribbled.</span> <span id="s391">The Red Cross and other organizations gave us the</span></p> <p><span id="s392">diaries.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">00:12:30 We could write as long as we weren't overseas.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">00:13:00 Most of them don't remember what they wrote.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">(Another) Yes, when I started reading through</span></p> <p><span id="s396">00:13:30 it brought back memories.</span> <span id="s397">Except one person I wrote about.</span> <span id="s398">I can't remember.</span> <span id="s399">There really wasn't anything in them that I wanted to talk about.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">00:14:00 I think I had written that at Tent City, that is Scoffield, there was a guy who limped, he was about 10 years older than most of us, he was very helpful.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">00:14:30 When I saw him limp, I wondered how he made the Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">This guy with bad asthma, how he made the Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">00:15:00 Other than that, the train ride was pretty exciting.</span> <span id="s404">We rode that train to come to the depot on Oahu.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">00:15:30 It was used by the plantation to haul sugar cane, I</span></p> <p><span id="s406">guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">ITR: Any further response to the matter of the letters to the</span></p> <p><span id="s408">editor?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">00:16:00 Yes, about the reparations, I would like to let them know that people volunteered for military intelligence in the Pacific and that shortened the war by two years and saved thousands of</span></p> <p><span id="s410">casualties.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">00:16:30 These people, many of them volunteered from the concentration camps were their parents were locked up.</span> <span id="s412">Why do they oppose the reparations bill?</span> <span id="s413">Do they believe in upholding the constitution of the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">00:17:00 ITR: Why do you think people are opposing the</span></p> <p><span id="s415">reparations?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">(Another) They think that the people don't deserve that monetary</span></p> <p><span id="s417">thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">00:17:30 Must be those people whoever went into the army or were minorities.</span> <span id="s419">I guess some of the people want to be in the papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">00:18:00 (Another) There's a lot of confusion among those people about the Japanese Americans.</span> <span id="s421">Confusion of the elder generation with the actual Japanese in Japan.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">00:18:30 That's where they seem to go of the track.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Another - Something that was unjustly done, some payment is due - they must uphold the constitution.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">00:19:00 The poor guy thinks, with all the deficit, why should the money go for that.</span> <span id="s425">The Constitution comes first, and money seems the most appropriate way, then the problem is how to finance it.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">00:19:30 It has to be financed one way or another.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">ITR: Many of you went to the Smithsonian and the exhibit concerning the Japanese Americans and the Constitution.</span> <span id="s428">Do you think we are moving towards "the more perfect union?"</span></p> <p><span id="s429">00:20:00 That the things that happened to the Japanese Americans happened under the laws of the land and that perhaps the laws ought to be questioned sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">00:20:30 Sometimes there are laws passed that really are against what the Constitution stands for.</span> <span id="s431">I wondered what your reaction was</span></p> <p><span id="s432">to the exhibit?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">(Another) I think we are going in the right direction.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">00:21:00 It will take time.</span> <span id="s435">The right should be brought forward in order to right the wrong.</span> <span id="s436">If you do another wrong for the wrong, then you're going backwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">00:21:30 Even if its only a penny.</span> <span id="s438">We should all back this bill.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">(Another) I think we are going in the right direction, but slowly because we are not vocal enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">00:22:00 The whites are vocal and now, so are the blacks, and look at the progress they have made.</span> <span id="s441">I think the 3rd, 4th generation are getting more vocal, they'll let their feelings be known.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">00:22:30 ITR : Take a break now.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">00:23:00 ITR: Let's talk about the events that lead up to Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">(Another) The 522nd was detached because they needed our artillery to help cross the Rhine.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">00:23:30 The targets were less and less.</span> <span id="s446">Often the artillery was ahead of the infantry.</span> <span id="s447">All this took us through many towns.</span> <span id="s448">By the end of the war we were almost in Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">00:24:00 But we came to Dachau.</span> <span id="s450">The first thing I saw was these people running around in their prison shirts.</span> <span id="s451">I myself took the time to go into one of the camps, though I don't know which one it</span></p> <p><span id="s452">was.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">00:24:30 I still remember seeing Rev. Martin Neimuller sitting on a couch.</span> <span id="s454">We had to keep moving, but that day we made camp close to</span></p> <p><span id="s455">that camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">00:25:00 We were about a mile away, and our area was filled with these released prisoners.</span> <span id="s457">They were down to skin and bones.</span> <span id="s458">You wonder what kept them up, they were so skinny.</span> <span id="s459">Yet their minds</span></p> <p><span id="s460">were alert.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">00:25:30 After we ate, we couldn't just throw away the leftovers.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">But orders were out not to feed them because they couldn't eat the food.</span> <span id="s463">In due time they would be fed food they could eat.</span> <span id="s464">Being a staff sergeant, I had to carry out the orders.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">00:26:00 I wanted to feed them, but I didn't.</span> <span id="s466">I was getting rid of my leftovers at the slump, and there right across from me were fellows asking why I was throwing all that away.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">00:26:30 That's my recollection of meeting these prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">ITR: Q When,did you become aware of the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: I think we were privileged to see things in the Stars &amp; Stripes from time to time.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">00:27:00 ITR: When you first saw these prisoners walking around, what was your feeling?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: To recall the reaction at that time is very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">00:27:30 It was one of sympathy, knowing about the concentration camps, and seeing the condition they were in, what they must have endured to survive to this day.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">00:28:00 These were the survivors, but hundreds of thousands did</span></p> <p><span id="s474">not survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Mr. Obayashi: I was a private, so all I knew was what I saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">00:28:30 I don't know if we were there first, but later I found out that two other units claimed they were first.</span> <span id="s477">I don't know what camp we passed, but outside of Munich we passed</span></p> <p><span id="s478">00:29:00 this camp, and there is the concrete wall inside the perimeter line and I realized it was a prison.</span> <span id="s479">The gates were open.</span> <span id="s480">I don't know when I was told that the Germans left the doors open when they retreated.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">00:29:30 So I don't actually know when I knew about it.</span> <span id="s482">Also, passing through there, they had a handful of prisoners.</span> <span id="s483">I could see people going in and out and on the ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">00:30:00 They were dying or dead.</span> <span id="s485">There were no troops there.</span> <span id="s486">I recall we were scouting at that time.</span> <span id="s487">We were told to look for the front line but we didn't encounter any allied forces.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">00:30:30 Later I found that other troops had gone there, but I don't know what prison it was.</span> <span id="s489">There were no allied troops there.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">The only thing I saw were the prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">00:31:00 While going through the area I saw two dead horses.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">00:31:30 When we came back, we saw a lot of people around the dead animals and eating them.</span> <span id="s493">That is the scene that I cannot forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">ITR: Did they react to you in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">00:32:00 No.</span> <span id="s496">They were eating.</span> <span id="s497">One person said it was a rib.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">ITR: Were you able to talk to any prisoners at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: No, not at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">00:32:30 We saw a lot of prisoners, hard to tell whether men or women, they wear the same clothing.</span> <span id="s501">I assumed they were all men.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">But in their condition, it's hard to tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">00:33:00 We returned to the bivouac area and that's where we met them, they were walking around there.</span> <span id="s504">They were healthy - they could walk.</span> <span id="s505">Some of the others could barely lift their heads.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">00:33:30 We had some C-rations and others - (lists other personnel</span></p> <p><span id="s507">present).</span></p> <p><span id="s508">00:34:00 We gave out our rations through our mess halls (more info</span></p> <p><span id="s509">on units around).</span></p> <p><span id="s510">00:34:30 When we were cooking our rations and coffee, we fed them anyway.</span> <span id="s511">One person, I remember was an old person, we invited him in, and he ate, and ate and drank coffee.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">00:35:00 He stood aside and we offered food to others.</span> <span id="s513">They accepted the food, very politely.</span> <span id="s514">There was no rush.</span> <span id="s515">It was something to see, knowing that they were starving.</span> <span id="s516">It was something</span></p> <p><span id="s517">to see.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">ITR: Do you think they knew you were Americans?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">00:35:30 Yes.</span> <span id="s520">It was hard to communicate.</span> <span id="s521">As we passed through Germany we picked up a few words, but not to carry on a</span></p> <p><span id="s522">conversation.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">00:36:00 If we had people who could understand the language, we would have asked questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">ITR: What was your feeling about people doing this to other</span></p> <p><span id="s525">people?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">00:36:30 It was really a pitiful sight.</span> <span id="s527">Seeing people, how skinny they were.</span> <span id="s528">It was the first time I saw people like that.</span> <span id="s529">Just skeletons.</span> <span id="s530">You can't tell their age, their sex.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">00:37:00 Seeing people like that, how do you feel?</span> <span id="s532">There are no words to describe that.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">(Another) I was a colonel's radio operator, and as we got into this village with all the prisoners</span></p> <p><span id="s534">00:37:30 On the day to that village, I saw some of the ex- prisoners dead or dying along the road.</span> <span id="s535">Because of the mass of army trucks, we had to slow down, and this fairly young man</span></p> <p><span id="s536">00:38:00 hung on to our jeep.</span> <span id="s537">I could see he was feverish and I asked where he was from.</span> <span id="s538">He didn't understand, so I asked in French, and he said, "Belgique."</span> <span id="s539">I gave him some chocolate and</span></p> <p><span id="s540">rations.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">00:38:30 In poor French and sign language I told him to do down the road to a First Aid station.</span> <span id="s542">That evening, some of us were eating near the mess truck, and we saw these people just standing and watching us eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">00:39:00 I'm not sure when we heard about not feeding them, but its not easy to eat when people are standing there watching and you know they are starving.</span> <span id="s544">Later on, I visited a German house and there was an ex-prisoner there.</span> <span id="s545">He said,</span></p> <p><span id="s546">00:39:30 and this one spoke English, and I remember saying, "Gee, the way the Germans treated you , why don't you go into a German house and ask for food."</span> <span id="s547">He said, "Nicht gut."</span></p> <p><span id="s548">00:40:00 He said that the German people were alright, but the SS "nicht gut."</span> <span id="s549">I was impressed by what he said.</span> <span id="s550">I guess the German</span></p> <p><span id="s551">people, many</span></p> <p><span id="s552">00:40:30 living near the camps, didn't know what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Later I saw German civilians, with three dead bodies in his yard, digging a grave.</span> <span id="s554">I asked him what he was doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">00:41:00 He said, over there, there are four more bodies that I buried.</span> <span id="s556">That's about all I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">ITR: Mr. Kuba</span></p> <p><span id="s558">00:41:30 I remember a time we were eating, and its hard to do when these people are looking at you.</span> <span id="s559">I went to the slump (?)</span> <span id="s560">to get rid of the food, and there was a lady there with a child.</span> <span id="s561">I don't know whether she was a prisoner.</span> <span id="s562">I went to give her the food and the 1st sgt. yelled at me.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">00:42:00 He said not to give them food because we would have an army of prisoners coming down to our place.</span> <span id="s564">There were some people wearing German uniforms.</span> <span id="s565">I don't know whether they were soldiers or just wearing the uniforms for clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">00:42:30 Others in pyjama type clothing with striped jacket.</span> <span id="s567">I should just have given them the food.</span> <span id="s568">I felt very bad.</span> <span id="s569">I think it</span></p> <p><span id="s570">was very cruel</span></p> <p><span id="s571">00:43:00 to get rid of the food right there.</span> <span id="s572">The kitchen could have provided us with a big can away from them.</span> <span id="s573">I couldn't eat; many couldn't.</span> <span id="s574">Also I remember a dead cow which was bloated.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">00:43:30 I don't remember how many minutes later I passed again, and the cow was a skeleton.</span> <span id="s576">The people were just picking the meat</span></p> <p><span id="s577">from the skeleton.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">00:44:00 You asked me in the interview how they were able to get the meat.</span> <span id="s579">I suppose if you are starving, you would do.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">00:44:30 Somebody may have had a knife, but that cow was right down to the bone the second time we passed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">ITR: I wanted to ask why you think it's important to tell this</span></p> <p><span id="s582">story about Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">00:45:00 To prevent it from happening again.</span> <span id="s584">Back in 1934, when we went back to see Dachau, some local Jewish organization had displays there and I think that is a good idea.</span> <span id="s585">I think all these</span></p> <p><span id="s586">relocation camps</span></p> <p><span id="s587">00:45:30 should be preserved, so people can see what was done to other people.</span> <span id="s588">They should be kept as a reminder, and I think what the Jewish committee is doing is a good idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">ITR: Does anyone want to talk about the 1984 trip back?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">00:46:00 And some of your reactions to meeting the survivors</span></p> <p><span id="s591">there.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: That is why this has to be remembered.</span> <span id="s593">I couldn't eat either.</span> <span id="s594">This time, we saw the gas chamber</span></p> <p><span id="s595">00:46:30 You had the gas chamber, the oven, and the mound where people got shot in the back.</span> <span id="s596">The stench was so bad that when I came back I couldn't eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">00:47:00 Things like this have to be brought out.</span> <span id="s598">Hopefully it won't happen again.</span> <span id="s599">People have to know what people went through.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Its hard to believe that there were 30 other camps like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">00:47:30 More so if you count the smaller camps.</span> <span id="s602">The German people would like to forget those things.</span> <span id="s603">But this is history and you can't erase history.</span> <span id="s604">Going back in '84, this was not a trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">00:48:00 Come back to bad memories but we went back to D (?)</span> <span id="s606">which we may have called our home.</span> <span id="s607">We were there six months after the war and we enjoyed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">00:48:30 We came out to refresh our memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">(Another) I would like to mention beside /Dachau there were lots of labor camps in the area.</span> <span id="s610">After the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">00:49:00 At one location where we were stationed we had these Russian laborers in the camp.</span> <span id="s612">They were living in poor conditions, sleeping on straw, lots of insects and we were asked not to fraternize with them, but we did</span></p> <p><span id="s613">00:49:30 talk to a few of them and they seemed to be healthy, other than the fact that they were denied things.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">(Another) These camps were also referred to as Displaced Persons camps.</span> <span id="s615">And I remember once, they had a wedding.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">00:50:00 This was during the occupation.</span> <span id="s617">And they had a custom there, all males, the bridegroom would go around and drink toasts with every person, in vodka.</span> <span id="s618">That was the first time I got drunk.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">00:50:30 Your question, why we should publicize this, I think it is one of those examples of man's inhumanity to man.</span> <span id="s620">Because there are people who said it didn't happen, we have to say it did happen, that we are eyewitnesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">00:51:00 This should be part of the education program for all people, so it should never happen again.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">ITR: I wonder now, looking back, what was very significant for</span></p> <p><span id="s623">you?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">00:51:30 Has that experience at Dachau had any impact on your life?</span> <span id="s625">Some of you have gone to Holocaust survivors' meetings.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: It was military intelligence, and I was concerned.</span> <span id="s627">Nisei history is military intelligence too.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">00:52:00 ITR Do you want to tell a little of what happened when you went to the survivors' meeting in Philadelphia?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: You witness the Holocaust, you cannot forget it.</span> <span id="s630">When the invitation was made to WW II veterans</span></p> <p><span id="s631">00:52:30 I accepted and the Jewish War Veterans of Hawaii helped me a lot.</span> <span id="s632">Unfortunately I was the only Nisei at the convention.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">ITR: What was the reaction to you of the survivors at the</span></p> <p><span id="s634">meeting?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">00:53:00 I was curious to see how the survivors were making out in America today.</span> <span id="s636">How they compared their experience before with that</span></p> <p><span id="s637">in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">ITR: Did they say anything that sticks with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">00:53:30 I wanted to know about their experience when the Americans liberated their camp.</span> <span id="s640">One survivor told me he saw an American tank cross over the fence.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">00:54:00 I've been making some research into this, and there were about 30 camps in the Dachau area.</span> <span id="s642">There are American units that are claiming that they are the only ones that liberated camps and</span></p> <p><span id="s643">that isn't true</span></p> <p><span id="s644">00:54:30 There were many units involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">ITR: How do you feel about your role in liberating the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">00:55:00 Question again?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">ITR: How do you feel about your role as a liberator?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">00:55:30 Its so ironic - one persecuted minority in America, the Nisei soldiers, their parents were thrown into camps.</span> <span id="s649">A lot of these boys were from Hawaii and volunteered and fought in Italy,</span></p> <p><span id="s650">France and Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">00:56:00 This experience in Germany, I see the Nisei boys persecuted in our country, they're aiding another minority.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">ITR: Did that have anything to do with why you are taking part</span></p> <p><span id="s653">in this project?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">00:56:30 Its the main reason.</span> <span id="s655">If we forget, history will be repeated again.</span> <span id="s656">So many of them died in these death camps.</span> <span id="s657">I cannot forget what happened in WWII.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">00:57:00 (Another) I agree that this is something that none of us can forget.</span> <span id="s659">Whenever I see news items, it does bring back memories</span></p> <p><span id="s660">of these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">00:57:30 I hope that things like this will never happen again.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">(Another) I guess when you have a sick Leader Leading a country, he's going to do a lot of sick things.</span> <span id="s663">What Hitler did to the Jews - the rest of the people in the camps just had to follow his</span></p> <p><span id="s664">orders.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">00:58:00 And exterminate them.</span> <span id="s666">I heard one of the doctors say that he thought Hitler was sick in his mind and this is what made all of</span></p> <p><span id="s667">the death camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">ITR: What about us who knew about the death camps</span></p> <p><span id="s669">00:58:30 or the relocation camps, and did nothing?</span> <span id="s670">The</span></p> <p><span id="s671">indifference (Another) I talked to a professor at the University of Hawaii once, he had lived in Europe, and asked him why the Jewish people!</span> <span id="s672">did not leave Germany when all of this happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">00:59:00 He said that these people were born German citizens and for them to pull up roots was a traumatic experience so they would not leave unless they had to.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">00:59:30 By then it was too late.</span> <span id="s675">I understood - they were born in Germany, they grew up there, their culture was Germanic.</span> <span id="s676">It was hard to them to leave but you wonder why they didn't leave when all this terrorism was beginning to build up.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">01:00:00 ITR: Why didn't the Japanese leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: We didn't know about concentration camps.</span> <span id="s679">People didn't come and break our things and throw us into ghettoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">ITR: On the mainland, they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">00:00:00 Repeat of above</span></p> <p><span id="s682">00:00:30 And we really did nothing to stop that.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">00:01:00 ITR Why that we don't do anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: Because we're riding a wave.</span> <span id="s685">Everybody is abiding by the law.</span> <span id="s686">Well, you have a few who don't.</span> <span id="s687">But it is following the law.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">00:01:30 ITR: So, a lot of it is going along with the law, and probably it was the same thing in Germany, as Mr.Nogato was saying.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Its hard to believe when you're at the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">00:02:00 When Hitler was going - we're going too,get the Jews, its like a wave going from town to town.</span> <span id="s691">Everybody wants to belong.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Germany is going to be the supreme race.</span> <span id="s693">They have the upper hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">00:02:30 You're not going to buck the trend.</span> <span id="s695">The Jews were the scapegoats.</span> <span id="s696">They were - well, we're one of them too.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">ITR: Do you think the relocation camps can come again here?</span></p> <p><span id="s698">00:03:00 Even worse, the death camps, the annihilation of a people?</span> <span id="s699">The chances are less now, knowing what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">ITR: I just have one thing I want to read to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">00:03:30 (She quotes) Neo Nazis are now producing anti-semitic computer games.</span> <span id="s702">(She continues to quote)</span></p> <p><span id="s703">00:04:00 (Someone) We have the Nazi party in this country too.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">And we have the Klu Klux Klan.</span> <span id="s705">I think there will always be people like that.</span> <span id="s706">Its up to the majority to take action to keep them from</span></p> <p><span id="s707">controlling.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">00:04:30 (Another) With regard to people not having taken any action at all, its not totally true.</span> <span id="s709">There were groups that were supportive.</span> <span id="s710">I don't agree with some of the activist stances the ACLU has taken in recent years,</span></p> <p><span id="s711">00:05:00 but I recall they were one of the groups that were helpful.</span> <span id="s712">And I thank them.</span> <span id="s713">The Quakers were another.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">ITR And even in Germany there were upright citizens.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">(Another) Even in Hawaii there were people who helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">00:05:30 If it weren't for those good people, we were able to help</span></p> <p><span id="s717">the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">ITR: Any other comments.</span> <span id="s719">Well, thank you very much.</span> <span id="s720">If down the road you think you want to say something more, let us know.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">.</span> <span id="s722">END.</span></p></body></html>
