4, 1998 Beginning Tape One, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Question: Just make sure we’re recording here.</span> <span id="s13">Why don’t you just say a few words and -- say your name.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Answer: A few simple words?</span> <span id="s15">Leo Bretholz is my name and recording Holocaust stories is my game.</span> <span id="s16">Although, I like to stay away from it, base -- I never bring up the subject when we sit.</span> <span id="s17">It’s not -- I’m not a -- a dweller on -- on the -- on the events.</span> <span id="s18">I don’t exult in the word survivor, because that, to me, is almost like a -- become an object of -- of curiosity.</span> <span id="s19">Those who are no longer here, they are the real people that should be paid attention to.</span> <span id="s20">Because if we don’t remember them, you know, we’ll kill them all over again.</span> <span id="s21">But the word survivor to me connotes something that’s always a -- a special group and you know, when I speak to people and then they say, “Do you have a number?”</span> <span id="s22">I say, “No, I don’t have a number, because if I were -- had been in a position to get a number, chances are 99 or 999 out of 1000 that I wouldn’t be speaking to you here.</span> <span id="s23">So once I don’t have the number, I am no longer that object of curiosity and I’m losing some -- I’m lo-losing some credibility, you know.</span> <span id="s24">They want to hear that oh, you’re in Auschw -- well, if you’re in Auschwitz, you’re not here to tell the story.</span> <span id="s25">Some of them are, but the majority of them are not.</span> <span id="s26">It’s enough that I escaped from a train and even that was -- in that train out of -- out of 1000, only seven -- out of 1000, 773 were gassed on arrival.</span> <span id="s27">So, even that is sort of a -- a -- a percentage to -- to -- to be -- to be taken into consideration, you know, so anyway.</span> <span id="s28">Now I said more than what you wanted me to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: Let me make sure I’m getting all this on tape.</span> <span id="s30">I want to begin with talking about the events, maybe the weeks or days leading up to the end of the war and where you were and what you were doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Well, the end of the -- the days of the end of the war, after I had lived through the liberation in France.</span> <span id="s32">Paris was liberated on the 25th of August, 1944.</span> <span id="s33">And then the war ended in ‘45.</span> <span id="s34">I was still in France and originally I had papers to come to the United States in 1941, but that was negated by the fact that there was Pearl Harbor and the Americans [indecipherable] entered the war.</span> <span id="s35">So, the papers that I had then, which was the affidavit of support, which we got from our relatives here, that expired.</span> <span id="s36">And of course after that, I went through all my adventures to deportation and the escape and the jail and everything.</span> <span id="s37">But in ‘45, at the end of the war, I was in France and was awaiting the documents that my aunt, who lived in Baltimore sent me, which is an affidavit of support, at the end of 1946, I received my visa of entry into the United States.</span> <span id="s38">And in January of 1947, the 19th of January 1947, I went to LeHavre in France and took the John Erikkson to the United State, a 10 days crossing.</span> <span id="s39">And I arrived in New York on the 29th of January, 1947, which is now a little over 51 years.</span> <span id="s40">To some people, a lifetime, to me it flew by just like this and it’s hardly to be believed, that’s 51 years have gone by, yes.</span> <span id="s41">So I was in France at the end of the -- of -- of the war and came to the United States there.</span> <span id="s42">At that point, I didn’t know yet what had happened to my family, although the -- the indications were quite ominous that a tragedy had happened, because we knew already what had happened on the camps and I knew that my mother -- hadn’t heard since ‘42.</span> <span id="s43">So that was, to me, an indication.</span> <span id="s44">So I came to United States, I -- I was then s-still ignorant of the fact what happened to my mother and sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: I’d like to ask you about that in -- in a little bit, but do you recall -- I think I re-recall reading something about liberation day and you were in a town in France where they were -- German soldiers were being led through town?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Yeah, that’s in the book, also.</span> <span id="s47">That is in my book, the book will come out at the end of this year -- towards the end of the year now.</span> <span id="s48">Probably November of 1998 and the book will be called, “Leap into Darkness - Seven Years on the Run in Wartime Europe”.</span> <span id="s49">It’s co-written by my good friend Michael Oleska, the -- actually, he was the -- he motivated me to write it and then he was editing it f-for me and we did mutual project, was -- it went very well.</span> <span id="s50">Taught me a lot and gave me an opportunity.</span> <span id="s51">But, at the end of the war, in Limoge, I was in Limoge.</span> <span id="s52">That’s where I was when France was liberated.</span> <span id="s53">And the garrison, the German oc -- the German garrison in Limoge was not the same as it had been before June of 1944, because some of them were sent to the war front.</span> <span id="s54">The landing in Normandy took place on the sixth of June.</span> <span id="s55">And on the 10th of June was the burning of the village of Orodure, to which I was a -- almost witness, because I was on my way there and got off the train when I saw a German transport going there and I didn’t want to go into the same direction.</span> <span id="s56">That village was burned to the ground and all it’s inhabitants, except a few, burned with the village.</span> <span id="s57">And I was just about maybe 10 - 15 miles away from them.</span> <span id="s58">Everyone that had a ticket for Orodure, to get off, which I had -- was taken into station, was part of that massacre.</span> <span id="s59">So there again, I was lucky in a great, great way.</span> <span id="s60">You see, my escape is not so much survival and -- and that’s why I say I don’t exult in it.</span> <span id="s61">It’s a -- it’s a question of -- of fear and luck.</span> <span id="s62">The fear is the motivater and then you got to be lucky for -- for it to succeed or to -- to get away.</span> <span id="s63">So, that was just -- before the liberation, after the liberation, we had these -- the remnant of the German garrison in -- in -- in Limoge.</span> <span id="s64">They were taken down the main street, down towards the station by a ragtag outfit of the resistance, whom the Germans considered dispensable, just a few weeks earlier.</span> <span id="s65">And here, this ragtag outfit that didn’t have matching shoes, had the nerve.</span> <span id="s66">Anything to -- to -- to -- to hold on to basically, except their pride and their joy that the -- now, the war -- the end of the war came.</span> <span id="s67">Those Germans acted like little sheep, you know.</span> <span id="s68">Their -- a few weeks earlier they were the masters and at that moment they walked with their hands on top of their heads and looking scared.</span> <span id="s69">Why?</span> <span id="s70">Because they’re human beings.</span> <span id="s71">And some of them were young.</span> <span id="s72">I mean they were in the hands of these underground people and they knew that these undergrounds had a bone to pick with them.</span> <span id="s73">They knew that wh-wh-wh-when we are in their hands, we are not in the hands of -- of a -- of -- of an enemy’s ha -- high command, where they have to deal with -- with protocol and war amenities.</span> <span id="s74">The amenities of exchanging and of fairness, imprisonment.</span> <span id="s75">These -- these underground, th-the -- the resistance, they were bent on -- on vengeance.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: And you are -- were a member of this ragtag [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: I -- I was -- I was not -- I -- I was a member of the -- of the Sixth.</span> <span id="s78">The -- the Sixth was a group that was engaged in clandestine performances, like doing false identification cards and -- and documents.</span> <span id="s79">We did that already, before the liberation.</span> <span id="s80">But, we were all under a -- taking orders.</span> <span id="s81">Some were connected with the FTPF, they were called.</span> <span id="s82">In French it’s Front Tereur Partisain Francais.</span> <span id="s83">Front tereur means snipers or guerrillas.</span> <span id="s84">Partisain -- partisans, you know.</span> <span id="s85">They were a tough -- oh, how do you say it?</span> <span id="s86">Rough, rock and tumble outfit.</span> <span id="s87">They didn’t go by -- by orders or by command.</span> <span id="s88">There was another group was called FFI, the Force Francais L’Interiore.</span> <span id="s89">The French Forces of the Interior.</span> <span id="s90">They took orders from DeGaulle in London.</span> <span id="s91">And there was this conflict between the two groups.</span> <span id="s92">The one wanted to go the -- the legal -- the -- the proper way.</span> <span id="s93">The other said, “We’re going to get the enemy whichever way we can.”</span> <span id="s94">So this -- this was the group.</span> <span id="s95">And under -- we were usually under these orders.</span> <span id="s96">But the partisans that arrested the Germans, they were the ones that had come out of the woods carrying their rifles.</span> <span id="s97">Some of the rifles -- most of the rifles were not loaded.</span> <span id="s98">But the rifle looked good and inspired -- if -- if -- if not fear, at least respect.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Do you remember what you were feeling that particular day, after -- after so many years on the run and so much uncertainty?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: Well, it -- it -- it -- it was -- there was elation.</span> <span id="s101">There was jubil -- jubilant attitudes, you know.</span> <span id="s102">In the streets it was festive, carnival-type.</span> <span id="s103">And people were rejoicing that -- that -- to see that the Germans had been defeated because the atrocities -- in fact, I write that in the book, down the street, th-they were -- they were carrying placards, “Remember Orodure”, that’s the town that they burned down, you know.</span> <span id="s104">Euphoria, that’s the word.</span> <span id="s105">Wh --</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s107">You -- you were feeling euphoric, yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s109">The mood was euphoric.</span> <span id="s110">And then with it came a sobering moment, mixed in with that euphoria.</span> <span id="s111">That while the war is finished, there are families somewhere from whom we hadn’t heard.</span> <span id="s112">So, to us this was the beginning of a new chapter of finding out and searching.</span> <span id="s113">And being here dealing with things.</span> <span id="s114">When Paris was liberated, in ‘44 -- in August ‘44, we knew that Germany was not defeated yet.</span> <span id="s115">In fact, that same year, in the -- in the fall, came the Battle of the Bulge.</span> <span id="s116">And in that counter attack by the Germans, they advanced far enough for Paris to feel that there might be another -- a re-occupation.</span> <span id="s117">That never happened.</span> <span id="s118">The allies -- allies prevailed.</span> <span id="s119">But that was that moment.</span> <span id="s120">Germans were still kicking -- alive and kicking.</span> <span id="s121">And when the landing took place in ‘44, during that period, in June of ‘44, the deportations from southern France, from Vichy, France towards Drancy and Auschwitz were still going on.</span> <span id="s122">So even that euphoric moo-mood, about the landings, had to be tempered with -- with the knowledge that people are still being sent away.</span> <span id="s123">But then when -- when -- in 1945, in May of ‘45, the armistice was signed, there was a different attitude.</span> <span id="s124">Now, we knew that the war was ended and we had to deal with the aftermath.</span> <span id="s125">For many of us, that had to do with family, because we had left our families and loved ones and some of it -- some of them left with their families, but in the process of fleeing, of going to France and living on the Vichy, some of those fa-families had been separated.</span> <span id="s126">Young men were hiding out while their parents were deported.</span> <span id="s127">That happened quite often, you saw that in the movies with -- with “Au revoir mes enfants” and you had so many other things and -- and so in Freedman in the wrote -- the wro -- who wrote that book, “When Memory Comes”, he was taken to a convent and his parents were deported and never came back.</span> <span id="s128">And finally he got back to his Judaism, because he -- he was converted by the padres and -- no, bu -- bu -- no, he went to a -- not to a con -- he went to a monastery, I think.</span> <span id="s129">So anyway, we all had to deal with these things and knowing that the war was over was very good, but there was the family’s story and the history of -- and the aspect of -- of dealing with it -- dealing with it from emotional standpoint because we -- we -- it was the great uncertainty, who had survived and who had not survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: And how did you go about beginning to deal with it?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: I tried to start searches.</span> <span id="s132">Red Cross and other venues and did actually not find out until 1962 what had happened.</span> <span id="s133">That was from ‘47 to ‘62, 15 years -- what happened to my mother and sisters, which is also in -- in the book.</span> <span id="s134">And how I dealt at the moment?</span> <span id="s135">At that moment I was -- in 1946, I was 25 years old, I had survived the war.</span> <span id="s136">I had received my papers to come to America.</span> <span id="s137">And frankly I was looking forward to getting away from the continent there.</span> <span id="s138">It had not been too kind to me, to say the least and of course, France, beautiful country.</span> <span id="s139">Countries are always beautiful, it’s what the people do that’s not so good, often, you know.</span> <span id="s140">But France to me was -- was a country that I wanted already to get away from because I had been in jail and I had been deported and I had been beaten up and so on.</span> <span id="s141">I -- I looked forward to coming to America, wh-where I knew I had family and start a new life.</span> <span id="s142">And that’s what I was dealing with.</span> <span id="s143">I did not dwell too much on the fact that I better stay in Europe and try to find my mother and sisters, because I had reached out to Red Cross and other agencies and I never heard anything.</span> <span id="s144">And of course at that time, the communication system had not developed to the point where you knew who had survived, who had not survived.</span> <span id="s145">So I -- I wanted to be just getting away from there and I knew that staying there wouldn’t advance anything from me emotionally, because I’d only be still under the -- the impact of what happened to me.</span> <span id="s146">And I looked forward to make a break.</span> <span id="s147">And that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s148">I came to the United States.</span> <span id="s149">I did not dwell too much on the sentimentality.</span> <span id="s150">[indecipherable] stay here and -- and -- and -- and -- and f -- and fight it to the end, because the continent was no longer for me, you see?</span> <span id="s151">I wanted to get away from it.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: How did you support yourself?</span> <span id="s153">You were a young man and for those two years before you came to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Well, we were all -- the American Joint Distribution Committee, they were in charge, even during the war, with some of the aid that they distributed to us.</span> <span id="s155">And in Limoge I worked for a aid committee, the Corshazod committee -- com-com-Committee d’Assistance Sociale est Secouron a Reconstructione.</span> <span id="s156">A -- a reconstruction of every -- we helped people who came back, who were repatriated or people who came out of hiding.</span> <span id="s157">And to -- to establish themselves with -- with ID cards and rejoining families.</span> <span id="s158">I worked for that committee and -- in Limoge and that committee was also in charge of distributing the Joint Distribution -- the American Joint Distri -- A -- the -- AJDC -- the JDC, American Joint Distribution Committee -- Committee.</span> <span id="s159">They sent funds into Europe and they were the arm that extended into the -- into the Jewish community of friends and other countries in the -- in the area, Belgium and Holland, Luxembourg.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Can you tell me about your --</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: And by the way, on that committee, I got paid for working there.</span> <span id="s162">Nominally, but I didn’t need to go to fancy restaurants, you know or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Tell me about your -- your trip to America in 1947.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: I was in a -- on the Jo -- SS John Erikkson.</span> <span id="s165">I was -- I think about a 37 -- 37,000 ton former liberty ship.</span> <span id="s166">And it was a -- a January voyage.</span> <span id="s167">80 percent of the ship got seasick.</span> <span id="s168">Most of us, while we were seasick, slept on deck, because in the cabins it was too -- the smell wasn’t so good.</span> <span id="s169">There was -- with the disinfectant and so on.</span> <span id="s170">I -- it was a -- a -- a pleasant ship to be on.</span> <span id="s171">It had good food and a piano where one F-Frenchman was playing swing music.</span> <span id="s172">It’s interesting -- was an interesting voyage.</span> <span id="s173">We were seasick and overnight the seasickness stopped, because we got into calm seas when we passed the Gulf Stream.</span> <span id="s174">So on the icicles that were hanging on the -- on the railing started melting and the waves were pretty high, I was one sitting there where this fella that played on the piano, he was a -- quite an artist.</span> <span id="s175">He improvised music and arrangements.</span> <span id="s176">Arrangements of popular tunes, especially American tunes.</span> <span id="s177">And there was a young lady, who was a war bride and she came to America to rejoin her fiancé.</span> <span id="s178">And these two fell in love.</span> <span id="s179">And then we landed in New York, Hoboken or Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s180">Never forget that scene.</span> <span id="s181">We landed in New York, she and that young man walked down the gangplank and her fiancé, the former GI and his folk were standing there with flowers to wait to -- to receive her.</span> <span id="s182">And this young man walked down with her, carrying her suitcase.</span> <span id="s183">And actually big suitcases were taken in by the porters for the customs, but these little handbags carrying something for her.</span> <span id="s184">And we observed that, because we were already aware of that, because that was the talk.</span> <span id="s185">She says, “I don’t know what to tell my fiancé.”</span> <span id="s186">We were friends on that -- on that ship, you know, I have a few pictures that show us together.</span> <span id="s187">And then they walked down to her fiancé and his folks and she says, “I have to tell you that I fell in love on this ship and this is the man.”</span> <span id="s188">I don’t know what the words were that they exchanged there, but this was one of the scenes of that arriving -- arriving in America.</span> <span id="s189">There was one young lady who said she’s going to Eagle Pass, Texas.</span> <span id="s190">A Parisian woman.</span> <span id="s191">Eagle Pass, Texas, that’s at the Mexican border.</span> <span id="s192">I mean, this is an outpost where you -- where the cows walk in the streets and watermelons [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s193">Well, with her I was in correspondence after I came here, for a few weeks or a couple months or so.</span> <span id="s194">And she wrote to me she doesn’t know how to deal with that, but from Paris to Eagle Pass, she never knew that it would be this way.</span> <span id="s195">And then she -- she devised a -- a subterfuge where her mother was writing her a letter from Paris that the grandmother is very ill and is about to die.</span> <span id="s196">So she told her husband, he was her husband already, that she’s going back to Paris, to the funeral of her grandmother.</span> <span id="s197">Later I found out that she wrote to him that she is not coming back to Eagle Pass.</span> <span id="s198">And [indecipherable], these are these spur of the moment situations where people in the war get together, fall in love, don’t know what the future will be and then you transplant somebody from Paris to Eagle Pass, you’re -- you’re crossing a -- you’re going in to -- all together different culture there.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: And -- and what was the future for you?</span> <span id="s200">What -- what were your plans?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: My plans were to be in -- in -- in Baltimore and start working.</span> <span id="s202">To maybe -- you know, earn -- earn my -- my keep.</span> <span id="s203">I had family here.</span> <span id="s204">My aunt, my father’s sister, Aunt Sophie.</span> <span id="s205">And ma -- Aunt Minna and Uncle Sam, whom I had been with in Luxembourg after I escaped from Vienna.</span> <span id="s206">They had come here and my aunt was in the rag business, metal and iron, scrap metal and iron, but I never expected to be in that business and I came in January, lost my Uncle Sam, whom I loved very much.</span> <span id="s207">I came in the 29th of -- of January and in the middle of February he died.</span> <span id="s208">I hadn’t had much chance to even tell him -- we had a chance, but not much chance to communicate about these years that had past, in between, in the interim.</span> <span id="s209">So, but -- end of February -- a month after I came here, I worked for Barnes Clothing, down on Baltimore Street and was my first job and I joined the textile company.</span> <span id="s210">Some people say I should have gone to college and furthered my education.</span> <span id="s211">Which would have been alright if I’d had enough money to pay rent.</span> <span id="s212">At first I stayed with my relatives, then I moved in with a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s213">Rented a -- a room in a place -- a little apartment.</span> <span id="s214">Didn’t want to be a burden to my relatives all the time.</span> <span id="s215">So -- but I worked for a textile firm, starting in 1947 til the early 60’s.</span> <span id="s216">And my goal in America was to -- to live a -- a normal life and -- and to make a living, you know.</span> <span id="s217">That’s not -- no great ambitions or -- or great aspirations other than settle down and -- and quietly.</span> <span id="s218">I was a good salesman, I turned out to be a pretty good salesman and made a good living working for the textile firm and later did other things.</span> <span id="s219">But th -- the first few months in America were also not entirely satisfactory as far as my daily life was concerned.</span> <span id="s220">Number one, the death of my uncle affected me very much.</span> <span id="s221">And the change from France to America is also a culture shock.</span> <span id="s222">Then came the very hard winter in -- in -- in ‘47, was a hard winter, which is fine, but then the very hot summers in Baltimore, which were very oppressive for me, I cannot tolerate the heat too much.</span> <span id="s223">And before you know it, I was into the hay fever problem, which I did not have in -- in Europe.</span> <span id="s224">So the first year in America, I had second thoughts and the correspondence I had with my aunt in Paris and with some of the friends was that there is a possibility I may come back.</span> <span id="s225">In the back of my head, there was also still -- and that I couldn’t help -- the idea of my mother and sisters.</span> <span id="s226">And in America I was far away from it, so the combination of not quite acclimating immediately to the American culture and the climate, plus the fact that I was still laboring with the thoughts of what had happened to my family, because this -- there was this guilt from the moment that I left them, in ‘38, although my mother urged me to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: You still had that guilt?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: That was with me, yes.</span> <span id="s229">So, a combination of not quite acclimating and wanting to be closer to where I might find out the truth.</span> <span id="s230">And still thoughts in me -- I was toying with the idea of perhaps going back, if not -- if not to stay, but at least to try again, because I could have gone back, but I wasn’t -- I wasn’t a citizen then.</span> <span id="s231">So it was a little more difficult for me to -- back and forth, but I had to reassess this whole thing.</span> <span id="s232">And it didn’t take long before I got acquainted with the language fully.</span> <span id="s233">I had some elementary school English knowledge.</span> <span id="s234">And I developed a circle of friends and once I started working, I became more involved in the daily life, acclimated in that respect.</span> <span id="s235">The language started to come easier and then when I started going on the road, I developed more and more of -- of a sense of what America means to me, because I like to travel aspect of meeting people and -- and earning a living, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: This was your sales [indecipherable] for the textile --</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: A salesman for the textile company.</span> <span id="s238">I was -- I became a -- a sales representative for them within about ni -- eight, nine months.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: So you got to see the country and --</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: County ah -- I traveled the rest of Maryland and the Eastern Shore and onto Delaware and the Baltimore - Washington area.</span> <span id="s241">Montgomery county, western Maryland.</span> <span id="s242">Developed a circle of customers, yes.</span> <span id="s243">The firm handed me about a list of about 25 inactive customers.</span> <span id="s244">And when I left the firm in 1961, I left them with 250 to 300 customers.</span> <span id="s245">So that I had built up, you know.</span> <span id="s246">Nor -- I went to Norfolk, Virginia, went to the northern -- northern North Carolina area.</span> <span id="s247">I traveled basically from North Carolina to -- to Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s248">You know, into --d-different days, different directions.</span> <span id="s249">But I became -- I acclimated fast, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Did you travel by car?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: By car, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: What kind of car?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Well, my boss sold me his -- that was 19 f -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: Well, my boss sold me his -- that was 1947 - ‘48 I bought that.</span> <span id="s255">He sold me -- he sold me his ‘46 car, Plymouth four door.</span> <span id="s256">And two years later I had to trade it and two years later I trade it again and two years later I trade it again, because I put on 50 - 60,000 miles a year.</span> <span id="s257">So my first car was a Plymouth, 1946, a gray Plymouth, 1946, a four door.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: What was it that you were selling, what product?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Textiles.</span> <span id="s260">Linens, domestics.</span> <span id="s261">Sheets, pillowcases, blankets, spreads, curtains, diapers, yardgoods, cretonnes, white goods, you know.</span> <span id="s262">The -- the department stores, five and 10 stores they are -- five and dime stores, they’re a little bit out of -- out of -- no longer in existence, these places, you know, they’re all big chains now.</span> <span id="s263">But you know, I had quite a good circle of -- of customers, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: And your -- your English was getting better at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Well, it was getting better, yes.</span> <span id="s266">In the beginning I had a little difficulty and then as I describe in the book, in some of the places on the Eastern Shore, some of the merchants actually mocked me.</span> <span id="s267">I came into a place, the Rising Sun, where I encountered actual animosity.</span> <span id="s268">That used to be a little bit of Ku Klux Klan territory.</span> <span id="s269">So, but I -- I could cope with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: Fact is, I describe it in the book.</span> <span id="s272">The -- on the Eastern Shore, I was sitting in the hotel, adding up my sales that I had made for the day and there were two fellas there, one from Philadelphia and one from Brooklyn, both in the shoe line.</span> <span id="s273">And we started talking and they recognized I had a little -- I spoke with an accent.</span> <span id="s274">“Where you from?”</span> <span id="s275">And, “Yeah, I just came here a year and a half ago, two years ago.”</span> <span id="s276">That was maybe in ‘48 - ‘49.</span> <span id="s277">But I said, “I just started traveling here on the Eastern Shore and I find it a little different from traveling in Baltimore and Washington.”</span> <span id="s278">They say, “How you mean that?”</span> <span id="s279">I say, “Well, the people have sort of a hostile attitude towards me, like they’re mocking me.</span> <span id="s280">When I said, “Towel,” they said, “Towel?</span> <span id="s281">What are you talking about?”</span> <span id="s282">You know, this and that.</span> <span id="s283">I said, “I feel a little bad about it.”</span> <span id="s284">And they wanted make me feel good and one -- both of them said, “Don’t worry about that.</span> <span id="s285">I’m from Brooklyn and he’s from Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s286">They don’t like our accents either.</span> <span id="s287">So we are -- we are in the same boat.”</span> <span id="s288">So it made me feel better.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: How did you learn your trade?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Well, it was af -- I -- I worked about eight or nine months or 10 months inside the -- the office on -- in Baltimore.</span> <span id="s291">Anyway, ha -- in the -- in -- in the s -- in the wholesaler outfit distributorship.</span> <span id="s292">People came in and bought their merchandise and -- and I learned the difference between this type sheet and that type sheet.</span> <span id="s293">They had types, you know, sheets have types.</span> <span id="s294">There are -- there are muslins and percales and that type 128 and type 140 and type 180 and type 200.</span> <span id="s295">That has to do with how many threads there is in a square inch, you know.</span> <span id="s296">And qualities and yard goods and when you apply yourself, you -- you learn the -- the -- the details of the trade and the -- the boss.</span> <span id="s297">He -- he instructed me pretty well from time to time and -- then I said, “Well, be good if I could go outside and become more -- you know, a salesman outside.”</span> <span id="s298">I felt there was more opportunity in that than staying inside and also this way I get to learn the country and -- and get to know the country and -- [indecipherable] so I worked for 13 years for that firm, from ‘47 to ‘60 or ‘61, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: And what was it that was appealing, did you like the independence?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Yeah, it was independence, it was I could make my own schedule, basically.</span> <span id="s301">I -- I decided where I go, what day.</span> <span id="s302">Of -- of course that is in the beginning, later the schedule became more regular.</span> <span id="s303">I knew already which days I go to Washington, which days I go into other areas, because I knew the schedule and the -- the -- the stores, their openings, their closing -- closings and -- and became acquainted with -- with the owners and some of them became not only acquainted, but became friends of mine.</span> <span id="s304">And when I came to Norfolk, had a few customers there that I had to always let them know when I’m coming, because that night, one of them, they invite me to dinner.</span> <span id="s305">Or would take me to his home to visit and be with the family.</span> <span id="s306">And traveled to the Shenendoah Valley, which was a little bit reminiscent of the foothills of -- of Vienna.</span> <span id="s307">I always liked the mountains better than the seashore.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: It’s probably no coincidence that you -- you had been on the run for so long, that you -- that you took a job that allowed you to continue moving, traveling.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: It -- perhaps that was the extension of it, that I had this wunderlust in my -- in my veins.</span> <span id="s310">That is possible.</span> <span id="s311">Well, I was always perhaps a little Gypsy at heart in that respect, because I remember when I was a kid and I was on the railroad station, I would look at the trains as they departed and inhale the odor of that railroad station.</span> <span id="s312">These were the steams of the coal and -- and f -- locomotive furnaces.</span> <span id="s313">I would -- I would feel quite nostalgic, quite nostalgic about th-things like this, yeah.</span> <span id="s314">I always imagined this train goes somewhere and goes into the distance and it’s winding up somewhere.</span> <span id="s315">These tracks begin here and will have to end somewhere.</span> <span id="s316">This was sort of -- a little bit of romanticism there, you know?</span> <span id="s317">So, perhaps you are right, that the -- the -- the desire to travel was in me -- by -- by nature perhaps, by -- by a vicarious thrill I got perhaps from that -- you know, to be going places and seeing new things.</span> <span id="s318">A friend of mine once said that applies to me, I’m -- a friend of mine once said, “You know, I’m nos -- I am homesick for places that I’ve never been to.”</span> <span id="s319">And perhaps that applies to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: You said you made -- you began to make a lot of friends.</span> <span id="s321">Who were your friends in -- in those early years?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: Well, here in the area, yeah, in fact a man is coming this evening, we have dinner with is -- was one of my first good friends in Baltimore.</span> <span id="s323">He’s a retired pharmacist now.</span> <span id="s324">And I was his best man as his -- at his wedding and my wife was a bridesmaid and that’s where Flo and I met.</span> <span id="s325">So this was one a -- family and then we met friends in various organizations I was involved in -- in some -- there was a Zionist group here in Baltimore which I -- in which I made many friends.</span> <span id="s326">We had meetings and -- and then came the establishment of state of Israel in 1948 and we got together for celebrations and that sort of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: Were most of your friends Jewish?</span> <span id="s328">A: The majority, but not exclusively.</span> <span id="s329">Had some friends that I made in my business connections and dealing with customers.</span> <span id="s330">I know Mrs. Twick, a Catholic woman on Linwood Street.</span> <span id="s331">We were the best of friends when we -- when I called on her and -- and exchanging cards.</span> <span id="s332">But in my circle of friends here, my -- my family, friends, they were mostly Jewish, but as I said, not really exclusively.</span> <span id="s333">And this is still the case today.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: And did you experience any -- you talked about the fear, a little bit of fear that you had when you went to the Eastern Shore.</span> <span id="s335">Did you -- did you experience any overt discrimination [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Well, I wouldn’t call it fear on the Eastern Shore, it was uneasiness.</span> <span id="s337">I felt set back or -- or -- or set apart.</span> <span id="s338">I wasn’t part of my surroundings.</span> <span id="s339">No, I did not encounter anti-Semitism, but I encountered situations that I didn’t like.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Such as, my Uncle Sam, before he passed away, worked at a -- at a laundry.</span> <span id="s342">A major laundry, what was the name?</span> <span id="s343">Regal -- Regal Laundry.</span> <span id="s344">And he was in the printing shop there.</span> <span id="s345">They printed their own laundry tickets on stationery and he was in the printing shop.</span> <span id="s346">Uncle Sam once took me -- it was in these few weeks before he passed away -- we were very close.</span> <span id="s347">I came down to meet him there, so we can go to have a bite somewhere, or whatever.</span> <span id="s348">He wanted me to see the place where he works, see how it is in America.</span> <span id="s349">And as I’m waiting for him to come out of his office, or his workplace, it was five o’clock in the afternoon, I needed to go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s350">And before I walked into the bathroom, I saw outside of the bathroom, two sinks -- not in the bathroom, but outside of the bathroom, two little sinks against the wall.</span> <span id="s351">And -- and each sink had a mirror above it.</span> <span id="s352">And above one mirror it said, Negro, colored and the other said white.</span> <span id="s353">So here’s what I did.</span> <span id="s354">This is the mirror, right.</span> <span id="s355">In my naiveté, I stood in front of these mirrors and I did this.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Back and forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Back and forth, I was waving my body back and forth and I tried to see the difference in the mirror.</span> <span id="s358">Why would this be colored and this white?</span> <span id="s359">And I wanted to see how this reflects in the mirror.</span> <span id="s360">At that moment my uncle came out.</span> <span id="s361">And he says, “Leo, what’s this, a new dance you’re doing?”</span> <span id="s362">I said, “No, no, Un-Uncle Sam,” I said, “I’m just wondering about this,” -- first time I’d seen it.</span> <span id="s363">“Oh,” he says.</span> <span id="s364">“Well, let me explain this to you.”</span> <span id="s365">And he went to explain it to me.</span> <span id="s366">To me this was a shock.</span> <span id="s367">I had just gone through this thing with being Jewish and having to wear the yellow star, see?</span> <span id="s368">And we were told we are different.</span> <span id="s369">The Jew, the Nazis say, you can recognize a mile away.</span> <span id="s370">The way he acts, the way he talks, the way he behaves.</span> <span id="s371">He looks -- then comes my question.</span> <span id="s372">If we are so easily recognizable, why do we need the star?</span> <span id="s373">School kids, when I talk to them, they have the right answers.</span> <span id="s374">And here, I wondered -- we were separated there by Jewish and -- and designated by a star.</span> <span id="s375">What designates whom here?</span> <span id="s376">I -- I couldn’t -- I couldn’t make it out.</span> <span id="s377">It didn’t make logical sense, it didn’t make any kind of human, realistic sense to me.</span> <span id="s378">And my uncle explained it later, that this is what we are living here and -- and we’re coping with.</span> <span id="s379">“See, I’m not working together with Negroes.</span> <span id="s380">I am not working to -- we work in different building, we eat lunch, we sit in different place.”</span> <span id="s381">“Oh,” I said.</span> <span id="s382">“And that -- that,” I said, “is -- that’s not nice.”</span> <span id="s383">He said, “Well, don’t talk too much.”</span> <span id="s384">You don’t want to talk too much about it, you know, because you could -- you could encounter resistance and maybe he didn’t want me to be hurt, didn’t want me to be disappointed.</span> <span id="s385">He didn’t want me to -- to -- to -- to regard this as a place that I may not want to live in, you know, after they just brought me over to this country.</span> <span id="s386">That was one of the things that -- that was quite -- it was a shocker to me.</span> <span id="s387">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: How did you come to terms with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Realized that I have to -- to stay with my attitude and opinion that it is wrong.</span> <span id="s390">And whoever -- whenever anybody will talk to me about it, I will immediately stand up to that person and speak back and talk back and stand up.</span> <span id="s391">I made up my mind that if anybody, at that time, will tell me something about a nigger, which I learned after a few weeks and months that this is the word that is not supposed to be -- of course some of the black people call each other that way, but that is the -- to differentiate between me and you.</span> <span id="s392">I am the good black and you are the nigger.</span> <span id="s393">I found that out that that’s discrimination among the groups themselves.</span> <span id="s394">Jews, blacks, Catholics, others.</span> <span id="s395">We all human beings.</span> <span id="s396">But, as soon -- I made up my mind that I will not keep quiet in the face of adversity or bigotry or prejudice, bias.</span> <span id="s397">Because I’ve learned my lesson in Europe.</span> <span id="s398">Because if you keep quiet, you prob -- be -- you become a -- a co-conspirator.</span> <span id="s399">When you keep quiet you become part of -- of the system.</span> <span id="s400">If you keep quiet, that means in the face of the person that -- that -- that mentions these names or says these names or demeans anybody else.</span> <span id="s401">If you keep quiet, that person walks away in the knowledge -- or in the -- with the opinion that you agree with him.</span> <span id="s402">They will never think that you might disagree.</span> <span id="s403">Oh, he has nothing to say, he agrees with me.</span> <span id="s404">So I made up my mind, if anybody will speak about -- to me about a nigger, I will immediately reply to that person, “You know what you just did is very offensive to me.</span> <span id="s405">And I’m not so sure that when I turn my back to you, where you have been speaking very nicely to me, I’m not so sure that when I turn my back to you, you will not call me a kike.</span> <span id="s406">That goes hand in hand.”</span> <span id="s407">And my friend Herbie, that I mentioned to you, the one -- Freedman, the one who I -- was one -- one of the first friends.</span> <span id="s408">When we went down to Broadway and we took a cab home at night after we had taken some girls we went out with, friends and -- and dates and taking them home we grabbed a cab on Broadway in Baltimore and asked him to take us back to Parkhats Avenue.</span> <span id="s409">The cabby said to my friend Herbie, who was perfect in English, of course, he went to school here, went to the military and everything.</span> <span id="s410">So, Herbie got the cab and he told him, “Go Parkhats Avenue.”</span> <span id="s411">So the fella says to him, “Oh, that’s Hebetown.”</span> <span id="s412">You know what Herbie said?</span> <span id="s413">“Pull over to the side.</span> <span id="s414">Pull over to the side, we want to get out of that cab.”</span> <span id="s415">That taught me a lesson right then and there, too.</span> <span id="s416">That Herbie and I, we were on the same page, you know.</span> <span id="s417">There -- naturally America is -- was a society that was not in every respect to my liking.</span> <span id="s418">But on the other hand, I felt also that it was a place where I could -- I had no longer -- I did no longer have a fear of -- of saying I’m Jewish.</span> <span id="s419">See, I have -- I have the -- the opportunity to come back in kind if somebody says to me, “You can’t live in my area.”</span> <span id="s420">I can say, “You don’t live in my area.”</span> <span id="s421">Or -- as bad as it is, but I have a comeback.</span> <span id="s422">I am -- I am on an equal footing with everybody.</span> <span id="s423">So I realize that in spite of everything, it was still a country that I can acclimate myself to.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: How long did it take you to realize that it was safe to say that you were Jewish, because it was so unsafe to say that in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: You know, when I went here to a synagogue and I didn’t see people outside sneering or -- or -- I -- I -- I knew that right away.</span> <span id="s426">But took awhile to -- to realize all that and that I was not afraid to -- and that I’m -- to say that I’m Jewish, came almost -- within a -- within a very short time.</span> <span id="s427">Because I had my -- my examples there, of my friends.</span> <span id="s428">And -- and I also knew that there was support for me when -- when something might go wrong with me, from people who are not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: And Herbie was -- was not Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: No, no, Herbie was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Yeah, Herbie was Jewish.</span> <span id="s433">He s-still is.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Mr. -- Mr. Bretholz, did you -- I understand you -- I believe I read in your memoirs, in you epilogue that -- that you didn’t talk about your Holocaust experience for a long while.</span> <span id="s435">Can you talk about why that -- why that was and when you did first start talking about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Well, I didn’t talk for 14 years.</span> <span id="s437">It was too hard to reflect on it, to come to terms with it.</span> <span id="s438">And I hadn’t heard anything from my mother and sisters and the guilt was there and -- the knowledge that you can’t do much about it, was a heavy weight.</span> <span id="s439">And I worked, so I had my work and I had my friends.</span> <span id="s440">In 1960, when I had left Standard Textile and went into partnership, into the liquor business, I heard a radio program.</span> <span id="s441">It was one of those talk hosts -- talk show hosts, who -- earlier -- years -- that dates back now, over 30 years of course.</span> <span id="s442">And the man who ran that program, who was the -- the talk show host was a -- a Methodist minister by the name of Luther Starnes.</span> <span id="s443">We became very good friends.</span> <span id="s444">Luther had a call-in program and it was at the time when a marine, a young marine died while he was exercising in Paris Island with the -- in training.</span> <span id="s445">And a mother called -- a woman who may have not been the mother of one of those marines.</span> <span id="s446">And the debate went on, how should this training go to toughen our boys and to make them into men and make them into -- for the defense of the country.</span> <span id="s447">Oh, here’s the man there.</span> <span id="s448">Oh, excuse me.</span> <span id="s449">Will -- will that disturb you with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Well, a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: This is Mr. Pitt.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: So the lady said to Luther Starnes, Luther, if it’s necessary for defense of our country to toughen our boys, let’s train them to be killers.</span> <span id="s454">Let’s train them to be good soldiers is one thing, but let’s train them to be killers, bothered me.</span> <span id="s455">So -- so there was the -- the break in the -- in the program, during the commercial break, I picked up the phone and called Luther and I told him what bothered me.</span> <span id="s456">He says, “You know what?</span> <span id="s457">Let’s have lunch together.”</span> <span id="s458">And we had lunch a couple days later, which was exactly on the sixth of November.</span> <span id="s459">Sixth of November, 1961, I believe.</span> <span id="s460">‘60 or ‘61, whatever.</span> <span id="s461">And it was on the day -- the anniversary of the day that I had escaped from -- from the train and we became very good friends and we formed a group, of which I was the initiator, basically, with him, called Prejudiced Anonymous, like Alcoholics Anonymous, Prejudiced Anonymous, based on the premise that when we’re prejudiced, we have an illness.</span> <span id="s462">We don’t admit to it.</span> <span id="s463">It’s colorless, it’s odorless, you know, it’s tasteless, it’s very insidious, but you’re prejudiced.</span> <span id="s464">And when you’re prejudiced you have to admit that you are before you can cure it.</span> <span id="s465">Just like an alcoholic.</span> <span id="s466">So we called it Prejudiced Anonymous and it formed -- it turned into a group of over 100 - 150 people -- member -- members.</span> <span id="s467">And then it fell apart because people moved away and those who went, we went out to speak to groups.</span> <span id="s468">Did a lot of programs, got a lot of material on that that I still ha-have on hand from them -- from then.</span> <span id="s469">And that’s how I started speaking.</span> <span id="s470">Because I realized that unless I speak up, I -- I will promote wh-what they are espousing.</span> <span id="s471">Yo-You can’t let the bigots get away with their attitudes.</span> <span id="s472">And Prejudiced Anonymous was that -- I have a plaque downstairs on that and everything, this dates back.</span> <span id="s473">This is now what’s it, ‘98?</span> <span id="s474">This is 37 years of, whew -- time.</span> <span id="s475">Got a little older since then, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: So that’s when you first started talking in public --</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: That’s when I first started talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: -- to friends and to other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: Yeah, other people and to meetings.</span> <span id="s480">I found my language, I found the way to express it and nat -- not to become shy -- gun shy in the face of adversity.</span> <span id="s481">And when we went to these groups, we had flak from those groups.</span> <span id="s482">Why you goody - goody, bleeding heart, this sort of thing.</span> <span id="s483">No.</span> <span id="s484">Because if you don’t learn the lesson from history, who was that, Santanyana said that?</span> <span id="s485">If you do not learn the lesson from history, we are condemned to repeat it.</span> <span id="s486">And by that -- on that premise, we went out talking, like we -- we had blacks, whites, Christians, Jews, atheists.</span> <span id="s487">We had a group of people, of -- from all denominations and walks of life.</span> <span id="s488">And one fella came up with a saying -- and -- in those days it was the liberty lobby that -- that promulgated the -- the -- the -- the -- the slogan, “America, love it or leave it.”</span> <span id="s489">Well, this fella was a -- a minister.</span> <span id="s490">And he was also a marriage counselor.</span> <span id="s491">He says, “I can replace that slogan.</span> <span id="s492">America, love it and change it, for the better.</span> <span id="s493">Let’s all do it together.”</span> <span id="s494">And then we had one fella who spoke -- black fella who actually had served some time in jail and then joined us because he educated himself.</span> <span id="s495">He came up with the saying -- I’ll never forget that, people applauded him.</span> <span id="s496">“We’re getting an A in moon, but we’re flunking earth.”</span> <span id="s497">So we -- we were a group who became -- we called it a group whose time had come.</span> <span id="s498">We called ourselves Prejudiced Anonymous.</span> <span id="s499">Patterned after the panel of American women.</span> <span id="s500">Have you ever heard of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: In those days, in the 60’s, there was a group of women, who went out to speak to organizations and churches and synagogues and institutions and they had a panel where they discussed the aspects of prejudice and -- and what can be done about it.</span> <span id="s503">And was called the panel of American women.</span> <span id="s504">So we said, let’s have a panel of fellas, men.</span> <span id="s505">The women can do their way, they -- they have -- they have time during the day perhaps, to do their meetings.</span> <span id="s506">We are -- because in those days women were not still involved in a two -- two family earning pattern and so women stayed home and -- more in those days.</span> <span id="s507">So they had time during the day to go out, instead of going in a -- go to a coffee clutch, they went to have a meeting in a -- in -- in a church or a synagogue or in a school.</span> <span id="s508">The men were working during the day, so we got together in the evenings, or on weekends.</span> <span id="s509">I never forget -- we went to Washington a snowy morning.</span> <span id="s510">On a weekend [indecipherable] to the Omni -- it was I think Omnibus.</span> <span id="s511">It was a -- in Washington there was a program called Omnibus.</span> <span id="s512">We went to Arlington, Virginia, a few blocks down from -- from a -- a -- Rockwell’s.</span> <span id="s513">Rockwell’s headquarters, the Nazi Rockwell.</span> <span id="s514">In -- on -- on Wilson Boulevard.</span> <span id="s515">What was his first name?</span> <span id="s516">Lincoln Rockwell.</span> <span id="s517">He was the -- the American Nazi.</span> <span id="s518">They flew the flag there, the Nazi flag on Wilson Boulevard.</span> <span id="s519">I once wrote about that and said, “Our troops went to Europe to -- to get the Nazi flag down from the Eiffel Tower, to the Acropolis in Greece and you come to Arlington and you see a -- you see an -- a swastika flying.”</span> <span id="s520">Whether it’s in Arlington, Virginia or in Lincoln, Nebraska, you know.</span> <span id="s521">Anyway, that was the group that we formed and so I found -- I found my -- my voice.</span> <span id="s522">And then in 1962, I got notified by the Vienna Jewish community, that the names of my mother and sisters do not appear on the list of those who have returned.</span> <span id="s523">In the book I call it quite a euphemism.</span> <span id="s524">Instead of saying they were murdered at Auschwitz, their names are not listed -- do not appear on the list of those who have returned.</span> <span id="s525">You know, that’s a nice way of saying it.</span> <span id="s526">But by that time I’d found out what happened to my mother and sisters and I could begin to reconcile things although the guilt stayed with me for many years until someday later, in fact maybe eight, 10 years ago, I went to a psychiatrist and consulted and had a few sessions.</span> <span id="s527">And he said to me, you know, “If your mother were able to come back for just a moment -- if she were coming back for just an hour maybe and -- and say one sentence to you, she would probably say, “I’m glad I urged you to leave.</span> <span id="s528">”” Because it was she who urged me to leave Vienna in 1938.</span> <span id="s529">She was the one.</span> <span id="s530">If not for her, I would not maybe have gotten my stuff together and left.</span> <span id="s531">B-But she says, “You must go because for men, for boys, this is not a place to be.”</span> <span id="s532">See, she was very prescient.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: And that -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: -- this is not a place to be.”</span> <span id="s535">See, she was very prescient.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: And that was the guilt that -- that lingered --</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: That lingered with me.</span> <span id="s538">The na -- the other guilt that lingered with me, to know that these people were left in that railroad car.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: The survivor’s guilt.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: From the -- from the baby, to the old people, you know.</span> <span id="s541">That’s -- that’s described in the -- in the chapter of my escape in the [indecipherable] -- in one of the chapters.</span> <span id="s542">But th-the survivors, yeah, that’s -- we are laboring under that.</span> <span id="s543">All of us, in a way, but I’m not dwelling on it.</span> <span id="s544">And being that I wrote the book, I know I have done what I wanted to do to get it -- to -- to get it and -- my friend Mike Waleska said to me, “Over so many years you’ve written all these Op-Ed pieces and the articles th -- in the Sun paper.</span> <span id="s545">Put it together in -- in reading form.”</span> <span id="s546">And so I say, “I’m not organized, I am not disciplined enough.”</span> <span id="s547">He says, “Well, let me help you with this.</span> <span id="s548">All you have to do is just write your narrative.</span> <span id="s549">The escape here, the escape there.</span> <span id="s550">Later we’ll put it together chronologically.</span> <span id="s551">Give me your narrative on the escapes.</span> <span id="s552">And on all the other things that you have experienced.</span> <span id="s553">And I’ll work with you, edit it here, there --” And in fact, in the book, he wrote a lot of the -- the historical aspects to it.</span> <span id="s554">I wrote about this and that in Vienna, this or that in France.</span> <span id="s555">And he picked up what happened, historically there, in the war or so, you know, with -- so that were cooperative effort.</span> <span id="s556">Edit it and helped me and when I wrote about 30 - 40 pages on this legal lined paper.</span> <span id="s557">You saw what it is, the -- all block lettering.</span> <span id="s558">He came back with a print out -- computer print out of 135 questions for me.</span> <span id="s559">He’s a journalist.</span> <span id="s560">All right, this -- this is very -- real story there, with this lady on crutches in the -- in -- in -- in the cattle car.</span> <span id="s561">But that lady had a face, that lady must have said something, must have done something.</span> <span id="s562">She looked like some -- what did she wear?</span> <span id="s563">This man that was praying there, what was the reaction of the other people?</span> <span id="s564">And for every -- I had 135 points to go and elaborate on, rather than write a narrative of what happened, go into details -- m-more minute details.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: Did all of this help also?</span> <span id="s566">Help you come to terms with --</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: Yes, come to terms.</span> <span id="s568">Because I had to dig up things and realize that I’m here now to tell a story and I cannot let the past be overwhelming me with these emotions when I’ve got -- I’ve got a family now and I got a life now and let’s face it by attrition and by the passing of time.</span> <span id="s569">My mother wouldn’t be here now anyway, which does not eliminate the fact that she was murdered, but I have to come to that -- to that realization and I have to come to that reconciliation.</span> <span id="s570">And I called Michael up like every other night.</span> <span id="s571">I say, “You know, I’m -- I’m now on pa -- I’m now on question 18 and this is 135 quest -- and I’ve had it already for about two weeks.”</span> <span id="s572">He says, “I’m not rushing you.</span> <span id="s573">You take your time, you do -- put your -- put your -- your thoughts into it.”</span> <span id="s574">And before you know it, I had answered all 135 questions and that was the book?</span> <span id="s575">No, it was not the book, this was the book, this was three or four chapters of it.</span> <span id="s576">And then after that my writing came much easier, because I already knew what the -- the essence of it is, not just that I was in a labor camp and worked on th-the so and so, but I was surrounded by things and I spoke to people and people had reactions.</span> <span id="s577">So, I could reconcile it and -- and -- and find this a very -- a real catharsis.</span> <span id="s578">And when I was finished with it, I felt -- I’d like to do more.</span> <span id="s579">I -- I felt a letdown.</span> <span id="s580">It was good to know that it was finished, but there was a letdown because I hadn’t -- I -- I was actually looking forward to every new chapter, every new paragraph wh-when I was doing it.</span> <span id="s581">And I wrote til three, four in the morning, because I’m a night person.</span> <span id="s582">And when I woke up during the night and a thought came to me, I went to this tab -- this table full with papers.</span> <span id="s583">I went to it and I wrote down my -- more notes, you know.</span> <span id="s584">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: I think you wrote in your memoirs that the war didn’t really end for you until 1962, when you got the news about your sister and your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: That’s what I just referred to.</span> <span id="s587">That when I got this, I had -- there was a -- this was a milestone.</span> <span id="s588">So I had a -- a closure of some sort.</span> <span id="s589">It was the closure to know what had happened to them.</span> <span id="s590">Not that I had many doubts that this was it, but when you don’t have the fin -- the -- the official word, you still have some hope.</span> <span id="s591">Because people, after so many years, as you’ll read from time to time, get together and find each other.</span> <span id="s592">But it was a closure.</span> <span id="s593">And the only way it can ever be a closure is that I do not know where they’re buried.</span> <span id="s594">That is the -- that is the -- the big thing, because most people do not realize the luxury of -- that they have in knowing the burial place of a relative.</span> <span id="s595">Father, mother, uncle, aunt, grandmother.</span> <span id="s596">Even if you never go to that gravesite, the knowledge that it’s there and that you can go if you would want to, is very comforting.</span> <span id="s597">And it is almost a luxury for those who have that comfort, have that knowledge.</span> <span id="s598">Now, I do -- to me there’s something like a surrogate for that.</span> <span id="s599">When I go to the Holocaust Museum and I see that mound of shoes there, I look at it with -- with some form of -- devotion of some sort or reminiscence or -- what do I want to call it?</span> <span id="s600">I look at it with some sort of a solemn feeling that perhaps, perhaps by the f -- most farfetched possibility, one of those shoes belonged to my mother or my sisters.</span> <span id="s601">So I use that as a reference, as a point of reference to give me some comfort and solace.</span> <span id="s602">And we have to do that.</span> <span id="s603">Just like some people go to Auschwitz and step on the ground and say perhaps the bones and the ashes of my family are here, so I’m here on hallowed ground.</span> <span id="s604">To me those shoes mean that.</span> <span id="s605">Those combs and toothbrushes there, that are -- you -- you know, there -- at the museum.</span> <span id="s606">When I’m going to that cattle car, I get shivers, you know.</span> <span id="s607">A cattle car, the way it is constituted there, could not have allowed me to escape, because the bars are bolted to the outside.</span> <span id="s608">Solidly bolted, I -- I would have never touched them.</span> <span id="s609">I would have never been able to bend them apart like I described doing it at my -- that point of my escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: How often do you go to the Holocaust Museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: I go probably more often than I would like to and would I -- that I would volunteer to go.</span> <span id="s612">I was there a day before it officially opened, with the WJZ.</span> <span id="s613">I have the tape of that, JZ TV, they went there to do a -- a program and I -- they took me along to do some color -- explanation and get my i-input.</span> <span id="s614">Then there are these bus trips that schools take, organization ik -- invite me to come as a dossent.</span> <span id="s615">So I speak about it on the bus going there, what they might expect.</span> <span id="s616">I tell them right away, this is not a trip into serendipity.</span> <span id="s617">This is not a -- a pleasure excursion.</span> <span id="s618">When you will come out of there, you will feel tired, you will feel abused and you will have a lot of questions.</span> <span id="s619">And a lot of questions that will never be answered.</span> <span id="s620">And tell them a little bit about -- what my story, show them my star and so on, so forth.</span> <span id="s621">Then, on the way back, sometime there are questions on something that they saw and they would like something explained or elaborated on.</span> <span id="s622">Most of the times, it’s silence.</span> <span id="s623">The majority of the trips back, I do not get questions, although I say right away, when we’re -- if you have any questions during this trip, please don’t hesitate.</span> <span id="s624">That’s it.</span> <span id="s625">I leave it at that.</span> <span id="s626">No urging, no prodding, no encouraging it.</span> <span id="s627">But, very seldom.</span> <span id="s628">The people are really thinking.</span> <span id="s629">And the majority of them, when we leave and we get back, say that they will have to go back at least one more time, because you can’t really absorb it, it’s -- it’s too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s631">Can we go back a little bit in time?</span> <span id="s632">We skipped over the meeting of your wife, your future wife.</span> <span id="s633">Can you tell that story, how you met her and how your marriage came to be?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: Flora and I met at a wedding.</span> <span id="s635">My good friend Herbert Freedman married Joyce Herman and Flora had a friend who was also a friend of Joyce and they became bridesmaids to Joyce.</span> <span id="s636">Flo’s friend, Sandra, bridesmaids to Joyce and I was best man to Herbie.</span> <span id="s637">That’s how we met.</span> <span id="s638">That was in November of 1951 and we were married in July of 1952, which will now be 46 years and Herbie was best man at my wedding, in ‘52.</span> <span id="s639">So that’s how I met Flo, in -- at -- at a wedding in 1951.</span> <span id="s640">I was -- just about four and a half years after I had arrived in this country.</span> <span id="s641">In ‘52 we were married, in July and in August of ‘52, a month later, I acquired American citizenship, five years after my arrival.</span> <span id="s642">And that is the -- that is the story of my -- of my meeting with -- with Flo.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Wh-When was the first time you told her about what had happened to you during the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: I did not speak too much about it in the beginning, but little by little it -- it came out, because in ‘54 we went to Europe to meet the remnant of my family, my aunt in Paris and my cousin in England.</span> <span id="s645">And a cousin that had survived who was an Austrian, she met us in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s646">I write about that.</span> <span id="s647">And as we came to Paris and spoke to my aunt and -- and then my other relatives that were still in Belgium since then, my uncle died, my aunt died, my cousin.</span> <span id="s648">Time takes it’s toll.</span> <span id="s649">And during that trip to Europe and on the way back, I started to tell Flo more and more because she had met the family.</span> <span id="s650">But in general, I did not elaborate too much on -- on it, because I didn’t want to dwell too much on it.</span> <span id="s651">Seven years ago, when I spoke to Social Security agency, in Woodlawn, a young lady came up to me and she says, “Leo,” she looked at me, “Leo, I didn’t know these things.”</span> <span id="s652">I said, “Wait a minute, wait a minute, you are?”</span> <span id="s653">“I’m Jane.”</span> <span id="s654">“Jane, my God.</span> <span id="s655">How time goes by,” I said.</span> <span id="s656">It’s a girl I had taken out, dating, good friend.</span> <span id="s657">And there she was so many years later, maybe, I don’t know -- maybe some 30 -- some years later.</span> <span id="s658">“But you know what you just -- what I just heard you tell, you never told me about that.”</span> <span id="s659">I said, “Jane, in those days I didn’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s660">I didn’t want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s661">I didn’t feel like talking about it.”</span> <span id="s662">But that was much -- much later than -- than when I took Flo to -- when Flo and I went to Europe in ‘54.</span> <span id="s663">Of course we lived together and it had to come out, correspondence and pictures and -- and the star, I had the star with me and I told her a few things here and there.</span> <span id="s664">And Flo was always very, very understanding in these things and very compassionate about these things.</span> <span id="s665">Much more than the average person I would think.</span> <span id="s666">And understood it and -- and -- and even today, when she reads about these things or hears about this, “How could that -- how could they do that to -- to the children?</span> <span id="s667">How could they do that to the old people?”</span> <span id="s668">And she understands it.</span> <span id="s669">In fact, one of her first friends, girlfriends in -- in Baltimore was a girl -- a young woman who -- who had survived a -- a camp and -- and came back after the war, from Sweden.</span> <span id="s670">So Flo always understood a lot about these things and was very understanding and compassionate and -- had strong feelings about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: Did she not s -- tell you that -- encourage you to confront the -- the past?</span> <span id="s672">I read where you -- you said something about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Yeah, she did.</span> <span id="s674">Yeah, she did, it’s a -- be good to -- you know, to -- to find out and to do the best you can with -- of -- of course when we had children later, I had to be very careful with the kids, not to inflict some of these post traumatic syndrome aspects on them, or pass it on to them, which in many families has become a problem.</span> <span id="s675">Many children of survivors are very actively involved.</span> <span id="s676">My kids are not so involved, although they know of it -- of it, but my son never wanted to hear anything about it and he was strongly affected by it.</span> <span id="s677">So we had to moderate my memories and expression of the memories with -- with the aspect of -- of the family.</span> <span id="s678">My -- my cousin in London -- I’m not going to give anything away, but as I didn’t -- didn’t know there is an ending to this that -- that is a very interesting ending, pertaining to my cousin in London -- never told her kids anything about her family.</span> <span id="s679">The kids grew up entirely sheltered from it.</span> <span id="s680">Now, I didn’t shelter them.</span> <span id="s681">They -- they knew that I had meetings.</span> <span id="s682">They knew I had the meeting with Prejudiced Anonymous and they knew that in Prejudiced Anonymous I spoke about my experiences, because I had found my voice.</span> <span id="s683">And some of it was reported in the papers.</span> <span id="s684">A fella by the -- Lou Panos followed us from one meeting to the other and always described our meetings -- was very impressed with what we were doing.</span> <span id="s685">But they knew about it, because evidently I did speak about it at those meetings, because that was the essence of what I wanted to tell them.</span> <span id="s686">Look what prejudice did in Europe and how it can affect us all here if we do not -- if we do not speak up and talk back and stand up for what we think is -- is right.</span> <span id="s687">But Flo, yeah, en-encouraged me to -- to a -- to -- didn’t discourage me to talk about it, but she was also encouraging and -- and saying you have to -- you have to make up your mind and all that -- how to deal with it and deal with it the best way you can and you can’t let your life be affected by it for the rest of -- of your years, you know, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: How many children do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: Three.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: And did there come a point where they came to you and asked you to talk to them more about it or did you ever sit down with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: No.</span> <span id="s692">We sat down in a family and sometime it happened at the dinner table, sometime -- there was never too much reaction from them on -- on an -- on an -- they understood it, but then on emotional point.</span> <span id="s693">But -- but my son was definitely affected by it.</span> <span id="s694">Whenever we spoke about something, about the -- these events, the Holocaust, he would walk out of the room.</span> <span id="s695">He could not -- he could not cope with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: And how did that affect you?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: Well, I-I didn’t -- I tried not to do it when he was -- when he was present, you know.</span> <span id="s698">Then he went to college and we wa -- we moved over to Holland for two years, from 1975 to ‘77 on business.</span> <span id="s699">So I lived in -- we lived in Amsterdam, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: And they’re grown now [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: Oh, they’re grown, yeah.</span> <span id="s702">I have four grandchildren.</span> <span id="s703">The son isn’t married, but the daughters are.</span> <span id="s704">One lives in Elicott City, one lives in Virginia, over in Herndon and we’re going there this weekend, to Herndon, Friday and Saturday to be with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: Do your grandchildren know about your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: Well, they’re too young.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: I have one granddaughter who is nine and a half and she knows.</span> <span id="s709">She has heard me talking in school, Hebrew school, she learns a little bit about it.</span> <span id="s710">But her sister is six, she doesn’t know anything.</span> <span id="s711">And then the boys are five and three, so they’re -- they’re not --</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: Now is -- is Flo American?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: B-Born in Baltimore.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: Baltimore.</span> <span id="s715">Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s718">And tell me what it was like to become an American citizen, what that was like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: Well, it was a ve-very -- it was a great experience.</span> <span id="s720">I felt very good about it, I felt I now have a -- a -- an identity, a passport that is respected, that ha -- that -- that is meaningful.</span> <span id="s721">That’s -- that’s the way I felt about it.</span> <span id="s722">And you know, I finally got over some of the nightmares that I had in the beginning.</span> <span id="s723">And still, from time to time, I -- I get some weird dreams that recall the past, like you know.</span> <span id="s724">But as -- when I became American, that was -- it was a very good feeling for me.</span> <span id="s725">I was some -- it was something -- it was a feeling of achievement.</span> <span id="s726">And proudly when we went to Europe in ‘54, I then traveled on a -- with an American passport and -- and I didn’t have to -- and another thing, in -- well, in school for instance, in Austria, we had on our -- on our certif -- on our reports, yearly reports, was not only our name, but also our religion was marked.</span> <span id="s727">And this in -- in -- in America, I didn’t feel -- felt was no longer the venue, you know, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: What did it mean to be an American, to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: Well, when you -- when you become -- when you become an American citizen, you feel that something special has happened to you.</span> <span id="s730">You have become a person within a system that considers you a person.</span> <span id="s731">On par with everybody else.</span> <span id="s732">And what it meant was exactly what the judge told us.</span> <span id="s733">You -- most of you -- all of you -- these were Russians and Poles and Czechs and Romanians and Italians.</span> <span id="s734">Most of you come from countries where when you walked into a room, or a schoolroom, or an office, you had the picture of the leader of the country.</span> <span id="s735">We don’t have this idolization of a -- of a -- of a person.</span> <span id="s736">The president lives in the White House and he is your tenant.</span> <span id="s737">Never forget the judge said.</span> <span id="s738">And when it’s time to evict him, you doing it.</span> <span id="s739">He gave us the metaphor, you know.</span> <span id="s740">He is your tenant.</span> <span id="s741">And you come from all backgrounds, from all areas of the world and you’re just a continuation of that influx that came here at the turn of the century.</span> <span id="s742">Unfortunately, latel-lately these attitudes have changed, forgetting that what Emma -- what what’s her name said, [indecipherable] Emma Lazarus said on the Statue of Liberty, both foreign born and native born have made this country great.</span> <span id="s743">Go through the history of America and you see how many of -- of the -- of the pioneers, what they have done for America.</span> <span id="s744">So I remember what the judge said, and that always stuck with me.</span> <span id="s745">You come from many areas, but here nobody will malign you because you come from here, from there, because we are all alike.</span> <span id="s746">We are all -- we all came basically on the same boat, at different times.</span> <span id="s747">I did and you did and your neighbors did.</span> <span id="s748">The judge made a great impact on me and I felt very good about becoming an American.</span> <span id="s749">And I don’t wear the flag on my sleeve, but when I lived in Holland, I did, because in Holland, oh, you Americans, you -- you don’t know from tragedy and pain and bombing.</span> <span id="s750">What do you understand about the miseries of the Dutch, you know.</span> <span id="s751">In the meantime, they segregate the Moloccans and the Moroccans and the Turks.</span> <span id="s752">But they harp on the black man here.</span> <span id="s753">And I said, “You just come and talk to the black American and see whether he would prefer to live in your country or whether he would prefer to stay in America.”</span> <span id="s754">And that’s when I had to defend America.</span> <span id="s755">And they said, you do not understand what it means to be suffering.</span> <span id="s756">Because they had just gone through that World War Two thing and the Nazis and persecutions and hardships and hunger.</span> <span id="s757">Famine and all this thing.</span> <span id="s758">Deportations, bombings, from which I am to understand by what they say, and they say you do not understand me and you have never had that, therefore you can’t understand.</span> <span id="s759">But we, because we had it, we have become better for it.</span> <span id="s760">We understand what it is and when you understand something, you apply it in your life and you become better for it.</span> <span id="s761">But that isn’t the case.</span> <span id="s762">So I said, “Have you become better for it?</span> <span id="s763">Look at the Moloccans.</span> <span id="s764">A cab driver wouldn’t pick him up to take him to his apartment, because he says he is going to Battonfeld and Battonfeld is one of the suburbs where the Moloccans live, or the Moroccans.</span> <span id="s765">So the cab driver would say I can’t take you.</span> <span id="s766">This is -- have you become better?”</span> <span id="s767">And this is the arguments that I had with them, you know?</span> <span id="s768">That’s where I stood up for America.</span> <span id="s769">And I was proud to do that.</span> <span id="s770">I said to Flo, “Now, let’s get back to America and relax.</span> <span id="s771">Now we are Americans, we know what’s good about it, we know what’s bad about it and we know what we want to change and we know what we can’t change.</span> <span id="s772">And we know that it will always be the same, basically, f -- because people are people.”</span> <span id="s773">But the times have evolutioned, you know.</span> <span id="s774">But in Holland, we had to stand up for America.</span> <span id="s775">It made me feel good.</span> <span id="s776">It made me feel real good when I went to the consulate in -- in 1976 and I voted.</span> <span id="s777">I voted in absentia.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: You talk about having nightmares.</span> <span id="s779">How long -- what were the nightmares about, how long did you have them?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: They were sporadic.</span> <span id="s781">One of them that I describe in the book is mainly -- I’m coming into a h-house that is being destroyed, torn down.</span> <span id="s782">And there is a wall and the wall is being hit with these ac -- picks, you know they -- that they tear down from the inside.</span> <span id="s783">And in it, behind the wall, is the body of a woman.</span> <span id="s784">It’s a recurring theme.</span> <span id="s785">And also, I’m walking in the street and I’m coming to a barrier, almost like a construction type barrier, but instead of construction, beyond are Nazi brown shirts.</span> <span id="s786">I’ve had that sporadically, on and off.</span> <span id="s787">But not recently.</span> <span id="s788">This was in the 60’s.</span> <span id="s789">50’s - 60’s - 70’s, up to the 70’s, not recently.</span> <span id="s790">From time to time I do dream about swimming a river or talking to my mother, my sisters.</span> <span id="s791">And th-that -- that would sometime be a reflection on what we might have talked about the night before at dinner, or maybe -- you know, I never bring the subject up.</span> <span id="s792">When we are at dinner, unless somebody will say, “So how are you coming with your book?”</span> <span id="s793">I [indecipherable] fine, yeah.</span> <span id="s794">“What do you -- h-how was this?</span> <span id="s795">Did you hear about what so and so said?</span> <span id="s796">You hear about Switzerland, whats --” I sit in a restaurant.</span> <span id="s797">I walk into a restaurant and I see somebody stand in line there in front of me, or somebody is just walking out.</span> <span id="s798">I know the person.</span> <span id="s799">He rush -- or her -- they walk over, “Hi, how are you doing, Leo?”</span> <span id="s800">And I’ll motion to Flo, watch this.</span> <span id="s801">“You know Leo, I meant to call you and ask you, you know I read something about the Holocaust Mu --” I -- immediately when they see me, they -- they think I am the authority on the Holo -- I don’t want to be an authority on the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s802">I don’t want to be -- I want to be Leo Bretholz.</span> <span id="s803">I -- in nine out of 10 cases, they’ll come and ask me something about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s804">When are you going the next time?</span> <span id="s805">Do you know a bus that’ll go there, because I like to go alone.</span> <span id="s806">Do you know my son -- End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: “When are you going the next time?</span> <span id="s808">Do you know a bus that’ll go there, because I like to go alone.</span> <span id="s809">Do you know my son or my nephew, they have a project in school, they would talk to -- like to talk to someone.</span> <span id="s810">You think he can give you a call?”</span> <span id="s811">“Yeah, ask him to give me a call.</span> <span id="s812">Yeah, do that.”</span> <span id="s813">Some of them call, some of them don’t.</span> <span id="s814">But it’s nine out of 10 cases when somebody sees me in a -- in a -- in a place, the subject will be the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s815">I don’t -- I don’t relish it.</span> <span id="s816">I don’t exult in that th -- sort of thing.</span> <span id="s817">Because it’s -- it’s part of me, it’s my past, that’s -- yes, but I don’t go to a fella who is a -- a shoemaker and say, “You know what?</span> <span id="s818">I meant to tell you, I -- I bought a pair of shoes and --” wh-wh-wh -- I give you that as a -- as an example.</span> <span id="s819">I don’t go to anybody who is a doctor and would say, “You know, I meant to call you.</span> <span id="s820">I had a pain here that -- what do you make of that?”</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: You’re more than the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: I’m more than the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s823">I don’t want to be an -- oh, I’m sorry, I don’t want to be an object of curiosity.</span> <span id="s824">I -- he’s a survivor, you know.</span> <span id="s825">“This is my friend, Leo, he’s a survivor.”</span> <span id="s826">You know, spare me.</span> <span id="s827">Spare me the title, please, sir.</span> <span id="s828">We are all survivors.</span> <span id="s829">Do you realize that if Hitler had won that war and become what he wanted to be, the thousands [indecipherable] encompassing the whole world, that we wouldn’t be sitting here, talking?</span> <span id="s830">In that re -- in that -- in that way, we are all survivors.</span> <span id="s831">Don’t think of the others as survivor, please, do me a favor.</span> <span id="s832">[inaudible].</span> <span id="s833">Do you understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: Can you personally understand it?</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: Aside from this being an interview, if you and I were talking over a cup of coffee, I would not bring up the subject, but if you would bring it up, I would certainly tell you what you want to know.</span> <span id="s838">That’s common courtesy and common procedure when somebody wants to find out something in the process that -- that could be possibly a learning a process, yes.</span> <span id="s839">But this is not my achievement.</span> <span id="s840">My achievement is that I am alive.</span> <span id="s841">Let’s dwell on something positive.</span> <span id="s842">I have a family and these are the -- the new branches of the old tree, you know, it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: Well, let’s pick up on some of the more positive achievements, then.</span> <span id="s844">I think we left off in your career with you starting a -- a liquor business.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: Can you talk a little bit about -- more about your work and how that --</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: Well, the -- the work in the liquor business was a very lucrative business.</span> <span id="s848">It was good, it was from 1960 -- ‘61 -- ‘60 - ‘61 to 1968 and then came the riots and we could not get insurance any more, so we sold it.</span> <span id="s849">We sold the property and the business.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: The riots -- the civil rights?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: Civil rights, yeah.</span> <span id="s852">And this is an aspect that I want to bring out and was thinking of bringing out if it came up.</span> <span id="s853">That while the liquor stores were closed for two weeks curfew, by edict --</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: And this is in Baltimore?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: Baltimore.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: Every night, around -- between 11 and 12 midnight, we got calls from the area of people that were standing there, watching, assuring us, “Leo -- Mr. Leo,” Mr. Bender was my partner.</span> <span id="s858">“Your place is okay.</span> <span id="s859">We will not let anything happen to it.”</span> <span id="s860">We felt that was a tribute to us by the people there, who knew who we were, who knew how we treated our customers.</span> <span id="s861">This is where my actions, my words -- my words and our meetings with Prejudiced Anonymous, showed some results, in fact.</span> <span id="s862">That it wasn’t just that we spoke words, but that we acted it out in our daily lives in our business.</span> <span id="s863">Stores were burned down on Lombard Street and this corner liquor store at Lombard and Central, remained intact -- where others lost their businesses.</span> <span id="s864">Now naturally we couldn’t stay there -- without insurance you can’t run a liquor store.</span> <span id="s865">And we sold the property later to someone else and that was fine.</span> <span id="s866">So that was the liquor store.</span> <span id="s867">And that was til 1968 and I went into a -- into the book business in partnership.</span> <span id="s868">And my partner had the place in -- my partner had the place in Amsterdam, a book place in -- with another fella, in partnership and this fella wanted to come back to America, so I went over to manage that store for two years.</span> <span id="s869">Took my wife and my two daughters.</span> <span id="s870">My son was at Georgetown University and he finished his study.</span> <span id="s871">Took my two daughters over there.</span> <span id="s872">One went to the international school, the younger one.</span> <span id="s873">The older one went to an extension of Syracuse University in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s874">She had just a -- about a -- had a half a year left here in high school.</span> <span id="s875">And did her tests with a proctor and came back in ‘76 to graduate on -- on the stage, with the kids, then we went back.</span> <span id="s876">And -- and when I came back -- when I came back from Amsterdam, I just went to work for my former partner -- also managing his store -- also book stores.</span> <span id="s877">And then in 1992, I retired from the book business.</span> <span id="s878">I was in the liquor store business and the book business.</span> <span id="s879">And at first a traveling salesman for a -- a textile company.</span> <span id="s880">So that -- that is basically no great -- no great shakes, but I always made a living and then -- then I wrote this book.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: How -- how do you think your experiences during the Holocaust shaped your belief system, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: Well, the belief system is a -- is a very -- is a very -- I was raised, actually, by a quite liberal father.</span> <span id="s883">He -- my father was never raised -- he died when I -- when I was nine, so I wasn’t really raised by him.</span> <span id="s884">But he was never a religious man, but he was a very activist man in social causes.</span> <span id="s885">And the Holocaust shaped me to the extent that there is a realization that unless you assert yourself in the face of hatred and adversity, you will -- you will become a victim eventually.</span> <span id="s886">Now, you have to stand up for what’s right when your neighbor is being maligned, and your fellow man discriminated against.</span> <span id="s887">That’s the way we raised our kids.</span> <span id="s888">Because if you don’t do it at that moment, then it’ll come back to haunt you because there’s somebody there waiting for you -- to -- to malign you.</span> <span id="s889">And the -- the evil of -- of prejudice and hatred, has to be recognized for what it is.</span> <span id="s890">That’s the lesson of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s891">If, from that negative experience of the Holocaust, there is only one positive thing that come out of it, it’s the creation of an awareness that it can happen, so that you can fight it.</span> <span id="s892">Now, you have to fight it before it establishes itself as a governmental entity.</span> <span id="s893">Before the government has been established with that ideology.</span> <span id="s894">You cannot let it get to the point where it becomes officially a government policy, then it’s too late already.</span> <span id="s895">[telephone interruption] -- we shouldn’t.</span> <span id="s896">So fight it before it is established, because then it is too late.</span> <span id="s897">The Nazis have shown it to us.</span> <span id="s898">Other -- other dictatorial regimes have shown it to us.</span> <span id="s899">The -- the -- it -- it’s like a web.</span> <span id="s900">The dictator is like a web -- in a spider in a web, I mean.</span> <span id="s901">The dictator’s the spider.</span> <span id="s902">Now, this is metaphor, again.</span> <span id="s903">The spider gets that insect and enmeshes it in the web.</span> <span id="s904">But the spider isn’t finished.</span> <span id="s905">He goes for more victims.</span> <span id="s906">He gets more, until this web is filled up with -- with insects, then he builds another web to catch more, you see?</span> <span id="s907">That -- that is -- that is what we have to learn from it, to fight when you see it.</span> <span id="s908">Now, can we always do it?</span> <span id="s909">Do our -- d-does our -- our character, our -- our temperament always allow us to immediately speak back -- or talk back, I mean?</span> <span id="s910">Sometime not, sometime you have to say, well, you have to watch out, maybe that person didn’t mean it, you have to make allowances.</span> <span id="s911">But we cannot make many allowances.</span> <span id="s912">When there is a pattern that repeats itself.</span> <span id="s913">Whether it’s in the school, or at work, you have to speak back.</span> <span id="s914">[indecipherable] can’t talk.</span> <span id="s915">You have to talk back.</span> <span id="s916">And when people tell me, “Leo, why did other people not run?</span> <span id="s917">Why did you run?”</span> <span id="s918">I say, “I was afraid, I was scared.”</span> <span id="s919">Fear was my motivater.</span> <span id="s920">Then I have to give examples.</span> <span id="s921">It’s easy to say, why does somebody not run.</span> <span id="s922">Well, I ran, I was free, I was single.</span> <span id="s923">If I had been with a family, I couldn’t have done it.</span> <span id="s924">If I -- one elderly person, I couldn’t -- a woman, a child.</span> <span id="s925">And in the whole history of deportations from France, there were less than a dozen attempts to escape, out of 80,000 - 85,000 people.</span> <span id="s926">Book shows it.</span> <span id="s927">But -- but when somebody says, “Why did others not run?”</span> <span id="s928">Almost like demeaning them for not having attempted.</span> <span id="s929">I have one simple example to these people.</span> <span id="s930">You’re working in an office, you’re working in a factory, in a business.</span> <span id="s931">And you have a supervisor, you have a manager, you have a foreman, you have a boss and you come home day after day after day and you’re complaining to your husband or to your wife, “He goes on my nerve.”</span> <span id="s932">Or, “She annoys me.</span> <span id="s933">I can’t stand it, I hate to go into -- I hate the thought of going into that office.”</span> <span id="s934">There’s nobody standing there with a gun.</span> <span id="s935">You can quit.</span> <span id="s936">All you are giving up is a job and you have to find another job.</span> <span id="s937">But nobody’s standing there with a gun, threatening you and you say people should run away when they are in line, being assembled to be taken into a train, surrounded by guards with weapons?</span> <span id="s938">They should run away, but you can’t get away from a job where there’s nobody there with a weapon?</span> <span id="s939">It’s always so easy for someone else to tell others what they should have done, when they themselves don’t know what they would have done.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: And you have to understand also the other person that is being prejudiced against.</span> <span id="s942">As I said before, the nigger in the pr -- in -- in -- in the hater’s eye, becomes the kike or the wasp or the wop.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: You talked about the lesson of the Holocaust and I wanted to read you this quote from Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister of Israel.</span> <span id="s944">You may have heard of -- heard him or read his -- this, from April 24th.</span> <span id="s945">“This is the lesson of the Holocaust, this and only this.</span> <span id="s946">That the existence of the Jewish people is tied to Jewish sovereignty and a Jewish army that rests on the strength of Jewish faith.”</span> <span id="s947">Do you agree with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: Well, after the Holocaust, we have seen that nationhood for the -- for the Jews was a survival necessity.</span> <span id="s949">Had there not been a Holocaust, there probably would not have been a Jewish state.</span> <span id="s950">But had there been a Jewish state in the 30’s and 40’s, I am convinced that there would not have been a Holocaust.</span> <span id="s951">All you have to see is Entebbe.</span> <span id="s952">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s953">That -- that is my conviction, because we lost a million and a half children.</span> <span id="s954">A million and a half children.</span> <span id="s955">As somebody wrote -- a woman wrote, Gerta Weissman Klein wrote that they’re ordinary children, but a lot of them could have become very extraordinary.</span> <span id="s956">Luxembourg is a nation with 350,000 people or 400,000 people.</span> <span id="s957">There were a million and a half children who could have grown into a nation of 30 or 40,000,000, had they been allowed to live, but they didn’t.</span> <span id="s958">Had there been a state of Israel, these children would not have died.</span> <span id="s959">In that respect, yes.</span> <span id="s960">With other things, I can disagree with Netanyahu, but he was elected.</span> <span id="s961">And perhaps the -- the labor government is more acceptable to a lot of people, because they were, perhaps, more -- more amenable.</span> <span id="s962">But Rabine also was not a man who was going to have his country commit suicide.</span> <span id="s963">I am sure he was not that kind of a man.</span> <span id="s964">In fact, Rabine was a general and Netanyahu was not.</span> <span id="s965">But Netanyahu is also a man who wrote an important book about terrorism, he is an expert on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: You said something interesting, had there not been a Holocaust, there would not have been a Jewish state, and -- and made me wonder, had there not been a Holocaust, how would your life have been different?</span> <span id="s967">Do you ever reflect on that?</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: Well, had there not been a Holocaust, perhaps I would never have come to America, that is possible.</span> <span id="s969">But the Jewish state was already in the stages of -- of -- of planning, or infancy or a incubation with the Balfour Declaration, 1917.</span> <span id="s970">Of course, in 1895, Hertzel wrote The Judenstat, a Jewish state, which he became aware of through the Dreyfuss affair.</span> <span id="s971">And he said, if we will it will not be a -- if we will it, it will not be a dream.</span> <span id="s972">But, while it was in -- in it’s infancy, then the -- the -- the idea, it -- it became -- it became a -- a dire necessity after the Holocaust, simply because -- because the proof was there, that nobody -- nobody was accepting the Jews.</span> <span id="s973">The world knew about it.</span> <span id="s974">The -- the ship Saint Louis came to the American coast in 1939 and Gustov Shroeder, the captain with the swastika on his lapel, called the Coast Guard, ship to shore, pleading with them, “Let -- don’t let me take these people back.”</span> <span id="s975">He was crying, a Nazi.</span> <span id="s976">Was he a Nazi or was he a -- a -- a cripto antagonist, perhaps, you know.</span> <span id="s977">But he wore the swastika and he was the captain of the ship, from the Hamburg - America line.</span> <span id="s978">And he’s, “Don’t let me take these people back.”</span> <span id="s979">And those who wound up in England were saved, but the ones that depo -- disembarked in Holland and in France and in Belgium, they wound up in the -- in the death camps.</span> <span id="s980">So the captain -- Nazi captain was right.</span> <span id="s981">And when you take that in history -- in the context of history, you -- you -- you will see that -- that’s conjecture, naturally.</span> <span id="s982">But the impetus was there for the state and the -- and the sympathy was there for the state and it -- and it became.</span> <span id="s983">And today there are problems.</span> <span id="s984">There are problems within that state.</span> <span id="s985">We know them and we hope they will overcome them.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: A couple of things that I didn’t ask you about, in -- in talking the -- about the chronology of your life and that is your trips to Europe -- going back to Europe in the -- late ‘54 and then later.</span> <span id="s987">Can you talk about what impressions those trips had on you?</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: Well, I told you the impression that I had when we lived in Holland, with the Dutch, that I had to stand up -- I had to drape myself in the American flag, because I was an American.</span> <span id="s989">We came back in ‘54 and then we went to England in ‘54 to meet my cousin.</span> <span id="s990">I learned a lot from her, what happened to her during the war, she was in a -- in a -- lived in a building that was bombed in the blitz and she narrowly escaped.</span> <span id="s991">I also learned that during the blitz, when the people went into the shelters, in the underground, metro, shelters.</span> <span id="s992">That where they may have been at odds with each other, racially or in -- n-n -- by na -- racially or by nation or by religion or whatever.</span> <span id="s993">Where the -- whether West Indians in England or where some of the Asians in England were perhaps second class citizens, but when it came to going into the bomb shelters, they all slept under the same blankets.</span> <span id="s994">They all were together, threatened by that one common enemy.</span> <span id="s995">So it just shows how some situations can make human beings into real human beings, not just a species, but in action, you see?</span> <span id="s996">That’s what we learned at -- that was during the war -- in the war.</span> <span id="s997">We -- we -- we went back to France in ‘54, to meet with my aunt and with relatives in Belgium and my cousin from Vienna came to join us in -- in -- in -- in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s998">Very little -- very little was mentioned about the tragedy of the war, it was too fresh.</span> <span id="s999">Much too fresh for my cousin in -- in Vienna, who had lost her father.</span> <span id="s1000">This is described very vividly.</span> <span id="s1001">My aunt in Paris who had lost her husband.</span> <span id="s1002">My uncle in -- in Belgium, whose son was deported and murdered at Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1003">So these were things that were tacit -- tacitly part of our -- of our make up, but it wasn’t much talked about.</span> <span id="s1004">1970 -- in 1970, we went to Israel to visit our family on the kibbutz there, my mother’s youngest brother was there.</span> <span id="s1005">It’s interesting.</span> <span id="s1006">He was there and we went to visit him with the family on the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1007">He is no longer alive now.</span> <span id="s1008">And we went back to Europe and traveled by car through Europe.</span> <span id="s1009">Again met with my aunt in Paris and my cousin in Vienna and I just mentioned my family on the kibbutz lately.</span> <span id="s1010">We received this picture from them.</span> <span id="s1011">This is my Aunt Sarah here, who was 90 and on her 90th birthday, this is the clan.</span> <span id="s1012">These are her daughter and two sons, their children, grandchildren and her by that -- by that measure, great-grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1013">What does this picture signify?</span> <span id="s1014">That one man, Uncle Jacob, my mother’s youngest brother, left Europe in 1930.</span> <span id="s1015">One person, of one family, in 1930 and this is -- this is the result of one man’s leaving Europe and not having to go through the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1016">This is the result.</span> <span id="s1017">Can you extend it into -- into more people, if of our family, another five or six or 10?</span> <span id="s1018">My father was one of nine and my mother was one of 10.</span> <span id="s1019">If they had possibly had the foresight to go that -- at that time my Uncle Jacob was a pioneer.</span> <span id="s1020">He was an idealist.</span> <span id="s1021">He went to a kibbutz as a farming, you know, this was idealism.</span> <span id="s1022">And -- and so he went there by conviction.</span> <span id="s1023">Although, he knew what he was running away from, because Poland had had pogroms, he had lived through some of the pogroms in his hometown.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: Wh-What was it like going to your hometown in Vienna, going back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: Traumatic, the first time.</span> <span id="s1026">1970, very traumatic, couldn’t wait to leave.</span> <span id="s1027">I was in Vienna for one week.</span> <span id="s1028">As I describe it in the book, I felt that I was -- when I left Vienna, I felt I was leaving a cemetery.</span> <span id="s1029">See, the hills were there, the buildings were there, the trees were there, but the heart and soul was gone and all those who could have made a difference, namely people and faces and arms clutching you -- that was not there.</span> <span id="s1030">So you -- so you had a -- a very traumatic -- I went back in -- that was 1970.</span> <span id="s1031">I went back in ‘92, that was already different and I went back in ‘96 to Vienna, that was almost -- well, almost reconciled.</span> <span id="s1032">And Flo enjoyed it very much in 1996 also, when we were invited by the Vienna government to come.</span> <span id="s1033">[indecipherable] welcome service.</span> <span id="s1034">This is a sort of a make up to us, you know, in a way.</span> <span id="s1035">But it was very enjoyable, in a way, that I went back to some of the places, took some photos.</span> <span id="s1036">And Flo keeps saying, “You know, I would like to go back to Vienna.”</span> <span id="s1037">And I -- I would go -- I would go back, in fact I -- I have a cousin who still lives there.</span> <span id="s1038">She’s about my age, about a year younger.</span> <span id="s1039">But will we or won’t we, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1040">I believe we will.</span> <span id="s1041">I would like to retrace my steps in France, where I -- mainly -- which is mainly the -- the -- the locale of -- of the book and I maybe -- maybe I get some interviews on -- on the -- on some of the radio shows and I can really promote it.</span> <span id="s1042">I would like the schools to get that book.</span> <span id="s1043">That was -- would be my major -- it’s not -- this is not what you might call a -- a money-maker.</span> <span id="s1044">The book will sell for 16.95, a hard back.</span> <span id="s1045">And they’re working on the layout now, with all im -- with all the -- the cover and so on, so forth.</span> <span id="s1046">But, I would like it to be accepted in -- in schools as a -- as a learning text and also as an encouragement to some of the young people, not to give up when things go badly and stick to it.</span> <span id="s1047">Because I -- in the face of adversity, I -- I did not give up and I think escaping from a train is probably a -- a great form of resistance.</span> <span id="s1048">And there’s not many that did that.</span> <span id="s1049">Because we were going to hell, straight to hell.</span> <span id="s1050">So that was 19 -- I said 1970 - 1992 -1996, we went back.</span> <span id="s1051">And I would like to, as I said, go back again.</span> <span id="s1052">If you want to know any more details about -- there was not much there.</span> <span id="s1053">I -- I roamed through the streets of Vienna, went back to the synagogue, which was no longer there, where I was Bar Mitzvahed.</span> <span id="s1054">This is now an apartment building and it has a plaque outside, designating it as a scene of a conflagration, destroyed by the Nazi hordes.</span> <span id="s1055">It’s an apartment building.</span> <span id="s1056">So I’m watching this and I’m reading this and a lady coming out of the house, this building, she sees us and she says, “Can I help you in any way?</span> <span id="s1057">Looking for anything?”</span> <span id="s1058">I said, “No, this is the place that I went to say my prayers when I lived in this area.”</span> <span id="s1059">“Oh, oh.”</span> <span id="s1060">And she walked away, because she’s now a tenant in that place.</span> <span id="s1061">And then steps back for one moment and she says, “I want you to know, we are living on a holy ground here.”</span> <span id="s1062">So she admitted that to herself, that this used to be a synagogue and to her, her apartment building is -- has been erected on holy ground, you know.</span> <span id="s1063">The Austrians are 99.9 Catholics.</span> <span id="s1064">And I knew -- probably knew just as much about Catholicism when I lived in Austria as I knew about my own religion.</span> <span id="s1065">But that’s what it was, that was the reaction there.</span> <span id="s1066">Others were nice and -- and forthcoming.</span> <span id="s1067">There were other people who were standoffish and didn’t want to hear about it.</span> <span id="s1068">And in 1970 -- that was ‘96, I’m there talking about, but in 1970 when we were there first, I walked into a store to buy stamps and I said, “How much are stamps for America?”</span> <span id="s1069">“Oh,” she said, “you’re American?”</span> <span id="s1070">I says -- End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: I walked into a store to buy stamps and I said, “How much are stamps for America?”</span> <span id="s1072">“Oh,” she said, “you’re American?”</span> <span id="s1073">I says, “Yes, but I was born in Vienna.”</span> <span id="s1074">And I said that to her in German.</span> <span id="s1075">I have a cousin who wouldn’t want to honor them with German, she’s so upset, she’s -- she will never talk German.</span> <span id="s1076">But I talked in German, “Yeah, but I was born in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1077">I’m from America, but I was born in Vienna.”</span> <span id="s1078">“Well, so not everybody did get killed, that’s -- that’s fortunate.”</span> <span id="s1079">Then she added that’s fortunate, you know.</span> <span id="s1080">I mean, she didn’t have to say not everybody got killed.</span> <span id="s1081">I should have ask her, “How many really survived?”</span> <span id="s1082">And if we survived, it wasn’t due to your efforts.</span> <span id="s1083">It was due to my effort.</span> <span id="s1084">Cause if you had it your way, we would not have survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: How do you think your efforts of -- of doing what you had to do, you know, using your wits, using fear, using whatever motivating factor you had during the war to -- to survive.</span> <span id="s1086">How -- how did it make you what you are or how did you -- how did it shape you and what impact did it have on your -- on the rest of your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: Well, my wife will tell you that when I hi -- when I am on the road in the car and I hear a siren in the back of me, I think they’re after me.</span> <span id="s1088">And I’m also not one to give up, even in present life.</span> <span id="s1089">When I’m looking for something, when I’m on the road looking for something.</span> <span id="s1090">When I’m trying to find something in the house, when I’m trying to -- to correct something.</span> <span id="s1091">I’m not one to give up easily.</span> <span id="s1092">I s -- I -- I stick to it.</span> <span id="s1093">You lose something, I -- I -- I -- I trace back the steps that I’ve been to.</span> <span id="s1094">I go and look again and look again.</span> <span id="s1095">My wife would misplace something, I would say, “Well why don’t you look here?”</span> <span id="s1096">“No, I looked there.”</span> <span id="s1097">“Why don’t you look again?”</span> <span id="s1098">And then she says, “Would you believe it?</span> <span id="s1099">I’m glad you told me, I found it here now.”</span> <span id="s1100">And -- and the same thing with my kids sometime and I -- I -- I -- I just don’t give up too easily.</span> <span id="s1101">And in fact, when we had escaped from the train, I told my friend, “You know, 30 years from now -- 30 years from now -- we will be talking about this like it’s a dream.”</span> <span id="s1102">He says, “How can you think of 30 years from now?”</span> <span id="s1103">he said.</span> <span id="s1104">“You don’t even know what’s going to happen three hours from now.</span> <span id="s1105">We have no papers, we have no --” I said, “You know, now that we have escaped from that train, I don’t think anything will prevent me from surviving the war.”</span> <span id="s1106">Because that situation was such an extreme situation that I think I will never be presented with another situation that could be that extreme.</span> <span id="s1107">And I made all the efforts possible, never to get back to Drancy again.</span> <span id="s1108">That’s where I escape from another train, you know.</span> <span id="s1109">This -- I -- I -- a couple of train escapes.</span> <span id="s1110">You saw that, probably, in my write up of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: Yeah, I was going to say you’re -- you -- you call yourself the ghost of Auschwitz, I was going to say the Holocaust Houdini.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: Maybe something like that.</span> <span id="s1113">Maybe.</span> <span id="s1114">Some people say that, too.</span> <span id="s1115">Yes, I had several escapes.</span> <span id="s1116">I had a escape from the gendarmes after my trial, they caught me back.</span> <span id="s1117">Caught me like -- to -- after a couple days and I served two days extra in jail for that.</span> <span id="s1118">Was added to my sentence, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: Are there other sounds or smells that remind you?</span> <span id="s1120">You said the sirens sometimes get you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: Well, farm smells, yes.</span> <span id="s1122">When I’m going to the farms.</span> <span id="s1123">When we used to go on trips through the farm, in the country with the kids, and the open window, the odor came in from the -- manure odor.</span> <span id="s1124">Th-Th-Th-The smell of stables -- smell of stables was very reminiscent to me, because I spent one night -- the second night after my escape, sleeping between two cows that were chewing their cud.</span> <span id="s1125">And that is a very reminiscing feeling to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Q: I think you describe it as a perfume, cows [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">A: Where did you -- did you [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: I think that’s in your memoirs, no?</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: I-Is it in the -- in the memoirs or is it perhaps in -- did you listen to my interview with the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: Maybe that was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: -- the transcript of the interview --</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: That might have been it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: -- that I did with Linda -- Linda Cosmac.</span> <span id="s1134">Dr. Cosmac, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: Mm-hm, might have been.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: Hold it for a second --</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: Let me show you something.</span> <span id="s1139">Read this book about Vienna and I told you before about this lady in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1140">You know how they can be very charming and so, but then they come with that big -- there was a playwright in Vienna, by name of Nestroy -- N-e-s-t-r-o-y.</span> <span id="s1141">Nestroy wrote satirical plays.</span> <span id="s1142">And he always poked fun, as well as of himself -- o-of other people, also of him -- of himself.</span> <span id="s1143">He poked fun and in this little chapter, in this book about Vienna.</span> <span id="s1144">It’s called, “Vienna, my Vienna.”</span> <span id="s1145">“In his masterpiece, Judith and Holofs -- Holofernese, Nestroy attacked” -- he always attacked people, see -- “attacked another cherished Viennese institution, anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s1146">By the brilliant device,” that -- that’s where he was so brilliant with -- “of disguising Viennese characters as Jews and holding the Jews up for laughter while actually exposing the Viennese for their weakness and meanness, their outward charm and lack of inner conviction.”</span> <span id="s1147">In the 1850’s, very funny plays, we used -- when we were kids we used to go to Nestroy’s plays, you know.</span> <span id="s1148">He -- he had a play that was called -- the vaschwenda, “The Spendthrift”.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: How -- how do you think your -- your wartime experience has affected your spirituality?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: You mean religiously?</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: Religiously.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: I was always traditionally very much involved with -- with Judaism, but I was never a -- practicing in the Orthodox way, although I relate more to the Orthodox mood, because that’s the synagogue I went to in Vienna, than to the Conservative or the -- the Reform.</span> <span id="s1153">But I was more traditional in keeping the holidays.</span> <span id="s1154">That’s -- was my mother -- my father wasn’t that way, my mother was in that way, very much devoted to the -- to the tradition, background.</span> <span id="s1155">I have never failed in my -- in my feelings as -- as a Jew.</span> <span id="s1156">Nothing to do with religion, it has to do with my background, my cultural inclination, my feeling about the -- the ethics of Judaism, due -- because our religion goes by the rela -- by the relation with man.</span> <span id="s1157">Between man and man, not with man and God, because if you do good by your fellow man, you do good by God.</span> <span id="s1158">We don’t have a middle man, but I was never a very practicing Jew.</span> <span id="s1159">We raised the kids as Jews, with some of the Sabbath meals and the candles and taking the holidays and [inaudible], my son was Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s1160">But not in the Orthodox sense.</span> <span id="s1161">Often -- often, my wife and I talk and we say we wish we could have really been stronger involved in -- in religious venues.</span> <span id="s1162">Although the holidays are kept.</span> <span id="s1163">I never worked on a Jewish holiday.</span> <span id="s1164">I made it a point not to.</span> <span id="s1165">And I wanted to maintain that.</span> <span id="s1166">When a -- when -- on Passover, I am very strict about not eating bread, because again, it’s a -- it’s perhaps a symbolism, but it makes me what I am.</span> <span id="s1167">And I’m thinking of my mother, who said, “You take along your religious articles.”</span> <span id="s1168">You know, the phylacteries and the tallith and the prayer shawl.</span> <span id="s1169">They got damaged when I swam through the river.</span> <span id="s1170">But she wanted me to, because -- “it will remind you of who you are.</span> <span id="s1171">Never forget who you are, because if you forget, there’ll come a time when somebody will remind you of it.”</span> <span id="s1172">And if the Nazis could remind us, at the end of a gun, who we are, certainly we owe it to ourselves to know who we are without -- without the gun.</span> <span id="s1173">And that is the -- that is probably what motivates me to be a Jew.</span> <span id="s1174">I never shied away from -- from saying it or from admitting it.</span> <span id="s1175">“You Jewish?”</span> <span id="s1176">“Of course, who isn’t?”</span> <span id="s1177">That’s what I would say.</span> <span id="s1178">I come back with that.</span> <span id="s1179">We went to -- on a cruise in February, we went to Jamaica.</span> <span id="s1180">My ca -- the fellow that drove the -- drove the jitney, that -- that little, you know, that little bus that they had for us, turns around, to me, “Are you Jewish?”</span> <span id="s1181">Said, “Yes, I am, but what difference does it make?”</span> <span id="s1182">“Oh,” he says, “you are --” Oh, I could have given -- I couldn’t have given him a check, because I didn’t have -- I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s1183">I -- I said, “You--” “You Jewish?”</span> <span id="s1184">I said, “Yes, wh-wh-why you asking that?”</span> <span id="s1185">“Well, over the ages, your people have been punished.”</span> <span id="s1186">And he gives me a lecture on Jesus.</span> <span id="s1187">The Jamaicans are very religious, they’re very Christian.</span> <span id="s1188">Then when we got to that place where he took us, at a vantage point like a -- a vista, I took him like on the side and I said, “Why did you ask me that?</span> <span id="s1189">Why did that make any difference?”</span> <span id="s1190">And I said to him, “Do you know if Christ came back on earth today and he came to Jamaica --” Oh, I ask him, “Is there a synagogue in Jamaica?”</span> <span id="s1191">“Oh, yes, in Kingston.</span> <span id="s1192">It’s one of the oldest in the west.”</span> <span id="s1193">I said, “You see, if Christ were coming back today to Jamaica, he would look for that synagogue to go to, not to your church.”</span> <span id="s1194">I had to come back to him some -- somehow.</span> <span id="s1195">I said, “We are all -- we are all the same.</span> <span id="s1196">Christ was Jewish.”</span> <span id="s1197">I had to give this man a lesson.</span> <span id="s1198">Why did he pick -- why did he pick on me?</span> <span id="s1199">You know, people never actually -- not knowingly, take me for Jewish.</span> <span id="s1200">They think I am Lebanese, Greek, Italian, what else -- South American.</span> <span id="s1201">Because of my coloration maybe, my skin color.</span> <span id="s1202">“But, what difference does it make,” I told him.</span> <span id="s1203">And, “Yes I am.”</span> <span id="s1204">I will never deny it.</span> <span id="s1205">But my spirituality -- it’s often this way, if you are -- if you are just a little bit inclined to be who you are, as a Jew, for instance and -- and a catastrophe comes, it can easily extinguish it.</span> <span id="s1206">But if you have a strong feeling about it and a catastrophe comes, it’ll reinforce you.</span> <span id="s1207">Because you want to prove, I have survived.</span> <span id="s1208">It’s like again the metaphor with the wind and the flame.</span> <span id="s1209">if you have a very small flame, and a harsh -- a strong wind blows, it’ll blow out the flame.</span> <span id="s1210">If you have a big flame and a wind blows, it’ll enlarge the flame, you see?</span> <span id="s1211">But, being that I have been persecuted as a Jew, I think it’s a duty to be committed as a Jew for the rest of my life.</span> <span id="s1212">Because they wanted me to be gone and I have survived and if I am not what I am and show what I am, I’m giving them a victory.</span> <span id="s1213">That would be posthumous victory, wouldn’t it?</span> <span id="s1214">If I say, no, I want to give up my Judaism, that’s all that Hitler would want.</span> <span id="s1215">Hey, take Isaac Bashivasinger, the writer.</span> <span id="s1216">The Yiddish language was supposed to have been obliterated.</span> <span id="s1217">And they were supposed to brag about that later, what they did to that culture.</span> <span id="s1218">And there he comes and writes and wins the Nobel Prize for literature, writing in the Yiddish language.</span> <span id="s1219">If Hitler had been alive then, he would have committed suicide again.</span> <span id="s1220">Because this language was no -- was not supposed to have survived.</span> <span id="s1221">So that is what you call it, a vindication.</span> <span id="s1222">A -- an assertion.</span> <span id="s1223">You’re here, you live and one of the phrases that the Jews always sing in the song and you may have heard that in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1224">Have you heard Im Israelhaim?</span> <span id="s1225">The Jewish people who lives is alive.</span> <span id="s1226">The word chaim means life.</span> <span id="s1227">And you may be Jewish even.</span> <span id="s1228">Are you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: No, you’re not.</span> <span id="s1231">All right.</span> <span id="s1232">What business is it?</span> <span id="s1233">Why do you ask that?</span> <span id="s1234">But you know -- yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: Do you have friends who were survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1237">Quite a few, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">Q: Is there a connection that you have with -- that you -- that you -- you could never really -- never really feel with people who aren’t survivors?</span> <span id="s1239">Is there a commonality?</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: There is a commonality, but I am just as often more comfortable with people who are not survivors.</span> <span id="s1241">We -- I have friends who are survivors, who have become -- in social matters, very -- what I call callous.</span> <span id="s1242">Not what I would say as Jews we should be.</span> <span id="s1243">Even to the point of some of my friends saying, “W-We really should do something about the immigration laws.”</span> <span id="s1244">These are survivors.</span> <span id="s1245">“We really should do something about so and so.”</span> <span id="s1246">Whether it’s the blacks.</span> <span id="s1247">I prefer a fella who is not a survivor and lives by -- by the rules of -- of -- of good human mankind, rather than [indecipherable] I mean there’s -- some of the survivors are -- I -- I -- I have only a connection because -- because we belong to a same survivors group or -- or we belong to a -- to an organization that’s the -- the Holocaust ca -- com -- mem -- Holocaust Memorial -- not Memorial -- commemorative -- council of -- the Baltimore Jewish Council Ho-Holocaust Remembrance Committee.</span> <span id="s1248">Holocaust Remembrance Committee, so we -- we do often go together on panels and speak to classes.</span> <span id="s1249">But I have a lot of friends who are -- this fellow here that just called me and so many others that -- that I am -- that I’m just as comfortable, often more comfortable than with survivors.</span> <span id="s1250">Because with survivors, they’re -- often the -- the conversation turns on those -- on those subjects, you know.</span> <span id="s1251">We have one lady that unfortunately is very ill, who when-whenever you see her, it has to be that subject to be talked about and it weighs on her day and night to the point where she is probably unstable mentally because of that.</span> <span id="s1252">But that’s -- that’s -- that can happen, but I -- as I say, I feel I can acclimate in -- in -- in my surroundings and feel comfortable both ways or uncomfortable both ways.</span> <span id="s1253">That’s -- depends on the situation, the person and the -- and the personality.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: One thing about the perfume -- stable perfume and the cows --</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: When you smell -- when -- you said you took drives out in the country with your family and you smelled the -- the stables, what feeling did that evoke?</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: It’s good feelings.</span> <span id="s1258">Feelings of -- of being sheltered, feeling good.</span> <span id="s1259">Viscerally invigorating.</span> <span id="s1260">Because, I slept between two cows, after -- the -- the second night after my escape and I felt that nobody can find me and I heard them chew the cud and the odor was so nice, I felt I’ve pro-protected.</span> <span id="s1261">I was in -- in goo -- in a good surrounding and peaceful.</span> <span id="s1262">Pastoral.</span> <span id="s1263">Nice.</span> <span id="s1264">Like -- like hearing a -- a -- a nice melody play or something like that.</span> <span id="s1265">Yeah, it’s -- it’s a -- it’s a good reminiscence.</span> <span id="s1266">I call it Chanel 65 or something like that.</span> <span id="s1267">Yes, it’s -- it’s -- it’s -- it -- it brings back -- it brings back the memories -- just like the buckets that overflowed in the car, bring back the other olfactory senses of -- of despair.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: The buckets?</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: In -- in the cattle car.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: That flowed over.</span> <span id="s1272">That overflowed.</span> <span id="s1273">We used it to -- to relieve ourselves.</span> <span id="s1274">That was one bucket for 50 people, now you imagine that.</span> <span id="s1275">That brings back despair.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: The smell of outhouses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: Yes, was putrid.</span> <span id="s1278">Awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q: You call yourself a g -- a ghost of Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">A: Who called me that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q: I thought you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">A: I was never in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Q: Well, then you’d never -- then you never -- you -- you escaped it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A: Yeah, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: Th-Th-Therefore you were a ghost, you never --</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: Yeah, I never got -- yeah, I was a -- a would be -- a would be Auschwitz internee or victim in the book -- in the book of the deportations of Jews.</span> <span id="s1287">I am listed as one who was gassed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: That’s right, I wanted you to talk about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: Because I do not have an asterisk next to my name.</span> <span id="s1290">Because I wasn’t in France to have an input when the book was printed.</span> <span id="s1291">My friend with whom I escaped has an asterisk next to his name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">Q: So the official record shows --</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">A: Shows me as one that died in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1294">In that book.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">Q: And you saw that book when you went back to France?</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">A: No, no, no, I -- I saw it here when my friend Herbie Freedman, who lived then in Norfolk, got it from a cousin in France and I looked it -- I looked into it and found my name in there.</span> <span id="s1297">I had shivers run down my spine.</span> <span id="s1298">Then my aunt sent me one from Paris.</span> <span id="s1299">That was the book, yeah, that’s -- that is -- has to [inaudible] -- has my name in it and my date, where I was born and my name is actually misspelled and -- B-r-e-h-o-l-z.</span> <span id="s1300">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: How old were you when you saw that?</span> <span id="s1302">What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">A: In ‘78.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Q: In ‘78.</span> <span id="s1305">And you said it made shivers run down your spine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A: Yes, absolutely.</span> <span id="s1307">Absolutely, it was -- was a realization.</span> <span id="s1308">I’m here, but in the book I’m -- I’m -- I’m a victim, you know.</span> <span id="s1309">I was then -- that was ‘78, I was 56 years old then.</span> <span id="s1310">I’m -- I’m now 77.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q: I -- I -- I don’t have many more questions.</span> <span id="s1312">I don’t know if there’s something --</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">A: Well, that’s good.</span> <span id="s1314">And you know what?</span> <span id="s1315">You may have some questions, but I may not even have any more answers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: Do you have anything that you wanted to say that I didn’t ask you about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: No, you have the questions and as I said, my life is -- was rather uneventful after -- after I came here, except for the trips, and the reminiscences and -- and no major achievements.</span> <span id="s1318">You’ll have some people that will wind up to be professors and teachers and -- and -- and big businessman and inventors and scientists.</span> <span id="s1319">I’m just here and I’m alive and I’m glad I’m alive and -- and I’m happy with what I am and what I have.</span> <span id="s1320">And if that is a matter of being at ease, so be it.</span> <span id="s1321">There are probably some things that -- that I would have done differently if I had -- had different opportunities perhaps.</span> <span id="s1322">I would have studied people.</span> <span id="s1323">My wife says, “Leo, you sh -- could have been in law, you could have been teaching.”</span> <span id="s1324">And some people tell me I could have been teaching, because I speak to schools and get that reaction.</span> <span id="s1325">But then again, it was -- it wasn’t and in hindsight, I am alive and that’s more than -- than I can say for my mother and sisters and of course so many, many, many others.</span> <span id="s1326">I lost over 30 members of my family.</span> <span id="s1327">But, if being alive is an achievement, so I have achieved something.</span> <span id="s1328">And if being alive is just run of the mill -- what everybody does.</span> <span id="s1329">They get born, they live and they’re alive and then some of them die, sooner or later.</span> <span id="s1330">So I have -- I have my -- my life as it is and try to relax and sometime it’s a little hard, when you worry -- worry sometime about -- you know, now you worry -- that you’re a grandfather, you worry about your grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1331">And I guess, as long as your alive, that’s part of it.</span> <span id="s1332">It wouldn’t be -- it wouldn’t be all that challenging if you didn’t have something to -- to be concerned with, you know.</span> <span id="s1333">You always want the best for -- for your grandchildren, so you -- from time to time you worry, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: Has your health been good?</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">A: My health’s been -- I -- I would say, yes it’s been good.</span> <span id="s1336">I have a slight case of angina and I’m on medication, but we’ve been talking and I’ve kept up with it, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q: Yeah, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: The emotions sometime get a little bit ahold of me and perhaps you noticed that and I can’t help that.</span> <span id="s1339">That’s again part of -- of the make up, you know, as I said, there was a book written in the 50’s, “You Are What You Eat.”</span> <span id="s1340">And in your emotions and in your emotional make up, you are the sum total of your life’s experiences.</span> <span id="s1341">So that is one thing that is part of me and I’m coping pretty much with it.</span> <span id="s1342">[indecipherable] friends are coming here at five o’clock.</span> <span id="s1343">In fact, we are going to a dinner theater tonight, so I’m going to enjoy myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: Do you feel as though you’ve led a blessed life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: Well, I feel that I’m probably married to the best woman in the world.</span> <span id="s1346">I have my children and grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1347">I have been very lucky.</span> <span id="s1348">Very, very lucky.</span> <span id="s1349">If not for that night on the sixth of November, 1942, we would not be sitting here talking to each other.</span> <span id="s1350">So I am very lucky, there is no doubt about it and if you want to call it blessing, which gives it the -- the divine connotation, yes.</span> <span id="s1351">If you want to call it lucky, which is more secular, you call it that.</span> <span id="s1352">And I have a very good friend, Father Gallagher, who writes some very beautiful pieces.</span> <span id="s1353">And he and I have been getting together, Catholic priest who used to be with the archdiocese here.</span> <span id="s1354">And we get together from time to time and we do a little bit of philosophy and we do a little bit of reminiscing and as far as writing and words, we have a lot in common.</span> <span id="s1355">And he just sent me this book.</span> <span id="s1356">That’s the second book he sent me.</span> <span id="s1357">He writes -- he writes free -- free verse poetry and this is Father flan -- Father Gallagher.</span> <span id="s1358">And he writes -- he dedicates it.</span> <span id="s1359">Can you read that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: “For Flo and Leo, with keen admiration, Joe Gallagher.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: And we get together quite often and I -- I have -- talking before, you have Jewish friends?</span> <span id="s1362">Yeah, I have Jewish -- I have a -- a -- a priest who is my friend.</span> <span id="s1363">And we -- we get together and we have our moods and -- and our discussions and very, very nice man.</span> <span id="s1364">And so I’m blessed.</span> <span id="s1365">Yeah, I’m blessed with family, I’m blessed with friends.</span> <span id="s1366">And I’m not averse to using the word blessed.</span> <span id="s1367">Because to be alive, after all, this is -- is basically a blessing and that -- that I -- I to -- I told it yesterday when I spoke to the FBI in the field office here in Baltimore.</span> <span id="s1368">I said, “When I escaped from the train, little would I have thought then that I was going to survive, let alone speaking to one of the wanted law enforcements agencies in the world, telling them how I circumvented the law.”</span> <span id="s1369">But those laws, to me and to many others who could have -- would have done it if they could have, these laws were supposed to be circumvented, because if we didn’t, we wouldn’t survive.</span> <span id="s1370">These were bad laws, done -- instituted by bad people.</span> <span id="s1371">And after that a couple agents came to me and said, “Mr. Bretholz [indecipherable] very interesting and I’ll tell you something.</span> <span id="s1372">You made us feel very bad.”</span> <span id="s1373">“How is that?”</span> <span id="s1374">“You made us feel bad about ourselfs.</span> <span id="s1375">What we can become when we don’t act properly.</span> <span id="s1376">I hope all of those who were here took your -- your talk to heart.</span> <span id="s1377">But we were interesting in how you managed to get away, because we always want to find out how people manage to get away.”</span> <span id="s1378">I said, “Did you find out?”</span> <span id="s1379">I said, “I hope I did not in any way or -- offend you or -- or challenge you with that.”</span> <span id="s1380">“No, no, this was very interesting.”</span> <span id="s1381">I said, “Yes, those laws were so bad that we had to get around them.</span> <span id="s1382">And escaping was against the law.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q: How often do you think about that night, November sixth, 1943 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A: ‘42.</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">Q: How often do you think about that night, November sixth, 1943 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">A: ‘42.</span> <span id="s1388">Quite often.</span> <span id="s1389">I had to -- I could have given you the answer quickly, quite often, but I want to put it into context.</span> <span id="s1390">Every time the sixth of every month runs around, I have an anniversary.</span> <span id="s1391">There’s that yearly anniversary in November.</span> <span id="s1392">But when it’s the sixth of whatever month it is, it always jumps out.</span> <span id="s1393">And there’s another thing, I was born on the sixth of March.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">Q: That’s my mother’s birthday.</span> <span id="s1395">In fact, you were born on the same day as my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">A: ‘21?</span> <span id="s1397">Is your mother 77?</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">A: Well, see -- now look at this.</span> <span id="s1400">Now look at that great coincidence.</span> <span id="s1401">I was born on the sixth of March and every sixth and most of the day -- most of the things that happened to me, most of the events happened in the first 10 days of the month.</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">Q: What do you do on the anniversary, the yearly anniversary, November sixth?</span> <span id="s1403">Do you do anything special?</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: Nothing special.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">A: It’ll be s -- it’ll be 56 years now and when the book comes out, it’ll be the 60th anniversary of Kristallnacht, which is the ninth of November.</span> <span id="s1407">That was the day I crossed into Belgium in 1938.</span> <span id="s1408">And then I’m in touch with that nun that I contacted after the -- after the -- while I was writing my book.</span> <span id="s1409">A nun in whose care I was in the hospital in Limoge when I had a strangulation hernia, on the eighth of May, 1944, it is again the first 10 [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1410">And I woke up -- I woke up in that ward and I was afrai -- I wa -- I had been afraid that I would be recognized as a Jew in that Catholic hospital in Limoge.</span> <span id="s1411">I’m circumcised.</span> <span id="s1412">They don’t do that in France.</span> <span id="s1413">And also false papers and I’m under anesthesia.</span> <span id="s1414">And who knows what can happen while I am -- I’m -- I’m o -- great fear.</span> <span id="s1415">I -- I didn’t want to be taken to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1416">And there’s this voice telling me, “As long as I’m in this ward, you have nothing to fear.”</span> <span id="s1417">And was the voice of Sister Jeanne d’Arc.</span> <span id="s1418">Joan of Arc.</span> <span id="s1419">50 odd years later I wrote to the hospital, if they have a trace of her and they gave me her address where she is now.</span> <span id="s1420">And I’m corresponding with her.</span> <span id="s1421">Just got a card from her this week.</span> <span id="s1422">Joan of Arc.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q: Can you read it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">A: It’s French.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Q: Can you translate?</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: If you don’t mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">A: This is Sister Joan of Arc.</span> <span id="s1429">I had sent her a card for -- I had sent her a card for Pentecost -- for the Pentecost, you know, which is a holiday seven weeks after Easter, which is a Jewish holiday also, we have Passover and Shabouth.</span> <span id="s1430">I sent her a nice flowery card.</span> <span id="s1431">Let’s see how she puts across here.</span> <span id="s1432">She’s in castra, she is now in her 80’s.</span> <span id="s1433">I contacted her.</span> <span id="s1434">And she sends me this -- this little book marker.</span> <span id="s1435">“Pour la metier inexist en neelia neeta, near fontier.”</span> <span id="s1436">French.</span> <span id="s1437">For friendship, no limits, no borders exist.</span> <span id="s1438">She says, “Dear Mr. Bretholz.</span> <span id="s1439">I don’t have the beautiful flowers for you or to -- to thank you -- to thank you for yours.”</span> <span id="s1440">Because I sent her a card with flowers.</span> <span id="s1441">“But I’m only asking that this little barge that is depicted on this post card,” this is a canal in Paris.</span> <span id="s1442">She doesn’t live in Paris, but she -- this is a canal in Paris.</span> <span id="s1443">“That this little barge will cross the ocean and will cross the ocean towards you and you can imagine the distance and the ocean would not prevent it from bringing you my best souvenirs, my best remembrances.</span> <span id="s1444">I’m very touched that you have thought about my situation here.”</span> <span id="s1445">I ask her how are you, are you well taken care of?</span> <span id="s1446">Are you well installed in this home that you are -- Saint Joseph?</span> <span id="s1447">As a nun, she is.</span> <span id="s1448">“Nothing I’m lacking -- I am not lacking -- I am not wanting anything and not for want of anything and the house is very well equipped and I am surrounded by my sisters, of whom some -- some of whom were also nurses with me in the hospital in Limoge in 1944.</span> <span id="s1449">Give my friendships to Madame Bretholz, your wife and your whole family.</span> <span id="s1450">You are always present in my prayer, that God will bless and will keep -- that -- may God bless you and keep you.</span> <span id="s1451">Believe in my -- in the expression of my most sincere friendship.</span> <span id="s1452">Sister Jeanne d’Arc.”</span></p> <p><span
