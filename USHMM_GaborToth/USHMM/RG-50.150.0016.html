I was born in Magdeburg in 1924.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">Q. Where did you start school.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A.</span> <span id="s7">In 1930.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Q. Could you describe your school days.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">A. No, not really anymore.</span> <span id="s10">It was a very progressive school, according to today’s standards, like it is today.</span> <span id="s11">It was an experimental school in Germany.</span> <span id="s12">And in 1933, we left Germany for France.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q. Do you remember this time between 1930 and 1933 when you were in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A. No.</span> <span id="s15">I only remember that the S.A. used to stand in front of my parents’ store and wouldn’t let people in.</span> <span id="s16">My parents decided that’s it.</span> <span id="s17">They don’t want to take this and we left Germany.</span> <span id="s18">Otherwise, I have no recollection of anything - hardship or otherwise.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q.</span> <span id="s20">While you were going to school, did you have many non-Jewish friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s22">I did.</span> <span id="s23">It really didn’t make any difference.</span> <span id="s24">I was aware of being Jewish.</span> <span id="s25">I had a Jewish upbringing but I had just as many non-Jewish as Jewish friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q. Can you remember any change in the attitude of your non-Jewish friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A. No.</span> <span id="s28">Not at that age.</span> <span id="s29">It’s too young at that point.</span> <span id="s30">When you are seven or eight, you don’t feel that.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q.</span> <span id="s32">When you say the S.A. stood in front of your parents’ business, what type of business were they in.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A. My father was a wholesale and retail tobacconist, you know, cigars, cigarettes.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q.</span> <span id="s35">When you saw the S.A. standing there, what kind of impression did you have.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A. I really can’t say.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q. Do you remember any discussions about the situation at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A. Well, we all hoped that it wouldn’t last but my father didn’t want to take a chance on waiting so we left Germany and went to Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q.</span> <span id="s40">How did you feel about leaving.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A. I don’t think it bothered me too much.</span> <span id="s42">I think it was exciting in a way.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q.</span> <span id="s44">Did you know why you were leaving.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A. Oh yes.</span> <span id="s46">That I was fully aware of.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q.</span> <span id="s48">When you went to Paris, how long did you stay there.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A.</span> <span id="s50">A year and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q.</span> <span id="s52">Did your father have business connections there.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A. Well, this is the first disappointment.</span> <span id="s54">You know in France, at that time you could only establish your own business.</span> <span id="s55">You couldn’t get a working permit.</span> <span id="s56">So he went into business with three other people and unfortunately, one of them was a crook and all the money was gone before the business got started like happened to many refugees there.</span> <span id="s57">It was rather an interesting life because the refugee community lived as such - it was quite different from the way it was here in America.</span> <span id="s58">You lived somewhere and you ate somewhere else - everybody together - everybody was in the same boat and you met some interesting people at the time.</span> <span id="s59">Even as a child, I realized that.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q.</span> <span id="s61">Did you go to school in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A. Yes, I went to school, quite a well known school, and I went without knowing any French at the time but as a child, I picked it up rather fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q.</span> <span id="s64">Did you go to school with other German refugee children.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A. No.</span> <span id="s66">No.</span> <span id="s67">I was the only one in my class.</span> <span id="s68">It was quite interesting and I enjoyed France.</span> <span id="s69">I enjoyed staying there and during the summer, my parents sent me to a camp run by the Salvation Army where I stood out like a sore thumb because I was the only refugee.</span> <span id="s70">My French wasn’t too good yet but I survived it.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q. Were you made to feel as a refugee.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s73">Not as a refugee but rather as somebody different.</span> <span id="s74">Children are pretty cruel when it comes to that but I enjoyed living in France and I was sorry when we left.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q.</span> <span id="s76">Why did your parents decide to go back to Germany - it was 1935.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A. Well, my grandparents were still living in Germany and some of the other family members and they all wrote it cannot last and it’s not so bad.</span> <span id="s78">So we went back.</span> <span id="s79">My father originally wanted to go to America right then and there but mother wasn’t so much in favor so we went back.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q.</span> <span id="s81">Did you go back to Magdeburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A. No, we went back to Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q. Was your father able to reestablish a business in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A. No.</span> <span id="s85">He became a salesman for a cigar manufacturer and everything was more or less all right for the first couple of years but then...You know, I went right away to a restricted jewish school and that’s where I stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q. Was that by choice at the time or already mandated.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A.</span> <span id="s88">The children that were at that time already in non-Jewishschool, they could stay but it was already a border line thing and it was advisable to start right away.</span> <span id="s89">The Jewish schools were being established.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q.</span> <span id="s91">Did your family belong to a congregation in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s93">That’s where I went to school.</span> <span id="s94">They had a school at the same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q.</span> <span id="s96">What type of congregation was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A.</span> <span id="s98">It was considered liberal.</span> <span id="s99">It had an organ and it had a choir but it was not reform.</span> <span id="s100">It was I would say a little bit like the Tabernacle.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q.</span> <span id="s102">When you were in this school, were you able to make any non-Jewish friends from the neighborhood or</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A.</span> <span id="s104">At that point, it was a strictly Jewish community and from that school which was like grammar school, I went to a middle school which was also Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q.</span> <span id="s106">Did you feel in any way restricted in those years.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A. Yes, to a certain extent.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q.</span> <span id="s109">How so.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A. Well, because you only lived with Jewish people.</span> <span id="s111">You were aware of it.</span> <span id="s112">From 1935 to 1938 was only three years and it went very fast.</span> <span id="s113">You couldn’t go to certain places anymore and you felt quite restricted already.</span> <span id="s114">Certain cafe houses you could only go - I mean you made sure you only went to certain places.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q.</span> <span id="s116">Did you ever try to go to a movie or anyplace which displayed a sign...</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A.</span> <span id="s118">A sign.</span> <span id="s119">No.</span> <span id="s120">Ii wouldn’t go.</span> <span id="s121">But in 1935 and 1936, there were no signs yet.</span> <span id="s122">It started I think late 1937 and 1938.</span> <span id="s123">Then it was mandatory.</span> <span id="s124">But up to that point, there were not many signs - not in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q. Do you remember your parents discussing emigration again during those years.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A. Oh yes.</span> <span id="s127">Only we were not so fortunate.</span> <span id="s128">Whatever we tried, to come to America, you had to have an affidavit and it was not very easy.</span> <span id="s129">Naturally, you tried to dig up whoever we had - remote family but somehow it didn’t work.</span> <span id="s130">And then we tried Chile and we tried whatever there was and I was supposed to go with a children’s transport to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s131">My luggage went but I didn’t.</span> <span id="s132">At the last minute, I guess it was revoked.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q.</span> <span id="s134">Did you know about these plans to go on a childrens' transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A. Oh Yes.</span> <span id="s136">I mean children at that time were not children.</span> <span id="s137">They became adults very fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q.</span> <span id="s139">You were only 13 years old, how did you feel about leaving everyone and going on a childrens' transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A. Well, since I had family in Switzerland and I knew the country, it was not such a - hoping for my parents to be able to follow.</span> <span id="s141">It was a common thing to be done so you really didn’t question.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q.</span> <span id="s143">When you say the common thing, did you notice many children around you leaving.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A. Oh yes.</span> <span id="s145">In the school you didn’t learn much anymore at that point.</span> <span id="s146">The thing you learned was geography and what country is the best country to emigrate to and what are the possibilities to establish a business or make money and these kind of things.</span> <span id="s147">What kind of people are there and how do they respond to the Jewish people - these were the uppermost things of interest and languages.</span> <span id="s148">Outside of that, the interest was not too great in anything.</span> <span id="s149">We were taught everything but somehow your mind was occupied with other things.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q. Was there a great deal of discussion among your friends who had already decided to go to wherever as to what life would be like.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A.</span> <span id="s152">We really didn’t anticipate anything.</span> <span id="s153">You couldn’t envision it but it was the normal thing to talk about emigration and hoping to get out, where and how.</span> <span id="s154">On the other hand, you tried to live as normal a life as a child will.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q.</span> <span id="s156">When you went out into the streets, did you ever have any contact with the SS or...</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A. No.</span> <span id="s158">Since we came to Berlin rather late, we only had Jewish friends but people who used to live there still had their non-Jewish friends who little by little fell by the wayside.</span> <span id="s159">Some were afraid, some changed their mind.</span> <span id="s160">Some betrayed them, some stuck to them.</span> <span id="s161">But all in all, it was strictly a Jewish...</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q.</span> <span id="s163">Did your parents participate in Kulturbund activities.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s165">Not as active members but as an audience to go to the shows.</span> <span id="s166">That was the only thing there was of interest and a couple of movies until 1938 when it was all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q.</span> <span id="s168">When you lived in Magdeburg, did your parents also attend the cultural affairs offered.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A. Oh yes.</span> <span id="s170">But not Jewish ones.</span> <span id="s171">Whatever there was, concerts, operas.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q. Do you remember your parents thinking that this was a hardship - being restricted.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A. Well, I think events happened so fast that you were not really thinking about the past - rather about the future.</span> <span id="s174">There was always the fear of being arrested or sent to a concentration camp and it was a life that was not quite real.</span> <span id="s175">You lived a suspended kind of a life - you lived from day to day.</span> <span id="s176">You really didn’t think back because everyday, there were new rules and new regulations and you lived for that - not of that but with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q.</span> <span id="s178">How did your father fare in his job.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A.</span> <span id="s180">He traveled still and after a while he couldn’t travel anymore.</span> <span id="s181">So then, like most men, they tried to make a living somehow within Berlin and it was a very difficult thing and then you lived on your money that you had.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q.</span> <span id="s183">Did his company...</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A.</span> <span id="s185">It was a Jewish company originally and then it was Arisiert and that was the end of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q.</span> <span id="s187">What happened to your family on Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A. Well, actually we didn’t know too much about it until the next morning when I wanted to go to school or I rather went to school with my girlfriend and we saw all the stores smashed - all the windows and then we were sent home and we realized what happened.</span> <span id="s189">If I remember correctly, we didn’t have a radio anymore because Jews were not allowed to have phonographs, no radios, no pets and certainly no jewelry or silver.</span> <span id="s190">That had to be declared or rather you could keep one set of forks and knives per person and that was it.</span> <span id="s191">But the biggest hardship was that you couldn’t have a radio.</span> <span id="s192">You had no communication with the outside world.</span> <span id="s193">You couldn’t hear what England would say or anybody else.</span> <span id="s194">I guess that was the purpose of it and all right, you bought newspapers but they only reported whatever they wanted to but word of mouth got around very fast and you found out the horrors that were happening and they were arresting people.</span> <span id="s195">Even before that, they arrested, I think it was before, they arrested all Jewish men of Polish or Russian descent and I had a lot of friends and when they were sent back to Poland, the families could after a while join them but you never heard from them anymore.</span> <span id="s196">So we all became prepared for what might happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q. Was your father arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A. No.</span> <span id="s199">We were fortunate - he didn’t get hurt in any way and from that moment on, you tried even harder to get out and for us, it was impossible.</span> <span id="s200">Whatever we tried, you know some people were lucky and got out and others didn’t.</span> <span id="s201">Like we were supposed to be on this one ship that was returned.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q. St. Louis?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A. Yes, but luckily we were not on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q. I don’t know that you remember this, but how did your father go about finding ways to emigrate.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A. I think it was an effort that was done by friends together.</span> <span id="s206">Nobody did it on their own - you couldn’t.</span> <span id="s207">You discussed and talked and tried and there was an organization - Hilfsverein - they tried to help but...Then in 1938, the Jewish schools got closed.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q. Were you allowed to go back to school after Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A. No.</span> <span id="s210">Then they were closed.</span> <span id="s211">So without school and I was rather young - there was still a Jewish fashion school around so I went to that and that closed after six months.</span> <span id="s212">For a young girl to hang around the house and not to do anything is not very good so through non-Jewish friends, there was a dressmaker who was willing to take me in against little money and she taught me the business a little.</span> <span id="s213">You know it was not official - it couldn’t be.</span> <span id="s214">Since I wasn’t looking too Jewish and she wasn’t afraid and she was - the girls who were working for her were all right so I was occupied for another six months and then I couldn’t go - once you had to wear the yellow star, that was the end of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q.</span> <span id="s216">When you mention the yellow star, you were about 15, how did you feel when you were given...</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A. Well, I think that was one of the worst things that could happen because it took your dignity away to be marked and I don’t know if anybody told you that they had to be sewn on with such small stitches that you could not put a pencil between the stitches.</span> <span id="s218">Because somehow when people are in trouble you find all kinds of tricks to make things a little easier.</span> <span id="s219">Sometimes you sewed it on with large stitches - there was a reason you wanted to visit an old non-Jewish friend or something - you just pulled out a thread in order to remove it quickly but they were aware of all these tricks.</span> <span id="s220">Or you placed it - you know they had to be placed at a certain spot inches were given - so that you couldn’t hide it with a pocketbook or with a package or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q. Do you remember sewing it on.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A. Oh yes.</span> <span id="s223">Do you want to see it?</span> <span id="s224">As a matter of fact, we saved it when we went underground, we put it inside our coat lining so that we would have it afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q. Do you remember going out with it the first time.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A. I really don’t.</span> <span id="s227">I think there were more important things that bothered you.</span> <span id="s228">It certainly wasn’t a comfortable feeling.</span> <span id="s229">At that time my father had to go and work - forced labor in an ammunition factory and I was fortunate enough because I was able to sew to be able to go to a shoe factory instead of - you know by choice, where I knew people.</span> <span id="s230">We had a Jewish division.</span> <span id="s231">It was originally a Jewish company and the sons were half Jewish so they could manipulate this thing and they had a Jewish division and I worked there after some trial and error so life was a little easier.</span> <span id="s232">At that point I had to travel by subway and only people who worked were allowed to use public transportation and you were not allowed to sit down so in the subway I was leaning against one of those fire hydrants which they all had - half sitting and half leaning and I fell asleep.</span> <span id="s233">It was six o’clock in the morning so they made a big stink about it - that a Jewish girl would dare to sit down.</span> <span id="s234">These were the harrassments that you went through.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q. Were you subjected to any physical harrassments while you were working.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A.</span> <span id="s237">This was actually the only one which I went through personally.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q.</span> <span id="s239">You mentioned a Jewish division.</span> <span id="s240">How did this work.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A.</span> <span id="s242">You had to be partitioned off like lepers.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q. Were you under constant supervision.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s245">But this was a factory with its workers from years back when it was still Jewish so the attitude of the workers there and the top management was pro-Jewish.</span> <span id="s246">They tried to protect us as long as possible.</span> <span id="s247">So there was no problem there but they couldn’t sustain themselves anymore and they closed up.</span> <span id="s248">And I was lucky again and got to a mattress factory.</span> <span id="s249">I learned to make inner spring mattresses from A to Z and again the owner was very pro-Jewish - rather the son in law whereas the old man was a Nazi and this son in law helped the Jewish people in his Jewish division with food and with all kinds of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q.</span> <span id="s251">Who got you these jobs both in the shoe factory and the mattress factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A. Well the shoe factory I - because I knew the owners and they requested me.</span> <span id="s253">The other thing I got because I was able to sew and they - I mean the German employment office or whatever you want to call it - of course tried to get as many skilled workers to certain areas so I was lucky that I did have a skill.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q.</span> <span id="s255">You mentioned that your father had to go to this munitions factory...</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s257">It was forced labor and he worked the night shift.</span> <span id="s258">When he came home I left.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q. Was he subjected to difficult conditions in this factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s261">They threatened the men continuously that if anything went wrong they would be arrested and shipped to a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s262">I believe the psychological warfare on men was worse than on women and on adults naturally, more than on children.</span> <span id="s263">But for men it was worse because their pride and their ego was completely taken away from them and I think men suffered much more than women did.</span> <span id="s264">Also they can take less.</span> <span id="s265">They may be physically the stronger sex but mentally they are not.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q.</span> <span id="s267">In this sense of pride and ego being taken away, did this have an effect on your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A. Oh yes.</span> <span id="s269">My father suffered terribly from then on I would say.</span> <span id="s270">And when we had the opportunity to go underground, it was us women who were the stronger ones and who forced the issue at all times and also during the underground period, he was the one who at one point almost couldn’t take it anymore and he said well, I almost rather give myself up than living hidden away like this continuously.</span> <span id="s271">But we managed to carry him through in that respect and we all made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q.</span> <span id="s273">How did this opportunity to move underground present itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A. Well, actually it presented itself through me.</span> <span id="s275">In this shoe factory, after they closed up, a few months later, they tried to open up - the non-Jewish owner who was a Nazi, and in order to - there was somebody who repaired shoes for me so he met me there and tried to open up a Jewish division again.</span> <span id="s276">And one thing led to another and he took sort of a fancy to me and felt he wanted to help me and therefore got deeper into this kind of a thing than he ever anticipated.</span> <span id="s277">Because I said if anybody helps me, it is either all or none (all of us).</span> <span id="s278">And through him we met a man who was really a marvelous man - he was the general manager of Leiser shoes and he was a White Russian who grew up as the biggest Jew hater because White Russians are brought up this way.</span> <span id="s279">He was a psychiatrist and when he studied in Poland, in Warsaw, he met a lot of Jewish people for the first time in his life and he realized that they are not any different than other people and he made it his business to get to know them and later on in his life, most of his friends were Jews.</span> <span id="s280">When these times arrived, he made it his business of help many - by money or personal deed - as possible.</span> <span id="s281">He helped us and seven other people.</span> <span id="s282">I mean we were in his own home later on and other people he helped just with money.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A. Is that when you went underground, when you went to his home.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A. No.</span> <span id="s285">He arranged - well, it’s difficult to say.</span> <span id="s286">First, when the word came that he was able to find hiding place for us, we had to disappear until this was all established.</span> <span id="s287">We lived in the basement of our own apartment building and with all the sirens going and being that it was a luftschutzkellar or shelter, it was not very easy.</span> <span id="s288">We couldn’t smoke because the smoke went up through the pipes and somebody complained.</span> <span id="s289">I mean the super was in on this.</span> <span id="s290">He got paid off.</span> <span id="s291">I mean there were still in Berlin especially a lot of people who were willing to help - some strictly out of conviction and others did it for money as well as conviction.</span> <span id="s292">They certainly had to want to help -whether they did it for monetary gain or not but they wanted to help.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q. Going back to your working for a moment while you were in the shoe factory or the mattress factory and your father in the munitions factory, were you paid.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s295">But like - maybe by today’s standards it would be like 25 cents a day.</span> <span id="s296">You can’t call it payment.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q. Were you able to use money that was yours - like ...</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s299">You had to pay because you had to buy food and Jewish people were only allowed to go to the stores between 4 and 5 in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s300">Your ration cards were marked that you were Jewish - you couldn’t buy certain things and of course, there were certain things which you bought on the black market - like everybody, that always exists.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">To get back to an earlier period just for a minute.</span> <span id="s302">What is interesting to me in retrospect is that young people in spite of all the hardships - somehow somebody managed to retain a phonograph and young people got together and you danced - I mean you made it so low that nobody could hear it - you still danced - you still had some kind of fun.</span> <span id="s303">It seems that nature cannot be repressed completely, in spite of everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q. Were you in fear when you did this.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A. Oh yes.</span> <span id="s306">We were constantly in fear.</span> <span id="s307">There is always somebody.</span> <span id="s308">Also, a non-Jewish person who had a radio and you tried to hear England or any other foreign country but it had to be so low - you hardly heard it.</span> <span id="s309">The volume couldn’t be any louder because maybe somebody would denounce you.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q.</span> <span id="s311">Now this was still while you were in your apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q.</span> <span id="s314">When you moved to the basement, do you remember watching your mother.</span> <span id="s315">What were your impressions of her.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A. I would say she rose to the occasion.</span> <span id="s317">My mother always has been a business woman - a very strong person.</span> <span id="s318">It was a light in all the darkness - trying to save yourself.</span> <span id="s319">I mean you always hoped that the war would end or rather that the Allies would defeat Germany.</span> <span id="s320">So we always said how much longer can it go.</span> <span id="s321">You figured a month, two months, six months but nobody could - we lived underground for two and a half years.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q.</span> <span id="s323">When did you move down to the basement.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A.</span> <span id="s325">In early 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q. Between Kristallnacht and 1942 were you able to pursue any possibilities for emigration or was this finished.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A. No.</span> <span id="s328">One tried but there wasn’t much success.</span> <span id="s329">Still, people were able to get out between 1938 and 1939 but we were not fortunate enough.</span> <span id="s330">And once the war broke out, it was finished.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q.</span> <span id="s332">How long did you live in the basement.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A. Only for two or three weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q.</span> <span id="s335">You mentioned it was an air-raid shelter, when it was used as such, what did you do.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A. Well, they had a Jewish air-raid shelter and a non-Jewish air-raid shelter so we had to quickly move into the Jewish air-raid shelter.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q.</span> <span id="s338">At this point, were they already taking people to...</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s340">That is why we had to vacate the apartment - not to be caught there.</span> <span id="s341">Because somehow, I don’t remember how we found out, we were on the list to be picked up and that’s why we had to get out fast.</span> <span id="s342">They wouldn’t come into the shelter - that wasn’t done that way.</span> <span id="s343">During an air raid, nothing moves so we were relatively safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q.</span> <span id="s345">What about at your father’s job.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A.</span> <span id="s347">At that point, we just stopped going.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q. Just one thought occurs to me, at the time you must have seen many Nazi parades or displays of military strength...</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A. Not really.</span> <span id="s350">We didn’t see any.</span> <span id="s351">We saw them, while you were still able to go to the movies, we saw them in the movies but you did not see it in the street.</span> <span id="s352">Jewish people certainly did not go where the parades were and you were not allowed to go because you would have to raise your hand and say Heil Hitler which you wouldn’t do.</span> <span id="s353">So, at least I did not see any.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q.</span> <span id="s355">How did this man from Leiser help you after you were in the basement of your apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A. Well, they arranged that I was going to a friend of his - to her house and my parents were supposed to go somewhere else.</span> <span id="s357">They went there.</span> <span id="s358">We were picked up in their car and somebody else picked up the little luggage that we had and the only thing is this man that I knew there, he got cold feet and he got scared through this whole thing and tried to get my parents denounced.</span> <span id="s359">They almost got caught in that apartment where they were but they ran away.</span> <span id="s360">They got away and they fell - it was a winter night and there was snow like here in New York and they fell and tore up their clothes but somehow they managed to get where I was and at that point the general manager of Leiser took over and since he knew how being a psychiatrist he knew how to cope with people scared this other fellow so much and said Listen you are just as much involved in it now and you will always be, so if you do anything, you are caught just as much as they are.</span> <span id="s361">But we couldn’t stay with this young lady in her house - not the three of us for a long time and I must say they were so nice the best food, the best of everything, they served.</span> <span id="s362">It was like we were their honored guests.</span> <span id="s363">But he was able to get us on the outskirts of Berlin to a woman who was a known communist and certainly willing to help especially if it was for money.</span> <span id="s364">She needed it.</span> <span id="s365">She was a worker’s widow and her son was in the Army and always in danger because he was known to be the son of a Communist and we stayed at her house for about three months until she got - actually in her apartment, she lived with her daughter in law - until she got into a fight with the daughter in law and wanted her apartment back.</span> <span id="s366">Then, this Dr. Tietjens, that was his name, had almost no choice but - he had a choice, but he had made it his business - and we came to his own estate so to speak which was outside Berlin.</span> <span id="s367">But before we got there he had to throw out his - he was a trainer for horses, that was his avocation - and he had to throw out his trainer there because he was a Nazi and had to prepare his wife which he did.</span> <span id="s368">His wife came from - she was a von something she was a very nice woman.</span> <span id="s369">We had a very good relationship there.</span> <span id="s370">They had an apartment for us in their house upstairs and the kitchen was stocked with food when we arrived there and we stayed there for two and a half years until we were liberated by the Russians.</span> <span id="s371">But unfortunately during this time, this man died but his widow continued regardless of all the hardships and whatever happened because she had a son out of her first marriage who was a known Nazi and when Berlin really got bombed, he said I’m coming to you.</span> <span id="s372">After all, you’re my mother.</span> <span id="s373">Again, somehow she was able to persuade him not to say anything and he knew about us.</span> <span id="s374">But the life was not easy - to be cooped up in one room with kitchen and bathroom - three adults at that time adult people and especially for my father, it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s375">I mean my mother and I, we did sewing, cooking, baking, what have you, we could occupy ourselves but what could a man do - cooped up.</span> <span id="s376">You can’t play cards all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q. And not by yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A. No.</span> <span id="s379">But these people who ran the farm, actually - these two farmers - a couple, they came up during the day and they talked to us and he played cards with my father but that wasn’t enough.</span> <span id="s380">So, this Dr. Tietjens let him do some research about racing from racing books and so on.</span> <span id="s381">Everything helped but it was not easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q.</span> <span id="s383">You put your trust in quite a number of people through this...</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A.</span> <span id="s385">You had to.</span> <span id="s386">You had to.</span> <span id="s387">You really had no choice.</span> <span id="s388">It was either or.</span> <span id="s389">But at that point, once a person committed themselves to help somebody, they put themselves in terrible danger.</span> <span id="s390">Whether they get paid for their work or not, once they get caught, there is no difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q. Was you family able to pay...</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A. No.</span> <span id="s393">At that point, we had no money, none whatsoever.</span> <span id="s394">So this Dr. Tietjens did everything for us - fed us, clothed us and sheltered us and also paid off whoever had to be paid off including the mayor of that little town because he wanted to send people there to stay who got bombed out in Berlin - not knowing that we were there.</span> <span id="s395">But he got paid off just to leave that area alone, to leave that building alone - where he lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q.</span> <span id="s397">How old was Dr. Tietjens.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A. Well, when you are young, everybody looks old.</span> <span id="s399">He was only 50 when he died, unfortunately.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q.</span> <span id="s401">You mentioned that he was a psychiatrist.</span> <span id="s402">Why was he working at Leiser.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A.</span> <span id="s404">He gave lectures at the University about how to improve sales from a psychological point of view and many years before, the owner of Leiser went and listened to that lecture and he was so impressed with him that he said this is the man who can reeducate our sales force and that’s what he did and then he grew up within that company and since he was very friendly with all the Leiser people - they were personal friends - and when they had to be taken over by gentiles, again it was a friend who pro forma took over and it was the owner of a company, his name was Bahner which was LBO stockings and that was all one friendly family and they were also involved in everything.</span> <span id="s405">This was why he was always involved with Jewish people and that’s how he became general manager of Leiser.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q.</span> <span id="s407">You mentioned that it was very difficult for your father, but it must have been very difficult for you too.</span> <span id="s408">You were a young girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A.</span> <span id="s410">It was very difficult but if you can occupy yourself, it helps.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q.</span> <span id="s412">But was the cooking and baking enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A.</span> <span id="s414">The sewing.</span> <span id="s415">It was easier for me.</span> <span id="s416">It was much easier for me as well as for my mother than it was for my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q.</span> <span id="s418">Did you ever have any contact with any young people.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A. No.</span> <span id="s420">None whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q. Were you in any way restricted in that apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A. Well, only when there was an air raid.</span> <span id="s423">It was darkened enough at night so that no light would go through but this was a building, a villa that was on a little hill and nobody could really look in.</span> <span id="s424">It was totally isolated.</span> <span id="s425">And I would say that in those two and one half years, we went outside maybe four or five times.</span> <span id="s426">In the late evening, there was a forest right behind the building where we walked a little bit but that was the extent of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q.</span> <span id="s428">How were you able to keep your morale going.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A. I think with the hope that it is going to end soon.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q. Were you able to get news.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s432">I mean they had a radio and you listened and with every air raid on Berlin you hoped the war would end soon.</span> <span id="s433">You said to yourself, how much longer can it last.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q.</span> <span id="s435">When Dr. Tietjens died, were you at all fearful...</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s437">At that point, we were very much afraid.</span> <span id="s438">Not that she wouldn’t continue but whether she could cope with it.</span> <span id="s439">But she did.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q.</span> <span id="s441">Did you make any plans in the event that she couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A. No.</span> <span id="s443">We were totally helpless.</span> <span id="s444">Whatever would happen, would happen.</span> <span id="s445">You couldn’t make plans and you couldn’t even think further than the next day.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q.</span> <span id="s447">Did you know what was going on in other places.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A. No.</span> <span id="s449">At that point, you didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q. Was all your news given to you by these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s452">Or we went downstairs at night and we listened all together.</span> <span id="s453">We were not restricted if nobody else was in the house, not to go downstairs.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q.</span> <span id="s455">When the Russians came to liberate you...</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A.</span> <span id="s457">It was a big event.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q.</span> <span id="s459">It was I suppose what you had hoped for...</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A. Well, it was a little bit different than we expected it to be.</span> <span id="s461">We were in a bunker at the time - a shelter, an outside shelter on the estate naturally with a lot of people from the surrounding area - it was a huge thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q.</span> <span id="s463">Why were you in this shelter.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A. Because there was danger of artillery shooting - once the war was there right there in town - you had to take shelter, you couldn’t stay.</span> <span id="s465">Of course, then when you heard, all of a sudden there was silence and someone of the men went outside and said well, it’s over finished!</span> <span id="s466">Then we ripped our coats open and took out our stars.</span> <span id="s467">We figured that’s the only way to differentiate ourselves from the rest of the population.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q.</span> <span id="s469">What do you mean you took out your stars.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A.</span> <span id="s471">You know we had them sewn into our coat linings and we pinned them onto our coats to make sure we would be recognized.</span> <span id="s472">Of course, those people, they were all in shock not realizing they had harbored or were living sort of with Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q.</span> <span id="s474">What was the reaction when they saw you take out the stars.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A. I would say strictly shock but I think they were happy at that point because they figured it would be their salvation.</span> <span id="s476">This estate was outside of this village and we had to walk into town and at that moment, the German airplanes were still going.</span> <span id="s477">There was still shooting going on.</span> <span id="s478">Then our first surprise was that the Russian soldiers wanted to grab all the women and we tried to explain to them that we were Jewish but it’s not so good to communicate when you don’t know any Russian.</span> <span id="s479">But then luckily it was the headquarters there and at that point, most officers were Jewish-Russian officers.</span> <span id="s480">And of course, there was a big celebration.</span> <span id="s481">They made my father mayor of the town and we were able to save everything for these people who had helped us - you know their property getting destroyed or being taken away by the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q.</span> <span id="s483">How did you manage to ward off these Russian soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A.</span> <span id="s485">It wasn’t easy.</span> <span id="s486">My mother got hit over the head in trying to protect me.</span> <span id="s487">My father got hit over the head.</span> <span id="s488">I spent a lot of time in closets.</span> <span id="s489">And we were once discussing it with one officer who spoke some German.</span> <span id="s490">He was not Jewish and we asked why do you want these women who are not willing?</span> <span id="s491">Aren’t you married?</span> <span id="s492">He said yes, I’m married.</span> <span id="s493">My wife is all the way away - we write letters but what are letters?</span> <span id="s494">The Russians were like children in a way because they raped the women and then gave them food.</span> <span id="s495">It was unique.</span> <span id="s496">There was no viciousness - they just wanted women.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q.</span> <span id="s498">Did they react the same way towards the German women as towards the Jewish women.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A.</span> <span id="s500">They left us alone then after a while.</span> <span id="s501">But they didn’t care, old, young, ugly, beautiful.</span> <span id="s502">it didn’t make any difference.</span> <span id="s503">But once all the shooting was over, we were able to go back to our estate there and then the Jewish officers came and couldn’t understand that my father couldn’t drink vodka like water and one of them told us that if you ever intend to go to America, Berlin will be divided into various sects and we should manage to get into the American sector fast.</span> <span id="s504">So once the shooting was over in Berlin, they drove us into Berlin and we registered and we were supposed to meet them again at a certain point to get back.</span> <span id="s505">But somehow that go fouled up and we had to walk back - about 35 miles.</span> <span id="s506">It was a July summer day and it was terrible because you were afraid to stop anywhere to ask for food or water because you didn’t know whom would you face but we managed to get back.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q.</span> <span id="s508">When you say the Russians came to the estate, did they set up headquarters.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A. No.</span> <span id="s510">Not at the estate but they came in the evening and in their off hours.</span> <span id="s511">After all, they were so happy to find Jewish people and somebody who helped them.</span> <span id="s512">It was a big event for them too.</span> <span id="s513">Naturally, at that point, things in Russia were a little bit different too and they tried to persuade us to go to Russia - it is so great and so beautiful.</span> <span id="s514">What a future I personally would have but we said no, thanks.</span> <span id="s515">Our family is in America and that’s where we want to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q. Was this common for the Russian officers to be Jewish at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A. I understand at that point, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q.</span> <span id="s519">When you walked the 35 miles back from Berlin did you confront any Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A. No.</span> <span id="s521">We just didn’t take a chance, we didn’t take a chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q.</span> <span id="s523">When you went back to the American sector...</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A.</span> <span id="s525">Then a few weeks later, at that point you knew what was going on and then we just moved back to Berlin and these people, (Tietjens) they gave us money to live - after all we had nothing.</span> <span id="s526">And as a matter of fact, for our new apartment there, she gave us a beautiful oriental rug.</span> <span id="s527">So, they did more than just helping us.</span> <span id="s528">They became our friends throughout those years.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q.</span> <span id="s530">When you did move into this apartment in Berlin, you must have come into contact with many Germans...</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s532">It was peculiar attitude.</span> <span id="s533">You felt almost that you didn’t belong anymore.</span> <span id="s534">You felt totally isolated.</span> <span id="s535">Certainly you didn’t recognize the town anymore - it was bombed and what have you.</span> <span id="s536">But also you felt like they were total strangers - people that you knew before, faces that you had seen.</span> <span id="s537">You felt completely removed.</span> <span id="s538">Naturally distrust for but the main reaction was that you just didn’t belong.</span> <span id="s539">You couldn’t wait to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q.</span> <span id="s541">How did they react towards you.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A. Of course, they showed great happiness and well, we never were like that and I’m so happy for you to survive.</span> <span id="s543">We all know better.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q.</span> <span id="s545">Did you rent this apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q. And the landlord was non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s548">Did you have any trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A. No.</span> <span id="s550">There was no trouble.</span> <span id="s551">You had to go first to the city hall and register and you had to be given an apartment - you know there were no empty apartments.</span> <span id="s552">Many buildings were bombed out so people moved together but we had first priority at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q.</span> <span id="s554">Did you deal with any agency at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A.</span> <span id="s556">It was strictly the mayor’s office, city hall and then the American Army.</span> <span id="s557">That’s whom we contacted and they had set up a chaplain’s office, a Rabbi, who gathered whatever jews were left in each sector.</span> <span id="s558">This was their job.</span> <span id="s559">And then we were told we had to register somewhere to immigrate to America.</span> <span id="s560">It so happened that we got visa number 2, 3 and 4.</span> <span id="s561">No. 1 was a baby that was adopted by an American officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q.</span> <span id="s563">So then you made plans to go...</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A. Oh yes.</span> <span id="s565">At that point, nothing could have been done for me to stay in Germany for anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q.</span> <span id="s567">What was the morale like in Berlin among the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A. I would say they were glad the war was over and trying to build a life again but I really had no contact with them.</span> <span id="s569">I was absolutely not interested whatsoever.</span> <span id="s570">We lived our own life and we got to know quite a few American soldiers and they sent mail to our... that was the first contact we ever made again through soldiers with our family here as well as in Switzerland to notify them that we are alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q.</span> <span id="s572">Who of your family...</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A. My mother’s brother and various cousins.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q.</span> <span id="s575">During the liberation and your moving from the Russian zone to the American zone, how did your father get on with the Russians and then...</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A. Very well.</span> <span id="s577">At that point, he was relieved and he then started feeling like a human being again and had great hopes, once we get to America, it’s all going to be different and then he had another disappointment.</span> <span id="s578">He found that it wasn’t easy when he got here either.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q.</span> <span id="s580">How old was your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A.</span> <span id="s582">We came in 1946.</span> <span id="s583">We came with the first ship - D. P. s hip - the Marine Flasher which was the first ship.</span> <span id="s584">I looked for the clipping before but I couldn’t find it.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q. Was that an Army transport ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A.</span> <span id="s587">It was a liberty ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q.</span> <span id="s589">What was the mood of the passengers on the ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A. Well, it was jubilation.</span> <span id="s591">Now, we come to the promised land.</span> <span id="s592">Some promise!</span> <span id="s593">But, we had already our disappointments before.</span> <span id="s594">You were, you know, the UNRRA, did all the transportation and what have you so you took first a train to Bremerhaven and you were put into a camp building by the UNRRA.</span> <span id="s595">That camp was manned by English soldiers so whatever possessions you had, you brought certain things - linens or personal things - they took away again.</span> <span id="s596">That was the first disappointment.</span> <span id="s597">I mean you got robbed left and right - it was unbelievable what they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q. I’m not quite sure I understand.</span> <span id="s599">By whom did you get...</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A.</span> <span id="s601">The English soldiers.</span> <span id="s602">They rifled through your possessions - okay, whether you had guns or what have you.</span> <span id="s603">I mean there’s all kinds of - spies could come along.</span> <span id="s604">Okay, there’s nothing wrong with that but not to take away the few possessions that you had.</span> <span id="s605">So that was the first disappointment - the reality of life again.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q.</span> <span id="s607">Who did you meet in this camp.</span> <span id="s608">Were most of the people German - Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A. No.</span> <span id="s610">It was a mixture.</span> <span id="s611">I would say that most were - in my group let’s put it this way - were German Jews.</span> <span id="s612">They were camp survivors and some other people who lived underground.</span> <span id="s613">As a matter of fact when everything was over, I met a former girlfriend of mine who I went to school with who had also lived underground all by herself.</span> <span id="s614">But she had rather a rough time and almost got denounced by another former friend but she survived and we were all on the same boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q.</span> <span id="s616">You mentioned before we started talking that there were instances of people being denounced, did you know of them personally.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A. Afterwards we heard.</span> <span id="s618">Not during that time because we were hidden away but we later heard about it.</span> <span id="s619">I would say that in Berlin and the surrounding area about 1000 people lived underground which is a very small percentage and yet considering the danger that was involved, it is quite an amount of people.</span> <span id="s620">Relatively few people had it as good as we had it though.</span> <span id="s621">We were really fortunate in our misfortune.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q.</span> <span id="s623">Did you realize that at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s625">I think we did because they tried to make it as comfortable for us as they possibly could under the circumstances.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q.</span> <span id="s627">You mentioned before that Mrs. Tietjens’ son was a Nazi.</span> <span id="s628">Was there ever a question of his reporting you.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A. No.</span> <span id="s630">he was basically a coward even though he was about 6’3” tall but he was a coward.</span> <span id="s631">He was an artist and he made caricatures for the Voelkischer Beobachter and he was really only told about us after he had lived there for a few days.</span> <span id="s632">And it was put to him in such a way - well, you are caught up in the same thing.</span> <span id="s633">If you denounce us today, you are just as guilty.</span> <span id="s634">You participated in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q.</span> <span id="s636">In this camp in Bremerhaven, how did the British treat you.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A.</span> <span id="s638">They treated us like prisoners really.</span> <span id="s639">I mean there was no friendliness or anything.</span> <span id="s640">They treated us like prisoners of war or whatever you - like a bad element that gets shipped out.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q.</span> <span id="s642">What kind of conditions were there in this camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A. I would consider them Army conditions.</span> <span id="s644">The women slept together, showered together and it was an army camp or something of that sort.</span> <span id="s645">But then it was only - we were there maybe a week if that long so you could bear it.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q.</span> <span id="s647">When you came to the U.S. did you come directly to New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q.</span> <span id="s650">Did you uncle meet you.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s652">He met us at the pier.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q. Where did you go that first day.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A. Well, let me backtrack just a minute.</span> <span id="s655">This was the first ship that arrived and they made a whole lot of fuss with it.</span> <span id="s656">There were newspaper reporters on board and when we came to Ellis Island, the immigration people came on board and there was a lot of talk and when we arrived, I believe, there were a lot of speeches being made and if I recollect, I think Mrs. Roosevelt was there - that was on Ellis Island but we were on board.</span> <span id="s657">So there was a big fanfare being done for us.</span> <span id="s658">When we arrived, there was some kind of security and then my aunt and uncle, my uncle had married in the meantime, they took us by taxi to their house which was on 90th St. and Central Park West.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q.</span> <span id="s660">How did you feel about all the fanfare and excitement.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A. Well, we felt elated to be here but we wanted to get it over with - start some kind of normal life again - to start fresh.</span> <span id="s662">And especially I - I felt I wanted to live now.</span> <span id="s663">I was 21 which wasn’t easy because there were so many years where other people, normal people the age, you know, the teens, where you really have a carefree life, more or less - that was lost for me.</span> <span id="s664">I must say this was one thing I always regretted.</span> <span id="s665">I always felt that loss of a carefree kind of life - or normal boy-girl relationship and whatever else goes with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q.</span> <span id="s667">During all those growing up years, you really didn’t have any contact with other girls or boys your own age.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A. Very little and you grow up very fast.</span> <span id="s669">You become an adult - I was an adult when I was thirteen.</span> <span id="s670">Not only I - so was every child at the time.</span> <span id="s671">You had no choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q.</span> <span id="s673">What were your first impressions of New York when you went...</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A. Very disappointing.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q.</span> <span id="s676">In what way.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A.</span> <span id="s678">In a physical way, very disappointing.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q.</span> <span id="s680">What had you imagined or anticipated.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A. Well, from the movies.</span> <span id="s682">I mean Berlin was actually a very beautiful city - clean, nice buildings.</span> <span id="s683">When we arrived and we arrived here at the harbor on 11th Avenue, it hasn’t changed much in all these years - you saw those brownstone houses - tenement buildings - we couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s684">And when we saw Broadway, it also wasn’t as we had expected it to be.</span> <span id="s685">But I mean those are outside things.</span> <span id="s686">I think it took two years to get used to New York and to see anything that you liked within the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q.</span> <span id="s688">After you went to your aunt and uncle’s house, how did you manage to earn a living.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A. Well, my uncle offered me to go back to school and I wanted to but I just couldn’t see myself sitting down - there was just too much to catch up with.</span> <span id="s690">I just wanted to become independent and earn money since we had none.</span> <span id="s691">Somebody found a job for me and my parents - I don’t remember exactly - I think my mother found a job somewhere and that was the big disappointment for my father - that he was not able to establish himself as he wanted to.</span> <span id="s692">My uncle was a manufacturer and after a while, they became sort of contractors for him and it was a little better then.</span> <span id="s693">But still it was my mother who was the dominant factor because it had to do with hands - it was women’s work and my father did some bookkeeping and he did the delivering back and forth but it was not the thing that he anticipated or expected to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q. Was this first job that he got with your uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s696">I believe so.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q.</span> <span id="s698">Did you all know English when you came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s700">I did and my parents also to a certain degree.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q. Your father had come over very hopeful.</span> <span id="s702">How did he anticipate getting the capital to...</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A.</span> <span id="s704">He had been selling all his life and he thought he would try to sell anything but it didn’t work out quite that easily.</span> <span id="s705">They were not waiting for him - especially, he was not a youngster - he was already in his 60’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q.</span> <span id="s707">Did he go to any organizations.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A. For help, no.</span> <span id="s709">That wasn’t really necessary but another disappointment was, we arrived on May 27, 1946, and the Jewish holidays were somewhere in September and coming from Europe we knew - seats in a temple were no problem.</span> <span id="s710">I mean you become a member and that’s it.</span> <span id="s711">But not that you had to buy seats.</span> <span id="s712">And my uncle belonged to Habonim at the time and so he said well, we’ll buy you a ticket.</span> <span id="s713">So my father said, you are not going to buy any tickets for us.</span> <span id="s714">They should be glad if they give us tickets.</span> <span id="s715">But whoever was the Rabbi, I think it was Hahn, there was no such thing.</span> <span id="s716">They said they don’t give away tickets and my uncle subsequently gave back his membership and never continued.</span> <span id="s717">The only temple in all of New York or in that area in New York that was glad to give tickets for High Holidays was Stephen S. Wise congregation.</span> <span id="s718">That was another disappointment.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q.</span> <span id="s720">How long did you stay with your aunt and uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A.</span> <span id="s722">We stayed for almost a year in their apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q.</span> <span id="s724">What kind of work did your mother find at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A. Within that year, she made lampshades, she worked for somebody but then they became contractors.</span> <span id="s726">They also did alteration work - as long as they had a loft and some sewing machines and my mother was very handy and they went to a dress shop and picked up alteration work and things like this but they also worked for my uncle who had a hairnet factory - they were knotting hairnets and employed a few women from the neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q.</span> <span id="s728">How did you father feel about your mother working.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A. Well, my mother worked always in business together with him so that was no problem and she comes from a business family.</span> <span id="s730">The biggest problem was that he was not the head of the household so to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q. Well, in what ways did that make itself manifest.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A. I could see he was depressed about it and I would say it broke his heart.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q.</span> <span id="s734">What kind of job did you get.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A. Well, since I had learned the fashion business already, I tried to get back into it and I started as a sample hand and worked myself up to be a designer.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q.</span> <span id="s737">How did you find your first job.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A.</span> <span id="s739">The very first job was working in a stock room fixing up things so that was just a job to get some money and then I took a newspaper and went from place to place and it was not easy to find a first job because everybody would ask what was your experience in this country.</span> <span id="s740">Finally, I came to somebody and it was a younger man and he asked me the same question and I was tired of it at that point and so I said If nobody gives me a chance to work, I will never have any experience.</span> <span id="s741">So he said all right, you got the job.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q.</span> <span id="s743">How did you make contact with other young people your age.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A.</span> <span id="s745">That was very difficult, because by the time I got here, my age group was already married or established.</span> <span id="s746">I somehow found some of my old school friends again but it was very difficult - through introduction and - but it was an effort - it was not easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q.</span> <span id="s748">Did you join any organizations.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A. Not really.</span> <span id="s750">I joined because our dentist said - why don’t you learn how to play tennis.</span> <span id="s751">So I joined the New World Club tennis group and ever since, I play tennis.</span> <span id="s752">But that was very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q.</span> <span id="s754">Did you look to join mostly a German jewish refugee crowd.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A. I did not look for it - no, I really didn’t but it came by itself.</span> <span id="s756">With the exception of one friend I had made in Berlin - an American soldier and through his family I met some other Americans but little by little it fell by the wayside because within your job, you were busy and you came home and you had to worry about your own family.</span> <span id="s757">it was not like it is today where a young girl keeps the money all to herself and also my parents tried to do some manufacturing and after my work, I went to their place and I continued there.</span> <span id="s758">So it was two jobs for a certain length of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q. Was this manufacturing in the hairnet...</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A. No, in novelty items, beachwear and halters like they are coming back with but I enjoyed also a ski club but that was several years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q.</span> <span id="s762">Did you date any American boys other than the soldier that you met in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A. Yes, they were all people I had met in Berlin, all young soldiers that came back to New York but I would say there was a gap because I was really not quite ready - I didn’t know how to handle it.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q. Maybe if you would have come over as a fifteen year old and gone to school here, the transition might have been easier...</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A. Exactly.</span> <span id="s766">My friends that came over here several years earlier and went maybe just only to high school - they were totally integrated already in the American life.</span> <span id="s767">I remember I was here maybe two years and I went on my first vacation - it was a Labor Day week end with a former school friend of mine.</span> <span id="s768">Well, it was just - I didn’t belong.</span> <span id="s769">I absolutely didn’t belong.</span> <span id="s770">It happened to be my birthday over that week end and they made a big fuss - you know, a birthday cake - but I just didn’t belong.</span> <span id="s771">I didn’t know how to cope with young people.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q.</span> <span id="s773">What made you feel that you didn’t belong.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A. I just didn’t know how to handle it.</span> <span id="s775">I didn’t know what to say.</span> <span id="s776">Their interests were not my interest.</span> <span id="s777">There was no past to talk about and I was also too serious - just to talk and talk - I mean today, it has changed over the years but in those days, I just didn’t know how to.</span> <span id="s778">This is in retrospect.</span> <span id="s779">At the time, I did not notice it so much only I didn’t make friends easily.</span> <span id="s780">I couldn’t make new friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q.</span> <span id="s782">When you dated these American soldiers in Berlin or here, did your parents have any feelings about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A.</span> <span id="s784">They were happy to see me getting back into a normal kind of life.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q.</span> <span id="s786">But would they have preferred you to go out with German Jewish boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A. No.</span> <span id="s788">My parents never had these kind of feelings.</span> <span id="s789">We also never had the feelings of Eastern Jews or Western Jews or something like this.</span> <span id="s790">That never entered our feelings.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q.</span> <span id="s792">When you first started working, did you ever feel embarrassed about speaking German...</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A. No.</span> <span id="s794">Because we made a habit of not speaking German - neither did my parents.</span> <span id="s795">Strangely enough, as poor as their English was, we never communicated in German.</span> <span id="s796">Not even at home.</span> <span id="s797">I mean we do speak German like most people who speak other languages, you lapse from one to the other but generally speaking, we speak English.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q.</span> <span id="s799">Did you feel a desire to become Americanized.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s801">I didn’t want to have anything to do with Germany anymore.</span> <span id="s802">I have been back to where my grandparents lived near the Swiss border, in southern Germany, to go to the cemetery and I just couldn’t get out of there fast enough.</span> <span id="s803">I feel very badly being there.</span> <span id="s804">I distrust everybody and yet my mind tells me that today's generation - they have nothing to do with it.</span> <span id="s805">They are very nice people, on the contrary, after all, they are Israel’s greatest allies.</span> <span id="s806">But I don’t feel comfortable - I wouldn’t go back to Berlin - Yes, I - on one hand, I would like to show it to my son and say this is where I lived.</span> <span id="s807">He has been to Mannheim which is where my husband was from but I just feel very uncomfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q. Was this a small town that you visited - where your mother c ame fr om.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A. Yes, it was called Geiling and at one point it had a larger Jewish community than non-Jewish community.</span> <span id="s810">It wa a well known village within the Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q.</span> <span id="s812">In connection with feelings about Germany, how do you feel about the Wiedergutmachung.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A. I take whatever is coming to me.</span> <span id="s814">I feel I must give them credit for it - that they keep it up the way they do yet I feel whatever every Jew can get out of them - they can never make up for whatever hardship and loss one had.</span> <span id="s815">For the people who died, there is nothing - no money can make up for it.</span> <span id="s816">And it is taken advantage of by some people, some people get richer than they ever were in their life but it’s all part and parcel of it.</span> <span id="s817">I mean there will come a day when nothing will be paid anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q.</span> <span id="s819">In looking back, what do you think was the greatest adjustment that you had to make when you came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A. I think personal relationships - this was the most difficult thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q.</span> <span id="s822">In what way - personal relationships.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A. Having friends or having - I have always tried to recapture the lost years but you really can’t.</span> <span id="s824">That was a difficult point because my interests at that point were different from my contemporaries because for them, that was already past.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q.</span> <span id="s826">You called them lost years, what do you think you lost the most.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A. Carefreeness, happiness, companionship, a normal life.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q. Companionship of...</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A. Of my peers.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q.</span> <span id="s831">What do you think was your parents’ greatest adjustment when they came.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A.</span> <span id="s833">The disappointment of not being able to earn the kind of money they had expected and of course, later on, the restitution money helped and today, for my mother it is a different kind of a life.</span> <span id="s834">But those were very difficult years and yet when we heard other people who emigrated here in 1936,7,8 - how difficult they had it to make ends meet - we didn’t because at that point the livelihood that you earned was already more in line with what your daily costs were.</span> <span id="s835">But we didn’t feel sorry for them - I still don’t because we said you should be grateful you were here - you were safe - even if you just had bread and water.</span> <span id="s836">And if a whole community has the same hardships - you really don’t feel it.</span> <span id="s837">If one person is poor and has nothing and everybody around them has everything, then you feel bad.</span> <span id="s838">But if everybody is in the same boat, it isn’t that terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q. Today, do you feel yourself more a part of the American mainstream or more a part of the German Jewish community in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A. I would say I am in a very difficult position.</span> <span id="s841">I dislike my own people to a large extent.</span> <span id="s842">I feel more comfortable in the American community and yet most of my friends are European.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q.</span> <span id="s844">Why do you say you dislike...</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A. Because there are many people who cling to their old ways or feel superior to a certain extent.</span> <span id="s846">I would say I feel also superior because I feel European whether German, French or what have you - upbringing is different and you have something that the average American hasn’t got.</span> <span id="s847">But outside of that, I feel uncomfortable in so called refugee circles.</span> <span id="s848">I feel I have graduated from that - I don’t like to speak German too much or talk about Germany.</span> <span id="s849">Vacationing - that’s a different story.</span> <span id="s850">But I’m betwixt and between.</span> <span id="s851">To a large extent, I feel more comfortable with Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q. Do you work with mostly Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A. Only Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q. Do you feel there is a difference - I guess there is a difference between being brought up as a European and as an American but how do you think that difference manifests itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A. Values in life.</span> <span id="s856">From the point of view of earning a living or looking at your work or your livelihood, we do have different values.</span> <span id="s857">We don’t say give me and then I show you.</span> <span id="s858">We say we’ll show you and then we’d like to be reimbursed properly.</span> <span id="s859">If not, good-bye.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q. Do you notice a difference in your working habits as compared to your American colleagues.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s862">There are always exceptions but on the whole, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q.</span> <span id="s864">In what way.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A. I would say Europeans are more ambitious, more hardworking, more sincere and try to give the best - try to give a dollar for a dollar and not to take advantage of a given situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q.</span> <span id="s867">When you first started to work, how did you get used to the American attitudes.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A. I think pretty fast because I think I tried to block out everything else and there was only one way to go - I wanted to make a success of myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q. Have you always worked since you arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s871">I started four weeks after I arrived and I worked ever since.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q. Basically, you worked in an American Jewish dominated industry.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">You mentioned before that most of your friends are still German Jewish, why do you think this is so,.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A. I didn’t have too many friends until I got married and most of our friends were my husband’s friends and they were European.</span> <span id="s875">He was quite a bit older than me and felt closer to the old established -</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q.</span> <span id="s877">In terms of recreation, you mentioned that you went on a skiing...</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A. Yes, but not so fast.</span> <span id="s879">About three or four years had gone by already.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q.</span> <span id="s881">What did you do for recreation.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A.</span> <span id="s883">It was strictly family.</span> <span id="s884">In summer, we went picnicking.</span> <span id="s885">It was all family oriented.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q.</span> <span id="s887">Did they go to the cultural events in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A. Well, my uncle did but he had a little different attitude - what you haven’t earned, you can’t spend but in those days, we did not spend much money - we didn’t have it.</span> <span id="s889">You had to build a little nest egg first.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q.</span> <span id="s891">Did your parents feel that loss.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s893">Especially my father because he was always - he enjoyed life and he enjoyed giving and he enjoyed to be able to buy my mother the best there is and once he couldn’t do that anymore - it was not easy for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q. Was he still living when the restitution came.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A.</span> <span id="s896">It started but the fruit of it came really after he passed away - that was unfortunate.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q.</span> <span id="s898">How do you feel when you see Jewish successes in American politics like Kissinger, Koch, Javits.</span> <span id="s899">Do you like to see that.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s901">Because I don’t believe in hiding because whatever will happen, happens whether you are in a prominent position or not.</span> <span id="s902">And there are the anti-semites regardless of what you do or don’t do.</span> <span id="s903">So I don’t believe in hiding and saying that you shouldn’t put yourself into that kind of a position.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q.</span> <span id="s905">As far as your son is concerned, do you think you were a different parent than most of the parents of his friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s907">I would say so.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q.</span> <span id="s909">In what way.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A. I guess in values - in what is important in life or how to establish yourself or how to make a success of yourself.</span> <span id="s911">But I don’t think that has to do with my experiences of living underground or being under Hitler.</span> <span id="s912">I think this has to do with European values, upbringing.</span> <span id="s913">he feels very much the difference in that between himself and his peers.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q. Have you ever told him the story of living underground and emigrating.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A. Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q.</span> <span id="s917">What was his reaction.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A.</span> <span id="s919">He was very interested in it but I think it has reached a point where he really does not want to hear about it anymore, as conversation anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q.</span> <span id="s921">How does your mother relate to your son in terms of his life as an American boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A. Very well.</span> <span id="s923">My mother is very Americanized.</span> <span id="s924">She had later on, after my father passed away, made quite a success of her business.</span> <span id="s925">She became a contractor for making beach bags and pillows - throw pillows - and met a customer - rather he can never get over it how she with her poor English took it upon herself to knock on any door and sell herself, so to speak.</span> <span id="s926">She adjusted very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q.</span> <span id="s928">Did that disturb your father that she was successful.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s930">it did disturb him.</span> <span id="s931">He felt he couldn’t do it and it bothered him very much.</span> <span id="s932">The opportunity, somehow in the line they were in, somehow it was more for a woman to do because she was the expert in it where he wasn’t.</span> <span id="s933">Whatever bookkeeping or money transaction had to be done, that was his part but in order to sell her labor, it was her.</span> <span id="s934">He couldn’t understand if somebody asked can you make this.</span></p></body></html>
