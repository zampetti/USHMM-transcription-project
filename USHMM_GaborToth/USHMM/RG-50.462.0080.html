id="s3">JF: This is an interview with Dr. Helmut Frank, on February 19th, 1982, with Josey Fisher.</span> <span id="s4">Dr. Frank, can you tell me where and when you were born, and a little bit about your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s5">HF: I was born on April 15, 1912, in the city of Wiesbaden.</span> <span id="s6">[unclear] My upbringing was Jewish, not Orthodox, but some way traditional.</span> <span id="s7">My great-grandfather was a rabbi.</span> <span id="s8">Not a rabbi with a pulpit but a talmudical scholar who made a living by a store, whom his wife operated.</span> <span id="s9">In addition to that, his wife bore him 10 children and took care of the household so that he could, the whole day, take care of his learning and study, and in this way had an easy life.</span> <span id="s10">So I am his great-grandson and while most members of our family were not religious, or not interested very much in religion, I was in love with Judaism.</span> <span id="s11">I was different than everybody else.</span> <span id="s12">Different than my sister, different than cousins and all other members of the family.</span> <span id="s13">Most other members of the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">JF: Were you able to spend time with this great-grandfather when you were a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">HF: No.</span> <span id="s16">He was not living any more when I was born, but my grandfather was also very religious, and I was influenced by him.</span> <span id="s17">He was not a learned scholar, but he was a very observant Jew and I liked his ways of spending time in shul, liked his laying tfilin in the mornings, observing kashrut and I was influenced by him, I would say.</span> <span id="s18">He was one--he died when I was 11 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">JF: Was it with this grandfather then that you learned your early Jewish education?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">HF: I don’t think I learned it with him but he was very much interested that I should get a good Jewish upbringing, and he suggested to my father that he should give a special sum of money to our teacher of religion so that he would teach me more, but my father didn’t like that idea at all.</span> <span id="s21">But you’ll see.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">JF: Did he do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">HF: He didn’t do it but he would have liked to see it.</span> <span id="s24">He was more a Jew in the old-fashioned way.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">JF: Now, were your parents members of the synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">HF: Well, in this town where I grew up there were two Jewish communities, one small one that was Orthodox and one larger one that was Liberal.</span> <span id="s27">Today, according to American terms you would call it Conservative.</span> <span id="s28">There was no Reform in Wiesbaden.</span> <span id="s29">Altogether in Germany there was only one Reform congregation and it was in Berlin that had Sabbath services on Sunday.</span> <span id="s30">Later on, I was also once in that Temple to see how they performed services there, without hats, as is done in America in Reform synagogues.</span> <span id="s31">But, I think they were much more Reform than the congregations, the Reform congregations in America.</span> <span id="s32">They were national Germans, felt altogether more German than Jewish, for Jewish was only a very small part of their life.</span> <span id="s33">I want to come back now to my own upbringing.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">JF: Yes, we were talking about your families…</span></p> <p><span id="s35">HF: In comparison to my classmates who received their religious upbringing in special classes, I was the best one.</span> <span id="s36">I learned more than them because I was more interested.</span> <span id="s37">But from a children’s point of view of Jewish requirements I did not learn very much altogether.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">JF: Which of the groups did your family belong to?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">HF: We belonged to the Liberal congregation, but my grandfather, when he was in our home, of course he wouldn’t go there.</span> <span id="s40">He went to the Orthodox.</span> <span id="s41">So, I was somewhat in between, sometimes I went there.</span> <span id="s42">I think I was one of the few who went to both.</span> <span id="s43">To both congregations, to both synagogues.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">JF: So, you are saying that the education that was given in the Liberal congregation was not what you would have liked it to have been.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">HF: That’s right.</span> <span id="s46">The Orthodox, where my wife went, had a kind of better education, not very much also, not very much either, but it was still, they still learned more than we learned.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">JF: What was involved in your education?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">HF: You mean Jewish education?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">JF: What kind of classes that you had in the Liberal congregation.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">HF: We learned Hebrew, to read from the prayer book.</span> <span id="s51">We learned some Chumash, not too much, but I, I excelled because I learned the whole sidra.</span> <span id="s52">Nobody else did.</span> <span id="s53">Because I did that on my own.</span> <span id="s54">We learned Jewish history, Biblical history, I should say first.</span> <span id="s55">Jewish history.</span> <span id="s56">I mean those that were interested could get something out of it.</span> <span id="s57">Generally, not too many were interested.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">JF: What kind of community were you living in, in Wiesbaden?</span> <span id="s59">Was it a Jewish community or was it an integrated area?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">HF: Wiesbaden was one of the large German communities.</span> <span id="s61">We had 4000 Jews in Wiesbaden.</span> <span id="s62">It was in the time before Hitler, Jews were known among Gentiles.</span> <span id="s63">There might have even been some Jews who were friendly with Gentiles.</span> <span id="s64">And, of course there was intermarriage, not like today, 50 percent, but there was quite a size of an intermarriage at that time.</span> <span id="s65">Jews were then through marriage friendly with Gentile families, through personal relationship, family relationship.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">JF: Were you in a public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">HF: Yes, yes, there was no Jewish day school in my hometown, and since my schooling was finished before the advent of Hitler, in 1931 there was no problem as far as Jews attending public schools was concerned.</span> <span id="s68">I went through regular high school, and I finished with a diploma in the year ‘31.</span> <span id="s69">There were incidents, antisemitic incidents, already at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">JF: Can you describe them to me?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">HF: Well, people kept away from me because I was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">JF: Was this still while you were in high school or earlier?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">HF: Well, earlier I do not think there were any anti-Jewish incidents, but in high school there were people belonged to national organizations, nationalistic organizations, I should call them, and were not very friendly to Jews.</span> <span id="s74">I still remember one incident where one was not nice to me all the time because of his antisemitic attitudes.</span> <span id="s75">He wanted help during a test and I refused to help him and he then handed a note over to me, “Typical of a Jewish…” The same person, unfortunately, I should say, was killed in the Second World War so…</span></p> <p><span id="s76">JF: As a child growing up, did you have non-Jewish friends as well as Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">HF: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s78">As a matter of fact in the beginning of my schooling I had only Gentile friends.</span> <span id="s79">Later on, it changed.</span> <span id="s80">We were only three Jews in our class and one unfortunately died, natural causes, when he was about 13 years old.</span> <span id="s81">Then we were only two, and this one, this other Jew who was in my class became my best friend, very good friends.</span> <span id="s82">He then, he died about 12 years ago in Israel.</span> <span id="s83">He was in a kibbutz, Dalia.</span> <span id="s84">I visited his widow when I was in Israel in 1972 and I am still friendly with his widow who wants to visit us here in America during this year.</span> <span id="s85">Generally, there were Jews who were well known, who had Gentile acquaintances.</span> <span id="s86">I cannot say whether here in America, Jews are in better terms with Gentiles or whether if in Germany Jews were more friendly with Gentiles.</span> <span id="s87">I do not know.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">JF: Were your parents involved with Christian families?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">HF: Well…</span></p> <p><span id="s90">JF: Socially?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">HF: We had a cousin who was a Christian and, of course, my parents were very friendly with him, but he was related to us through marriage.</span> <span id="s92">Otherwise I do not think we had any social relationships with Gentiles, I cannot remember, except this cousin of course that my parents liked very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">JF: And, your home was not observant as far as…</span></p> <p><span id="s94">HF: Let me [laughing]--especially as long as my grandfather lived with us, he wanted my mother to make him a kosher household.</span> <span id="s95">And as long as he was there, there was something like a kosher home.</span> <span id="s96">Later on when he passed away, I don’t think there was much kashrut observance in our house.</span> <span id="s97">But we didn’t have pig, at least, so it was [unclear] kosher.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">JF: Were your parents involved in any Jewish organizations in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">HF: Yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s100">There was the B’nai B‘rith Lodge to which my father belonged.</span> <span id="s101">My father was very active in Jewish organizations.</span> <span id="s102">In addition to the community to which we belonged by the fact that we were Jews, we had to belong unless you declared before the courts that you wanted to be a Jew without belonging to the community, you had to belong and pay taxes to the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s103">That’s different from American.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">JF: In the Gemeinde.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">HF: That’s correct, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">JF: Now if you did not want to, you had to declare so before a court.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">HF: Yes.</span> <span id="s108">For instance, the Orthodox had a special privilege to leave the Gemeinde because they formed their own Gemeinde, so they had to go.</span> <span id="s109">Let’s say the parents of my wife, they had to go before they moved to Germany, they had to go before the court in Wiesbaden.</span> <span id="s110">No.</span> <span id="s111">When the parents of my wife moved to Wiesbaden, they wanted to join the Orthodox community, and in order to do so they had to go before a court and declare that they want to leave the Gemeinde and become members of the Orthodox community.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">JF: The court was under whose auspices?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">HF: It was a general governmental court.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">JF: A German governmental court?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">HF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">JF: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">HF: That was a law that came out in the year 1876 under the influence of Samson Raphael Hirsch, only in Prussia, not in all of Germany, only the province of Prussia that it stipulated that any Jew may leave the Jewish community and still remain a Jew.</span> <span id="s118">This was for the benefit of Orthodox people who did not want to contribute money to the general community because the general community used in their synagogue on organ and that was against their principles so they could declare--but, as I say, only in Prussia and Wiesbaden was part of Prussia.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">JF: At what point did you decide that you wanted to go into the rabbinate?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">HF: Actually I wasn’t so sure about it at all.</span> <span id="s121">And even today I don’t even know that it was the right thing for me to do.</span> <span id="s122">But as I say, I had a love affair with Judaism.</span> <span id="s123">And I found that this was the only way in which I could learn something or something more about Judaism.</span> <span id="s124">So, I felt in order to know as much as possible the best thing is I attend a rabbinical school and once I was there already it was the most natural thing that I slide into that profession.</span> <span id="s125">I think that I could have lived even without it.</span> <span id="s126">I mean that I don’t think that I felt that it was absolutely necessary for me to be a rabbi but, as things happened, with the way it turned out...</span></p> <p><span id="s127">JF: Which seminary did you attend?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">HF: Well, this is a good question that you ask me, because in Germany there were three places where you could be or become an ordained rabbi.</span> <span id="s129">One seminary was in Breslau.</span> <span id="s130">It was the oldest one.</span> <span id="s131">And Berlin had two, one Orthodox and one Liberal.</span> <span id="s132">Now you would think that according to my feeling it would have been the right thing for me to go to the Orthodox seminary, but I did not, and I could not, because they would never have accepted me.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">JF: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">HF: Number one, lack of Hebrew knowledge.</span> <span id="s135">Number two, a rabbi would have to confirm the fact that I come from an Orthodox family; I did not.</span> <span id="s136">So they wouldn’t have accepted me.</span> <span id="s137">And, I don’t think, I am doubtful whether I would have stayed there very long.</span> <span id="s138">Of course, the need of learning Talmud was very great and I know that even some who came from Orthodox families were told that they could not tolerate them because they didn’t learn enough Talmud, even after they were accepted.</span> <span id="s139">So they had no other choice.</span> <span id="s140">The only choice I had was between Breslau and Berlin and everybody told me that Breslau seminary was on a decline downwards and Berlin is still a good seminary.</span> <span id="s141">They had famous teachers there like Rabbi, like Dr. Elbogen, Dr. Guttmann and Dr. L. Baeck at the time and so...</span></p> <p><span id="s142">JF: This was the Hochschule?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">HF: Yes.</span> <span id="s144">Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums.</span> <span id="s145">It is correct.</span> <span id="s146">So, I went there from ‘31 till ‘37.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">JF: Can you tell me about your experience during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">HF: Well, actually I was not too happy there.</span> <span id="s149">Because school was very liberal and I didn’t like it but I had no way of changing it.</span> <span id="s150">School had not even a mezuzah at the doors.</span> <span id="s151">School was under the influence of Geiger that was founder of the school.</span> <span id="s152">I did not find there the atmosphere, the religious atmosphere that I was longing for.</span> <span id="s153">I didn’t find there the type of company that I was longing for.</span> <span id="s154">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s155">JF: What do you mean by that?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">HF: Like-minded people.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">JF: The students were of a different nature than...</span></p> <p><span id="s158">HF: More or less.</span> <span id="s159">Yes.</span> <span id="s160">I found the one who became my friend who lives now in Jerusalem as I mentioned before.</span> <span id="s161">His name was Fischer and he was like me.</span> <span id="s162">He came from Poland and he came actually to this school because he didn’t know about the fact that there was another school that was Orthodox.</span> <span id="s163">He thought it was the only one that existed.</span> <span id="s164">That’s the way he got stuck there.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">JF: Were the other students more interested in the scholarly aspects or the academic aspects and not as much in the traditional observance?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">HF: Yes.</span> <span id="s167">Yes.</span> <span id="s168">We had very serious scholars in our school among the teachers as well as among the students who became later famous through their scholarly work.</span> <span id="s169">Others played their role in the Reform movement.</span> <span id="s170">Just now the New Torah came out with the explanations by Rabbi Plaut.</span> <span id="s171">Rabbi Plaut was originally a student of the Hochschule and there are quite a number of Reform rabbis today who are prominent former students of the Hochschule with whom I had associated there.</span> <span id="s172">Others are now in the Conservative rabbinate.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">JF: Was the training, the religious aspect of the training sufficient, do you feel, in the Hochschule for what you were looking for?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">HF: No.</span> <span id="s175">Unfortunately, I must say no.</span> <span id="s176">We learned Talmud, where I felt that the Orthodox were learning too much, we definitely learned too little.</span> <span id="s177">I mean, we still could, I still should say we can compete with what is taught today at the Jewish Theological Seminary.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">JF: Here?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">HF: Here, and we learned definitely more than is taught here at the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati.</span> <span id="s180">When, at one time, Cincinnati took over about--after the advent of Hitler, in order to help us--took over, six volunteers who wanted to go to America.</span> <span id="s181">One of them was Plaut whom I mentioned to you before and as far as Talmudical knowledge was concerned, they were considered scholars there, so it shows you how relative everything is as far as knowledge is concerned.</span> <span id="s182">I personally felt we did not learn enough, not in enough time, not enough energy was devoted to us.</span> <span id="s183">And not enough understanding for the needs of the student who came from a western Jewish home.</span> <span id="s184">Because we had there many students who came from Poland and Russia.</span> <span id="s185">They knew, many of them knew Talmud very well.</span> <span id="s186">They didn’t come there for Talmudical studies.</span> <span id="s187">So, there was this discrepancy, on one hand, the German-Jewish student who had hardly any knowledge and on the other hand, the Polish-Russian student, who was already a scholar when he came to the seminary, the Hochschule.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">JF: But, unless you came from an Orthodox family and already had some Talmudic knowledge you were not permitted to go to the Orthodox seminary from what you are telling me.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">HF: That is correct.</span> <span id="s190">Yes, that is correct.</span> <span id="s191">They were not interested in making converts, like the Lubavitcher here in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">JF: You couldn’t switch tracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">HF: No, no, in order to go there, if I would have to go there, I would have to go, at least, as I learned later, to be made kosher by going to a yeshiva for one year and then maybe would be acceptable.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">JF: Were there academic requirements in any other university in addition to the Hochschule?</span> <span id="s195">Did you have to take courses of study in any German university, in addition?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">HF: Well, in order to be a rabbi in Germany it was generally done that you had to acquire the Ph.D. degree.</span> <span id="s197">If you didn’t you weren’t excluded from the rabbinate, but that was the general way and the rabbis in Germany were, I would say, 90, 95 per cent in the same time Doctors of Philosophy.</span> <span id="s198">So, it was expected from a student of the Hochschule that he would spend at least half of the time at the Berlin University.</span> <span id="s199">I personally also studied at the Berlin University, philosophy and Oriental languages, like Arabic, Syriac, and, but, I went then to the city that is now famous, but at that time it wasn’t so famous as a capital of western Germany, Bonn.</span> <span id="s200">I went to the city of Bonn where I graduated with a Ph.D. in the year 1935.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">JF: What school was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">HF: It was the University of Bonn.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">JF: The University of Bonn.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">HF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">JF: You were doing this at the same time that you were pursuing your rabbinical studies?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">HF: When I went to Bonn for one year I took a leave of absence from the Hochschule for the purpose of doctorate.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">JF: Why did you switch to the University of Bonn?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">HF: Very simple.</span> <span id="s209">Because the requirements in the University of Berlin were very difficult and I felt it was too hard for me to do it.</span> <span id="s210">Most of the students did not graduate at the Berlin University.</span> <span id="s211">Most of them went either to Bonn or Wurzberg or other university cities where it was a little easier.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">JF: You said that it was most prevalent than it was not required that you have a Ph.D.</span> <span id="s213">?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">HF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">JF: You could still be ordained?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">HF: Be acceptable as a rabbi in Germany without a Ph.D., but most congregations wanted to call their rabbi, Herr Doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">JF: As opposed to Rabbi?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">HF: Herr Rabbiner was not well-liked in Germany as a consequence of the Emancipation.</span> <span id="s219">The name Rabbiner was not very well-liked.</span> <span id="s220">Also it would have been acceptable, but generally it belonged to it.</span> <span id="s221">It was part of the rabbinical study you must have university training.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">JF: Did you have any experience during those years with either Rosenzweig or Buber or any of the off-shoots of the Lehrhaus in Frankfurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">HF: Well, Rosenzweig died at the time that I was a student.</span> <span id="s224">Buber was not a teacher in our school and he also left for Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s225">I don’t know which year he left Germany, but also early.</span> <span id="s226">So I had no direct connection with either Rosenzweig or Buber.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">JF: And what about Leo Baeck?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">HF: Leo Baeck, yes.</span> <span id="s229">He was prominent in our school, and I was one of the few who did not fully appreciate him.</span> <span id="s230">For very personal reasons, I would say.</span> <span id="s231">He kept aloof from the students.</span> <span id="s232">He just entered the hall in which he was teaching and gave his lecture or taught us and left again.</span> <span id="s233">The only time when I had personal contact with him, and he himself was surprised that he didn’t know certain things and I didn’t know it, was when I met him in the year 1947 in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s234">And I visited him in his hotel.</span> <span id="s235">After all that had passed in all these years, then all of a sudden we felt that we had certain things in common, we knew certain things, but while he was a teacher, he did not know anything about me personally and I had no direct contact with him.</span> <span id="s236">This was one thing that disturbed me, his being so far aloof from the students.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">JF: From all the students.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">HF: I wouldn’t say from all of them, but most of them.</span> <span id="s239">Then, that personally reminded him of certain things that he said prior to Hitler, and during the Hitler time and I was sure that I was right and in Philadelphia, reminding him of these things, he denied them.</span> <span id="s240">For instance, he had said that you should stay in Germany but should keep a line open so that in the last moment you still could, would be able to leave Germany.</span> <span id="s241">Things that was just academical, theoretical.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">JF: At what point did he say that, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">HF: Well, he said it while we were students, while we were, while he was teaching us.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">JF: That he felt that you should stay in Germany, and only leave if it was absolutely necessary at the end?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">HF: He personally did so.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">JF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">HF: But not everybody came out the way he did come out.</span> <span id="s248">Healthy.</span> <span id="s249">And he was lucky this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">JF: Were you familiar with his works with organizing the Jewish community during the ‘30s, as he was also your professor?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">HF: Yes.</span> <span id="s252">Yes.</span> <span id="s253">He was, I mean, as a scholar and as a man, as a person, he was special.</span> <span id="s254">He was something that not everybody could emulate.</span> <span id="s255">For instance, he would get up in the morning at 3:00 and start studying because he said at that time he said, “Nobody disturbs me.”</span> <span id="s256">In other words, five, four or five hours of sleep would be plenty, would be enough for him.</span> <span id="s257">And while he was a great scholar, at the same time he could be the President of the Reichsvertretung der Juden in Deutschland, and do a lot of organization work.</span> <span id="s258">Also, I have...</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s260">JF: This is tape 1, side 2 of an interview with Dr. Helmut Frank on February 19th, 1982.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">HF: You see, the fact that he was called in this organization, the Reichsvertretung, he was called the Cardinal, shows already that people considered him the dignified person, but the actual work was not done by him.</span> <span id="s262">Daily work.</span> <span id="s263">He was just the important person who was considered, without having the actual title, the Chief Rabbi of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">JF: He didn’t actually have that title officially?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">HF: No, there was nothing in the constitution of the Jewish community, of the Jewish congregation that would permit anybody to be the Chief Rabbi, but he was considered like a Chief Rabbi.</span> <span id="s266">If he came to the congregation, people felt, like, maybe I should say, that in comparison like the Pope comes to the Catholic church.</span> <span id="s267">That’s how people felt about him in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">JF: What role do you think he was most active in the Reichsvertretung?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">HF: Well, if I would be honest, I would say that he gave his name, his prestige and his knowledge for the benefit of this organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">JF: Was it Baeck who was in contact with the Nazi government more than anyone else?</span> <span id="s271">Or was someone else in that role?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">HF: Now, that is a difficult question because, at one time, he described how people tried to get him in contact with some minor officials of the Nazi party, but it didn’t help much.</span> <span id="s273">It didn’t help him, it didn’t help the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s274">For instance, the Nazis had, for instance, the practice of, when they would arrest Jews, they wouldn’t come at 7:00 or at 9:00 in the morning or at 8:00 at night.</span> <span id="s275">They would come in the middle of the night in order to frighten them more.</span> <span id="s276">So they came to Baeck and he himself told us at 3:00 in the morning, and they thought they could chase him out of bed.</span> <span id="s277">That would have been what the Nazis would have liked but to their great surprise, they found him at his desk working.</span> <span id="s278">So this was different.</span> <span id="s279">But, I mean, he himself had no special privileges from the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">JF: You said that they came to his home.</span> <span id="s281">Were they about to take him?</span> <span id="s282">To deport him?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">HF: No, at that time he was arrested as a prominent member of the B’nai B’rith Lodge, but it was only temporary arrest.</span> <span id="s284">He was deported later on to Theresienstadt, as is known to you and to most people.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">JF: Who else, then, in the group do you feel was a significant?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">HF: Well, the most significant, as far as the students were concerned, was Professor Elbogen, and he really cared for the students.</span> <span id="s287">We used to visit him at least once every term in his home, and he was like a father to all of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">JF: What position, he was a professor and he had an official position in the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">HF: In the Hochschule it was like that, the term of the president of the school changed from year to year, but it made very little difference whether Elbogen was president or somebody else was.</span> <span id="s290">He was the actual president whether he had the title for that term or not.</span> <span id="s291">So, if you wanted to have something that was something special, you had to clear with him, with nobody else, because he was as I say the actual president, the actual leader of the school.</span> <span id="s292">Nobody else was.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">JF: What was the relationship between the students in the Hochschule and those in the Breslau seminary and in the Orthodox seminary?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">HF: I can speak only about the Orthodox seminary because not only were we in Berlin, we were on the same street.</span> <span id="s295">We were about less than five minutes walk from each other, so we met often.</span> <span id="s296">The relationship as far as personal, social relationship was, I should say, was good; when we met, there was no discrimination in any way.</span> <span id="s297">I personally knew quite a number of the Orthodox Jews.</span> <span id="s298">Breslau students, of course, Breslau students, unless we met in certain places outside of Berlin, in Breslau, I would have not known anyone of them.</span> <span id="s299">There was no meeting with them, no organized meeting with students of Breslau.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">JF: Was there much conflict theoretically between the two groups that presented any problems?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">HF: I do not think so, for a simple reason.</span> <span id="s302">The Orthodox, students I mean, would be interested only in Orthodox synagogues and congregations.</span> <span id="s303">We would be interested only in Liberal synagogues, so we both went different ways.</span> <span id="s304">Sometimes we would meet, but very rarely in synagogues I would say.</span> <span id="s305">Sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">JF: Was there any requirement during the time that you were in the Hochschule of any kind of social work experience working in the Jewish community in some kind of social agency?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">HF: Yes, those who wanted it could take special courses.</span> <span id="s308">I remember there the name of Ohlendorf, a man who became well-known in Germany, as a social, Jewish social worker.</span> <span id="s309">Those who wanted to take that line could do it.</span> <span id="s310">I did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">JF: This was an optional.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">HF: Optional, yes.</span> <span id="s313">In my time at least, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">JF: Your education in the universities either in Berlin or in Bonn was not affected by the Nazi restrictions during those years.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">HF: I cannot, no, I cannot say that, you see.</span> <span id="s316">I was, I entered the university in 1931, but when the Nazi Party took over the rule in Germany, I was still in the university.</span> <span id="s317">So, at that time I was lucky that I was kept in the university due to the fact that I had been there before.</span> <span id="s318">Had I not been there before, I would not have been able to been admitted unless my father would have been--at that time, they had this law--had been a front line fighter in the Second World War, then I wouldn’t have been admitted.</span> <span id="s319">That was a rule at that time, so...</span></p> <p><span id="s320">JF: And when you transferred to Bonn, that was legal?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">HF: Yes, the fact that I was already in the university before was O.K., but, unless I would have found a man who was my professor there who was a real good friend of the Jews, Professor Kahle, K-A-H-L-E, I think, I think I wouldn’t have been graduated there.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">JF: This is in Bonn, you are speaking of.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">HF: This is a real good friend of the Jews and had the same faith as the Jews.</span> <span id="s324">He had to leave Germany later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">JF: Did you see an increase of antisemitism within the universities themselves between ‘33 and ‘35?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">HF: Well, you see, what I could see was that many of the Gentile students would think of the future and the future was a Nazi state.</span> <span id="s327">So, even if before they had their doubts about Nazism, when they thought of their own future they felt they had to join the party or the more or less military divisions of the party like SA and SS.</span> <span id="s328">I remember, in at that time, I went with a student of theology, a Christian student of theology in Bonn, I went with him to college, he had his Nazi uniform on and he didn’t mind walking with me and I didn’t mind walking with him, at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">JF: This was what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">HF: It was ‘35.</span> <span id="s331">This was still possible, theoretically.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">JF: Did you discuss it with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">HF: No, no, I wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s334">I wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s335">I would never discuss it with him.</span> <span id="s336">But among the teachers, strangely enough, even among Catholics, we had real Nazis.</span> <span id="s337">Now, I have to tell you a story.</span> <span id="s338">So, in Germany, we had all examinations, all written examinations for the doctorate.</span> <span id="s339">The written examination was your thesis, but there was connected with this an oral examination.</span> <span id="s340">So I had chosen the oriental languages, as was a field of Dr. Professor Kahle, that I mentioned before, and I had to take two minors, so I had taken philosophy and I had taken history of religion.</span> <span id="s341">So, I was not too much afraid of oriental languages since this was with my friend Kahle, and also the history of religion, was a real friend of the Jews, who was the professor of that.</span> <span id="s342">But in philosophy I had attended lectures by a Catholic professor who taught some kind of Catholic philosophy, and I felt sure with him.</span> <span id="s343">But at that time then they changed the rules, then, in philosophy you cannot select your professor, you have to select a professor whose term it is to test you.</span> <span id="s344">And it happened to be that they selected for me as my professor to test me a man whose brother was a leading minister of Austria.</span> <span id="s345">I forget his name but he was the Secretary of State like Haig in America today, in Austria, and he was a brother, and I know he was a Nazi and he was supposed to test me in the philosophy.</span> <span id="s346">Can you imagine with which feelings I went for the oral examination.</span> <span id="s347">And then the great miracle happened.</span> <span id="s348">Either he did not know that I was Jewish, or he did not want to know that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s349">He was the most cooperating professor I ever met.</span> <span id="s350">He made it so easy for me when he saw that I knew a certain part of philosophy well, he let me talk, and I could show him everything that I learned and he was a real darling.</span> <span id="s351">[laughter] So, since you asked me about experiences...</span></p> <p><span id="s352">JF: That’s wonderful.</span> <span id="s353">Now, you mentioned before the Professor Kahle that you were so close to.</span> <span id="s354">That at a later point he came to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">HF: Yes, at a later point what happened was that on the 10th of November [1938] when businesses were plundered and destroyed by the Nazis, his wife who was the daughter of a Christian minister, went to those stores and helped Jews to find their belongings, part of their belongings, which he helped Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">JF: This was at Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">HF: Yes, and after that, and of course it was soon that he was denounced to the authorities and the professor had to leave, he and his wife for England.</span> <span id="s358">I mean he had to leave Germany unless he would be arrested so he, he had the same faith like the Jews.</span> <span id="s359">He died in London.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">JF: Were there any other changes that affected you during, say, the period from ‘33 to ‘35 and the onset of the Nuremberg Laws?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">HF: Well, you saw the famous “J” on my passport, my book that I had for showing to the authorities in which the professor had to testify that I took part in certain classes.</span> <span id="s362">That also had a “J”.</span> <span id="s363">Of course, there were certain Nazi festivals, holidays which I was not permitted to take part, so we felt discrimination but it was one of the facts of life that we couldn’t change.</span> <span id="s364">There were American students, quite a number of them who came to Germany to the medical school because they were not admitted in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">JF: They came during the ‘30’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">HF: They came during the Hitler time.</span> <span id="s367">Strangely enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">JF: And they were admitted.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">HF: They were admitted.</span> <span id="s370">They did not fall--they were not considered Jews, they were considered Americans.</span> <span id="s371">While German-Jews could not become doctors, American Jews could.</span> <span id="s372">Isn’t that strange?</span> <span id="s373">So, I met a number of them, whose name I saw later on here in America who studied in Germany at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">JF: And they had no difficulty in leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">HF: Leaving what?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">JF: Germany, before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">HF: Oh, I guess they left before the war broke out, but, during that time of studies they had no trouble.</span> <span id="s378">They were not discriminated against.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">JF: Were they considered Jews in any respect?</span> <span id="s380">Did any of their papers fall under that?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">HF: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s382">They, of course, kept us Jews from Germany company but officially they were considered Americans, not Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">JF: What about your family during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">HF: Well, my father was a business man, and my father was at this time in his life very optimistic, and he could not believe that the Nazis would do the real bad things.</span> <span id="s385">Our rabbi sometimes was even, making even jokes about my father being so optimistic.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">JF: He never spoke of leaving Germany then?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">HF: Yes, we did.</span> <span id="s388">At one time there was an offer for me while I was still not finished yet but I had an offer to go to South America and I discussed it with my father and maybe I should say I was happy my father said to me, “Don’t we want to keep the family together?</span> <span id="s389">Don’t leave.”</span> <span id="s390">I think I was happy because I was the type of person who would have hated to leave Germany and leave the family alone not knowing when we would see each other again.</span> <span id="s391">So, I was happy that my father said it to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">JF: What was this opportunity?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">HF: There were some South American congregations that wanted to help German Jews and future rabbis and employ them there even while they were not finished.</span> <span id="s394">I wasn’t finished yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">JF: So, this was directed towards rabbinical students, this offer.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">HF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">JF: Did you personally think of leaving during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">HF: At one time Professor Elbogen who was a historian, used to say, “See, the Nazis all the time, they tried to destroy Jews but still when the Jews are here they have to live with them.”</span> <span id="s399">That was approximately what he said in the beginning of the Nazi time, because he did not know about the Final Solution, he could not figure that such a thing would happen at that time.</span> <span id="s400">So, that’s how we felt.</span> <span id="s401">There will be as much as during the medieval times there was a Jewish community in Germany in those countries where there was persecution of Jews.</span> <span id="s402">He felt there must be a German community even if the young people leave there will be old people who have to be taken care of.</span> <span id="s403">There will be, they will let us live.</span> <span id="s404">What kind of life?</span> <span id="s405">It will be hard, but they will let us live.</span> <span id="s406">We never thought, or at that time, let’s put it this way, we never thought that the time would come when we would have to--when we would face a question of life or death, to leave Germany or have to face death at a later time.</span> <span id="s407">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s408">JF: What happened to your father as far as his business was concerned during the Aryanization period?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">HF: Well, after the Kristallnacht his business was destroyed.</span> <span id="s410">He had a wine business and all the wine that was available was poured out...</span></p> <p><span id="s411">JF: This was a shop that he had?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">HF: Yes.</span> <span id="s413">Yes.</span> <span id="s414">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">JF: Up until that time he still had his shop, then until Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">HF: Yes, he had a wholesale business of wine and up to this time he was actively engaged in the wine business.</span> <span id="s417">After that he had to give it up and he was then busy by just trying to sell whatever was left.</span> <span id="s418">But he could not work any more as he did before.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">JF: At what point were you ordained?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">HF: I was ordained in ‘37.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">JF: In ‘37.</span> <span id="s422">Before we move on to the period of your life after that, is there anything else about those years before 1937 that you would like to tell us about?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">HF: Well, as I say, today it seemed to be an easy time because I was following my course of studying and could do as I pleased within certain restrictions, and I had a future at least, I believed I had a future as a rabbi in Germany.</span> <span id="s424">It turned out different, but from what came later in the years ‘40 to ‘45, it seemed everything today from that point of view it seemed to be very easy.</span> <span id="s425">I didn’t have any problems.</span> <span id="s426">In the year 1937 I was appointed rabbi of the congregation in Worms.</span> <span id="s427">My predecessor had left for Israel, Palestine, as it was called at that time, and I was there for the High Holidays.</span> <span id="s428">The first time that the synagogue was sufficient for the Worms Jewish community, because in former years there was a synagogue across the street from the Old Shul called the Levy Synagogue, was used for a service during the High Holidays for those who did not have tickets for the Old Synagogue.</span> <span id="s429">But for the first time that I was there in 1937 there was no need for a second service.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">JF: You say this other synagogue was called the Levy Synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">HF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">JF: It sounds like a Sephardic name.</span> <span id="s433">Is there any history of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">HF: No, the history of that synagogue was like this.</span> <span id="s435">A rich man did not behave well in the Old Synagogue in about the year 1860, and the gabai in charge asked the man to be quiet.</span> <span id="s436">And he came a second time and asked him to be quiet and he did not help and he came a third time and it did not help, and the man said, “If you don’t like it the way I behave in shul I will build my own shul.”</span> <span id="s437">And it was not an empty threat, because he had the means to build another shul and what he did, he acquired a building across the street of the Old Synagogue and built another synagogue and this synagogue was according to his name--his name was Levy--so it was called the Levy Synagogue.</span> <span id="s438">So, in the meantime, the congregation in later times became much larger, they could use the--congregation who had acquired the building, then later on, the later generations who were not interested in the doings of their father, they had it given as a present to the congregation, used that building for a second service on the High Holidays, sometimes for lectures.</span> <span id="s439">In my time in that synagogue was converted to a gymnasium because we didn’t have one and the children who attended the Jewish school and didn’t have a gymnasium.</span> <span id="s440">There was no need any more for a second synagogue so we converted it to a gymnasium.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">JF: This was a Jewish gymnasium now?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">HF: Yes.</span> <span id="s443">And still the Nazis tried to destroy whatever furniture was still--they didn’t know about that--so when the 10th of November came they still destroyed it.</span> <span id="s444">Today it’s completely erased by American bombs.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">JF: The synagogue in Worms at that time was what denomination?</span> <span id="s446">You were trained as a Liberal.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">HF: It was, I would say, Liberal, but very conservatively Liberal.</span> <span id="s448">The only Liberal thing was, as I say, the employment of an organ and the choir, but the ritual of the synagogue followed exactly the Orthodox ritual.</span> <span id="s449">Men and women were sitting in separate buildings.</span> <span id="s450">So, later on, when the organist left for London we did not have an organ, I mean that the organ was not used any more.</span> <span id="s451">Today’s reconstructed synagogue does not have an organ.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">JF: You said to me before that when you were hired, you were also hired as a cantor?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">HF: Not at that time.</span> <span id="s454">The cantor was--there was still a cantor there, but the cantor also emigrated about a half a year later and I told them I could do his job since I was always interested in chazanut and so I had both jobs as a rabbi and a cantor of the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">JF: Can you tell me the story of the young girl who gave you the music, as you told me before?</span> <span id="s456">[prior to taping]</span></p> <p><span id="s457">HF: Well, she was a product of a divorced marriage, and was educated in the home of her grandmother and her cousin.</span> <span id="s458">Her cousin was our organist, Miss Honig, who is still alive and now lives in England; she left the summer of ‘38, I think it was.</span> <span id="s459">She left for England and since that time there was no more music, no more instrumental music in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s460">So, that is the story of why I was also a chazan.</span> <span id="s461">In the time that I was, the congregation became diminished day by day through emigration.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">JF: Before we go on, the young girl whose aunt had been there gave you something which...</span></p> <p><span id="s463">HF: She was, this was a very musical family.</span> <span id="s464">Her cousin was very musical--excuse me, I shouldn’t say her cousin, it was her aunt who was the organist.</span> <span id="s465">It was her aunt and she was very musical and even she could, she could play something on the organ if I would ask her, but she couldn’t accompany a whole service.</span> <span id="s466">When she gave me those musical notes that you saw before...</span></p> <p><span id="s467">JF: This was the music for the regular cantorial...</span></p> <p><span id="s468">HF: Well, what she gave me was mostly the congregational singing.</span> <span id="s469">The music for the chazan was to the chazan and I had a volume of Lewandowski, a German Jewish composer that I already studied before I came to Worms and with that music I was very familiar.</span> <span id="s470">There was no problem for me to sing this music.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">JF: So that this music that this child wrote at the age of 11 was the congregational part of the service?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">HF: Yes, what they used.</span> <span id="s473">They used Lewandowski, they used Japhet, they used Sulzer and they used a modern Jewish composer by the name of Adler, Hugo Adler who came later to America and passed away, he was also in some synagogue a musical director.</span> <span id="s474">And, as I told you, unfortunately, that child was later on deported with his [her] grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">JF: And, she was deported in 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">HF: [long pause] That is correct, yes.</span> <span id="s477">So, which part of my activities would you want me to describe?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">JF: Let’s talk for a minute about the history of the synagogue.</span> <span id="s479">Perhaps you can describe that to me, and then we will go into your activities.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">HF: Well, I mean there were books written on that.</span> <span id="s481">It’s one of the oldest congregations, if not the oldest one in Germany.</span> <span id="s482">Köln was probably as old as Worms...</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Tape two, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s484">JF: This is tape 2, side 1 of an interview with Dr. Helmut Frank on February 19, 1982 with Josey Fisher.</span> <span id="s485">You were beginning to tell me a little bit about the history of the Worms Synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">HF: Well, when I tell you that the Worms Synagogue was built in 1034 we must assume that the congregation exists very much longer.</span> <span id="s487">So, some say Jews were already in Worms with the Romans.</span> <span id="s488">That would be many centuries earlier, but we definitely know that 1034 was the building time of the synagogue and I don’t think there are too many other synagogues in the world that can boast being in existence more than 900 years.</span> <span id="s489">If I speak just for one minute of the synagogue.</span> <span id="s490">The synagogue’s fate was not always an easy one.</span> <span id="s491">There were times in wars and persecutions that the synagogue was partially destroyed.</span> <span id="s492">So what happened on the Kristallnacht of November ‘38 was, in a way, nothing unique.</span> <span id="s493">The only difference was the wholesale destruction, as it happened, was for the first time, and it had to be in order to be completely reconstructed.</span> <span id="s494">The Jews, when they rebuilt the destroyed synagogue in the medieval times, had always some place to continue to add, to correct from what was destroyed by the enemies.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">The greatest change in the community life was the beginning of the Emancipation, the new time that came with Napoleon when he ruled in Worms after the year 1806 and the new time that was, as far as the synagogue was concerned, was initiated by breaking down the wall that separated men and women in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s496">And at that time already was they had only Orthodox rabbis while looking for Liberal rabbis.</span> <span id="s497">But there were still many traditionally-minded Jews in Worms so they found a compromise.</span> <span id="s498">Not a man who is half Liberal and half Orthodox, but they left an Orthodox rabbi and engaged a person with him together, whom they called preacher and that was a Liberal rabbi.</span> <span id="s499">So, at one time both officiated together.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">JF: They called the Liberal rabbi a preacher?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">HF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">JF: And, what was his function then?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">HF: To preach.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">JF: That was totally his function?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">HF: Yes, and the Orthodox rabbi was to what they call in the Yiddish paskin sheilas, to answer the religious questions, as they came up every day and, by the way, the person who was a preacher, the Liberal preacher at that time became famous later on.</span> <span id="s506">In America, his name was Jastrow the man who wrote the Talmudic dictionary.</span> <span id="s507">Jastrow’s dictionary and as far as Philadelphia was concerned, he was later on rabbi in Rodeph Shalom in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s508">He died here in Philadelphia.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">JF: So, about what time was this that there was still the split?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">HF: It was about between 1840 and 1860, 1870.</span> <span id="s511">At that time they didn’t have an organ yet, but at one time a man gave a donation of 1000 marks, and that was a lot of money at that time, for the purchase of an organ and that the congregation could not refuse.</span> <span id="s512">And so they put on, even though it really didn’t fit into that environment of that old synagogue which is named after Rashi they put in an organ at that time.</span> <span id="s513">But, as I say, this was actually the only reform that they had in the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">JF: The organ?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">HF: The organ, together with the singing with the organ.</span> <span id="s516">That was the only thing.</span> <span id="s517">Otherwise, the order with the service was Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">JF: Was the split of rabbinical function something that was done in many other synagogues in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">HF: No.</span> <span id="s520">I think of the many things that were unique to Worms was one for sure.</span> <span id="s521">Because, most congregations they made up their minds either, or.</span> <span id="s522">Usually they were Liberal and then after that, like what happened in Wiesbaden my hometown, a Orthodox minority split up from the large congregation.</span> <span id="s523">But that they had both together at the same time I think that, I don’t think happened anywhere else.</span> <span id="s524">Later on, of course, only Liberal rabbis were hired, and when I was there I think many felt and pointed out they never had such a religious rabbi like I was.</span> <span id="s525">At least as far as they could think back historically.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">JF: Now, you have mentioned the Rashi chair and you have told me that there is a story connected with its preservation.</span> <span id="s527">Could you tell me about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">HF: Yes.</span> <span id="s529">In other words, when, after the burning of the synagogue on the 10th of November, 1938, the chair did not burn because it was out of stone.</span> <span id="s530">But, while I was, after I came back from the concentration camp of Buchenwald--that was in December 1938--I was told by our shamus that, who lived next to the shul on the other side, he saw that workmen came and took out the Rashi chair.</span> <span id="s531">They divided it in three parts and on a truck it was taken away.</span> <span id="s532">Until after the war I had no idea what had happened, but now I know.</span> <span id="s533">There was a Director of Antiquities in the city of Worms who was very friendly to the Jews but couldn’t show it to the outside.</span> <span id="s534">Nominally he had to be a Nazi like everybody else.</span> <span id="s535">We thought he would give it to the Nazis but what happened in reality was he had saved many parts of the Jewish Museum.</span> <span id="s536">During the time of oppression, following the year 1938, he hid them in the Museum of the City of Worms and during the war hid them in the newer part of the Worms Cathedral.</span> <span id="s537">In the Cathedral he hid not only the parts of the Rashi chair, but also many parts of the museum that were confiscated on the 10th of November.</span> <span id="s538">All of the documents, and old mahzorim [High Holiday prayer books] and many of the antiquities of the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s539">I had no idea of what had happened to them.</span> <span id="s540">Only after the war I found out that this man by the name of Illert had taken them into his own safe keeping and, as I said, during the war he had hidden them in the newer part of the Cathedral.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">JF: These were all of the things from the Jewish Museum that were confiscated?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">HF: Well, again a story.</span> <span id="s543">Originally we had them all in the Jewish Museum.</span> <span id="s544">If you remember the picture I showed you that was on the second floor of the Women’s Synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">JF: That is where the museum was?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">HF: Was.</span> <span id="s547">But during my time, even before my time, they felt that this was dangerous to have the Jewish Museum and all these very valuables, very valuable documents, to have them here in this part of the synagogue.</span> <span id="s548">There could be a riot and it might be better to transfer them to the congregational building that was next door where the school was later on was located and the congregation offices were located.</span> <span id="s549">So, that was what happened.</span> <span id="s550">They took them over to the congregational office in the congregational building and that time only they were not accessible any more to the general public who wanted to see the Jewish Museum.</span> <span id="s551">And we--that happened during my time--contemplated selling them all to the Jewish University, to Jerusalem because we were not sure what would happen to them.</span> <span id="s552">But, our secretary, I never can forget that he was more familiar with the Nazi laws and he found out there is a Nazi law, a Nazi law that prohibits sending any kind of valuables for museums out of the country.</span> <span id="s553">So we could not do anything about it.</span> <span id="s554">But, on the 10th of November they were not in the synagogue building.</span> <span id="s555">Whatever was in the synagogue, like all of the Sifrei Torah was burned.</span> <span id="s556">Was lost.</span> <span id="s557">But, the Museum was in the congregational building and I was told when I came back from the concentration camp that somebody from the city had taken off all the treasures of the Museum.</span> <span id="s558">I thought that the Nazis had taken them for their own purposes.</span> <span id="s559">Only after the war I found out that Illert had taken them out and had, as I say, safe-guarded them during the war.</span> <span id="s560">After the war, they were, most of them sent to the Jewish Archive in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s561">Where they are now.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">JF: They man’s name again?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">HF: I-L-L-E-R-T.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">JF: And, the Rashi chair was restored.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">HF: I come back to the Rashi chair.</span> <span id="s566">After the war, of course, Illert came out the truth that he had saved it and it was divided into three parts, and it is in the original, it is in the reconstructed synagogue today.</span> <span id="s567">Those miracles that happen in Jewish history.</span> <span id="s568">That’s one of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">JF: That’s true.</span> <span id="s570">Tell me, then, about your beginnings in 1937 in Worms.</span> <span id="s571">What kind of experience did you have and where was the Nazi pressure?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">HF: As I say, during my time the Nazi pressure increased day by day.</span> <span id="s573">One day it was businesses that were smeared over officially by Nazis with the word Jude.</span> <span id="s574">All the businesses, the show windows were plastered with white color and now this interesting thing is that you could not take it off.</span> <span id="s575">It was done officially, or with official sanction, and you had to wait until police would give them special permission to take all of this off again.</span> <span id="s576">Then there were arrests of Jews who had one time had an encounter with the law, even if it was only, somebody had only not observed a traffic law, They were taken to concentration camps on one day in June 1938.</span> <span id="s577">It was not a pleasant life during that time, and there came a representative of the Reichsvereinigung to Worms.</span> <span id="s578">I will never forget that meeting that we had with him in which he said, “I wish I could give you better news but, unfortunately we heard through the grapevine that things will not become better for Jews.</span> <span id="s579">Just the opposite.</span> <span id="s580">There is no hope, things will become worse.”</span></p> <p><span id="s581">JF: When was this meeting?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">HF: It was, I would say, about June 1938.</span> <span id="s583">It has for me, personally, it has good sides, because I was, I saw so much antisemitism, so much persecution in Worms more than, by the way, than in other cities in Germany, I applied for a immigration then to America, pretty early, and since I was one of the earliest, this application was received here by America, and I received a so-called, out-of-quota visa, that saved my life and I came here just before the war, I came to America.</span> <span id="s584">So, if I would have been in a congregation where there would have been less antisemitism I would have probably wanted to stay there and maybe I would have stayed there too long; I don’t know.</span> <span id="s585">So, everything has its good sides.</span> <span id="s586">At least, that was what happened to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">JF: What kind of experience did you have with the Christian community, as far as any positive acts were concerned?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">HF: I couldn’t say anything because I had no connection with the Christian community except what I had to do officially.</span> <span id="s589">Let’s say I had to visit the prison.</span> <span id="s590">I felt that it’s my duty to visit Jewish prisoners in prison.</span> <span id="s591">Now, let us say they were not discriminating against me.</span> <span id="s592">They did what they felt was the right thing to do.</span> <span id="s593">The, I felt that the prison officials were not unfriendly to Jews.</span> <span id="s594">It was my personal impression.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">JF: You did not feel that the prisoners were receiving any different kind of treatment?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">HF: Definitely not, no.</span> <span id="s597">I remember I visited one prisoner who had gone to Baden Baden.</span> <span id="s598">This was a place that could be compared today to Atlantic City and the gambling that takes place.</span> <span id="s599">They had gambling in Baden-Baden.</span> <span id="s600">And, he told the community, “I am bankrupt, I played in Baden-Baden and lost all of my money.”</span> <span id="s601">For that he was taken to prison.</span> <span id="s602">But, it wasn’t the truth.</span> <span id="s603">In reality, he had taken his money out of Germany to be prepared for his immigration and so he was in prison for a while.</span> <span id="s604">I don’t know for how long, but after that he had it easy in leaving Germany.</span> <span id="s605">He had all his money outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">JF: You mentioned before that the Old Synagogue across the street, the Levy Synagogue, had been converted into a Gymnasium for the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">HF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">JF: Were you involved in the educational process as the Jewish schools took over the education of the Jewish children?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">HF: Yes.</span> <span id="s610">I had a very important position in the congregation, the congregational school.</span> <span id="s611">In other words, I was a teacher for Hebrew, especially for the higher classes.</span> <span id="s612">I was in the school every day.</span> <span id="s613">I had to teach, and the school was a very important part of the rabbinical functions.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">JF: What about the economic situation of the Jews in Worms?</span> <span id="s615">Was the synagogue or the Jewish community involved in any way in helping those who were losing their businesses and in the...</span></p> <p><span id="s616">HF: Definitely.</span> <span id="s617">We had a social office, and we call it in English, Welfare Office, and unfortunately the number of people who were depending upon a gift from the Welfare Office became greater and greater every day.</span> <span id="s618">And this was a very important part of the rabbinical function.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">JF: The Welfare Office, then, was under the auspices of the synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">HF: Yes, of the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s621">Yes.</span> <span id="s622">We had a special man in charge of that.</span> <span id="s623">This was, this job became very important, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s624">It all happened in my time.</span> <span id="s625">The number of Jews became smaller.</span> <span id="s626">The dependencies of Jews on welfare became bigger every day.</span> <span id="s627">In other words, it was a visible decline before the eyes of the rabbi who at the end, after what happened during the Kristallnacht, had to tell the people that, “You must prepare for your immigration, and every day in which you do not prepare and work for it is a lost day for you.”</span></p> <p><span id="s628">JF: You told them this at the time of the Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">HF: After.</span> <span id="s630">Afterwards, at the time of the Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s631">I was arrested and sent to Buchenwald with most of the men of the congregation.</span> <span id="s632">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s633">JF: Can you tell me the details about that, please?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">HF: My wife has heard it long before.</span> <span id="s635">It started very early in the morning.</span> <span id="s636">I must tell you something before because Huttenbach mentions this and he thought this is very important.</span> <span id="s637">A member of the congregation--one of the good members, not, he didn’t have an office, he says it was a vice-president but he was just a member of the congregation-- had called me the day before the Kristallnacht and told me he had heard from other congregations that they have burned synagogues or have damaged the Sifrei Torah and wouldn’t it be a good idea to take our Sifrei Torah--we had 30 of them, 30 Sifrei Torah--to take them out and save them.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">JF: This was how long before the Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">HF: It was the day before.</span> <span id="s640">And, I did not do anything about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">JF: Did you not think it was going to happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">HF: First of all, I wasn’t so sure whether it would happen because of the congregation.</span> <span id="s643">We were a small congregation.</span> <span id="s644">Always the smaller congregations were where antisemitism was, were stronger than in the larger cities.</span> <span id="s645">But even if I would want to save the Sifrei Torah where should I go with it?</span> <span id="s646">Now I take page 33 of the book by Henry Huttenbach, The Life of Herta Mansbacher and read what it says here: “That evening Rabbi Frank received an unusual telephone request from the vice-president of the Jewish community asking him as a precautionary measure to move the scrolls from the synagogue.</span> <span id="s647">Feeling himself utterly unauthorized to take such an unprecedented step, Rabbi Frank decided not to assume responsibility for bringing the 30 historic and priceless Torah scrolls to his lodging.</span> <span id="s648">A fresh graduate from the seminary in Berlin, only 27 years old, and awed by his first appointment to the prestigious Jewish community of Worms, Frank felt it unnecessary to protect the scrolls, unable to imagine what could possibly happen to them.</span> <span id="s649">What took place 12 hours later violated all his basic assumptions about Jewish existence in Germany and taught him instantly what indeed could happen in a civilized society.”</span> <span id="s650">Well, I tell you.</span> <span id="s651">It wasn’t exactly like that.</span> <span id="s652">If I would have taken, as Huttenbach suggested, if I would have taken these Sifrei Torah out of the shul, now how could I take 30 Sifrei Torah out?</span> <span id="s653">30.</span> <span id="s654">I alone could carry one.</span> <span id="s655">But not two.</span> <span id="s656">That would have been a whole procession.</span> <span id="s657">Now that should have gone on without people noticing it?</span> <span id="s658">And even if I would have taken it in our home, then the Nazis would have still, maybe not burned them, but thrown them out of the window and whatever would have happen to them?</span> <span id="s659">Just as my own furniture, my own books that were partly destroyed during the next day.</span> <span id="s660">So, it is not exactly the way Huttenbach describes it here.</span> <span id="s661">And, the man was not a vice-president, as I say.</span> <span id="s662">But, I couldn’t have done anything.</span> <span id="s663">Where should I have gone with the Sifrei Torah?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">JF: You did believe then that this was possible, but, hopefully, it wouldn’t happen because Worms was a larger city.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">HF: It was possible, Unfortunately, at that time, everything was possible.</span> <span id="s666">You could not--there was nothing that you could say from the beginning that cannot happen.</span> <span id="s667">A man who was very smart, who left about ‘37, left shortly after I came there, he told me, “And I tell you something, I believe what will happen to the Jews you could never imagine in your keenest fantasy, or in your dreams.”</span> <span id="s668">Unfortunately, he was right.</span> <span id="s669">He was a man who was eccentric, and nobody believed him, but he could tell you the truth.</span> <span id="s670">So, I want to continue what happened then, the next day.</span> <span id="s671">Very early, I was very tired because the evening before, the Jewish organizations, the youth organization--we had quite a number of them--there were not too many young people there altogether, but they had still a lot of organizations.</span> <span id="s672">They brought their material to my room because they wanted to dissolve.</span> <span id="s673">So my room was filled with all kind of papers and magazines from the organizations, and I was tired, and they called me about quarter of six.</span> <span id="s674">Rabbi Frank, the president, that the synagogue is on fire.</span> <span id="s675">So, you know what I answered him?</span> <span id="s676">“You have to call the fire brigade.”</span></p> <p><span id="s677">JF: You still trusted in the law?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">HF: I didn’t have a better answer, but I got dressed in a hurry and I went on my bike and I traveled to the shul, it wasn’t too far away, it was about ten minutes to walk, but on a bicycle it would take me three, four minutes.</span> <span id="s679">And, I was there, and I saw not the shul was aflame, but there was a fire in the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">JF: Inside?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">HF: Inside.</span> <span id="s682">So, I went in and I saw, yes, there was--the pulpit was burning.</span> <span id="s683">But, it wasn’t a big fire.</span> <span id="s684">I mean it wouldn’t have destroyed the synagogue if that would have really burned a little more.</span> <span id="s685">Meanwhile, I immediately went to the telephone in the house of the shames it was just across the street, called the fire company.</span> <span id="s686">They answered and I told them that they should come right away.</span> <span id="s687">There’s a fire in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s688">“We are so busy,” they said, “that we haven’t got the time now.</span> <span id="s689">We can’t come now.”</span> <span id="s690">At that time I did not understand two things.</span> <span id="s691">First of all, I did not understand why the fire company would not come and I didn’t know that what happened in Worms was happening all over Germany.</span> <span id="s692">I thought it’s a local action.</span> <span id="s693">I didn’t know that this was planned, I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s694">So, I said, “Can we do away with the fire ourselves?”</span> <span id="s695">No answer.</span> <span id="s696">So, meanwhile--in Worms, you know, everything is together, the synagogue, the congregation, the building where the school is, the shames’ house.</span> <span id="s697">So meanwhile, children had come already for the school on the 10th of November.</span> <span id="s698">The schoolhouse was closed.</span> <span id="s699">I did not know why.</span> <span id="s700">It was locked.</span> <span id="s701">I had no key.</span> <span id="s702">There had never been any problem.</span> <span id="s703">The caretaker, a non-Jew, was living in the building.</span> <span id="s704">Only later on I heard that he had gotten orders to lock the building, but I didn’t know anything why he had locked it.</span> <span id="s705">So, the children came and didn’t know where to go, and they were quite cold.</span> <span id="s706">Boys also came.</span> <span id="s707">And, before I could think of anything, they had already buckets filled with water and went to the shul and the fire was out in no time.</span> <span id="s708">And, you will find this all described in this book.</span> <span id="s709">There were Nazis around, although not in uniform on that day, but you could see that they were not friends to the Jews who watched us during this time and when this all was finished I felt I had nothing to do there any more.</span> <span id="s710">I wanted to go home.</span> <span id="s711">And, I looked for my bicycle, I wanted to take my bicycle home, I couldn’t find it.</span> <span id="s712">I looked here and looked there, I thought it was stolen.</span> <span id="s713">And, I say today I believe it wasn’t stolen, I was just so disturbed, so disoriented that I didn’t know where I put it.</span> <span id="s714">I don’t think anybody took it away because later on, a month later when I came back from the concentration camp I heard already there’s a bicycle that was listed as found at the police headquarters.</span> <span id="s715">And I went there and it was my bicycle, so they had found it.</span> <span id="s716">So, while I was looking for the bicycle there was a policeman there whom I had seen already at other occasions, and I see that he had--the boys had helped with the fire, I saw that he rounded them up, but when he saw me, he said to me: “Kommen sie mit, Rabbiner.”</span> <span id="s717">It means, “Come along, Rabbi.”</span> <span id="s718">So, from that moment I was arrested.</span> <span id="s719">We were brought to the police headquarters and were put in the police cells, the four boys and me together.</span> <span id="s720">And, there we stayed until noon time.</span> <span id="s721">Then we were taken out and we were told that we would have to clean up the streets.</span> <span id="s722">What happened was that the Nazis had entered the homes of my congregants and taken and thrown all of the furniture, all of the belongings that they could get a hold of on the street and that was blocking traffic and that cannot be tolerated in Germany, the traffic...</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Tape two, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s724">JF: This is tape two, side two of an interview with Rabbi Helmut Frank.</span> <span id="s725">This is a continuation of the interview started on February 19th, 1982, on February 24th, 1982 with Josey Fisher.</span> <span id="s726">You were talking about the things that had been thrown into the street and the obstruction of the traffic.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">HF: Yes, I just want to say one peculiar episode that happened before that.</span> <span id="s728">You must understand that I was taken to the prison early in the morning.</span> <span id="s729">I hadn’t eaten anything.</span> <span id="s730">We were actually fasting until the moment the police came to take us out.</span> <span id="s731">So that “Can’t we have anything to eat?”</span> <span id="s732">Isn’t it something that as a human being even in prison you should get something to eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">JF: You were purposely fasting.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">HF: No.</span> <span id="s735">I mean, I did not have a chance to eat.</span> <span id="s736">In the morning at six o'clock I left in a big rush to get to the synagogue and from then on I was walking around and then I was taken to the prison and nobody bothered giving us anything to eat.</span> <span id="s737">So, we were very hungry, especially the boys.</span> <span id="s738">But I was hungry too.</span> <span id="s739">So, I said to the policeman, “Couldn’t you give us something to eat?”</span> <span id="s740">So, first of all he went out, then he came back and, “We don’t have anything kosher.”</span> <span id="s741">Not that I had asked for anything kosher.</span> <span id="s742">He gave me that peculiar answer.</span> <span id="s743">“We don’t have anything kosher.”</span> <span id="s744">But, then he still, I guess he was sorry for us, so he brought us some sandwiches, with something, probably butter on it, but he gave us something to eat.</span> <span id="s745">So, then, as I say, we were on the streets and when I saw the picture I saw, let’s say I come to the home, and it was a Jewish house.</span> <span id="s746">What do I see?</span> <span id="s747">From the windows hanging sheets, bedding, whole beds were thrown out of the window but got stuck someplace between the window and the ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">JF: The beds were thrown out?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">HF: Yes, everything.</span> <span id="s750">You must understand, when we entered the rooms, it was completely empty.</span> <span id="s751">Just imagine.</span> <span id="s752">This would have fascinated the Nazis: the closet with all the china and glass in it, because anything that makes noise can be broken in a second-- that fascinated them to throw out.</span> <span id="s753">You would destroy that, anything that...</span></p> <p><span id="s754">JF: So, they made no distinction as to whether they were breaking into shops, or private homes or...</span></p> <p><span id="s755">HF: Well, I think shops were the most vulnerable, because if they knew which shop is Jewish and where to get in and destroy everything--but they had lists of Jewish households, which, for instance--I will tell you a funny story.</span> <span id="s756">A woman just had, she told me later on, just had cleaned up most perfectly her whole house, and then they came and threw everything out, and when I say everything, things that fascinated them were glassware, porcelain, china, typewriters, valuable things to throw out and destroy them by throwing them, so, when they landed in the street, of course, they were not, they couldn’t be used any more, they were broken.</span> <span id="s757">So, that was the picture we saw.</span> <span id="s758">Everything, valuable things.</span> <span id="s759">I still remember one man had a case with liquor and they threw the whole liquor on the street, and then the liquor was found on the street.</span> <span id="s760">I mean the liquid, with broken bottles around.</span> <span id="s761">So, the only thing, of course--the women were still around, the men, some of them were already arrested, the only thing I could say to console them was this reminds me, I said, of the pogroms in Russia which I had read.</span> <span id="s762">But I don’t know whether that was a consolation for them, that I..</span> <span id="s763">.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">JF: You said this to whom?</span></p> <p><span id="s765">HF: You see, when I came to those houses, the picture was not only that those rooms were empty, but that the women, the women and the children whom I knew, most of them, were there completely helpless.</span> <span id="s766">You could imagine what state they were.</span> <span id="s767">A state of shock.</span> <span id="s768">So, I tried, of course, at that moment I still was a rabbi, and I tried to console them but the only thing that came to my mind was to tell them that this reminds me of the pogroms in Russia, what they did to them.</span> <span id="s769">If that was a good consolation, I don’t know, but I reminded them of something that happened years before in a different country.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">JF: They immediately rounded up the men?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">HF: Yes, the men were, I didn’t meet men any more because they had rounded them up in the morning.</span> <span id="s772">When we got active, it was already by around noon time and they were taken to the main quarters of the police.</span> <span id="s773">We were in a branch office in the police, so I didn’t, until I came there, I didn’t know about the others that were already arrested in a different part of police headquarters.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">JF: In other words, when you saw these sights that you were describing now, you were walking home from the synagogue through the streets?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">HF: No, no.</span> <span id="s776">We were taken by police like prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">JF: You were being taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">HF: The boys and I were taken like prisoners as a, how do you call this, commando, a clean-up commando.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">JF: You were to clean up?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">HF: Sure, do you think that a German would do that?</span> <span id="s781">I mean we were to clean up because we Jews had caused all of this trouble.</span> <span id="s782">We had murdered somebody in Paris.</span> <span id="s783">We are responsible and for that, that was how the Nazis pictured that, for that, the German Volk, the German national soul boiled over and did all this, but, of course it was not true, it was well organized by the Nazis, this whole action, it was well organized.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">JF: But, were there any other Jewish men that they were also having clean up the streets with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">HF: Yes, we were not, I found it out later, but at the time I didn’t know, there were other commandos also.</span> <span id="s786">Yes, but, I didn’t meet them.</span> <span id="s787">We were taken to certain homes.</span> <span id="s788">“Here, work, work here, bring everything back up again,” as if that would help the people, if I would bring up a broken dish or a broken typewriter or anything, if that would help them in anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">JF: And it was when you were taking these things back into the homes that you were able to talk to the women...</span></p> <p><span id="s790">HF: Yes, I had a free moment.</span> <span id="s791">The policemen couldn’t watch us every minute, that we didn’t take a minute out, and we were talking to them.</span> <span id="s792">We tried hard, at least, to clean the streets because people were watching us, not only the policemen, but other people, other Gentiles were watching also, looking how we Jews were driven by the policemen and were told what to do and--in other words we couldn’t help, actually, the Jewish home that had lost most of their valuables.</span> <span id="s793">Just understand, there were people whose kitchen was completely empty.</span> <span id="s794">The people didn’t know where to make the next meal for those who were there, for the children, for themselves, because all the china, all the dishes were taken out.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">JF: Can you describe to me the response of the non-Jewish population as you saw it?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">HF: Well, I’ll tell you, the non-Jewish population was silent.</span> <span id="s797">They were looking, but they were silent.</span> <span id="s798">What they thought in their heart, in their hearts, I do not know.</span> <span id="s799">I can only imagine some of them thought, “Oh the poor Jews!”</span> <span id="s800">And some of them thought that it serves them right, I do not know.</span> <span id="s801">No words were spoken.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">JF: Were the guards who were in charge of you, on this detail, physically abusive towards you in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">HF: I could not say that.</span> <span id="s804">You see, these were not the professional S.A. or SS.</span> <span id="s805">These were regular police.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">JF: Of the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">HF: Yes.</span> <span id="s808">I don’t think that they had any feeling there.</span> <span id="s809">That it was command for them, that’s what they got to do, like anything else, they wouldn’t say to us, “Oh, it’s terrible, we feel sorry,” or anything.</span> <span id="s810">No.</span> <span id="s811">At least I didn’t hear it if they said it.</span> <span id="s812">Not to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">JF: How long did you spend working, trying to clean up the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">HF: Oh, I would say from about 12 o'clock to maybe four or five o'clock in the afternoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">JF: And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s816">HF: Then we were taken and we were, I think, about four or five people, four boys and myself.</span> <span id="s817">Then we were taken to the main building of the police to a hall, and in that hall I found most men of my congregation.</span> <span id="s818">The first thing when I came in there, they offered me the first seat in the first row.</span> <span id="s819">I wasn’t so anxious to sit there with a father, I would have preferred to sit in the back row.</span> <span id="s820">But my congregation felt the rabbi has the first seat in the first row.</span> <span id="s821">And, there was the commander of the police, he was the Nazi, because that’s the way it was in Germany.</span> <span id="s822">While the regular men of the police staff were still from years before, in other words, they were Nazis because they had to be Nazis, but the real Nazi was the commander.</span> <span id="s823">And, that’s the way he approached us, the way he talked to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">JF: What did he say?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">HF: Well, he would take out people who were known.</span> <span id="s826">Let’s say there was a Jew by the name of Sonnenheim.</span> <span id="s827">“You, you are known.</span> <span id="s828">You were a Communist all your life and you did this and this and you cheated the Germans; now we get even with you.”</span> <span id="s829">Something of that type.</span> <span id="s830">In other words, he would take out individual Jews.</span> <span id="s831">About me, nothing was known since I was relatively new in the community, but people who were living in Worms for centuries, people who were born there, they took them out individually.</span> <span id="s832">Then I saw people coming in and their whole head was bandaged.</span> <span id="s833">So then, that was the reason for the SS people and together with the commander of the police to make fun of them.</span> <span id="s834">When they came in, he would say, “Are you Turks?</span> <span id="s835">So the poor men didn’t know what to answer.</span> <span id="s836">He said, “I want an answer.</span> <span id="s837">Are you Turks?”</span> <span id="s838">So he said, “No.”</span> <span id="s839">In other words, there were people, apparently this must have happened outside of Worms in the outlying districts, that they were beaten up and they needed bandaging.</span> <span id="s840">They were so much beaten up, something that did not apparently, apparently, I am careful, did not happen in the city of Worms.</span> <span id="s841">At least I personally was not beaten, but there were, and I can never ever forget these poor people bandaged with bloody heads, and they would ask them yet, “Are you Turks?”</span> <span id="s842">So, we were sitting there, let’s say I was from six o'clock until 11 or 12 o'clock in the night time, and I heard already from other congregants, who had heard it from somebody else, our next destination is the concentration camp of Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s843">So, finally, 12 o'clock we were driven out of the police headquarters and outside there were three big trucks waiting for us.</span> <span id="s844">At that time, compared to what I heard happened to later years, they were still human, because trucks had benches for us to sit.</span> <span id="s845">I know in later times they used freight trains where there were no benches.</span> <span id="s846">People had to either stand or sit on the floor if they could.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">JF: What suspicions did you have at that time about what going to Buchenwald would mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s848">HF: Well, I knew pretty well, and I tell you why.</span> <span id="s849">In June of 1938, I might have mentioned that already, congregants where they had committed any offense, even though it was only a traffic ticket were taken to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s850">And, it happened that just a few days before, a couple of them came back.</span> <span id="s851">And I, as a rabbi visited them.</span> <span id="s852">It was strictly prohibited for anybody to talk about what happened in the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s853">This now, I had a little bit--when I was dismissed, or anybody was dismissed from the concentration camps, one of the officers of the SS would tell us, “Look, we dismiss you now, but if you tell anybody what you have seen here, what happened here, you know what will happen?</span> <span id="s854">You will come right back and then you’ll never get out.”</span> <span id="s855">So, this was, of course, told to this man, too, but since I was his rabbi, he was confident that I wouldn’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s856">So, he told me already about Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s857">So at least I knew what was facing us.</span> <span id="s858">This way I was a little bit privileged.</span> <span id="s859">I at least knew what was going to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">JF: Did you share any of this information with the men, once you found out that you were all going to Buchenwald together.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">HF: During that night how could you?</span> <span id="s862">You were just horrified, terrified during that night.</span> <span id="s863">What happened now, we were chased into these trucks, three trucks, I remember.</span> <span id="s864">They were civilian trucks that didn’t belong to the police, but they were confiscated for that purpose and they put benches in these trucks.</span> <span id="s865">We were chased in the trucks.</span> <span id="s866">And there were, it must have been known among the population, because just imagine, they left police headquarters about 12 o'clock at night, and there was a huge crowd of people standing there to clap, showing their happiness that we were carted off, that we were taken, that we were driven off.</span> <span id="s867">In other words, it was known among them what happened to us.</span> <span id="s868">We were, of course, I was personally concerned about what happened to my apartment.</span> <span id="s869">I had two rooms in an apartment that belonged to Jewish people.</span> <span id="s870">I don’t know whether I should tell you now before I forget later on.</span> <span id="s871">I was in my apartment and the following thing happened.</span> <span id="s872">Just the day before organizations like Zionist Youth Corps had given me all their belongings, because they weren’t sure any more what to do with it.</span> <span id="s873">So they had piled up papers in my room, and when the Nazis entered my room, they were so happy to find all of these papers, out of the window it went.</span> <span id="s874">My diploma, doctor’s diploma, rabbinical diploma, I had nicely hanging on the wall, out.</span> <span id="s875">Anything of paper that I had lying around, important documents on my desk, or things that I would have needed for immigration, all went outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">JF: How did you find this out?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">HF: Well, this, I found out later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">JF: When you came back?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">HF: I had an inkling that such a thing would happen in my living quarters, but later on, that’s why I want to excuse myself on telling you now something that I found out a month or so later.</span> <span id="s880">In other words, my room was almost emptied out, except that I had my books, and this was my greatest pride, in a big sturdy bookcase.</span> <span id="s881">So, the Nazis didn’t, the Nazis wanted to do damage, not only throwing things out, but to do damage.</span> <span id="s882">This was a huge bookcase, first they put it upside down, and so the backside of the bookcase was, of course, there was a wall of the bookcase made out of very solid wood, and they would take their knives, and took their knives and tried to empty it from the backside, and then take the books out and throw them out.</span> <span id="s883">But they didn’t succeed.</span> <span id="s884">It was such good wood that they just made--this way I saved 95 percent of my library that I have now here.</span> <span id="s885">What I lost was the following: for instance, there was a five-volume encyclopedia, and just the day before I had something looked up in the encyclopedia, and today I have to suffer for my being not so orderly, because I left the second volume of the Jewish encyclopedia I left on my desk, so I have now four volumes, and the last volume is missing.</span> <span id="s886">You cannot get one volume of an encyclopedia, so it was lost.</span> <span id="s887">And so the same thing happened to a very valuable Hebrew Talmudic dictionary.</span> <span id="s888">I had it in four volumes, and the last volume, I must have looked up something and left it on my desk, and that went out.</span> <span id="s889">Three volumes I saved.</span> <span id="s890">But this I can give you now consolation.</span> <span id="s891">In the year 1961 I heard from a professor of Gratz College, Dr. Shereshevsky, that this Hebrew dictionary by Levy had been reprinted in Germany, so they sent me that volume back.</span> <span id="s892">So it is complete again.</span> <span id="s893">I can show it to you later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">JF: Oh, I’m glad.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">HF: But, as I say, I lost a few books but most of them I saved because, on account of these circumstances.</span> <span id="s896">When I came, I found the bookcase upside down and this way, at least, I had saved my books.</span> <span id="s897">Everything else I lost.</span> <span id="s898">Religious articles that I had outside.</span> <span id="s899">So, but I actually at that time I didn’t know it yet.</span> <span id="s900">So, we were taken, we had a night ride through a good part of Germany until we reached Buchenwald concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">JF: Were there any openings in the truck that you could see where you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">HF: Yes, I was lucky.</span> <span id="s903">I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s904">I was sitting at the end of the truck, so I could see which cities we went through.</span> <span id="s905">I mean, I could see.</span> <span id="s906">The others that were sitting inside couldn’t see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">JF: And, did they give you any food at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">HF: No.</span> <span id="s909">We didn’t get anything.</span> <span id="s910">I think that the boys that were with me had been promised by the S.S. men when they were active in extinguishing the fire of the synagogue, that they would be beaten up on our way to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s911">But, as far as I know it did not happen.</span> <span id="s912">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s913">So, then, when we came to the concentration camp in the early hours of the morning, I could see from the outside already the men carrying big burdens, and not one man, but hundreds, all with prison guards beating them, and this was outside of the camp.</span> <span id="s914">So, my first idea was--I mean, I was almost apparently thinking in historical terms--my first idea was this is like in Egypt, this looks to me like.</span> <span id="s915">Jews had to work in Egypt.</span> <span id="s916">So, we were then told to leave the trucks, and there was already a reception committee waiting for us after we entered the gate of the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s917">This reception committee were S.S. people with sticks, large sticks in their hand, and they would beat anybody who wouldn’t run fast enough and would be a victim of their beatings, so many people arrived there wounded in the face, feet, and if you would have the bad luck of falling, they would do even worse.</span> <span id="s918">But, I was lucky at that time.</span> <span id="s919">I wasn’t in the condition like today.</span> <span id="s920">At that time I was young man, I could walk fast, so they did not hit me.</span> <span id="s921">But, unfortunately, the older people couldn’t run as fast.</span> <span id="s922">They got hit.</span> <span id="s923">Then we had to take our stand, and looking towards the gate of the concentration camp, and that happened now every five or ten minutes, a group of 20, 30 Jews being hit by guards there, and then they have to stand in front until there were maybe thousands of Jews assembled.</span> <span id="s924">What happened was they came from other parts of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">JF: These were other arrivals at the same time?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">HF: Yes, other new arrivals at the same time, the morning of November 11th.</span> <span id="s927">Friday morning, November 11th.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">JF: About how many men do you think came with you from Worms that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s929">HF: Well, I would say maybe 100.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">JF: And that do you think was most of the men in the synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s931">HF: Well, the prominent people were taken.</span> <span id="s932">There were some left out because they were not known.</span> <span id="s933">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s934">Some had, maybe, a little bit of protection.</span> <span id="s935">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s936">There was for instance one man, the historian of the Worms congregation, a man by the name of Sampson Rothschild, and he had many friends among Gentiles because he was a teacher in the public school system, already before the First World War and during the First World War.</span> <span id="s937">He was a man close to 90, and when I came back--now I shouldn’t say that actually in this connection, but this happened when I came back, I visited him and he told me, to him the Nazis did not come.</span> <span id="s938">They gave him special protection.</span> <span id="s939">His house was not touched, which he ascribed to his good standing among the Gentiles.</span> <span id="s940">So, there were people for one or other--he was not taken.</span> <span id="s941">He would have been too old anyhow.</span> <span id="s942">There were some people who had a little privilege, I would say.</span> <span id="s943">I don’t know how many.</span> <span id="s944">I think some of the poorer Jews were not taken.</span> <span id="s945">But all of the people who had some standing, business people, they were all taken.</span> <span id="s946">The whole board of the congregation, the officers.</span> <span id="s947">So, we had to stand in front of the gate, maybe--long, long hours until the day was finished.</span> <span id="s948">Meanwhile, some of the people was given haircuts.</span> <span id="s949">But haircuts was that your hair was totally shaven off.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">JF: Were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s951">HF: Definitely.</span> <span id="s952">Everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">JF: Everybody was.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">HF: But what happened then, for some reason the commanding officer would say, “Stop,” so that people were half-shaven and half not-shaven.</span> <span id="s955">That’s the way it remained.</span> <span id="s956">They went there all the time until they were dismissed.</span> <span id="s957">They do this just to make fun of the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">JF: Did you also have to change into a uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">HF: Well, this was a thing.</span> <span id="s960">Now I have to give you some idea how this concentration camp was organized.</span> <span id="s961">You see, we were one of the first people to come there; there were many people before, but that was such a large group of Jews, thousands of Jews would be taken in one or two days.</span> <span id="s962">For this the concentration camp organization was completely unprepared.</span> <span id="s963">They built, while we were there, they built houses.</span> <span id="s964">I shouldn’t say houses, I should say--it’s not the right word--it’s huts, huge huts, where we just would be pushed in to stay overnight.</span> <span id="s965">So, we were called Aktionjuden, Action Jews.</span> <span id="s966">We were the Jews who were the victims of the entire Jewish action of 10th of November, but there were other Jews there from before.</span> <span id="s967">So, they were in uniforms or in prison, in their, how do you call it, prison garb, prison clothing?</span> <span id="s968">And the Gentiles who were there.</span> <span id="s969">There were many Witnesses, you know, Jehovah Witnesses were there.</span> <span id="s970">They were a definite Gentile group who were there already for a long time.</span> <span id="s971">So, if you ask me about, you asked me whether--what did you ask me?</span> <span id="s972">Whether I had a uniform.</span> <span id="s973">Now, at one time, they wanted to make it easier for the rest of the Jewish population, and those new huts they wanted to make it easier for them, so an S.S. man passed by and that, “I need some men, the younger men.</span> <span id="s974">All come out!”</span> <span id="s975">And I followed the call and from that time on...</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Tape three, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s977">JF: This is tape three, side one, of an interview with Dr. Helmut Frank, on February 24th, 1982 with Josey Fisher.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">HF: I just wanted to say that something that happened, maybe two weeks later, that they wanted some of the Jewish prisoners to be like regulars, in uniform, and the worst thing was working like the regulars.</span> <span id="s979">While we were in the special huts of the Action Jews we had no work.</span> <span id="s980">We had no uniforms.</span> <span id="s981">Actually we could do as we pleased, except leaving the compound.</span> <span id="s982">We got, for instance, one of the features was we would not get regular meals.</span> <span id="s983">We would get no water, and they warned us, “Don’t drink the water, the water is poisoned.”</span> <span id="s984">I personally believe it was a lie.</span> <span id="s985">But, everyone was careful not to touch any water.</span> <span id="s986">In one way it was better to be one of the regular prisoners, because you got at least a little bit of food, better food than you would get as an Action Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">JF: What kind of rations did you get?</span></p> <p><span id="s988">HF: Well, in the morning, they gave us something what they called breakfast.</span> <span id="s989">It was actually a drink that was called coffee and one piece of bread.</span> <span id="s990">And soup for dinner and maybe some kind wurst for supper.</span> <span id="s991">In other words, you would not get enough to eat, especially I as a young man was constantly hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">JF: What were the barracks themselves like?</span></p> <p><span id="s993">HF: The barracks themselves--I’m sure, you have seen pictures of them because that has never changed.</span> <span id="s994">That was never changed.</span> <span id="s995">Once they were built, they stayed until ‘45, or maybe they are still there now.</span> <span id="s996">Huge wooden barracks with maybe five or six layers of wood where the people were supposed to be crowded in and sleep in the night, if they could sleep.</span> <span id="s997">This was especially made--I mention this, for me as a young man it was no problem for me to climb up and go to the highest layer, especially when some crazy S.S. men would come and would just do beatings for no good reason, just because he felt like doing it.</span> <span id="s998">He wouldn’t go up to the highest layer.</span> <span id="s999">Only the poor people who were lying on the first or second layer would get it.</span> <span id="s1000">So, I was lucky.</span> <span id="s1001">I was all the way up on these layers.</span> <span id="s1002">But I just was telling you that after two weeks I was one of the regular prisoners, in regular barracks, outside from that Action Jews compound, and there things were worse for us because we had to work, we had--and what was the work?</span> <span id="s1003">Working the quarries and carrying, under constant supervision, very heavy stones.</span> <span id="s1004">Thank God, as I almost constantly emphasize, I was young and still could do it.</span> <span id="s1005">To give you some idea what kind of work--in school you call it busy work--we had to do.</span> <span id="s1006">At one time there was a huge pile of stones.</span> <span id="s1007">And we were told that you have to remove it to the other side, and we were told if we don’t finish it in one hour, you won’t get anything to eat.</span> <span id="s1008">So, everybody tried to do his best in moving these heavy stones and carrying them from one side to the next and we were lucky, we did it, and we got our soup.</span> <span id="s1009">Do you know what we did in the afternoon?</span> <span id="s1010">What the command was?</span> <span id="s1011">Everything back again the way it was before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">JF: Were you threatened again in the afternoon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">HF: I don’t remember if we were.</span> <span id="s1014">But it was terrible.</span> <span id="s1015">I mean to live--and then the psychological strain would be that you would never get out here, the only way you would get out here would be through the chimneys.</span> <span id="s1016">Although they didn’t have gas chambers yet, there were people, I imagine ten percent of our, of the congregants, did not come out alive any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">JF: Did they die or were they killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">HF: They got sick, they got sick, and you can imagine that they would get easily sick under those circumstances.</span> <span id="s1019">Especially if you come there already with some sickness.</span> <span id="s1020">So, they had no hospital there.</span> <span id="s1021">They had, if you were sick, you were put in a special department, another of these wooden barracks that was called hospital, but it had no medicine.</span> <span id="s1022">But it had the other prisoners who were doctors, who were--but what can doctors do if they don’t have any medicine to help you.</span> <span id="s1023">They can just watch you die, and I think, of our group, ten percent died in this so-called hospital, by lack of care and...</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">JF: During the time that you were there, was there any opportunity for any kind of praying for any kind of religious meeting among the prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">HF: Yes, there was within the Action Jews compound, we actually were most of the time without supervision.</span> <span id="s1026">We could do what we pleased, and there my congregants asked me on Friday night, on Shabes, to have the regular prayers.</span> <span id="s1027">That’s what I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">JF: And, you were not hindered in any way in that compound?</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">HF: No, I mean, as long as nobody knew about it, as long as it was done clandestinely, nobody bothered us.</span> <span id="s1030">We wouldn’t do it too loud.</span> <span id="s1031">You know, the concentration camp was surrounded by electric wires.</span> <span id="s1032">So, many people, or I shouldn’t say many people, but several people on the first day of our arrival were just completely broken mentally and would run to these, towards these electric wires, and the guards seeing that wouldn’t even want them to have their body burned within the, from the electric wires, and they would--you remember these towers from the pictures--the guards standing on top would shoot people who would come near the wire.</span> <span id="s1033">They wouldn’t even wait until they touched the wire.</span> <span id="s1034">Quite a number of our people lost their mind and ran into those wires, and we could see the people lying dead there.</span> <span id="s1035">They didn’t move them for quite awhile.</span> <span id="s1036">It was a warning to us, apparently.</span> <span id="s1037">And, as it happened, people forget--60 years old and older--were put in such a situation suddenly, many people couldn’t stand it mentally.</span> <span id="s1038">And they would talk irrationally.</span> <span id="s1039">It happened to one of my members.</span> <span id="s1040">I couldn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s1041">I don’t think I should tell you what happened.</span> <span id="s1042">I don’t know whether I should mention.</span> <span id="s1043">What do you think, it’s--?</span> <span id="s1044">Not to mention it.</span> <span id="s1045">He said to me, “I don’t like it here at all.”</span> <span id="s1046">I said, “Why?”</span> <span id="s1047">“What kind of hotel is this where they don’t give you nice beds, they don’t give you appropriate clothing?</span> <span id="s1048">What are they doing to us?</span> <span id="s1049">This is not nice.</span> <span id="s1050">I don’t like it here.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">JF: Now, this was someone you had known before and he was coherent before this experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">HF: Definitely.</span> <span id="s1053">Definitely, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">JF: So, this happened immediately upon coming into the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">HF: Yes, they lost their minds, they lost their coherence.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">JF: When you say that this happened to many people, can you give me any idea out of your group of 100--?</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">HF: I would say ten percent we lost to sickness, and maybe one or two by strange behavior that they didn’t know how to cope with the situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">JF: Other than these people, what was the general reaction of the men that you knew, having known them before, having known their personalities, what was the general way of reacting?</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">HF: I must say some were excellent.</span> <span id="s1060">And what I mean by excellent, mostly people that served during the World War as soldiers, who tell how to behave in order to survive.</span> <span id="s1061">They gave us, in this way, some strength.</span> <span id="s1062">For instance, they would treat us like soldiers, and maybe some Nazis would be impressed by that, giving us commands.</span> <span id="s1063">Whether it helped I do not know, but there were people who were marvelous in that respect and would see to it that when there was some food it was distributed in the right way among our people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">JF: They took charge as if it were an army unit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">HF: Yes.</span> <span id="s1066">Yes.</span> <span id="s1067">They took charge, as you say, they took charge as if it was a military unit.</span> <span id="s1068">As I say, some of our men were marvelous, were helpful, and tried to make the best out of it.</span> <span id="s1069">Most of them who went through the First World War said that being in concentration camps was much worse than fighting the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">JF: Did they say what they meant by that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">HF: It was a strain on a person, was worse in concentration camp than in a front line of the war.</span> <span id="s1072">Just to show you how the Nazis worked, for instance, the Nazis told us through the loud speaker, anybody who has from the First, not only served in the First World War, but also has a certain medal that the Nazis gave out a couple of years prior to that to everybody, Jew and Gentile, those that have that medal would be freed.</span> <span id="s1073">Now, about, I would imagine about 50, 60 percent of the men that were with us were fighters, soldiers in the First World War.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">JF: At what point did they say this to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">HF: After a few days.</span> <span id="s1076">So, that you would imagine they would be freed on saying that they have the medal but didn’t bring it along.</span> <span id="s1077">So as far as I remember only one person had the medal with him and he was dismissed right away.</span> <span id="s1078">The others didn’t have the medal.</span> <span id="s1079">No dismissal.</span> <span id="s1080">They could not call by telephone, but they could send a letter home, that they send it to them.</span> <span id="s1081">Do you know how long it takes, especially under those circumstances, of having the letters cleared.</span> <span id="s1082">So, that’s how the Nazis worked.</span> <span id="s1083">The mental strain was especially difficult for us to bear.</span> <span id="s1084">For instance, naturally, we were addressed by the Nazis as “der Jude,” the Jew, and no name was ever called without the words, “the Jew.”</span> <span id="s1085">The Jew so-and-so should do this.</span> <span id="s1086">The Jew so-and-so.</span> <span id="s1087">This was humiliating.</span> <span id="s1088">At least most of them felt that way.</span> <span id="s1089">And then, when, sometimes, in other words, a Jew was called to the headquarters and then there they would give him a beating and say, “Now, you go back where you came from.”</span> <span id="s1090">People in high standing, all of a sudden, were treated in such a way.</span> <span id="s1091">I know in later times it was much worse in the war years in the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1092">But already at that time it was very difficult for us to bear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">JF: Did they know that you were a rabbi?</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">HF: I tell you.</span> <span id="s1095">Even if they know, they were not interested in that fact.</span> <span id="s1096">It happened in one case that from a neighboring congregation the people came with their preacher or chazan--it was not a preacher, it was a chazan--and when they arrived at the concentration camp gate the S.S. man in charge said to him, “Now I want you to say a prayer,” and so he started, the chazan started, and said a few Hebrew words, and the Nazi in charge then twisted these Hebrew few words and then beat him up for that.</span> <span id="s1097">“You say this,” and repeated the words the way he heard it.</span> <span id="s1098">In other words he took it as an excuse to do bad things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">JF: But, did you feel that you were singled out in any way because of your standing as rabbi?</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">HF: No.</span> <span id="s1101">As I say the Nazis were not, except this one case where that happened, I don’t think that the Nazis were interested in it.</span> <span id="s1102">At one time a rabbi--it was said through the loud speaker, “Rabbi so-and-so is permitted to keep his beard.”</span> <span id="s1103">I don’t know what made them have this privilege, but I remember yet that this was a case where a rabbi was singled out; otherwise they did not bother them who was a rabbi, who was not a rabbi.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">JF: Did you have any idea during this time--you said after two weeks you were put into the labor union [unit, probably] in the quarry.</span> <span id="s1105">At this time you were given uniforms?</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">HF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">JF: How long you would be there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">HF: This is just the very bad thing.</span> <span id="s1109">No idea.</span> <span id="s1110">You had no idea what, how you would be freed.</span> <span id="s1111">You had no idea when you would come out.</span> <span id="s1112">Today, it seems easy, because altogether I was there just one month, from the 10th of November till the 10th of December.</span> <span id="s1113">But, today I know what happened.</span> <span id="s1114">If your family got you papers for immigration and brought them to the Gestapo, in most of the cases you were then soon dismissed where the papers were found O.K.</span> <span id="s1115">In my case, my parents both were living, I wasn’t married yet, and my parents went to the headquarters of the police, and at this moment, I don’t know how, but some way they got for me a visa to China.</span> <span id="s1116">I had no intention of going to China, but some way, somehow, they got a visa for China.</span> <span id="s1117">And, this was one thing.</span> <span id="s1118">And, I belonged to the Gestapo district of Darmstadt, and that is the largest city close to Worms, and there they were a little more lenient than my home town in Wiesbaden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">JF: Your parents were still in Wiesbaden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">HF: Yes, but they must have gone to Darmstadt and must have shown them these papers, and on the basis of these papers I was dismissed.</span> <span id="s1121">On a Saturday morning, on the 10th of December.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">JF: What were these papers that the Darmstadt office...</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">HF: They showed to the officer the paper that I may leave Germany based on the visa that I have from China.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">JF: So it was the Darmstadt office that made the decision that the visa was valid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">HF: At that time, you must understand that at that time, in ‘38, end of ‘38, there was no “Final Solution” of the Jewish problem yet.</span> <span id="s1126">Jews could be dismissed from concentration camp by showing immigration papers and, as I say, some Gestapos were stricter, like Frankfurt and Wiesbaden who knew already which papers might be fictitious papers, which mine certainly was, and which might be real papers.</span> <span id="s1127">So, I was lucky that I belonged to such a district where they were a little bit more lenient in that respect.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">JF: So, the papers that your parents got were fictitious papers.</span> <span id="s1129">They were not brought as real immigration papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">HF: They were for China, but who at that time would have wanted to go to China?</span> <span id="s1131">There came soon a time when even a visa to China, Shanghai especially, would be used and would be welcome.</span> <span id="s1132">But at that time Jews still were a little bit choosy and would go only to a country that would give them a living.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">JF: Before this time that you were released did you work in the quarry?</span> <span id="s1134">That two weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">HF: Yes, those two weeks I was in prison uniform, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">JF: And were you doing similar work to that which you described to me earlier, carrying stones from...</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">HF: Yes, it happened quite often that we had to do that work.</span> <span id="s1138">First of all, we had to get up five o’clock, earlier yet, and then we had roll call at six o’clock standing.</span> <span id="s1139">All of this the Action Jews didn’t have to do, and then when we left the actual concentration camp to work outside, of course under a strict guard, whatever work we had to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">JF: Clarify something for me, if you would.</span> <span id="s1141">Were you still considered an Action Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">HF: Definitely, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">JF: After you were working in the quarry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">HF: Yes.</span> <span id="s1145">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">JF: And that meant that you did not have to stand for roll call?</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">HF: As Action Jews, no.</span> <span id="s1148">Action Jews were just like a herd of animals put in that huge hut there in the barracks, and unless some S.S. man got in a rage, nobody actually bothered you there.</span> <span id="s1149">They were a group by themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">JF: But, after you were sent to the quarry to work two weeks later, then you got up and went to roll call or no?</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">HF: Well, when I was called--yes, we had roll call every morning and evening.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">JF: Even as--you were still labeled as Action Jews at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">HF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">JF: Yes, you still had the roll call, and were treated the same way as the other Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">HF: But this--everything was not very logical.</span> <span id="s1156">After I was maybe ten days, the command came: “All Action Jews back where they came from.”</span> <span id="s1157">So we had to get our regular clothing again, take the uniforms off and the Mogen David that we had on top of the uniforms, everything off again and go back.</span> <span id="s1158">So, when I was freed from the concentration camp I was again with the Action Jews as before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">JF: And, at that point you were not working?</span> <span id="s1160">You were back in the barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">HF: Yes, there I could loaf and could go around and talk about philosophy and anything I wanted to do with anybody.</span> <span id="s1162">Yes.</span> <span id="s1163">I mean, in this way we were better off.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">JF: Does that make any sense to you now as you look back on it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">HF: Now I understand.</span> <span id="s1166">There were already some Jews were already dismissed by that time, so that there was more room in these--it made sense in that way.</span> <span id="s1167">Some S.S. officer must have said, “Look, there are too many Jews.</span> <span id="s1168">They’re in such a small space.</span> <span id="s1169">They haven’t got enough space.</span> <span id="s1170">We could relieve their living a little bit by taking the younger people off and put them to work with the regular units.”</span> <span id="s1171">That’s how I see it today.</span> <span id="s1172">Then through dismissals there was more room, and they thought, “We don’t need to use the Jews any more as a working unit here.</span> <span id="s1173">Back to where they came from.”</span> <span id="s1174">That’s how I would explain it.</span> <span id="s1175">But there were quite a number of Jews who would stay there much longer than I did.</span> <span id="s1176">Six weeks, eight weeks, twelve weeks...</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">JF: Was anybody else released at the time you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">HF: Yes, yes, I was with a group.</span> <span id="s1179">Usually you weren’t dismissed by yourself.</span> <span id="s1180">First of all, when you were dismissed, there was a whole group and they were given instructions, as I had told you.</span> <span id="s1181">What kind of instructions, not to talk.</span> <span id="s1182">That was the most important instruction.</span> <span id="s1183">Also you had to, you couldn’t leave the concentration camp the way you were walking around before.</span> <span id="s1184">You know, there was no barber to shave you, but when you were, especially when you had the hair halfway shaven off--so before you were dismissed, you must look decent.</span> <span id="s1185">That was because you were facing the Gentile population, and the Nazis didn’t want them to know what was going on, what was really going on, in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1186">So, I and the younger men had to clean the shoes of the older men and to be helpful, so that they would look some way respectable coming back to normal, so-called normal life again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">JF: What did they do with the men whose heads had been half-shaved?</span> <span id="s1188">Did they shave them fully?</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">HF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">JF: They were very concerned about the effect on the general population.</span> <span id="s1191">How did you feel when you were brought in?</span> <span id="s1192">Did you know that something was going to happen, possibly?</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">HF: Well, let’s say, I was lucky at least the things were not unknown to me through my interview with the man who was in my congregation who had come back.</span> <span id="s1194">So, I knew already what I had to expect and that made it a little bit easier.</span> <span id="s1195">But, for those who saw that for the first time, they were just shocked, shocked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">JF: And when you were called to be told that you were going to be discharged from the camp, why did you think you were being called?</span> <span id="s1197">Did you have any suspicion that maybe you were going to be able to be released?</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">HF: Well, don’t forget.</span> <span id="s1199">This was a thing that had happened throughout four weeks.</span> <span id="s1200">There were some lucky people, at least we considered them lucky, who already after the first week or less were called but always started like this: “Der Jude so-and-so and der Jude so-and-so, and der Jude so-and-so, come immediately to the big gate.”</span> <span id="s1201">And, from this way we knew already that means discharge.</span> <span id="s1202">We had to run to the big gate, and then it took about, the whole procedure took about two, three hours.</span> <span id="s1203">Now, at that time they were still a little more human because they provided a bus to take us to the train station.</span> <span id="s1204">At least we could board.</span> <span id="s1205">Later on I heard that people had to walk, they were not permitted any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">JF: How far was the train station?</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">HF: Oh, I would say it took about 15 minutes by bus.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">JF: 50?</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">HF: 15 minutes by bus.</span> <span id="s1210">15 to 20 minutes by bus.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">JF: And what happened after you returned?</span> <span id="s1212">Did you go to Worms at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">HF: First I had to go to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1214">That was already one of the instructions to report to the Gestapo at Darmstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">JF: At Darmstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">HF: And that we did in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s1217">You know with these people there was no eight hours.</span> <span id="s1218">Day and night.</span> <span id="s1219">So, we were there and, as I told you before, the Gestapo in Darmstadt happened to be a little more lenient than the one in my home town.</span> <span id="s1220">In my home town, they would say, “Now how long will it take you to get out of here?</span> <span id="s1221">Out of Germany?</span> <span id="s1222">All right, you leave until February 1st.</span> <span id="s1223">If you don’t leave, you know where you go back.”</span> <span id="s1224">But, in my case they didn’t give us a time limit.</span> <span id="s1225">They were more lenient.</span> <span id="s1226">We could go back where we came from.</span> <span id="s1227">So, I went back to my congregation.</span> <span id="s1228">I was needed there quite, I was needed there much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">JF: Tell me about your return to Worms and what you found.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">HF: Depressing.</span> <span id="s1231">This could be the picture of the synagogue in Worms.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">JF: How much had been destroyed of the synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">HF: Well, I mean the interior completely.</span> <span id="s1234">And the roof had gone.</span> <span id="s1235">What I saw was left, this is on the picture of the book, was only the bare walls.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">JF: And this had been from the fire that had been set inside the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">HF: Yes.</span> <span id="s1238">And there was a sign at the synagogue by order of the police, “It is strictly prohibited to enter the premises.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">JF: So, there was no way of searching to see if anything remained of the holy objects.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">HF: I went there.</span> <span id="s1241">I had so much guts, still I wanted to see inside.</span> <span id="s1242">I went inside, but it was dangerous because the neighbors could see me there.</span> <span id="s1243">But in many cases the Jewish community not only that they had to suffer all the damage from a burned-down synagogue, they were ordered by the authorities yet to take what was left on their own cost, to clear up the destroyed buildings so that they would be completely level.</span> <span id="s1244">This did not happen in Worms.</span> <span id="s1245">There is a history that happened years later that the Nazis leveled it off by explosions during the war years.</span> <span id="s1246">They had nothing better to do, nothing more important to do than level off the synagogue, the [unclear] of the synagogue, I should say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">JF: In Worms, are you talking about now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">HF: Yes, in Worms.</span> <span id="s1249">It’s what happened in Worms.</span> <span id="s1250">But in other cities Jews were ordered by the authority to take care of leveling of the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">JF: Now, you had mentioned earlier to me that the synagogue was also bombed by Allied bombs during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">HF: Yes, actually, there was actually hardly anything left by that in 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">JF: This was after the Nazis themselves had destroyed...</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">HF: Whatever was, I imagine a pile of rubble was left, and on that a bomb came.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">JF: O.K., so there was further Nazi destruction after Kristallnacht of the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">HF: Yes, in the synagogue in Worms, and long after I left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">JF: When you did sneak back in, what did you find?</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">HF: Well, what did I find?</span> <span id="s1259">The ruins of a synagogue that was very close to me, and there were no more benches, no more inside, no more any furniture.</span> <span id="s1260">All the Torah scrolls had gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">JF: There were no remains at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">HF: Just the stones that hadn’t burned and it was difficult, of course, to walk, because it was chaos, chaos.</span> <span id="s1263">Some people...</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Tape three, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">JF: This is tape three, side two, of an interview with Dr. Helmut Frank on February 24th, 1982.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">HF: Some people went to the burned out shul and said kaddish at the shul.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">JF: Was this when you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">HF: But they would all do that clandestinely when nobody would see them.</span> <span id="s1269">Maybe some did it at night time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">JF: Was the Levy Synagogue, the old Levy Synagogue across the street still standing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">HF: The Levy Synagogue was--there was vandalism inside, but as such it was standing between houses.</span> <span id="s1272">Wherever a synagogue was standing in the middle of houses, the Nazis would not burn it.</span> <span id="s1273">They would dynamite it inside, and in this case the Levy Synagogue was not a synagogue any more.</span> <span id="s1274">We needed a gym for our Jewish school and with my permission and under my supervision the synagogue was converted into a gym.</span> <span id="s1275">The Nazis didn’t know about this.</span> <span id="s1276">They still thought it was a synagogue and that we have to do some work of destruction inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">JF: Were you able to use this or any other place for another place of worship?</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">HF: Yes.</span> <span id="s1279">That is right.</span> <span id="s1280">We immediately worked restoring a temporary house of prayer.</span> <span id="s1281">In this case we took one of the, one of the larger rooms of the school, the congregational building, it was all the same thing, and converted it to a synagogue.</span> <span id="s1282">I should mention at this time that we had a very dedicated teacher among the teaching staff of our school.</span> <span id="s1283">Her name should be mentioned.</span> <span id="s1284">It was Miss Mansbacher.</span> <span id="s1285">Miss Mansbacher immediately went to work right after the pogrom of the 10th of November in getting permission from the authorities to open the school again.</span> <span id="s1286">And after she got permission, I think, after two weeks, she had to find benches.</span> <span id="s1287">A funny thing happened.</span> <span id="s1288">My wife knows the story.</span> <span id="s1289">She starts laughing when I mention it.</span> <span id="s1290">You know, people had lost all their furniture; they didn’t have a chair to sit on.</span> <span id="s1291">So, there was one of the, of my leading congregants, a man, I don’t know at this time why he wasn’t taken to the concentration camp, but he was home, one of the few left home.</span> <span id="s1292">But his living room was completely destroyed; he didn’t have a chair to sit on.</span> <span id="s1293">So, since he was prominent in the school committee, he went to the school and took out chairs from the bench.</span> <span id="s1294">By the way, the congregation building was locked.</span> <span id="s1295">I think maybe I said it and maybe I didn’t say it, but it was locked by order of the authorities on 10th of November and nobody could go in, and nobody could go out.</span> <span id="s1296">But by that time it was opened again so he took benches out for him to have some place to sit for him and his family.</span> <span id="s1297">So, that teacher Miss Mansbacher went to him and said, “Mr. Meyer, I know you have taken out my chairs from the school building but I need them back.</span> <span id="s1298">I want to start teaching again.”</span> <span id="s1299">So, his answer was, “You have nothing in your dumb mind but your dumb school.”</span> <span id="s1300">In German dialect it sounds even better, I can say that.</span> <span id="s1301">But she was very angry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">JF: Did he give them to her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">HF: He had no choice.</span> <span id="s1304">They were not his chairs and he was a man who still was in financial condition to buy himself new chairs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">JF: This was Herta Mansbacher that Dr. Huttenbach has written about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">HF: That’s right.</span> <span id="s1307">There’s a book on her.</span> <span id="s1308">Yes.</span> <span id="s1309">She was a person, I should say, who deserves to be mentioned.</span> <span id="s1310">Her name is perpetuated in the book and by a special memorial tablet on the synagogue that was dedicated two years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">JF: In the restored Worms Synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">HF: Right.</span> <span id="s1313">And, so when I came, the school was open.</span> <span id="s1314">The school was in session.</span> <span id="s1315">So, whatever school children had remained, they were taught by a dedicated staff of her and some other women teachers who had not been taken to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1316">No women had been taken to the concentration camp at that time, so she was there and taught the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">JF: Now, at this point, you had said to me that the original Jewish population of Worms before 1933 was about 1200.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">HF: I believe so, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">JF: And, in 1937 it was about 500?</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">HF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">JF: And, at this point, there had already been another decrease?</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">HF: Yes, don’t forget, from 1937 till 1938 many people had left, and under the condition of the pogrom many had left other cities.</span> <span id="s1323">I found the congregation was very much depleted.</span> <span id="s1324">Even if I account for the fact that some are in concentration camps, still they left.</span> <span id="s1325">So, we had enough space in schools, the larger schools, for services.</span> <span id="s1326">First we went to, by the way, to the old age home for services, then one skilled working man built us a very nice synagogue, as you can see on that picture in back of you.</span> <span id="s1327">It wasn’t a bad place, so at least until I left we had regular services there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">JF: The painting that you are referring to was done of you praying in front of the ark.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">HF: Yes.</span> <span id="s1330">By one of my congregants who, thank God, was saved very late to marry a man named Gustof, and he lived here in St. Louis and he got very old and died only a few years ago, a very fine man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">JF: And this picture was painted of you in this make-shift synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">HF: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">JF: In the school building?</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">HF: That’s correct.</span> <span id="s1335">That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">JF: Were you able to find any prayer books or get another Torah from any other community?</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">HF: I see you are thinking of the right thing.</span> <span id="s1338">Yes.</span> <span id="s1339">Absolutely right.</span> <span id="s1340">The first thing, yes.</span> <span id="s1341">One hundred percent.</span> <span id="s1342">The first thing we had to do before starting services, we had to get a Sefer Torah because all 30 of them weren’t there any more.</span> <span id="s1343">And, as it happened in Germany, we were not the only congregation that was destroyed or burned down.</span> <span id="s1344">There were quite a number of small congregations in Germany where the synagogue was already sold and the people had taken the Sefer Torah that they had in their own safeguarding.</span> <span id="s1345">So, there were congregations like that where they had Torahs for sale.</span> <span id="s1346">The first thing was, and I will never forget it, we went to a village community, what was once a village community.</span> <span id="s1347">There was one man left who had been trusted with a Sefer Torah, so he brought a Sefer Torah.</span> <span id="s1348">We needed it.</span> <span id="s1349">So we had a Sefer Torah, and the rest of the furniture was done, by, as I said, one of the skilled workers of the congregation who did a very good job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">JF: Had the community been taxed after Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">HF: Well, you know the Jewish community, as such, by order of the Nazis was fined for the murder of vom Rath.</span> <span id="s1352">We was taxed one billion of Mark.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">JF: Did this make a severe impression on the economics of your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">HF: Definitely.</span> <span id="s1355">Everybody would have to part with, in order to pay this, he would have to part with his valuables, whatever he had, had to be given to the Gestapo--the financial authorities and this damaged the congregants, not the congregation but the congregants, those who had means, quite severely, because many wanted to immigrate.</span> <span id="s1356">Before this debt, so-called debt was paid, they wouldn’t get permission to leave Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">JF: Did this also then affect the funds that you had available to you to perform some of your tasks as a synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">HF: No, the congregation at that time, the congregation as such was not fined.</span> <span id="s1359">So, I continued to receive my salary as before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">JF: And the Torah that you purchased was able to be bought through the congregational funds?</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">HF: Yes, this way we were not out of funds.</span> <span id="s1362">We had the same funds we had before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">JF: Were you still able to carry on your work in the community, the visiting of the prisons?</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">HF: Yes, I continued teaching as before; I continued officiating at services as before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">JF: Was there any interference on the part of the Nazi officials in the town in your performance, your religious performance?</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">HF: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1367">Once they gave us permission to hold services, they didn’t bother us any more.</span> <span id="s1368">Don’t forget, you mentioned before, it just comes to my mind, whether we had lost members.</span> <span id="s1369">We had lost many members, but at the same time we had gained some members, because from very small communities where a life for Jews was just impossible, Jews came to Worms to live there, so we had gained quite a number of new members during that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">JF: About how many then do you think were in your congregation, say, in 1939?</span> <span id="s1371">Between the exodus and the increase in population?</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">HF: I would imagine that when I said good-bye that, I spoke at that time to a group of maybe 50-60 people.</span> <span id="s1373">Don’t forget not everybody came to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s1374">But, maybe we had, maybe at that time, there was still 150 Jews in Worms, maybe less.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">JF: Were there still incidents in the town of excesses on the part of the Nazis towards people on the streets?</span> <span id="s1376">Any kind of random violence, as there had been before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">HF: After that, you see, Jewish personal life came to a complete standstill.</span> <span id="s1378">There were no more Jewish businesses; they were prohibited to function.</span> <span id="s1379">So, they couldn’t then boycott Jewish stores.</span> <span id="s1380">There weren’t any more stores.</span> <span id="s1381">And, every day brought some more limitations of Jewish activities so, actually, the Nazis couldn’t show how to harm the Jews because Jews kept away from the street as much as they could.</span> <span id="s1382">They stayed home.</span> <span id="s1383">At that time I don’t think there were any personal attacks; at least I don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s1384">You always hear of new arrests.</span> <span id="s1385">The Gestapo would make a search in the house and would find things that were to your disadvantage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">JF: Your parents were still in Wiesbaden, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">HF: Right.</span> <span id="s1388">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">JF: And, is there anything else that you can describe to me about that period of time before you left in 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">HF: Well, when I left my congregation it was a very bad feeling.</span> <span id="s1391">Because I knew those who I left, whom I leave now, I don’t think I will see them again.</span> <span id="s1392">Now, I left in August ‘39, and up to August ‘41 Jews were still leaving.</span> <span id="s1393">Some were leaving for Poland because they originally came from Poland and still thought it is a better place to stay than Germany.</span> <span id="s1394">For a while they might have been right.</span> <span id="s1395">But you know what came later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">JF: This was from the original application that you had made?</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">HF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">JF: To immigrate to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">HF: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1400">I had made that application already years before the pogrom of ‘38.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">JF: Had your parents also applied to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">HF: Yes, they also were--you see, I must explain to you how that worked.</span> <span id="s1403">They wanted to leave for America, the USA, and the consulate would give out waiting numbers.</span> <span id="s1404">They would give a certain quota of people leave Germany.</span> <span id="s1405">The quota was very small, so that they got a waiting number in case the quota--they would come to their own waiting number, it might have been maybe 45, 46, normally things would go on.</span> <span id="s1406">In other words, to wait for quota numbers was impossible, but for professors and clergymen there were certain out-of-quota conditions under which you could leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">JF: Why is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">HF: So, if a rabbi, I’m speaking of my own case, if a rabbi would receive a job in a Jewish congregation in America, and the contract would be sent the rabbi, he would get a visa outside of the quota.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">JF: The Nazis respected that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">HF: The Nazis were not interested.</span> <span id="s1411">They were happy to see every Jew leave.</span> <span id="s1412">But the consulate respected that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">JF: I see; the American consul respected that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">HF: Right, and that’s how I got out in time because Rabbi Simon Greenberg of Har Zion [synagogue in suburban Philadelphia] sent me such a contract.</span> <span id="s1415">Why I was sent because I was not the only one?</span> <span id="s1416">I was not the only one that applied.</span> <span id="s1417">There were 50 rabbis, maybe 100, who applied for that, but I was one of the first ones at least.</span> <span id="s1418">So, I got preference this way.</span> <span id="s1419">About my parents: we, my parents lived in Wiesbaden, about three-quarters of an hour by railroad away from city where I was rabbi, the city of Worms.</span> <span id="s1420">And, of course, I had to say good-bye to my parents.</span> <span id="s1421">I didn’t know would I see them ever again.</span> <span id="s1422">But as I pointed out, sometimes when I spoke about my Holocaust experiences before an audience in the congregation of A.J. [Congregation Adath Jeshurun] here in Philadelphia, I was lucky in two ways.</span> <span id="s1423">Not only that I could save myself from Germany yet before the war, but also was able to save my parents, and that my parents lived here in America until their death.</span> <span id="s1424">After I came here in the beginning of September ‘39, we heard that the war had broken out.</span> <span id="s1425">Germany was marching into Poland, something that we who lived in Germany had expected, because we saw the preparations for war being done very openly before us, and originally I had planned to leave Germany about November, December ‘39, but when I saw what was going on, I was able yet to get a passage for middle of August, and I just had to leave my belongings behind.</span> <span id="s1426">But I could at that time save my life by leaving just shortly before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">JF: You left all your books and papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">HF: Yes, my parents were able then to send them, but it was a slow process because they had to send them first to Holland, and in Holland they were at the time of the invasion, the Nazi invasion, so that--it’s a whole story and I don’t think it’s worthwhile to tell you the story of my life.</span> <span id="s1429">Anyhow, it was saved at the end of the war and then I got back whatever I had in my belongings.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">JF: They were held in Holland then from the time they were shipped?</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">HF: Yes, the only thing was, this man where they were sent had ten warehouses.</span> <span id="s1432">Nine of them were bombed and completely destroyed, and my stuff just happened to be in the tenth, and when the Germans came to the warehouse and wanted to know what are these things here, so the man supposedly told the German officers they belonged to some non-Jews or Aryans living in Germany, so he wasn’t interested any more in confiscation or anything.</span> <span id="s1433">Anyhow, after the war I got everything back.</span> <span id="s1434">So, I was lucky in this way.</span> <span id="s1435">I wanted to tell you about my parents.</span> <span id="s1436">After I came here and had a job myself, I devoted much of my time to make possible immigration of my parents to America, and, thank God, together with my sister, we worked in getting not only an affidavit, what they needed in order to get to America, but also we got something that I never knew outside of America that something like this existed--political push.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">JF: Your sister was here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">HF: Here before me, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">JF: What year did she come?</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">HF: She came in the same year but a few months earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">JF: Had she been living in Wiesbaden with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">HF: Excuse me, I was wrong.</span> <span id="s1443">It was not the same year.</span> <span id="s1444">It was ‘38.</span> <span id="s1445">It was the year before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">JF: And she had been living where?</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">HF: In my home town in Wiesbaden.</span> <span id="s1448">My brother-in-law is a dentist.</span> <span id="s1449">So, she was already in New York at the time.</span> <span id="s1450">And so I went to Cincinnati in April 1940 and found relatives who were willing to give an affidavit to my parents.</span> <span id="s1451">But not only that.</span> <span id="s1452">Lucky I was in this respect that these relatives were friendly with a senator, and that this senator sent a telegram to the consul in Stuttgart, Germany, to immediately see that these people get their visa to America.</span> <span id="s1453">The consulate followed the order given by the senator, and my parents were able to leave in the summer of 1941.</span> <span id="s1454">It was a long, drawn-out journey, but one has to consider that a few months after they got the visa from Stuttgart, all consulars in Germany were called back to America, and the offices were closed, and that half a year later, after the Wannsee Conference, the deportations started already.</span> <span id="s1455">One of the first ones to be deported was a brother of my mother, my uncle who was not married; and this was a category in Frankfurt that was taken first for deportation.</span> <span id="s1456">He was yet able to send a postcard from Poland and there were only a few words on that postcard.</span> <span id="s1457">He said, “Still I am living,” and then his name.</span> <span id="s1458">That was the only time we received any mail from him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">JF: Were your parents able to tell you what their experience was like until 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">HF: Yes, terrible.</span> <span id="s1461">Because, we had our own house.</span> <span id="s1462">One day there was an English bomb attack on our home town and Nazis immediately came to my parents’ house and said, “Look, Aryans were bombed in this attack, and if you as Jews caused it, you ordered it, so you have to vacate your living quarters within a few hours, and the beds have to be made so the people can have their night rest as usual.”</span> <span id="s1463">So, from one minute to the next they had to find, they had to live together with some other Jews in very cramped quarters.</span> <span id="s1464">This was one experience.</span> <span id="s1465">And, thank God, that they were able to leave yet on almost the last boat.</span> <span id="s1466">Still, another point to mention it, since I want to stop with a happy ending.</span> <span id="s1467">Best friends of my parents, another family, they were deported to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1468">Both survived it; both were, both came to America and were reunited with my parents again.</span> <span id="s1469">So this I would say this was a ray of light, of hope, in a very dark time, a very dark world.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">JF: The synagogue of Worms had also been restored as you have described to me?</span> <span id="s1471">And it was rededicated in 1961?</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">HF: Yes.</span> <span id="s1473">I was not there.</span> <span id="s1474">At that time I was working and didn’t want to leave my work unattended.</span> <span id="s1475">I have a financial loss so that was to be considered.</span> <span id="s1476">However, in ‘79 I was asked by a committee to dedicate memorial tablets for the people who had lost their lives and this memorial tablet to be affixed to the new built synagogue.</span> <span id="s1477">This time I was asked to come along.</span> <span id="s1478">I would have had the time to come along.</span> <span id="s1479">Unfortunately my condition of health would not permit me to come along.</span> <span id="s1480">But, I sent them a personal message, and that message was read during the service of dedication.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">JF: You were able to visit the synagogue, however, in the early ‘70’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">HF: ‘72, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">JF: And you were able to see the chair of Rashi that is restored?</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">HF: Yes, definitely, yes.</span> <span id="s1485">The synagogue from the outside looks almost the way it looked before.</span> <span id="s1486">Inside the furnishings--and as I told you I believe that the money must have gone out after they built it, and there was not enough to furnish inside the way it should have been done.</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">JF: At the time that you left, you mentioned before there were probably only about 150 Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">HF: Or less.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">JF: Or less left in the town and a certain number of these might also have been able to leave Germany before the deportation started.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">HF: Yes.</span> <span id="s1491">Yes.</span> <span id="s1492">In the list of Miss Mansbacher, the book of immigration--you can see about 20 or maybe some more names of people who were able to leave yet after I had left.</span> <span id="s1493">Some did the desperate step of going to Poland, because at one time they had Poland citizenship and thought they would escape the “Final Solution” of the “Jewish Question” in Poland.</span> <span id="s1494">Unfortunately I don’t think anyone of those who went to Poland was seen again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">JF: They elected to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">HF: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">JF: Is there anything else that you’d like to add to what you’ve already told us?</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">HF: Well, I left Worms with a heavy heart because I was afraid that the worst could happen, and I found that it was almost ironical on my part that I blessed the congregation before I left, because what kind of a blessing is that?</span> <span id="s1499">You just decide the words, but in your heart you are afraid that the worst thing could happen to them.</span> <span id="s1500">That was the feeling with which I left the community.</span> <span id="s1501">If I could have done only anything to help them, to take them with me, to save only one of them, to come to America, I would love to have done it.</span> <span id="s1502">I did make some contacts with relatives of the people here, but by that time, after the war had broken out in ‘39, it was almost impossible for those who had not made former efforts in order to leave Germany that they would get, after that, get a visa for another country.</span> <span id="s1503">Very sad picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">JF: Dr. Frank, thank you so much for talking to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">HF: You are quite welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">Dr. Ismar Elbogen
