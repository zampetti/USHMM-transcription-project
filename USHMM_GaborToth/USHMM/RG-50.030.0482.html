Helen Bamber, tell me about your background first of all, where you grew up and the family you grew up in.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Answer: I grew up as an only child in a Jewish family in North London.</span> <span id="s14">My father was born in America.</span> <span id="s15">My mother was born in the UK, in England, of course, as it was then.</span> <span id="s16">Their parents came from Poland and Russia respectively.</span> <span id="s17">Interestingly, one of my grandfathers was actually born, we found out many years later, in what was -- and my pronunciation is poor, forgive me, Oswiecim, Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s18">And that sent shivers down our spine many years later.</span> <span id="s19">Now, it wasn’t a happy household.</span> <span id="s20">My father was an accountant.</span> <span id="s21">He was a very obsessional man, and during most of my childhood -- I grew up, by the way -- I was born in 1925.</span> <span id="s22">So I grew up in the years of unemployment, dole queues, and the rise of fascism.</span> <span id="s23">And I think this combination absorbed my father completely inasmuch as he was something of a visionary.</span> <span id="s24">He could see, I believe, what was going to happen in Europe.</span> <span id="s25">He was bilingual, he spoke German perfectly, and a number of other languages, and I’ve never understood how it was that a man who was not -- you know, was quite simply educated in this country, a good scholar, but how it was that he spoke the languages he did, and how he could be bilingual in German.</span> <span id="s26">I never understood that, and I don’t now, but he was.</span> <span id="s27">So, as an only child, in a house in north London, with diminishing financial resources, as my father’s activities on behalf of people who were -- who needed to leave Nazi Germany became more -- how can I say more active, or more -- yes, more active.</span> <span id="s28">And as I was exposed to his version of events, his -- his horror of fascism, his fear of anti-Semitism rising in Europe, and indeed, in England where we -- I mean, I was frequently aware of Mosely’s fascists marching through north London, and the east end of London.</span> <span id="s29">I’m losing my thread, but what I’m trying to do is to give a background about an only child growing up in what was later a working class area, because we had to move from a rather sumptuous house to something very modest.</span> <span id="s30">Was a -- a -- a kind of house of -- of s-something bordering on fear and apprehension of what might happen in the future.</span> <span id="s31">My father insisted that we listened to the broadcasts from Germany, which he would translate.</span> <span id="s32">So that as a young child, I -- I was exposed to quite a lot of my father’s understanding and vision, but also his fears, and my own.</span> <span id="s33">N -- my mother tried hard to avoid all this by -- and it wasn’t that she didn’t care, it was that like so many people of her time, and h -- and as is always the case, she actually couldn’t face the possibility of what might happen.</span> <span id="s34">She began to disengage as much as she could.</span> <span id="s35">As my father’s activities became, as I said earlier, more -- more active, there were refugees from Germany who came to our house, en route perhaps for somewhere else, but would often stay in my house for some days, weeks, and -- and as a sickly child, on top of everything else, because I had what later was thought to have been TB, tuberculosis, which is very common in my time, many children had it, I was bi -- be -- I was bedridden for a lot of my -- of the winters of my childhood.</span> <span id="s36">And they -- there were -- people who came and stayed would often come and talk to me, sit on my bed and talk to me, but they wouldn’t talk to me about childhood events, or childhood dreams, and -- and fantasies, and i -- yo-you know, celebration.</span> <span id="s37">It was about what happened to them, and what was -- what happened in Germany.</span> <span id="s38">And I remember there was a pianist who stayed with us, who I disliked very much.</span> <span id="s39">I found him pompous, although he played beautifully.</span> <span id="s40">And he came and sat on my bed frequently.</span> <span id="s41">But he made a great change in my life, in my childish -- my childhood.</span> <span id="s42">He said to me, “You know, you don’t have to be ill like this.</span> <span id="s43">If you want to, you can get out of bed when I leave this room, and you can walk round the room, touch all the furniture, and get back into bed, and say to yourself, I am now in control of myself.”</span> <span id="s44">Now, I disliked him more than ever when he said this, because of course, illness can be a retreat, and a way of avoiding issues.</span> <span id="s45">But I did exactly what he said.</span> <span id="s46">I got up and I walked round the room, and I touched everything, and I said to myself.</span> <span id="s47">“I can make changes, I can be in control.”</span> <span id="s48">I wasn’t very confident, but I said it.</span> <span id="s49">And I don’t know, I think that was a -- a turning point for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Looking back, how do you think that the family atmosphere, and your father’s outlook on life influenced your personality, and your thinking?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: I think it was a very hard upbringing in some ways, although I don’t want to magnify it.</span> <span id="s52">I was very moved by my father.</span> <span id="s53">I still am when I look back and I think of his loneliness and his despair later on, when the Holocaust came.</span> <span id="s54">But I was always off -- I was also attracted by my mother’s social skills, her interest in clothes, her interest in the piano, and her desire for me to be somehow -- I don’t know, something very special.</span> <span id="s55">Not unusual, of course, in Jewish families.</span> <span id="s56">But it was a conflict for me, and I was torn between them both, really.</span> <span id="s57">Later they divorced; when I was in my late teens, they divorced.</span> <span id="s58">But it was an unhappy household, and I’m not sure that I -- I mean, I think I had a good role model for my future in human rights.</span> <span id="s59">I’m not sure that I had a good role model in terms of relationships, and in terms of parenting.</span> <span id="s60">I learned, though, as a -- as an only child in an unhappy household, with these issues, I learned how to negotiate, and I learned how to compromise.</span> <span id="s61">And these, I think, are skills I have.</span> <span id="s62">And that comes not only from later experience, but I learned it in the family home.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: You -- you spent your teenage years, I believe, in London during the war.</span> <span id="s64">Tell me about what that experience was like, and -- and how you think now, looking back, that it affected you.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: I was brought up in the war -- I mean, I -- forgive me, I grew up in the war.</span> <span id="s66">What can I say about it?</span> <span id="s67">In some ways, it was almost -- it’s crazy to say this, it was almost a relief from the fear of be -- of anti-Semitism, and being specially chosen, which was always my fear if the Germans came, specially chosen for annihilation.</span> <span id="s68">So in other words, when I was involved in a bombing incident, when I was fire watching in central London, when central London was terribly bombed, and was buried, albeit it -- it -- it wasn’t as dramatic or terrible as it sounds, but I was -- I wasn’t hurt.</span> <span id="s69">I suppose in modern terminology, I was somewhat traumatized, and I still find it difficult to go downstairs because I was on -- I was -- I was firewatching in a solicitor’s office, and standing on some steps, going down to the basement where all the documents were kept with little bits of pink ribbon tying them up.</span> <span id="s70">And I was going -- there was only about four or five steps, but as I stood on the top step, the steps collapsed under me.</span> <span id="s71">And I think that yes, I do have a phobia from that time, but I also know that -- that I ti -- I felt at the time, and I still do, that I was taking my chances with the rest of the population, and that I wasn’t being particularly chosen at that particular time.</span> <span id="s72">And so in a mad sort of way, the war had it’s reliefs for me, although it killed, in another bombing incident, an aunt of mine, who had a great influence on me, who was considerably left wing.</span> <span id="s73">Did a lot of work in the east end of London, working with the Communists, and the Jewish community there in trying to combat the activities of Mosely’s fascists.</span> <span id="s74">And she was involved in the much glorified battle of Cable Street, which is an incident where when Mosely was going to march down one particular area of the east end, the people of the east end brought out all their furniture, their -- their pianos, their -- their tables, their kitchen equipment, and they blocked the roads of the east end.</span> <span id="s75">And for me, with a father who was growing into despair as to what was happening in Europe, this simple act meant a great deal to me.</span> <span id="s76">It was about resistance, and it was about finding ways, even if they didn’t succeed ultimately in making a stand, in making a statement.</span> <span id="s77">So my aunt was another very strong influence in my life because she represented anything but despair.</span> <span id="s78">She was vigorous, she was sexy.</span> <span id="s79">She had the strangest advice as to how to behave in any sexual encounter.</span> <span id="s80">She was a fascinating, vigorous, lovely woman, and -- with boyfriends, and shocking everybody, platinum blonde hair, but also doing these fantastic things.</span> <span id="s81">An -- and she was a -- she was a very interesting influence in my life, and it was a terrible blow to me when she -- when she and her fiancé, someone I think she might have married, were killed when the Café de Paris had a direct hit.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Café de Paris in London?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: The café de p -- ki -- the Café de P-Paris was a very famous café for dancing, many soldiers and people would -- would go there on leave, and it was rather posh, and I think not inexpensive, but -- and it was supposed to be absolutely safe.</span> <span id="s84">I don’t know why people talk about something being absolutely safe.</span> <span id="s85">It had a direct hit.</span> <span id="s86">Her body was never found, and I remember going with my mother to try and identify various objects that were lined up somewhere in the middle of London where people queued and looked at these objects.</span> <span id="s87">Handbags, shoes, this kind of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: You were brought up with this kind of terrible fear of what might happen to the Jews of Europe.</span> <span id="s89">When did you actually begin to discover, and to understand what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: I think I always understood, because my father had understood what was going on in the -- in -- in terms of the annihilation of the Jewish people and the Gypsies, and the mentally defective.</span> <span id="s91">He had read men ka -- “Mein Kampf,” he had read other documents.</span> <span id="s92">The information actually was there for anyone who wanted to know it.</span> <span id="s93">Members of parliament denied all knowledge of concentration camps, and people -- I think including my father, but I’m not sure about this -- did lobby, and did try to persu -- persuade government of what was going on , but I don’t think that -- that anybody really wanted to listen at the time of -- of a total war situation.</span> <span id="s94">And maybe for other reasons as well.</span> <span id="s95">So I always knew, I always knew about the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s96">It was no secret in my house that people were being taken to concentration camps and murdered.</span> <span id="s97">We weren’t -- I -- I don’t always know -- now when I look back, it’s difficult to be accurate.</span> <span id="s98">Whether the details were known, I’m not su -- to me, I’m not sure, but certainly the word concentration camps, in my German -- my father would say it in German, was well known in my household.</span> <span id="s99">So it wasn’t a stranger to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: What years are we talking about here?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: I’m talking about the -- the years -- the -- the -- the -- all during the war really, th-the war years.</span> <span id="s102">The forties.</span> <span id="s103">The 1941, ’42, ’43, were years in which whilst the war was going on, and London was being bombed, my father was talking about concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: I believe there was an exhibition of photographs in London.</span> <span id="s105">An exhibition of photographs from the camps which had a very profound impact on you.</span> <span id="s106">Can you recall how old you were when you went to see that exhibition and what -- what stayed in your mind from that?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: No, I -- I think actually the exhibition of photographs came -- yes, that’s right, there was an exhibition of photographs that was shown in London.</span> <span id="s108">It wasn’t the photographs that shocked me so much as the attitude of people.</span> <span id="s109">And I think that if I’m not mistaken, that the photographs were discontinued; that means to say the exhibition was discontinued because of people’s reactions.</span> <span id="s110">Now, I’m not quite sure what that reaction was, but you know, after the war people did not want to believe, they did not want to understand the totality of what had happened, and they didn’t really -- they had their own preoccupations with the war, and loss, and deprivation, and rationing, and everything else.</span> <span id="s111">And to bring home to people the atrocities of the Nazis in that -- to that extent, I think either didn’t move people in the right way -- but whatever happened, it didn’t -- I don’t think that it was received with -- with -- with real comprehension, I think, with real under -- l-let’s say how difficult it was for anyone to understand what really happened.</span> <span id="s112">It wasn’t the pictures though, I think, that influenced me to -- to want to go to Germany at the end of the war.</span> <span id="s113">I think that I’d started to think about it for quite a long time, and I -- I’m -- and in -- it’s very interesting that the more one talks about this, the more you begin to understand, or the more you think about it, you begin to understand your motives.</span> <span id="s114">People often ask me why did I want to go to the camps, wh -- was it some voyeuristic reason, was it -- what was it that made me want to go and to work for the survivors.</span> <span id="s115">And I think it really, now talking today, I think it wasn’t only my father, because my father was sunk in despair at the end of the war, whereas everybody was rejoicing, and even I was rejoicing, my father was despairing because of the -- the catastrophic events that had happened, and the -- the death of so many people, not only in the concentration camps, but the -- the -- the -- th-the -- the -- that -- the -- the awfulness of that war, I think just -- just crushed him, and he was very despairing.</span> <span id="s116">He also had his own personal reasons for -- he was living alone then, and he was very sad.</span> <span id="s117">But I think it was also my aunt, because my aunt was the -- the very opposite, in a way, to my father.</span> <span id="s118">And her belief was you must do something, you can do something, you can do anything if you want to.</span> <span id="s119">And so I suppose it was my father’s knowledge, and my aunt’s kind of message about go for it, anybody can do it, do something, make a statement, however -- even if you’re waving your arms and nobody’s watching, do it, was what she was about.</span> <span id="s120">I think that’s really what influenced me.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Do you remember actually taking this decision?</span> <span id="s122">And how old were you at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: I found an organization called the Jewish Relief Unit, that was in formation before the end of the war.</span> <span id="s124">I think I was then about 18, and I made some enquiries and I went to see them, and they announced that I was very young, but they -- they said yes, they’d consider me.</span> <span id="s125">And I joined the relief unit in the hope that I would be able to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s127">Could you tell me what the unit consisted of, who organized it, how it was run, how big it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: The Jewish Relief Unit when I first came upon it was a small office near Woburn House in that square, Woburn Square, or Ensley Place I think was it’s name.</span> <span id="s129">It was a -- a house on a corner, and it consisted of an office with about six or seven people in it.</span> <span id="s130">It was financed, I think, by the -- now I’m not sure about that, it might have been the Central British Fund, I cannot remember.</span> <span id="s131">This -- this could easily be established how the organization was funded.</span> <span id="s132">I do have a book about it, but I don’t read the book, and I’m not sure why.</span> <span id="s133">But anyway, there is a lot of information about the funding of this organization.</span> <span id="s134">And there were people being trained to go.</span> <span id="s135">And these were people who were volunteers, it was a volunteer organization, nobody was paid to go, as far as I know.</span> <span id="s136">And I started to -- to -- to train with them, telling my parents -- I was then living with my mother; my father was separated, as I said.</span> <span id="s137">And this was going to be quite a difficult issue.</span> <span id="s138">I remember sitting in Saint James’s Park, and watching the ducks where I’d met my father, and I said to him, “I -- I want to go to Germany.”</span> <span id="s139">And he didn’t really say very much.</span> <span id="s140">He said, “Well, you must be sure you want to go, and you’ll have to be safe and careful.”</span> <span id="s141">Which hadn’t actually occurred to me at the time, about being safe.</span> <span id="s142">Being careful, yes.</span> <span id="s143">But he -- he didn’t express great enthusiasm or dismay or surprise or -- my mother, of course, was aghast.</span> <span id="s144">And her dreams of what she had expected of me for the future began to disappear to some extent, for her.</span> <span id="s145">She saw me taking a path that she really didn’t like, and I suppose as a mother now it was, looking back, it must have been hard for her.</span> <span id="s146">But I was very determined to go.</span> <span id="s147">And so I continued to -- to train, to -- to be exposed to a psychologist who in pri -- in small intimate sessions would -- individual sessions would ask you questions, but also in group sessions.</span> <span id="s148">And I suppose there were about 20 of us volunteers at the time, who -- not all Jewish by the way, and I think that’s important to know.</span> <span id="s149">There were several Quakers, people who felt very strongly about what had happened, who wanted to -- who offered their -- their services.</span> <span id="s150">And so that’s what I did, and we went on various training courses, to a kibbutz somewhere in England, in Wiltshire, I believe, where we undertook various training in map reading and first aid, and -- but I do remember -- I do remember one session where we sat in a group and I think it was the psychologist asked everyone what they felt they expected to find, and how they would deal with the very impossible situations, and how they would deal with people who they cou -- who felt -- who didn’t want to be helped, or were past helping.</span> <span id="s151">And I remember searching my -- my th-thoughts at the time, and trying to think what -- what is the answer to that, faced with a lot of people who you can’t help.</span> <span id="s152">And I remember saying that maybe one has to accept that there will be people you can’t save.</span> <span id="s153">And maybe if there are children and younger people there, we have to put our energies into trying to help them.</span> <span id="s154">And that maybe -- this now sounds all rather simplistic, but and maybe if -- if people see the energy going into the young and the children, that would be some compensation for them.</span> <span id="s155">I don’t think it was such a bad idea now, looking back, because there were many people that couldn’t be helped.</span> <span id="s156">Anyway, that was -- that was what I said at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: This is tape number one, side B of an interview with Helen Bamber.</span> <span id="s159">Tell me a little bit more about the actual training process, and the extent to which you were really prepared mentally and physically for what you were about to find.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Well, l-looking at how people are prepared today, say in aid agencies, which still leaves a lot to be desired, I’m not sure that we really were prepared so well.</span> <span id="s161">It was a disparate group of -- o-of volunteers.</span> <span id="s162">There were nurses, there were people with a variety of skills at the time.</span> <span id="s163">And -- but I can’t remember sitting down and really -- th-th-there was just that one discussion we had in which we were asked to face the possibility of not being able to help everyone, not being able to save everyone.</span> <span id="s164">It is important because it stayed in my mind and it -- it’s the situation that I’m faced with every day of my life now.</span> <span id="s165">And it’s always hard, it’s always hard and it should always be hard.</span> <span id="s166">But it has to be there, that acceptance that you can’t save everyone.</span> <span id="s167">But it’s so hard.</span> <span id="s168">We went to various -- as I said, we went to this kibbutz, and I remember I drove with somebody in a van, and the idea was that we had to follow the map and find our own way there.</span> <span id="s169">And map reading and finding our way around with a lot of emphasis, I think on practical help, on the provisions to be given.</span> <span id="s170">On the -- on the question of driving, and map reading, and knowing how to distribute the wherewithal, food, or provisions and so on.</span> <span id="s171">I don’t really remember, even with the help of the psychologist, a great deal of help about how we would feel, faced with what we were going to face, which wasn’t only about a d -- a -- a d-devastated people, devastated in every sense of the word.</span> <span id="s172">Suffering from malnutrition, suffering from loss, some behaving as if they were quite mad, all of that.</span> <span id="s173">But it was also that we were going to a country that was in rubble, and starving.</span> <span id="s174">And I certainly wasn’t prepared for the fact -- I’d hardened all these years my heart against the German people.</span> <span id="s175">I’d grown up with a dislike and fear of the Germans.</span> <span id="s176">And when I was on the train going out, on my own, with all my luggage and baggage and God knows what -- I mean, what a performance that was, I remember seeing starving German children standing along the railway line, holding out their hands.</span> <span id="s177">And I was traveling with soldiers, British soldiers, and everybody threw out their bread and whatever they had with them to the starving children.</span> <span id="s178">Now that I wasn’t prepared for, and that was hard too, because these were children, these were innocent children.</span> <span id="s179">And that brought a conflict that I hadn’t -- or an understanding that I hadn’t expected to find in myself.</span> <span id="s180">And I learned that the very first moment I traveled.</span> <span id="s181">So there were many things one wasn’t prepared for.</span> <span id="s182">One wasn’t prepared for the devastated cities.</span> <span id="s183">No, we weren’t prepared, but maybe there was no way to prepare us, because nobody really knew, I think, how catastrophic was the scene that we were t-to find eventually.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: Let me take you back a little bit.</span> <span id="s185">Can you tell me how you were kitted out?</span> <span id="s186">What you looked like and actually the journey?</span> <span id="s187">How does an 18 year old go make her way across half of Europe and end up where?</span> <span id="s188">I don’t know what your destination was, what had you been told?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: My journey remains really a bit of a mystery to me myself.</span> <span id="s190">I was then just 20 by the way, when I went.</span> <span id="s191">I think I was -- have to be very careful about this, but I think I just -- I was just 20 years old.</span> <span id="s192">And I had uniforms, we all had.</span> <span id="s193">We had officer’s uniform, we had officer’s rank.</span> <span id="s194">And an ordinary khaki kind of ordinary wear.</span> <span id="s195">I don’t know what you call it now.</span> <span id="s196">It’s awful that I don’t, but anyway, I traveled in my khaki ordinary, and I traveled with the yellow star on my shoulder, my left shoulder, which is what we had elected to do.</span> <span id="s197">And that in itself was an undertaking.</span> <span id="s198">So not only was I kitted out beyond belief with a -- a kind of a canvas thing that was like a mobile bath, or whatever, and a kit bag that really I could barely lift.</span> <span id="s199">And a bedroll and all kinds of -- the bedroll was very important later on, by the way.</span> <span id="s200">The -- the mobile bath, I never knew it’s -- what it was intended to do, but it -- I used to sort of keep all my dirty underwear in it because I could sort of snap it together when anybody came into the room.</span> <span id="s201">You know, it was one of those things, it sort of opened out with two kind of sticks, and it wa -- oh, I don’t know, it was a kind of ghastly thing.</span> <span id="s202">But it was very good for underwear and you could smack the two pieces together when anybody came in, and nobody could see.</span> <span id="s203">So that’s what I did with that.</span> <span id="s204">And there was all kinds of equipment that one didn’t actually need.</span> <span id="s205">I think the bedroll was very important.</span> <span id="s206">So I was in uniform, with a cap, you know, a beret, and m-my khaki, my ghastly shoes and navy blue underwear and -- and the yellow star.</span> <span id="s207">And why I traveled on my own I do not know, but I think there was a very difficult procedure before anybody was allowed to go.</span> <span id="s208">There was a very careful vetting of every individual, not necessarily verbally, I mean I didn’t meet anybody, but I know that there was one woman who belonged to the Communist party, who was not allowed to go.</span> <span id="s209">Which was a very great disappointment to all of us who knew and loved her.</span> <span id="s210">So, there was a very careful vetting of each individual, and I think there was a fear by the officials involved, that Jews going out were in some way -- Jews going out to work in the former concentration camps, or in Holland, or in Greece were somehow either a provocation or a difficulty, an embarrassment, difficult to control.</span> <span id="s211">Whatever it was, it was difficult.</span> <span id="s212">And so everybody was vetted very carefully, and although we came under the auspices directly of UNRRA, we were also responsible directly also, to the British military government.</span> <span id="s213">At least we were in the British zone, that means to say those of us who went to Germany.</span> <span id="s214">I had to go -- I mean, my final destination was a small village called Eilshausen, which I -- I kept spelling in my head all the time, E-i-l-s.</span> <span id="s215">Eilshausen.</span> <span id="s216">It was difficult for me.</span> <span id="s217">I’d spoke some German by the way, because I’d learned from my father enough German to get by.</span> <span id="s218">And the worst of all was that I went on a train from Victoria -- and I remember people were very helpful to me because I’m not very tall, and with all this heavy kit, the soldiers were good, and they would lift things for me.</span> <span id="s219">But of course they were also very -- they would also look quite quizzically at -- at the yellow star.</span> <span id="s220">So I was constantly in conversation, having to explain oneself.</span> <span id="s221">Why one was going, what one was doing.</span> <span id="s222">And it was the beginning in a way of a kind of role in society, in the public, that was always slightly uncomfortable for me, and it exists to this day, where I have to explain what I’m doing for asylum seekers and refugees.</span> <span id="s223">And so I -- I’d already begun then to explain what I was doing with the yellow star on my shoulder.</span> <span id="s224">[tape break] Where am I?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: With the yellow star on your shoulder --</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: -- you had to explain --</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: I had to explain myself to people as to why I was wearing the yellow star.</span> <span id="s229">And people were tolerant, the soldiers were good.</span> <span id="s230">But when I got to Calais, there was a hold up.</span> <span id="s231">The trains to Germany th -- were held up.</span> <span id="s232">I can’t remember why, whether is was overcrowding.</span> <span id="s233">It was quite a precarious journey eventually when I did get on the train because of the bridges, and the crossings.</span> <span id="s234">Bridges was dangerous and we all had to stand on one side of the train in order to give balance, which was a bit nerve-wracking.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: How do you mean?</span> <span id="s236">Can you explain?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Well, yes, but I haven’t quite got to Calais yet, because I was stuck.</span> <span id="s238">Let me go back to Calais.</span> <span id="s239">I was stuck in Calais for a week, and we lived -- I never took my clothes off i-in that week, and we stayed in -- oh, what are those huts called?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Nissen?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: Nissen huts, yes, in kind of dormitories on paliasis and so on.</span> <span id="s242">And it was -- it was very primitive, and I remember wandering round Calais all on my own and feeling so alone, as I’ve never felt in my life before.</span> <span id="s243">I hadn’t been out of England before, which is strange in this day and age, but I had never been out of England.</span> <span id="s244">And so this was the first time I’d been out.</span> <span id="s245">And I was very alone.</span> <span id="s246">Eventually we took our turn and we were put on the train.</span> <span id="s247">And I remember something quite awful about this train because it would always stop at various places which were not a station.</span> <span id="s248">I mean, in other words I couldn’t -- you couldn’t -- you had no platform, you had to get off the train, so to speak, without a platform, in order to go to wherever you were going to be fed on the way, which again was a kind of Nissen hut, specially prepared for the soldiers en route.</span> <span id="s249">And you would sit at a long table and -- and be fed.</span> <span id="s250">And I had the utmost difficulty with my height, in being able to mount this train.</span> <span id="s251">And this was one of the -- the extraordinary things that preoccupied me on the journey, all k-kind of, sort of incidental ridiculous things, not about the seriousness of my task, but how in heaven’s name I was going to get up and down this train without making a complete idiot of myself.</span> <span id="s252">And usually I had to be hauled up and pushed from behind.</span> <span id="s253">But the train ricketed along, and there was one bridge that we crossed when we were in Germany, when the German guard, or person on the train came through carrying a lantern.</span> <span id="s254">Achtung, achtung, and inviting us all to stand at one side of the train so that we actually balanced it properly, because there was a danger that the -- you know, that -- I don’t know, that maybe the train would topple over.</span> <span id="s255">Whatever it was, that’s what we all did.</span> <span id="s256">And then there were the children on the way.</span> <span id="s257">And if -- you know, the journey was a bit of a nightmare because I was so terrified that I would not find myself at this tiny village -- no, it wasn’t Eilshausen, do forgive me, Eilshausen was my final destination.</span> <span id="s258">The station I had to get out at was Badounhausen.</span> <span id="s259">Badenhausen, which was a base for British soldiers.</span> <span id="s260">And I had to find my way from Badenhausen, which was quite a long way, to Eilshausen, which was the headquarters of our unit, where Henry Lunzer, the capt -- a former captain in the British army, and who was then the director of the Jewish reli-lief unit, had set up our headquarters in the village.</span> <span id="s261">And because of the fact that I had taken a secretarial course at some stage, and was quite proficient in shorthand and typing, I was for the moment, to be his assistant.</span> <span id="s262">And so that was my route, Badenhausen and then on to Eilshausen.</span> <span id="s263">I had no idea how I was going to get to Eilshausen.</span> <span id="s264">Well eventually I managed to get out of the station, and I’ll never forget it, it was an extraordinary sensation.</span> <span id="s265">I was in Germany, I was on a German station all on my own, with all my stuff.</span> <span id="s266">And I remember walking down the steps and walking into the street.</span> <span id="s267">And I remember hearing German, seeing German lettering, an-and this somehow German shops and the names of things in German, and German voices, and a s -- a terrible sense of panic.</span> <span id="s268">And it was the -- didn’t -- doesn’t -- didn’t happen to me very often, but I really for the moment was frozen.</span> <span id="s269">And I remember standing there and thinking, “My God,” you know, “what have I done?”</span> <span id="s270">I’m in the middle of Germany -- it isn’t the middle of Germany, but you know -- I’m in Germany, and I’m with all this stuff.</span> <span id="s271">And I actually had to get the things down in -- in dribs and drabs.</span> <span id="s272">I think somebody helped me because I couldn’t carry all the stuff down the steps in one go.</span> <span id="s273">I think somebody did help me, and I was standing there.</span> <span id="s274">A British officer came up in a car.</span> <span id="s275">And of course, this is what happens, and you learn this in post-war situations.</span> <span id="s276">There is a kind of help that doesn’t normally exist that you -- you suddenly get used to.</span> <span id="s277">He drove up and he said, “Where are you going?”</span> <span id="s278">And I said, “I -- I have to get to Eilshausen.”</span> <span id="s279">He said, “Where the devil is that?”</span> <span id="s280">I said, “I haven’t a clue.”</span> <span id="s281">And he said, “Well get in the car and I’ll take you to my head -- my HQ, and -- and we’ll try and find out where Eilshausen is.”</span> <span id="s282">So I went with him to his HQ in Badenhausen.</span> <span id="s283">And you know, I can’t remember whether I ate -- I can remember cleaning up, I do remember that.</span> <span id="s284">I remember there was some sort of provision there, and I -- I cleaned myself up a bit.</span> <span id="s285">I must have been filthy because the week in Calais, it was not the most hygienic.</span> <span id="s286">And I felt an awful wreck, I remember that.</span> <span id="s287">And eventually -- but I don’t remember eating anything at all, except on the train.</span> <span id="s288">And then he came down, and he was very efficient, rather like something you see in British war films now, on a Sunday.</span> <span id="s289">You know, very elegant, very beautiful, very well spoken.</span> <span id="s290">And he said, “Look, I -- I’ve -- I’ve found a -- I’ve found somebody who -- we found Eilshausen, it’s a small village, I’ll get you there.”</span> <span id="s291">I’m still conscious of the yellow star.</span> <span id="s292">I was very grateful that somehow -- you know, this -- this curious thing of sh -- of pride and shame, you know, what was the yellow star going to do for us out there?</span> <span id="s293">Was it going to open doors, was it going to bring hostility?</span> <span id="s294">But I’d explained to him what we were about, and he took it perfectly in his stride.</span> <span id="s295">And they found a driver for me, and finding a driver and finding a truck in those days was hard work.</span> <span id="s296">So I had to wait quite a long time, and then I was taken to Eilshausen.</span> <span id="s297">And I remember when I got to Eilshausen, which is a tiny, little village, and I met with Henry Lunzer, and I think he -- he and I at that time, at that moment, were the only people there, although some British officers were coming over that evening for whatever, I don’t know what it was.</span> <span id="s298">And he was in -- we were in a commandeered house.</span> <span id="s299">It was the house of the local Nazi, and that was the kind of way things were done there, that people were billeted in the houses of the former Nazis.</span> <span id="s300">And the former Nazi would have been Nazi leader, I don’t know whether he was imprisoned or whatever the situation was for him.</span> <span id="s301">But certainly some of his staff was still around, and I was very conscious of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Did you have any encounters with them, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Oh, I always had encounters with them.</span> <span id="s304">I always had encounters with them.</span> <span id="s305">I -- I -- my work developed whilst I was in -- in Germany, between two camps and the headquarters.</span> <span id="s306">One camp was Belsen.</span> <span id="s307">The other camp was Kownitz, where I did a great deal of work, probably more than I did in Belsen, and Eilshausen, the vil -- the -- the center itself.</span> <span id="s308">And it -- it was there, in the main, that I had encounters with the local Germans, although I did have a very angry encounter with somebody once later on, much later on, when I was taking somebody from ORT, the American organization, well known, of course, in America, to -- to Belsen.</span> <span id="s309">Shall I just tell that story now?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: We -- one of the things -- and you see, the context is always so difficult, why with me I don’t know, but I had to -- I was in Celle, C-e-double l-e, which is a very beautiful, medieval town -- I think it’s medieval town, not so far from Belsen.</span> <span id="s312">And it was my job to remain there, and to escort this Am-American woman who had come -- I think it was ORT, and I was to take her to Belsen.</span> <span id="s313">And as we were eating in the -- the mess, the officer’s mess with other soldiers, and I was talking about Belsen, and this German waitress sort of said very arrogantly in Germany -- and I don’t know why there’s all this discussion about Belsen, we didn’t know anything about the camp.</span> <span id="s314">We nev -- we didn’t know that there was a camp -- we don’t know what all this talk about Belsen is.</span> <span id="s315">But she was extremely arrogant, and for the first and only time in my life, I stood up and I was going to hit her.</span> <span id="s316">And I was going to hit her very, very hard.</span> <span id="s317">And it was only when the -- the p -- the person from ORT could see what I was d -- about to do, that she restrained me, but I -- I have never since felt such violent rage as I felt for that woman.</span> <span id="s318">And I do -- I can, amongst all the other things I understand, and I preach about tolerance, about this, about that, I can understand violent rage in such situations, because I was out of control, totally.</span> <span id="s319">But these servants that we had in Eilshausen, were German.</span> <span id="s320">There was Frau Shermburg and her daughter, who’d come from eastern German -- Germany, who declared frequently that they’d been raped.</span> <span id="s321">Frau Shermburg was the wife of a doctor who’d been killed, and her son had been killed in the war.</span> <span id="s322">Her daughter was a nurse.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: And what was there role exactly, at Eilshausen?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: Their role was to provi -- was to cook and help us manage the house.</span> <span id="s325">We were very, very -- what’s the word I want?</span> <span id="s326">Very correct.</span> <span id="s327">We -- Henry Lunzer had been an officer in the British army.</span> <span id="s328">He maintained good standards of behavior within the house.</span> <span id="s329">Nothing should be broken, nothing should be taken that was not ours.</span> <span id="s330">If it was broken it had to be recorded as having been broken.</span> <span id="s331">We were to be mindful and careful of everything.</span> <span id="s332">And Frau Shermburg and her daughter cooked and managed the house for us.</span> <span id="s333">There was people that came in and dealt with the laundry, because by the time other people joined us -- I suppose I must have been one of the first, really, to go out to Eilshausen because other people joined us later.</span> <span id="s334">Harry git -- Grojinsky from the Grojinsky bakers came, and he was the officer for provisions and storekee -- stores.</span> <span id="s335">And so, as people came, laundry and other things needed to be in place, and a -- and as -- and a group of about I think at least seven or eight drivers, with trucks -- because that was the only way we could manage to move around Germany obviously, there was no transport provided.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: So you were all billeted in this Nazi’s house?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: And you were looked after by this --</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: Well, I wouldn’t say looked after, she -- Frau Shermburg was there to -- to cook, and -- but she was treated well, and I -- and she was billeted -- she wasn’t living in the house, she lived in the village.</span> <span id="s340">But I remember there was one scene, a very ugly scene, where she told me that they were being attacked on the way home, for being -- for working with us at the Jewish relief unit.</span> <span id="s341">And she said would somebody escort her.</span> <span id="s342">And one of the men in the -- in the unit escorted her, one of the tall men escorted her -- them, back to their billet.</span> <span id="s343">But there was one scene where a group of very angry people --</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: From the village?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: From the village.</span> <span id="s346">They were angry, I think they were drunk.</span> <span id="s347">They were very noisy, and they were carrying sticks, and they came to the house outside, and they made a terrible din.</span> <span id="s348">And Frau Shermburg was -- she said these are the peop -- these are people who di -- are going to hurt us if we go.</span> <span id="s349">And I, at that time, had been befriended by -- this was much later in my experience there, I’d been befriended by somebody from the Jewish Brigade, and I did quite a lot of work with him in Kownitz camp.</span> <span id="s350">And he had said to me on one occasion -- he taught me many things, he taught me for example, how to wake up at a certain time, which was my difficulty.</span> <span id="s351">I was very young, and I had difficulty waking up.</span> <span id="s352">And he told me that you can wake up any time you say you want to wake up, you can do it.</span> <span id="s353">So he taught me that, so that I wasn’t late for things.</span> <span id="s354">And -- but he also said to me amongst many other lessons, if you meet th -- a kind of -- in a -- a situation in which you’re isolated, and a lot of people are at the front door, or wha -- a-angry, don’t come out in a posse -- he didn’t use that word, but don’t come out in a group, one of you goes out, only one.</span> <span id="s355">And on this occasion, I think because -- I don’t know whether we were short of people, or whether because I am so short and small, and was quite small -- slender at the time -- not now, but then, I -- I went out, and I opened the door, and I stood by this -- in front of them, without saying anything, with nothing in my hands.</span> <span id="s356">And we just looked at each other, and then they slunk away.</span> <span id="s357">But it was a very important lesson to me.</span> <span id="s358">It may not have worked.</span> <span id="s359">It could -- it need not have worked.</span> <span id="s360">They could have done anything, but they didn’t.</span> <span id="s361">And it -- on this occasion it worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: This is tape number two, side A of an interview with Helen Bamber.</span> <span id="s364">To take you back again a little step, what kind of an area was Eilshausen in, and what did it look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Eilshausen was in Westphalia, some distance from Hanover, I should think about 20 kilometers, maybe less.</span> <span id="s366">It is -- it was a very beautiful village.</span> <span id="s367">Not so much the village itself, because some of the houses were modern, you know, spacious, fantastic houses in their own grounds, with a laundry room and you name it.</span> <span id="s368">But the walks were brilliant.</span> <span id="s369">The woods were lovely and we would often walk in the woods.</span> <span id="s370">And there was a woman called Frau Mometchka who was German, who had married a Jew, and who died in the concentration camp, her husband did.</span> <span id="s371">And she really belonged nowhere.</span> <span id="s372">Because of her background she could not live within the German community.</span> <span id="s373">And oh -- because of -- she didn’t quite belong in the house.</span> <span id="s374">She was a very educated, elegant -- it’s very difficult to be elegant in those circumstances, but very dignified woman in her 60’s, I would think.</span> <span id="s375">Tall, upright, spoke a beautiful German, played the piano beautifully, used to play for us.</span> <span id="s376">How she came to us I do not know.</span> <span id="s377">She was there one day when I came back from a mission.</span> <span id="s378">I don’t know where I’d been.</span> <span id="s379">I got to know her very well, she was very fond of me, we used to walk in the woods together.</span> <span id="s380">It was beautiful, absolutely -- absolutely lovely, with streams, woods, hills.</span> <span id="s381">Lovely place.</span> <span id="s382">And she would talk to me about her husband, she would talk to me about music, she would try to correct my terrible German.</span> <span id="s383">She was very much a teacher, a scholar.</span> <span id="s384">I had a great admiration for her, and affection for her.</span> <span id="s385">It wasn’t unusual for people to end up in our house with very few questions asked.</span> <span id="s386">I mean, it’s very strange, but in those circumstances you don’t ask very often.</span> <span id="s387">I don’t ever remember saying how did Frau Mometchka come?</span> <span id="s388">I never knew.</span> <span id="s389">And I didn’t know how she went, because when I came back from one mission, she wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s390">And I said, “Where’s Frau Mometchka?”</span> <span id="s391">And they said, “Oh no, she’s not here any more.”</span> <span id="s392">And I never knew where she went, but because of the speed, and the ferocity of everything that was going on, and the anxiety of pri -- everyday life, I didn’t ask, and I never knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Now you’ve told us that you lived in this -- th-the house that had formerly been occupied by one of the local Nazis, but your office I believe, was elsewhere.</span> <span id="s394">Could you tell us about the office, and w -- and the job that you went there to do, and that you ended up doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: The office was a short distance from the house.</span> <span id="s396">It was just a v -- a few minutes walk from the house up a country lane, and was simply a low, brick building.</span> <span id="s397">I don’t know what it had been before.</span> <span id="s398">It looked a bit like a -- a keeper’s house.</span> <span id="s399">It -- but we used it as an office.</span> <span id="s400">It had obviously been a house.</span> <span id="s401">And I set up there with a typewriter and looked out over onto the fields.</span> <span id="s402">And -- and that’s really where the work of the unit was fashioned in that -- in that place.</span> <span id="s403">There was a German man, who’d obviously been close to his master, the Nazi, I think, leader.</span> <span id="s404">I took an instant dislike to him, and I would often work in the building on my own.</span> <span id="s405">I -- I -- I’m a slow worker, and I often -- and I still do it, I work late and long, and I would often be in the building on my own and he’d be stoking the -- there was like a furnace, an old-fashioned furnace where you burned wood to heat the boiler for hot water and so on.</span> <span id="s406">Like a boiler.</span> <span id="s407">And he would fidget about the house and I was terribly uneasy with him there.</span> <span id="s408">And I found some leaflets in the house, Nazi leaflets.</span> <span id="s409">I asked him to throw them in the fire.</span> <span id="s410">There was a whip -- I always remember that, there was a whip hanging up on the wall.</span> <span id="s411">Now, that could have been for anything, I mean it need not have had an ominous -- a particularly ominous meaning, maybe they had animals, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s412">But it -- it made me very uneasy.</span> <span id="s413">And I said to him one day, “What is that doing there?</span> <span id="s414">Why is it here in the house?</span> <span id="s415">It’s not something I want to see.”</span> <span id="s416">And he said, “Hm, it was always in the house.”</span> <span id="s417">And I -- I said, “Please take it away, get rid of it.”</span> <span id="s418">But he didn’t like me, and I didn’t like him.</span> <span id="s419">And Frau Shermburg -- Frau Shermburg looked to me for arbitration and negotiation.</span> <span id="s420">She recognized very quickly that I could negotiate for her and her daughter with Henry the director, and f-for any facilities that she needed.</span> <span id="s421">And that became my role.</span> <span id="s422">She would show me photographs of her husband, the doctor who was killed, and her son, standing near the Arc de Triomphe.</span> <span id="s423">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: In uniform, presumably?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: In uniform, looking very much the Nazi -- well, the -- the German officer that he was.</span> <span id="s426">And it was very difficult, it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s427">It was a mother showing a picture of -- of her husband, her son.</span> <span id="s428">She maintained, as did her daughter, and I believe it to be so, that when the Russians came in to where they were living in eastern Germany, they were both raped many times and in front of each other and that -- that was not surprising, the story of rape was very common, both in -- particularly within the Russian zone.</span> <span id="s429">And you know, these kind of situations, to do with who you are and where you’re born, become very relevant -- and the choices that you make.</span> <span id="s430">And you have to ask yourself what choices did she have?</span> <span id="s431">On the other hand she didn’t see the significance of showing me the picture of her son standing near the Arc de Triomphe.</span> <span id="s432">I did have to point that out to her.</span> <span id="s433">It was a -- it was difficult, this relationship with local Germans, very difficult.</span> <span id="s434">And I remember looking out of the window one day when a colleague of mine, Edith Blau, who’d been in a concentration camp, and who’d been liberated with her mother by the Russians, and both of them were living in our house -- as I say, people came and went, and people stayed, and she stayed.</span> <span id="s435">And she’s now in this country, in -- in England.</span> <span id="s436">And she was passing a group of Germans in -- she was in uniform with a yellow star, she became a member of our team.</span> <span id="s437">And I s -- I was looking out of the window and I saw her strike, very hard, one of the German women who’d obviously made a remark about the Jews, having seen the yellow star.</span> <span id="s438">So tensions were high.</span> <span id="s439">Strange things did happen.</span> <span id="s440">There were stories about Germans putting wire across the streets in order that British soldiers on motorcycle could be decapitated, and that did happen.</span> <span id="s441">And it was an uneasy time.</span> <span id="s442">You did not sleep easily, let me put it that way.</span> <span id="s443">You -- you were aware, all the time, of tensions, of hatred.</span> <span id="s444">Your own and others.</span> <span id="s445">And that was hard.</span> <span id="s446">That was hard, that bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Tell me about the first few days, first few weeks in your job.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Well, for the first few weeks of my job, I think, was trying to help Henry to get some sort of order into what was a fairly chaotic situation, and to try to formulate some kind of strategy for the administration of a headquarters.</span> <span id="s449">I’d never had any experience of that before, but he, being an army officer, a captain in the British army, had experienced -- and so I learned from him.</span> <span id="s450">And we did quite well, I think; he was efficient.</span> <span id="s451">But after just a couple of days we went to Belsen together.</span> <span id="s452">We drove.</span> <span id="s453">And a ye -- part of Mrs. Henriekie’s team, she led the first team into Belsen, the first team of the Jewish Relief Unit into Belsen.</span> <span id="s454">And her team was there, and I must say I was incredibly nervous.</span> <span id="s455">It was reassuring being with Henry, but nevertheless, I was very nervous.</span> <span id="s456">Now, I can’t remember that first day very well.</span> <span id="s457">We went to the -- to the concrete blocks which had belonged to the -- oh, to the ger -- German army -- to the -- forgive me, I’ll come back to that.</span> <span id="s458">But you know that the people who’d been in -- liberated from camp one, when camp one was burned down, they were taken to the concrete blocks, where the German army had -- had been billeted.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: We just paused there, and -- to allow Mrs. Bamber to reflect on whose barracks we were talking about exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: It was the former German barracks, but I -- I -- I do not -- th-the name, it has escaped me.</span> <span id="s461">Some people refer to is as the former SS bar -- barracks.</span> <span id="s462">I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s463">But whatever, the people were incarcerated there in the barracks.</span> <span id="s464">And the barracks were bleak, they were kind of solid blocks of concrete.</span> <span id="s465">I can’t remember the lighting.</span> <span id="s466">I always remember it as very dim.</span> <span id="s467">I remember candles.</span> <span id="s468">I remember staying all night one -- on one occasion with s-somebody who died in one of the rooms.</span> <span id="s469">And it was over time talking to people in the rooms that bu -- was my first encounter with the inmates.</span> <span id="s470">Now, it wasn’t on that first day.</span> <span id="s471">That first day was a kind of initiation into the whole atmosphere of Bergen-Belsen at that time.</span> <span id="s472">I met the unit -- the workers.</span> <span id="s473">I went to camp one, which had been burned down.</span> <span id="s474">I saw the mounds, these huge mounds where had -- which had formed the mass graves.</span> <span id="s475">It was very -- there was always about that place particularly, that camp one, there was this strange, sweet smell which I -- I know to be the smell of death.</span> <span id="s476">I believe it to be, but I always refer to it as the smell of geraniums, because that’s what it was like.</span> <span id="s477">It was like taking the leaves of the geraniums and crushing them in your hand and then smelling them.</span> <span id="s478">And it’s -- it’s a sweet, dank smell, and that was the smell.</span> <span id="s479">And I’ve never forgotten it.</span> <span id="s480">And sometimes I’m reminded of it when the smell returns, that kind of dank smell.</span> <span id="s481">And this sense of awfulness, the sense of death was there in that space that was empty.</span> <span id="s482">There were no bodies, there was nothing.</span> <span id="s483">There were no birds, nothing stirred, it was just a terrible, empty space.</span> <span id="s484">And yet you -- you felt all the time as though someone was behind you, or someone was by the side of you.</span> <span id="s485">You felt very uneasy.</span> <span id="s486">I -- I know that I went there the first day, and I went there many times with other people who were involved in some kind of mourning.</span> <span id="s487">They may be people who had come as Jewish soldiers -- much later, this was much later -- or they were the inmates, although very few of them went there.</span> <span id="s488">But I went there sometimes, and I attended the ceremony there, where the monument was erected, the first monument, in memory.</span> <span id="s489">I believe there’s a picture somewhere of my unit marching.</span> <span id="s490">It’s somewhere in the Vina library, and I’ve never been to see it, but I believe it exists, because people have told me that it does, and they recognize me, mainly I think because I was very small, and I was in front for that reason.</span> <span id="s491">But I returned many times, and I spent many days there, and I spent a long period in the winter, because I remember sleeping in a sleeping bag with all my clothes on in the very cold winters that followed.</span> <span id="s492">And what was I doing there?</span> <span id="s493">And that’s the difficulty, I can’t really remember that I had a particular role as I had in other places.</span> <span id="s494">I went and I talked, and I can’t remember anybody asking me to do that, or seeing any value in it.</span> <span id="s495">So maybe I elected to go.</span> <span id="s496">When I knew that a driver or somebody was going to Belsen, which was very frequent, people frequently went there with provisions or with papers, or what have you.</span> <span id="s497">There was no other way of communicating than by going somewhere.</span> <span id="s498">The telephone systems were down, and it was very difficult to make telephone calls.</span> <span id="s499">And so it was -- the easiest thing was to always go to a place.</span> <span id="s500">So it is not surprising that I elected to go, and I elected to go I think because over time I found that by talking to people -- that by receiving the information that they gave me, was in itself a v -- a v -- a value.</span> <span id="s501">That doesn’t sound very profound, but people who give the most terrible information, of death, destruction, loss.</span> <span id="s502">Who rock with misery and despair, who are desperately fearful, who want to die, many of them, but can’t, it’s very important to receive that information in a way that says to people, I am your witness, I am here to tell your story.</span> <span id="s503">If you can’t tell it, I will be able to tell it for you.</span> <span id="s504">But all I can be is your witness, I can’t take away the past.</span> <span id="s505">Now I didn’t learn that quickly, I learned it painfully because I always felt I couldn’t do anything, what am I doing here?</span> <span id="s506">I can’t take away the past, I can’t change anything.</span> <span id="s507">So what is the value of my presence, and why do I keep coming?</span> <span id="s508">And I think it was because I began to learn that being a witness, simple and ordinary and limited as that may be, does have a value to the person who may not live very long, and who knows it.</span> <span id="s509">And so, I think in a way that was one of my tasks, but why I spent so many weeks there, sleeping on the floor, and what work I did with Henry there, or with anybody else, I honestly can’t tell you.</span> <span id="s510">I later went back there many times, when I was responsible much later for what was referred to as the TB train.</span> <span id="s511">I was sent to nic -- by Henry, to negotiate in Switzerland with a Jewish organization, humanitarian organization for the transfer of young people suffering from tuberculosis, who -- whose chance of recovery would be very much greater if they were taken to Switzerland to recover, which was one of the ways people treated tuberculosis in those days.</span> <span id="s512">And I went to Switzerland and I met this extraordinary woman.</span> <span id="s513">And I remember saying to her -- I wasn’t in uniform, and I don’t know why, maybe it was politic -- no, to be -- I just can’t remember.</span> <span id="s514">And I remember saying to her, “Why -- why -- how did you recognize me?”</span> <span id="s515">And she said, “It really wasn’t difficult to recognize you, I would have recognized you anywhere, as one Jew to another.”</span> <span id="s516">Anyway, I went with the x-rays, and when I say I went with the x-rays, believe me, I’m saying something extraordinary.</span> <span id="s517">Because to persuade people, young people, who were desperate to leave Belsen and other camps, desperate to get out, to emigrate to America or to England, desperate to get out.</span> <span id="s518">To persuade them to have an x-ray to identify that they were suffering tuberculosis was the last thing that they wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: Because it excluded them from --</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: -- going to this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: Yes, they would not be acceptable, and they knew that.</span> <span id="s523">And there was all kinds of maneuvering and manipulation of x-rays, and t -- name changing, and I mean it was a nightmare.</span> <span id="s524">And it -- it was a killer, I mean I -- I worked incredibly hard, and I remember losing my voice with the sheer -- you know, the -- the energy needed to persuade people that they wouldn’t be able to go anyway, that they would be identified anyway at some point as having the illness.</span> <span id="s525">And I’d hoped I was right to do that.</span> <span id="s526">I wasn’t working alone, I had a -- good advisors, but I had to persuade people.</span> <span id="s527">And then I had to persuade this -- to go with this delightful woman and persuade the Swiss authorities.</span> <span id="s528">And I remember a very suave, very beautiful, tall Swiss gentleman, who made clear to me, reluctantly, that yes, a certain number of young people would be acceptable to the Swiss, to go to Davose to be treated for their tuberculosis, on the understanding only that they were -- could recover, and that they could return to Germany at the end of their treatment.</span> <span id="s529">And that was th -- one of the first political lessons of my lifetime, because I learned about the la -- lo -- lack of compassion, I lat -- learned about politics, and in that one meeting, I learned it all.</span> <span id="s530">I learned about officialdom, bureaucracy that -- that -- that -- tha-tha -- that -- that protects people from the truth, it protects people from looking at that sick, young person.</span> <span id="s531">And I was very sick at heart myself, I was very upset.</span> <span id="s532">But I’d actually got the agreement, so I went back to Germany, and then there was an enormous activity on my part, and others helping me, to try to arrange for the evacuation of the young people.</span> <span id="s533">And I have pictures of this that can be supplied, to go on what was referred to as the TB train from Hanover station, which was bombed and derelict, catastrophically so, to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s534">And eventually -- I mean it was, I suppose, a triumph, but nothing -- it didn’t feel like a triumph, really.</span> <span id="s535">Nothing -- it just felt right, I suppose, that young people should be treated eventually after many months, having fought with many officials, British army officials in -- particularly on one occasion, when I needed a document that hadn’t come.</span> <span id="s536">They needed about five or six different permissions in order to leave the camps, from the British military government.</span> <span id="s537">And if they hadn’t got all five or six, they couldn’t travel.</span> <span id="s538">And in one case I had to go to Düsseldorf, I think it was, and persuade them to allow a young person in Düsseldorf to travel to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s539">And I think we were all day trying to persuade them.</span> <span id="s540">Finally I think it was only because we offered a lift.</span> <span id="s541">We were going to Berlin to catch the train, to put the document on the train.</span> <span id="s542">I mean, it’s all very primitive stuff.</span> <span id="s543">And -- and I got per -- I think that he was persuaded because we gave a lift to somebody to Berlin.</span> <span id="s544">And finally I got the documents.</span> <span id="s545">Eventually the train went, but it was made clear to me by UNRRA and the Red Cross, that if -- that I was short of one particular document necessary for the TB train.</span> <span id="s546">And that, you know, I would be held responsible for that, that everything was on course, that the TB train would come.</span> <span id="s547">It was all arranged by the Red Cross, but that at the last minute, there could be a hitch, and that that was my responsibility because I hadn’t got this document.</span> <span id="s548">So I remember standing on this train, waiting for it to go, and the sense of fear and trepidation, everybody was happy.</span> <span id="s549">The children, the young people were laughing and singing and looking out of the window, and I was terrified that at the end of the day there would be a hitch.</span> <span id="s550">Some official, some army official would come along and say I’m so sorry, but this is not correct, there’s -- something here is missing.</span> <span id="s551">However, it went.</span> <span id="s552">And I remember jumping off the train and think, my God, it’s gone.</span> <span id="s553">And looking at this train -- and you’ve got to picture Hanover station without a roof, with things hanging down, and this train wobbling away, and the kids hanging out of the window.</span> <span id="s554">And I remember standing there with tears running down my face and thinking it’s going to be all right, they’re going to go -- I don’t know what happened to the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: Let me take you back -- whoops -- let me take you back to -- to Belsen, and your early days there.</span> <span id="s556">How many survivors were there, and where were they from, what kind of state were they in?</span> <span id="s557">Can you tell me about them?</span> <span id="s558">You’ve taken us as far as describing the barracks where they were housed.</span> <span id="s559">What do you see in terms of -- of -- of the people within those barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: The people were mainly Polish, Romanian, from eastern Europe.</span> <span id="s561">There was one remote German woman who remained.</span> <span id="s562">And the reason, of course, was that most had been killed much earlier on.</span> <span id="s563">And she would always talk to me about the if factor.</span> <span id="s564">If my husband had only done this, he would not have been taken to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s565">If he hadn’t looked in my direction, or if he had kept quiet.</span> <span id="s566">Or if -- if -- if -- and this was always the word that people used all the time.</span> <span id="s567">If -- if only.</span> <span id="s568">And this preoccupied people so much, if only.</span> <span id="s569">And so you constantly had to ge -- take people back to the fact that it was -- it was totally out of their hands, that there was an inevitability about this.</span> <span id="s570">And -- but it was such a painful journey to take with people.</span> <span id="s571">She spoke English I remember.</span> <span id="s572">Mostly Polish, some were ruma -- well, eastern Europe.</span> <span id="s573">And of course, the two famous people who emerged as leaders of the camp eventually, and who I got to know very well, was Yosul Rosenzoft, a former lawyer, Polish, and Dr. Bimko, who became his wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: This is tape number two, side B of an interview with Helen Bamber.</span> <span id="s576">Right, so you were telling me you take Mrs. Forest, to -- to give us the names of the two leaders.</span> <span id="s577">But before that, if you can give me a sense of the kind of condition these people were in, how they were dressed, how they lived, how they slept, and the kind of experiences with which they were then trying to come to terms already, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: I remember people sleeping on the floor, and dressed in old jackets, trousers.</span> <span id="s579">Things were handed out, and when we ourselves had supplies of clothes, but they were ill-fitting, and people wore anything, so people continued to look somehow ill-kempt, and ill -- ill-fitting, ill-dressed, ill-cared for.</span> <span id="s580">They were emaciated, so very few things really fitted them well.</span> <span id="s581">They looked ill, they had a terrible pallor, terrible color.</span> <span id="s582">But what you have to, I think, remember, is that people survive because they are survivors very often.</span> <span id="s583">You know, there’s a s -- there’s a reason, there’s a certain something, X factor, that putting chance to one side, where you stand or where you don’t, people do survive.</span> <span id="s584">Once they’ve -- they’re into the role of survivor, they do begin to get a resilience, and a kind of strength, and so people were fiercely active, fiercely wanting to get out, fiercely wanting to organize in some way, and fiercely angry.</span> <span id="s585">But people, how did they look when I first saw them?</span> <span id="s586">Ill, emaciated, thin hands.</span> <span id="s587">Very thin hands.</span> <span id="s588">They had the hands of old people like you -- you see sometimes in hospitals where th-the whole hand di -- hardly resembles a hand, where the bones stick out, and they used to press their fingers into you very often, in a kind of se -- with a sense of urgency they would hold you.</span> <span id="s589">And you would hold them, if you were sensible, and -- and you would rock, because rocking was very much part of the way they would present.</span> <span id="s590">You would sit on the floor sometimes with people and hold and rock.</span> <span id="s591">And people would hold you, and dig their fingers in while they told you their story.</span> <span id="s592">And I always -- and I’ve said in my writings that they spat out their story like a kind of vomit, it came out in a hissing sound.</span> <span id="s593">It’s just barely audible, you -- you often couldn’t understand what they were saying, but you knew, without understanding just by the -- some words, some snatches of things.</span> <span id="s594">You were never alone with anyone.</span> <span id="s595">There were always people there.</span> <span id="s596">There was always people around, so people would often ch-chime in, and -- and come up with something.</span> <span id="s597">But I -- I was alone with the German woman, and I can’t remember the circumstances, and I’m just hoping -- I don’t think it was at ca -- you see, I spent a lot of time in the camp of Kownitz, but I’m sure it was Belsen because in -- in Kownitz they were mainly Hungarian, and in Belsen I think, for some reason, I was more alone with her.</span> <span id="s598">And she told me about her husband, and it was very pitiful.</span> <span id="s599">But people soon -- soon began to resemble some form of normal kind of appearance.</span> <span id="s600">Their faces would fill out, their stomachs would protrude because I think it’s part of malnutrition.</span> <span id="s601">You don’t suddenly become -- you don’t fill out properly, you fill out chaotically.</span> <span id="s602">And particularly with the younger people.</span> <span id="s603">But I remember some young adolescent boys, and they looked like any young kids from a village, with caps and ill-fitting clothes, and they didn’t look so unusual after some months.</span> <span id="s604">People recovered, and they recovered slowly.</span> <span id="s605">Those that were going to die, died very quickly, I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: On that subject -- on that subject, the day you arrive, I believe -- you know, th-there was -- there was such a sense of desperation still, that a woman took her own life, and her child’s.</span> <span id="s607">Do you recall that?</span> <span id="s608">A: Yes, I do.</span> <span id="s609">The day I arrived in Belsen, we were told that a woman who’d had a -- a child by, I think a Ukrainian guard, had drunk Lysol, and her -- poured the Lysol down the throat of her child, and they both died.</span> <span id="s610">And it -- it was horrific.</span> <span id="s611">And it was -- yes, it’s strange I didn’t remember that at first, that that was so important.</span> <span id="s612">But we all block.</span> <span id="s613">And there was a sense of real horror and upset amongst the workers about this woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: How did it affect the other survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: That I don’t know.</span> <span id="s616">I only know how it affected the workers, and it was -- it felt like a sense of failure, like it does with all carers, who care for people who take their lives.</span> <span id="s617">You feel you have failed them.</span> <span id="s618">So, there’s a kind of so-called reasonably normal response in a totally, totally abnormal situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: In terms of food and medicine and equipment and so on, how well were you equipped to help these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: I think we often lacked supplies.</span> <span id="s621">I remember on one occasion we were waiting for some supplies to come, and eventually a -- a truck arrived at the -- our headquarters.</span> <span id="s622">And it turned out to be a traveling synagogue and didn’t have the supplies that we wanted.</span> <span id="s623">And those of us who were less religiously inclined had quite a lot to say at the time, including myself.</span> <span id="s624">We were furious, and very upset.</span> <span id="s625">Oh, so much for what people feel you need.</span> <span id="s626">It was -- I mean, a lot of supplies were coming in.</span> <span id="s627">ORT was very good.</span> <span id="s628">There were other American organizations bringing in supplies.</span> <span id="s629">And we ourselves did have supplies and we did man the hospital in Belsen, which was run, I think, by one of the nun’s sisters, who was a m -- a nurse.</span> <span id="s630">Henry Lunzer --</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: So this is a -- this is a sister of your boss?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: Yes, yes, yes, and she was running the hospital there.</span> <span id="s633">And I remember her showing us around the hospital, and the hospital was called the Glen Hughes Hospital after Brigadier Glen Hughes who reli -- who liberated Belsen, and who was, I believe, a remarkable man.</span> <span id="s634">What can I say about the hospital?</span> <span id="s635">I think I learned -- I learned so much in those months I was in Germany.</span> <span id="s636">You know, I think what I -- I learned, looking at what was going on in that hospital -- you’ve got to remember that nurses of the 30’s and the 40’s were brought up to believe in everything being absolutely pristine, to be -- you know, to have sheets that are tightly drawn, to have -- you know, to have everything clean, and -- and cared for.</span> <span id="s637">And again, it’s like all the bureaucracies -- I mean, I do understand it, it -- it is -- the idea of chaos is always frightening, but chaos can sometimes be quite healing.</span> <span id="s638">And what I thought was very good, was when I watched people helping their own people.</span> <span id="s639">By that I mean maybe relatives, maybe friends, maybe a child, somebody feeding their -- their relative, or their friend.</span> <span id="s640">And it would be a mess.</span> <span id="s641">The cl -- the cl -- the -- the bed would be in a mess.</span> <span id="s642">Their trembling hands would never quite reach the mouth appropriately and there would be mess all over the bedclothes, and -- but -- but there was a to -- it was noise, and there was bustle, and there was a sense of activity.</span> <span id="s643">And I think that that is far safer for healing than the kind of -- the preparation for -- you na -- this sort of -- you being prepared for death with your white sheet tucked tightly round you, and I’m simplifying something very much, and I must be forgiven for that, because there is a place for order in a hospital scene, and many people do ask for it.</span> <span id="s644">But there are situations in which chaos and care can match, and can bring about solutions.</span> <span id="s645">And when I started, many years later with a group of other mothers, an association for the welfare of children in hospitals, so that mothers could go into hospital with their small children under the age of five, I remembered all the time the lessons that I’d learned in that hospital.</span> <span id="s646">And that is that sometimes it’s better for a bit of chaos if you are looking after your child, and the sense of care and love is there.</span> <span id="s647">And there will be people who will disagree with me about this, and people who will remember everything about Belsen differently than I do, but I was only 20 years old, impressionable, taking everything in and not all of it may be as coherent as the listener would wish.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: Well, you say you were very young, as indeed you were, but in -- how could you, at such a very young age, absorb and make any sense of what you were seeing?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: I think I was all -- you know, I don’t remember approp -- this sounds rather self indulgent, but I don’t remember a proper childhood.</span> <span id="s650">I remember being a very grown-up child.</span> <span id="s651">Not willingly, but somehow forced upon me by circumstances.</span> <span id="s652">I was always very serious, although I enjoyed fun, and I enjoyed fun when I was in Germany with my comrades.</span> <span id="s653">We had lots of fun and laughter, like one does in extreme situations.</span> <span id="s654">But -- I mean, you -- it -- it’s difficult now to -- to be honest, and to say did I absorb all that then, or have I somehow taken it in and absorbed it slowly over the years?</span> <span id="s655">And there may be something in the latter, because every time I look back, I realize of things I learned, and maybe I didn’t realize at the time I was learning about human relationships, about everything, and about hatred, about love, everything was encapsulated in that experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: Given the kind of desperate physical and psychological state of -- of these survivors, how did you begin?</span> <span id="s657">Can you recall how you began trying to reach out to them, and help them?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: I can’t remember trying.</span> <span id="s659">I remember moving into the blocks and talking, and being a ve -- and sort of sitting on the ground.</span> <span id="s660">I mean, don’t misunderstand, as people became stronger, they became angry, and you, being the carer, you being the provider, would often become the target for people’s anger, because you could not provide the answers.</span> <span id="s661">So I think with the creativity that existed amongst some of the survivors, and our own need to feed into that, we were able to support some of the things that were going on.</span> <span id="s662">For example, Yosul, and Dr. Bunko, and somebody called Norbert Fallheim, who later committed suicide, formed a committee within the camp.</span> <span id="s663">They were representatives of the camp.</span> <span id="s664">We were the next sort of go-between between ourselves, between them, and UNRRA, and the military government.</span> <span id="s665">So we would naturally, whilst we were supporting what they were doing, at the same time we would become the recipients of much of their anger.</span> <span id="s666">And I can remember sitting in an old Merck car that had been commandeered from somewhere by somebody, sort of closely packed in at the back with Norbert, and Yosul, and somebody else, and myself desperately trying to take notes with Henry and somebody else in the front, while they were raging and ranting and very angry indeed.</span> <span id="s667">About -- but you see, curiously enough, I think it was a relief because it was human, and it was life.</span> <span id="s668">And it was such a relief from the desperate, dejected, huddled figures.</span> <span id="s669">You know, sometimes when I used to go -- when I first started to go into the rooms, people didn’t look like human beings, they -- th-they were all kind of like a huddle of clothes sitting there.</span> <span id="s670">It was quite horrible, because it was dim, and y -- and you couldn’t always identify nu -- it -- and here were people shouting about what they wanted, and being very angry, with us, with them, with everybody.</span> <span id="s671">And in a way, although I felt very vulnerable sometimes, at being shouted at, I also was a go-between in my familiar familial pattern, between them and my own hierarchy, between them and Henry.</span> <span id="s672">And so they would come to me, either in Eilshausen, and they would ask me to negotiate, and they would complain about Henry, and then they would complain to Henry about UNRRA, and then all the rest of it and so on.</span> <span id="s673">Because of course, what they wanted more than anything else was freedom, and they hadn’t got it.</span> <span id="s674">I mean, I’m making it sound as if I understood it all, and I don’t think I did.</span> <span id="s675">I think it’s only with hindsight that I can talk about anger as being something very positive.</span> <span id="s676">But it’s something that makes you feel alive, whereas when I used to see the people huddled, and I thought to myself, I wonder if they’re going to die, th -- I’d -- I -- I think I just felt that I could do more in that situation of vigor and anger, and -- and vision, because they had a vision of what they wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: Which was?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: Well, they wanted out.</span> <span id="s679">They wanted out of the camp.</span> <span id="s680">Some people wanted -- you know, this is a difficulty now, this is a big difficulty, because people talk about the formation of an organization that was -- whose aim was Palestine.</span> <span id="s681">Now, my recollection is that there were many people who wanted to go, for one reason or another, either to America or to England.</span> <span id="s682">And obviously they couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: When you say obviously, can you explain that for us?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: Well, it’s very little different than it is now, really.</span> <span id="s685">I don’t think you could get into England unless you were sponsored by a relative or friend, and sponsored quite energetically.</span> <span id="s686">You had to be able to provide for that person completely and absolutely.</span> <span id="s687">And one or two people did go from Kownitz.</span> <span id="s688">So I don’t remember anybody going from -- from Belsen.</span> <span id="s689">And others wanted to go to America, and I’m sure some did.</span> <span id="s690">And some people did come to -- to England.</span> <span id="s691">But there were many -- the majority didn’t and couldn’t.</span> <span id="s692">And I think it was only with the realization that nobody really wanted them again -- yet again.</span> <span id="s693">That no -- that the doors were not opening generously to -- and -- and -- and with -- what’s the word I want?</span> <span id="s694">Like, with countries joining together in order to provide a solution for this group of people, who remained there, some of them, until 1950.</span> <span id="s695">Which is a very long time from 1945.</span> <span id="s696">So it’s not surprising that people became more militant and more determined that Palestine was the only solution for the Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: Again, let me take you back a little bit, because I think a lot of us don’t know quite as much and -- and we need filling in.</span> <span id="s698">I’m very interested to know what a typical day was, or a typical week in your life out there, or in the life of the team.</span> <span id="s699">What you did in the office, what you did with the people, you know, in a fairly basic kind of way.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: I mean, I was very involved with Henry in trying to negotiate for better facilities within the camps.</span> <span id="s701">And withi -- and within groups where Jewish people had -- had -- had come and were in need of provision, and -- and -- and support.</span> <span id="s702">And so we would be writing and Henry would be meeting -- I might accompany him with others, to try to negotiate, either with UNRRA or with the British government for better facilities here, and better facilities there.</span> <span id="s703">I would write endless letters, and I would be -- spend a huge amount of time screaming down the telephone because the telephones did exist, but it was almost impossible to hear anyone, and you would spend hours trying to get somebody, and it made such a difference because otherwise you just had to get in a truck and go.</span> <span id="s704">So I would do normal secretarial work in support for Henry.</span> <span id="s705">I would accompany him, particularly where Yosul and Norbert was concerned -- were concerned.</span> <span id="s706">But I spent a lot of time -- and this again is something I’d -- I can’t put -- I can’t be too correct about, because I simply can’t remember.</span> <span id="s707">I went to Kownitz camp -- what happened at Kownitz was that -- and I can’t even tell you exactly where it is --</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: This was a camp for women, was it?</span> <span id="s709">A: There were mainly women, there were some men, but there were li -- a large number of Hungarians -- Hungarian woman, but there were some young men.</span> <span id="s710">And we got a telegram to the unit, which -- which I -- it came to me, saying that -- that they were desperate, that they had no provisions, no means of support, that -- that there was this camp, and there was nothing and they were desperate.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: How many people were there, do you recollect?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: A lot.</span> <span id="s713">I don’t remember the number, and I can’t tell you the number.</span> <span id="s714">It was quite -- it must have been about 600 - 700 people, I think.</span> <span id="s715">And I went there, but I don’t remember with whom.</span> <span id="s716">I went there with somebody and we had a meeting in a room, up some stairs, wooden stairs with -- there were only candles, it was very cold then, very cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: Which winter was this?</span> <span id="s718">A: The first.</span> <span id="s719">I just wish one could remember more, who was with me.</span> <span id="s720">And I went back with whoever, and negotiated for provisions, for supplies, for acknowledgement that this camp existed and needed, you know, the support of UNRRA and other facilities, as well as our own.</span> <span id="s721">But then they got -- was a -- was a situation in which I would go very frequently to the camp, and that doesn’t seem to be acknowledged by anybody now who can remember.</span> <span id="s722">Neither Henry, nor Allison Ward, with -- who was our personnel officer, and who is still alive.</span> <span id="s723">Both are still alive.</span> <span id="s724">Neither have a clear recollection of Kownitz.</span> <span id="s725">Allison said yes, she remembers that I used to go off frequently with this former Hungarian Jewish Brigade leader, and that we would work there.</span> <span id="s726">But I can’t tell you how it was, whether I elected to g -- I know I must have elected to go because I was there so often.</span> <span id="s727">I was there for their first Pesach, which we had in the open.</span> <span id="s728">And I remember we arrived late, and they were quite fed up with us for being late, and they had to carry me across all the tables, and there was enormous hilarity about that, as I was carried aloft across tables.</span> <span id="s729">And I got to know them very well.</span> <span id="s730">But they needed a lot of support, they were young women, who were very beautiful many of them, who were very si -- very vulnerable.</span> <span id="s731">Who the person I was working with was very anxious to protect from the sexual advances of any soldiers.</span> <span id="s732">And I remember a very moving discussion in which he spoke, and said -- and I was so touched that in the middle of Germany, in the middle of all this mess, a camp that was mud, you were up to your ankles in mud at the time -- or later, because it was snowing then, but he -- he spoke to the women and told them, you must preserve yourself.</span> <span id="s733">You’ve been preserved for a reason.</span> <span id="s734">I can remember it to this day.</span> <span id="s735">You’ve been preserved for a reason.</span> <span id="s736">Don’t destroy yourselves, don’t capitulate to men who find you beautiful and who want to give you chocolate, and who want to try to help you, and maybe not help you.</span> <span id="s737">He was really telling them, you have a sexuality which you’re only just realizing because in the camp your hair was cut, you didn’t have your periods, you now do -- but he didn’t say this in so many words.</span> <span id="s738">But he gave this very moving talk to them.</span> <span id="s739">I was so touched by this, and thought it was so wonderful that -- that we should be talking there, preserve yourselves somehow as a woman, and as women.</span> <span id="s740">And it’s important.</span> <span id="s741">And then we danced, I remember we did lots of dancing.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: What kind of dancing was that?</span> <span id="s743">A: Oh, anything, we just danced.</span> <span id="s744">We danced the hora a lot, and -- hora, and then we -- there were people who knew various variations that I’d never seen before, that were fascinating.</span> <span id="s745">And lots of songs and wonderful, it was wonderful the way -- it was full of life.</span> <span id="s746">I met two of the woman later, here.</span> <span id="s747">And they’d managed somehow.</span> <span id="s748">But i-it’s -- I-I don’t know what we were trying to do there, we were trying and -- i-i-it was such a unsupported group of people, and it was so primitive.</span> <span id="s749">I think it was a very primitive camp.</span> <span id="s750">Somebody once described it as a very good one.</span> <span id="s751">I thought it was very primitive.</span> <span id="s752">I remember there was a sort of wooden toilet, you know, one of these open jobs, and sort of just by the side of the camp, and you know, you had to have people on guard when you went in there, because there’s no way you could fasten the door, and it was -- it -- that place was cold and primitive.</span> <span id="s753">We got supplies in, we got learning material in.</span> <span id="s754">We did something.</span> <span id="s755">We did our best.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: This is tape number three, side A, of an interview with Helen Bamber.</span> <span id="s758">Now, the survivors who you dealt with were now officially displaced persons.</span> <span id="s759">What did that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: Well, first of all it meant that as far as the officials were concerned, the word survivor or victim had gone out of their vocabulary, and the word displaced persons, which is a sort of anonymous terms for a glob of people, is quite a useful shield, just as we use the word asylum seekers today, so the word displaced persons, and then DPs, even worse, was used.</span> <span id="s761">So the compassion that was there at the very beginning, and the sense of outrage when the camp was liberated, had gone, in my view.</span> <span id="s762">And the DPs, displaced persons were seen as a problem, number one.</span> <span id="s763">So, in emotional terms, in political terms, in psychological terms, displaced persons meant a nuisance, a -- a problem.</span> <span id="s764">They were vocal, they’d become articulate, they had their committee, they were demanding, they wanted rights.</span> <span id="s765">What wa -- what rights did they want?</span> <span id="s766">They wanted rights within the camp, as far as I remember.</span> <span id="s767">They wanted rights of travel.</span> <span id="s768">They wanted to be able to move about Germany.</span> <span id="s769">And that was very difficult because as far as I remember, and this -- this can be corrected by others, the people in the camps were not allowed to leave or to travel without special permit.</span> <span id="s770">Now, in the early days, many of the young displaced persons went particularly, as I remember, to Poland, mainly to try to find their relatives.</span> <span id="s771">They went to their old, former homes to find their relatives.</span> <span id="s772">When they got there, they were set upon by the local people, who drove them out, and some killings took place, and some assaults took place.</span> <span id="s773">And the people, bedraggled, and often with torn shoes and bleeding feet, would return back into Germany, and back, as it were, behind barbed wire, behind the camp.</span> <span id="s774">I use barbed wire as a -- as a -- to cover what I mean by that kind of incarceration.</span> <span id="s775">So their options were very limited.</span> <span id="s776">If they wanted to find their relatives -- and this was at the beginning, for the first year or so was the most important as I remember it, was the finding of relatives.</span> <span id="s777">Now we had set up a search bureau in Belsen.</span> <span id="s778">And that was one of the things that one of the volunteers in our unit had trained at doing was to set up a search bureau.</span> <span id="s779">People who would come to the camp, again presumably illegally because they would come and there was no way in which they should have been able to enter or to leave, with little bits of like cigarette paper, rolled up paper.</span> <span id="s780">It was probably cigarette paper, with the names of relatives on it, asking has anybody seen or heard of so and so?</span> <span id="s781">And the names would be on these little bits of paper.</span> <span id="s782">And they would give them to you, or they would give them to anybody.</span> <span id="s783">They would just hand them out, and you would -- you would do your best.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: How did the search bureau work?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: I’m not well acquainted with the search bureau.</span> <span id="s786">The search bureau presumably tried to marry people through the camp, or through other means, relatives of the named person, so -- on the piece of paper.</span> <span id="s787">So, it did it’s job.</span> <span id="s788">Whether it did it adequately, I can’t say.</span> <span id="s789">It was primitive.</span> <span id="s790">But in some cases people were reunited.</span> <span id="s791">There were other search bureaus that were established as time went on.</span> <span id="s792">I’m not quite sure if the Red Cross was not involved also in trying to reunite people.</span> <span id="s793">That also can be confirmed.</span> <span id="s794">I have -- you -- you know, I have a very fragmented, compartmentalized memory of this particular period of my life.</span> <span id="s795">So I can’t really speak with authority about the organization of the search bureaus.</span> <span id="s796">I know that there were several, I know that we had one in the camp.</span> <span id="s797">And I know that people came searching for their relatives, handing bits of paper to each other in order to see whether somebody remembered somebody.</span> <span id="s798">It was pathetic, and very sad.</span> <span id="s799">Full of pathos, very sad to watch.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: You’d been -- you’d been speaking earlier about the options available to people now -- once they were DPs, if you like.</span> <span id="s801">Can you tell us a little more about the options they were seeking?</span> <span id="s802">You said that some of them wanted to go home, for example, to Poland, and what became of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: But what about those who -- who had their eyes set on other countries?</span> <span id="s805">A: I think my memory is of people wanting to come, many of them, to England or to America.</span> <span id="s806">There was no means by which they really could simply ask to come.</span> <span id="s807">I’m not sure if the American quota system was operating in the way that it normally does.</span> <span id="s808">In other words, so many from -- you know, that you’re on the German quota list, or the Romanian, Hungarian, or Polish.</span> <span id="s809">But what I do know was that it wasn’t possible simply to enter the US, or the UK, not really.</span> <span id="s810">Some people did, and they’re very proud of it, and they say it as though anybody could have done it, but they must forgive me, I don’t believe it was so easy for everybody to do it, otherwise they would have done it.</span> <span id="s811">I-It’s -- it was hard for people, they couldn’t get out, and they couldn’t go anywhere.</span> <span id="s812">They couldn’t go -- the Iron Curtain had already fallen, they couldn’t go to the Iron Curtain countries.</span> <span id="s813">They knew that they would be badly treated if they did.</span> <span id="s814">They knew what was going on by returnees.</span> <span id="s815">And so what were their options?</span> <span id="s816">To find their relatives, to -- but then, as the months passed people realized that nothing had happened.</span> <span id="s817">Perhaps they had found a relative, perhaps they’d accepted that that was it, that nobody was alive.</span> <span id="s818">Or they lived in hopes, but they still wanted to get out.</span> <span id="s819">Outside the camps, of course, the Germans were beginning to mingle, to fraternize with British, American and other soldiers in the various zones.</span> <span id="s820">And this came very hard to the inmates, the fact that they were still displaced persons while something else was going on outside.</span> <span id="s821">I believe then that a hardening of attitudes took place, a realization for many that they were not wanted.</span> <span id="s822">That was the feeling, that nobody really wanted to open their doors.</span> <span id="s823">I mean, many people returned to Holland, some maybe to France.</span> <span id="s824">But on the whole, people remained, and they didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s825">So, I think that is when -- and again I must be forgiven by tha -- by those people who see it differently, but I begin that i -- I believe that it was then that the idea of becoming more Zionist, wanting to go to Palestine is the only solution for their problem.</span> <span id="s826">And I believe it was then that it really became an entrenched desire and need, and mission.</span> <span id="s827">So people began to learn Hebrew if they didn’t already know it.</span> <span id="s828">They became more militant.</span> <span id="s829">There were the illegal transportations to -- to cross frontiers to try to get illegally to Palestine one way or another.</span> <span id="s830">And of course, many people perished on the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: What did you know at the time about these illegal journeys?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: What did I know?</span> <span id="s833">Well, everybody knew that it was happening.</span> <span id="s834">It was no secret.</span> <span id="s835">An organization grew, an organization of -- I’m not giving it a name, I don’t know it -- whether there ever was a name, but you know, with all these situations of -- of despair and need, a militancy grows, an urgency grows.</span> <span id="s836">People are not going to stay in that situation forever.</span> <span id="s837">And historically this has always happened.</span> <span id="s838">It’s happening now with the Kurds, and it’s happened elsewhere.</span> <span id="s839">People want something for themselves, and they want freedom and safety.</span> <span id="s840">And people will, if they’re not allowed to negotiate for it, they will try to take it.</span> <span id="s841">And so people began to go illegally, and cross frontiers illegally.</span> <span id="s842">And transports from the camps were organized.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: From yours as well, among the people you knew?</span> <span id="s844">That’s to say, inmates held at Belsen also.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: And Kownitz, yes.</span> <span id="s846">Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: So how would you find out about this?</span> <span id="s848">Would you turn up one day and there’d be fewer people?</span> <span id="s849">Or did it work other ways?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: I know -- I know relatively little about the transports.</span> <span id="s851">They were small.</span> <span id="s852">People didn’t go in large numbers, to my knowledge.</span> <span id="s853">I remember one particular incident, let me concentrate on that.</span> <span id="s854">We were told at the -- our headquarters that -- or we found out somehow, that there were a group of I suppose about 15 to 20 people being held in a British army post.</span> <span id="s855">And I can’t tell you where it was, but it was a group of DPs who had been found crossing the Dutch frontier illegally and they were now being held, and had been held for many months in this camp.</span> <span id="s856">And in this camp, when we eventually got there, we found that the camp was also a holding place for infamous war criminals and Germans who had -- who -- with a -- with a poor reputation.</span> <span id="s857">So I went with the leader of the Jewish brigade, who drove one lorry, and I think, too, we had another lorry with -- or truck, large truck, which would house another group, and a small, kind of mobile ambulance which was intended for the pregnant woman who was quite near term.</span> <span id="s858">So I think we probably had a nurse with us.</span> <span id="s859">I can’t remember that, but I would imagine so, otherwise it would not be necessary or prudent to just have the ambulance.</span> <span id="s860">So I think we must have had a nurse with us.</span> <span id="s861">So there were several of us, and when we got to the camp, the lorries stood in the comp -- in the main kind of open area, bef -- we -- we came into an open space.</span> <span id="s862">On the left of us was this open camp site with barbed wire, in which the Germans were standing or pacing.</span> <span id="s863">And there was one woman, whose name I think has been given as Irma Grace, but I’m not sure if it was she, and I will check that for the record, but it was definitely a woman of -- who was well-known for her crimes.</span> <span id="s864">And -- and when the lorries stopped, and we were to get out and go and negotiate with the British post, the inmates, the German inmates started to chant.</span> <span id="s865">They realized that we had come for, in inverted commas, the Jews.</span> <span id="s866">And they began to chant, and it wasn’t a very friendly chant.</span> <span id="s867">Something similar to do -- Jews, Jews, out with the Jews, but nasty stuff.</span> <span id="s868">I can’t remember the exact words, but it was very ominous, and the whole scene was very ominous.</span> <span id="s869">And as we began to -- as we negotiated, and we received the people, and they were walking towards the truck, and we were loading them onto the trucks, the chanting got louder, and louder, and louder.</span> <span id="s870">And my colleague said, “Start them singing, get them singing.”</span> <span id="s871">And so they started to sing.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: The -- the Jews who you --</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: -- had come to collect.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: Mm.</span> <span id="s876">And so, rather reminiscent of that film with Ingrid Bergman and -- you know, that famous “Casablanca” thing, but not dissimilar may I tell you, because the singing got louder and louder, and the chanting got louder, and it was extremely unpleasant.</span> <span id="s877">And I’ve never -- that scene, I -- I will never forget, because of it’s ominous nature, it’s pure, unadulterated hatred that was present, and the kind of slightly banal, rather semi-amused laid back attitude of the British soldiers from whom we were collecting the former inmates.</span> <span id="s878">And they were from Kownitz, I think.</span> <span id="s879">And we took them in the trucks, and the proud, pregnant lady haughtily rejected the ambulance, and was most affronted.</span> <span id="s880">So the ambulance, it trailed behind, and we had our two trucks and we took them back.</span> <span id="s881">And it -- th-there was some exuberance I remember, some -- some sense of release, relief.</span> <span id="s882">And there was a lot of singing, but people were tired, and exhausted, and it was a long drive, I remember.</span> <span id="s883">And I remember that there was a boy, young boy, and we held out our arms to help the people out of the -- out of the lorry, and he refused that, and he jumped down.</span> <span id="s884">And I -- I talked to him for a little while.</span> <span id="s885">And when we got back into the truck -- because people needed to relieve themselves, I think we had food as well, we got back into the truck, this young boy, as we dropped him off in -- in the compound in Kownitz said to me, “You will remember me.</span> <span id="s886">Remember me.”</span> <span id="s887">And I said, “Yes, I’ll remember you.”</span> <span id="s888">And I stayed in Kownitz, I -- I don’t know where or how, I can’t remember where I slept.</span> <span id="s889">And I asked, I think, several days later where the group was, and I was told that they’d gone off again, and that this time they had crossed the frontier and they had got away.</span> <span id="s890">So not, I think, the pregnant lady.</span> <span id="s891">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s892">Well, it may have been, but whatever, they had gone.</span> <span id="s893">So yes, there were transports, and they behaved as all people do in these situations, with incredible determination and much courage.</span> <span id="s894">Many died.</span> <span id="s895">Some were shot crossing the frontiers as well.</span> <span id="s896">But more than that, I don’t -- I can’t say.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: Just pause it there for a second.</span> <span id="s898">I wanted to talk a little bit now about how the camp at Belsen functioned, how it was organized and -- and what people did all day whe -- when you first arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: You know, I’m not quite -- to be honest, I’m not quite clear about what people did all day as far as the inmates were concerned.</span> <span id="s900">I think -- it wasn’t a camp that I worked in day in and day out.</span> <span id="s901">My impression is that they did very little at the beginning because they were so vulnerable, so debilitated, it would be difficult to imagine an actual activity.</span> <span id="s902">I believe that the more orthodox gathered and prayed, and went about their devotions.</span> <span id="s903">And I’m sure there was some activity, but there was very little structure to the camp as I remember it.</span> <span id="s904">It was the emergence of Yosul Rosenzoft and Norbert Fallheim, and the establishment of a committee many months later.</span> <span id="s905">And also with the presence of ORT providing workshops.</span> <span id="s906">And I do have, and I w-will have to donate it at some time, a small pot, a small vase from some metal that was found somewhere, which someone gave me, which is one of the f -- one the early products of the er -- ORT workshop.</span> <span id="s907">So people began to occupy themselves.</span> <span id="s908">They began to form into their political and religious groupings.</span> <span id="s909">The theater was established and became one of the liveliest and the most exciting exponents of resilience and life in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: Tell me about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: Well, the theater would start with, nearly always as far as I remember, with a very raw just sort of exposure on the stage of the destruction of a family.</span> <span id="s912">The scene would start with the mother, father and children sitting round a table, very familiar table.</span> <span id="s913">And you can see that they were joyful, that they were engaged with each other, arguing, discussing, etcetera.</span> <span id="s914">And then you heard the marching toward the door that would open on the family in which the Germans would come.</span> <span id="s915">And you saw the family being beaten, being taken, you hear the screams, you see the mother being dragged away.</span> <span id="s916">The whole scene of a family being broken up in front of you was played time and time and time again.</span> <span id="s917">And it would be received in absolute silence.</span> <span id="s918">It was the homage to the family, to the destroyed family.</span> <span id="s919">Whether it was a form of mourning, I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s920">It could -- it could have been.</span> <span id="s921">It was -- or was it more a kind of expression of outrage, letting the world know this is what happened to my family.</span> <span id="s922">I think it was more that than mourning, because it’s my view that many Holocaust survivors have never found the way to mourn such grotesque happenings as those that they witnessed and were part of.</span> <span id="s923">So I think it’s probably to do with -- to do with exposure of what happened, and wanting the world and everybody to see it.</span> <span id="s924">And as the military government and -- and officials from UNRRA were often invited to th -- these concerts.</span> <span id="s925">Not always, but -- but -- but especially so on some occasions, it’s not surprising that they would want to say this.</span> <span id="s926">This is, or was my family, and this is how it was for me.</span> <span id="s927">It was incredibly intimate, and terrible to watch.</span> <span id="s928">And there was never any applause, there was only silence.</span> <span id="s929">But then there would be other things taking part.</span> <span id="s930">I don’t remember all of it, but I remember that very often there would be a kind of cabaret element to it, in which there would be songs in Yiddish, or Polish, or whatever, really making fun of, and poking the finger at the establishment of the British rule, the British command and the British zone, the attitude to the camp.</span> <span id="s931">There would be -- and it would be received with roars of laughter and applause, and at the end of which, of course, everybody stood up and applauded, including the front row of officials from the army, who’d hadn’t understood a word of this cabaret.</span> <span id="s932">And I think the cabaret was done very much in the old-fashioned kind of really sort of German style cabaret.</span> <span id="s933">You know, it was ironic, it was -- it was -- it’s meaning was very, very clear, and I believe it was very, very clever.</span> <span id="s934">I didn’t always understand it all.</span> <span id="s935">And so the theater was very important, the hospital was important, the workshops, the committees.</span> <span id="s936">The constant badgering for different individuals to move or do something, to go somewhere within Germany for whatever reason.</span> <span id="s937">Other than that, I cannot really -- I cannot really remember other activities.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: How about the -- the newspaper, wasn’t there a newspaper?</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: Oh yes, there was a newspaper, of course there was a newspaper.</span> <span id="s940">Yes, there was a newspaper produced with again, factual and ironic comments about the life of the DP, and the life of Belsen.</span> <span id="s941">And -- and so on.</span> <span id="s942">No, th -- th -- there’s a newspaper, I wish -- I wonder if there’s ever any of this left.</span> <span id="s943">I’ve never seen anything.</span> <span id="s944">So much was of the moment, and you don’t think in terms of history, which one should.</span> <span id="s945">Anyway, that’s how it was, as far as I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: So it went from being a rather desolate, to maybe quite a spirited place.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: Yes, it was.</span> <span id="s948">It had its spirit, it had its resilience, it had its sense of life.</span> <span id="s949">And I think that there was a group of younger people there who were going to survive at all costs.</span> <span id="s950">Somehow survival and strength meant a great deal to them, and I think that they very often turned towards the idea of Palestine as their solution.</span> <span id="s951">Whether the Palestine or the Israel that we see now would have been different, I believe it might, but others don’t agree with me.</span> <span id="s952">Had Britain and America taken people more readily and quickly, and quickly solved this question of people remaining within the camp that once abused them -- I mean, there’s nothing much worse than that, really.</span> <span id="s953">Pretty awful stuff.</span> <span id="s954">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s955">It may be a very simplistic way of looking at a very complex problem.</span> <span id="s956">But the sense of not being wanted, and the sense of not being a victim again, was prevalent.</span> <span id="s957">And I have seen it elsewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: This is tape number three, side B of an interview with Helen Bamber.</span> <span id="s960">To what extent do you think the work that you did, and the work that your colleagues did contributed to this resurgence of the human spirit, if you’d like, in the camp?</span> <span id="s961">The one that you’ve just described.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: I find it difficult to make claims, I always do.</span> <span id="s963">I think that we were part of it.</span> <span id="s964">We were part of the res -- I don’t want to use the word resurrection, but the -- part of the -- we saw ac -- something of the restoration of the human spirit.</span> <span id="s965">We -- we vis -- we actually saw amongst the people, something of the spirit.</span> <span id="s966">Okay, they were angry, and they shouted, but they also laughed and performed, and -- and -- and were quite remarkable in many ways.</span> <span id="s967">I’m not taking responsibility for it.</span> <span id="s968">I believe we played a small part in it, and I believe that we offered support and resources, and that probably, as is so often the case, we were responsible more for particular individuals being helped than we were for the kind of global picture, if you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s969">I mean, I can think of individuals, and I think of the German woman I spoke to, and who I had quite a lot to do with, and I think that without making too many claims, our relationship was helpful.</span> <span id="s970">The fact that she could speak to me about her husband, about her losses, and the fact that -- no, I just feel somehow I can think of individuals that were helped by my colleagues, and on occasion by myself, but I don’t want to make too many claims about what we achieved.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: All right, well to get away from the claims, let me ask you about this.</span> <span id="s972">Beginning, let’s say with a good --</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: I think the hospital was important.</span> <span id="s974">I think -- I -- I had less to do with the hospital, but I think the hospital was valuable, and did a great deal for the individuals.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Tell me in what way.</span> <span id="s976">I mean, you’ve spoken about one aspect of the hospital, the fact that it was open to friends and relatives and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: Mm, mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: But it -- when you say it was particularly important, in what way do you mean that?</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: Well, it was -- i-it was a place for recovery.</span> <span id="s980">And it was of Jewish [indecipherable] and it wasn’t a German hospital.</span> <span id="s981">It wasn’t a British hospital ostensibly, it was somehow manned by Jewish people helping Jewish people.</span> <span id="s982">And I think that was very important because you are very vulnerable when you are helpless.</span> <span id="s983">And they had been helpless many, many times, helpless victims at the mercy of others cruelty and lack of care, and lack of anything.</span> <span id="s984">And I think whatever else we did or didn’t do, we did operate it well.</span> <span id="s985">I believe that.</span> <span id="s986">So I think that was a plus.</span> <span id="s987">And I -- I can think of many individuals who were helped along by something.</span> <span id="s988">But if you ask me were we responsible for all that renewal of -- of spirit and -- and so on, I don’t think we were responsible.</span> <span id="s989">I think it came from the resilience of survivors.</span> <span id="s990">Had we not been there it might have been more difficult, let me put it that way.</span> <span id="s991">That might be the fairest way to put it.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: Can you describe in -- in greater detail how your relationship with people developed, how when you arrived on this very desolate scene, how you made contact with people, how they reacted to you, and how, if at all, you -- you managed to establish some kind of dialog with them, and -- and draw them out.</span> <span id="s993">Tell me how that process happened there in Belsen, as opposed to since.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: I think in the early days -- I mean, this sounds very, again, rather trite, I think, and simplistic, but what I found was very important was to say very little, but to take somebody’s hand.</span> <span id="s995">I -- I found that very important, and I sometimes find it important in my present day work.</span> <span id="s996">When there’s nothing to say and the situation is so terrible, all you can do is to take somebody’s hand and stroke it and hold it and try to indicate through your touch that there is a communication.</span> <span id="s997">So you don’t begin with words, you begin with touch, and that’s all.</span> <span id="s998">And sometimes I would just walk away.</span> <span id="s999">And they might call me back or I might just walk away and come another day.</span> <span id="s1000">But it would be -- I -- I found that was helpful in the very early days, because people were so exhausted, that to take somebody’s hand and to hold it was a way of you -- you, as a person, trying to give strength, as it were, to the other person.</span> <span id="s1001">So that was all I could do sometimes.</span> <span id="s1002">Words came later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: And what happens when -- what happened when the words came, and what happened when you didn’t have a language in common with the people you were nonetheless communicating with?</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: Sometimes people would simply come out with a whole story in explosions.</span> <span id="s1005">I’ve -- I’ve said before like spitting up, like kind of vomiting something.</span> <span id="s1006">So that it would come out stacat -- come out in -- in -- in -- in -- not clearly, not in a coherent way.</span> <span id="s1007">And I would sometimes say either in German -- and I would always apologize for speaking German, and I would try to bring in Yiddish words that I’d learned, as much as I could, if I couldn’t understand somebody, because there would be other people there, and often people would sort of want to come to help you to understand the story.</span> <span id="s1008">So that again is a form of communication.</span> <span id="s1009">The fact that you don’t understand puts you in a less powerful position, therefore they have the power to inform you.</span> <span id="s1010">Without them, I can’t understand that person.</span> <span id="s1011">So that’s always a very useful way of looking at things, to accept your powerlessness, and let them have the power to inform you.</span> <span id="s1012">And I would ask for help from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: You’ve said, I believe, that sometimes you were -- they were angry with you, they didn’t want your sympathy, they wanted simply somebody to work out their anger on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: Yes, well then, I mean, this is something you get in all -- with most survivors and something that you get y -- I -- I have to get used to in my present day work.</span> <span id="s1015">People are angry because they are helpless and frightened and -- and they can’t see a way out.</span> <span id="s1016">And you just have to let them shout and be angry.</span> <span id="s1017">There’s nothing else you can do.</span> <span id="s1018">You don’t walk away from it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: Did you have at the time any sense that you were achieving something?</span> <span id="s1020">I mean, when you went back to the requisitioned house at the end of the day, after a visit to Belsen, what did you do?</span> <span id="s1021">Did you get blind drunk, did you hide under the sheets?</span> <span id="s1022">What -- what did you do?</span> <span id="s1023">How on earth did you live with this stuff day after day, and what sense did you have, had it been worthwhile, the day you just spent?</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: I never talked to anyone about it, and I think that was one of the failures in the organization.</span> <span id="s1025">It was born of it’s time when organizations were not encouraged to speak about feelings, or things that they couldn’t achieve.</span> <span id="s1026">So that organizations -- and indeed they do it today, and the more difficult the outside circumstances, the more institutions call upon the solutions for the institutions rather than for the people they’re there to help.</span> <span id="s1027">So we would look at, if we met in the evening, we would talk about the difficulties of transport, or the difficulties of a car being stolen, or an accident.</span> <span id="s1028">But we wouldn’t talk about how I felt, or anybody else felt.</span> <span id="s1029">So there wasn’t much of that.</span> <span id="s1030">What there was however, was a kind of group -- we would do all sorts of things in that house, that requisitioned house.</span> <span id="s1031">We would sing, we would read poetry, we would read aloud to each other.</span> <span id="s1032">We would put on various -- we had one boy who was an extremely good mimic, and Richard Talbor was a very popular tenor of the day, but dear Richard Talbor had a way of performing on the stage which was quite unique, and a little bit what can I say?</span> <span id="s1033">Little bit arrogant and pompous.</span> <span id="s1034">And he was wonderful at depicting Richard Talbor.</span> <span id="s1035">And so he would sing and perform and we would all act out something.</span> <span id="s1036">Or we would dance.</span> <span id="s1037">Now we would dance, we would have ballroom dancing, we were very good at this.</span> <span id="s1038">We’d put on something or other.</span> <span id="s1039">We had some very sentimental Italian songs, you know -- you know, I can’t even remember them now, but they were very sentimental, and we would all swoon, we would listen to music.</span> <span id="s1040">So we -- we pu -- we had our own activities and we used each other very well I think, in the evenings, but we didn’t talk about our feelings.</span> <span id="s1041">So my main relief would be laughing at somebody taking off Richard Talbor or somebody else for that matter.</span> <span id="s1042">And we’d have all those sort of activities, which was fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: Privately, did you despair of what you were seeing day after day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: No, I didn’t despair at the time.</span> <span id="s1045">When I came back to Britain, when I came back to London, I went through a very difficult phase, one that I haven’t experienced since.</span> <span id="s1046">I -- I can’t explain what it was, it was an inability to work with what I’d seen.</span> <span id="s1047">I was absolutely terrified of a recurrence of that kind of happening, I was terrified of it.</span> <span id="s1048">And I was sure that it was going to happen again.</span> <span id="s1049">And I don’t know why I felt that, but I felt afraid.</span> <span id="s1050">And I used to go to the cinema and sit and watch film after film after film.</span> <span id="s1051">And I had traditional, classical panic attacks, when I would feel overwhelmed with fear.</span> <span id="s1052">So a lot of -- of the experience emerged much later, when I was -- when I had come home.</span> <span id="s1053">And it was partly fostered by the lack of interest by anybody around me in understanding or listening to what I had to say.</span> <span id="s1054">That was very difficult for me.</span> <span id="s1055">I’d learned a lot of negotiating skills in Germany, and in my family, but I hadn’t learned how to deal, and I still find it hard to deal with a bystander, to deal with people who know and don’t know, who don’t want to hear, and who didn’t want to hear.</span> <span id="s1056">And I couldn’t bear it.</span> <span id="s1057">I came back to a country that was preoccupied with rationing, and which piece of meat they were going to get that week, and any effort I made on my part to communicate what I’d seen, even when I was asked to give official talks about it -- I remember going to the east end and talking in a theater there to people.</span> <span id="s1058">I was actually asking for money, and that may have had something to do with it, but money for the relief -- the Jewish Relief Unit.</span> <span id="s1059">I still do that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s1060">And I had to ask for money and say what was going on, and I -- I mean, I met with cold, angry stares as much as to say, don’t you think we’ve suffered enough, we’ve heard enough?</span> <span id="s1061">But I think it’s partly guilt.</span> <span id="s1062">I know now that it’s guilt.</span> <span id="s1063">And so that before you start, you have to try to reduce that sense of guilt with people that they couldn’t and didn’t want to do anything or know anything at the time.</span> <span id="s1064">And they certainly didn’t then.</span> <span id="s1065">And I found that the hardest thing of all.</span> <span id="s1066">So I despaired when I came back.</span> <span id="s1067">I despaired when I came back, and I was really very low, the lowest I’ve ever been in my life, I think.</span> <span id="s1068">Well, almost.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: What was it that made you decide to come back and made you decide to come back at a particular time?</span> <span id="s1070">Maybe you could remind us of the date as well.</span> <span id="s1071">What -- what was that one single thing or that -- were you just completely overloaded with what you’d seen and done?</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: No, I’d been ill, I’d been in hospital.</span> <span id="s1073">I’d been involved in an accident which I’d had what they thought was concussion, I was quite unwell.</span> <span id="s1074">And I came back on leave and it was decided for me, I didn’t decide.</span> <span id="s1075">I had wanted to go back.</span> <span id="s1076">In fact, I was dying to go back, I couldn’t wait to go back.</span> <span id="s1077">And I think that partly my despair i-in this -- in coming back, was due to the fact that I couldn’t go back there, and that I felt more at home there than I did here.</span> <span id="s1078">And I felt more at ease there, and with myself.</span> <span id="s1079">And that was very hard for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: Why did you feel more at ease?</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: I felt more at ease because I knew where I was, and who I was, and what I was doing, and what I was doing it for.</span> <span id="s1082">And even if we were failing, or not doing a fantastic job, at least we were trying to do something.</span> <span id="s1083">Whereas I came back to nothingness, to people who didn’t want to know about it.</span> <span id="s1084">And that was -- that was awful.</span> <span id="s1085">So I really found myself in the wilderness when I came back.</span> <span id="s1086">And the fact that it -- that things had changed, new people, new order had been set up out there, Henry was no longer there.</span> <span id="s1087">It meant that it was difficult for me to go back.</span> <span id="s1088">And in a way that was quite difficult for me, that whole scene.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: Well, I mean it was two things as well, wasn’t it?</span> <span id="s1090">It was unfinished business, and you hadn’t really said your goodbyes if you were expecting to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: I hadn’t said my goodbyes to anybody, I hadn’t -- I’d finished the TB train.</span> <span id="s1092">I mean, that was a job, that was a project that lasted many months, and that was the one thing I did achieve, whatever else I did or didn’t achieve, I achieved that.</span> <span id="s1093">So I felt quite good about the bi -- the -- the -- the -- the fact that I’d got a -- managed to get a group of young children and adolescents to Switzerland for treatment of their TB.</span> <span id="s1094">That was quite an achievement, you know, bearing in mind the difficulties that we were faced with.</span> <span id="s1095">So I felt good about that, but I didn’t feel good about leaving unfinished business, not saying goodbye.</span> <span id="s1096">I felt very, very bad.</span> <span id="s1097">It was bad, very difficult for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: So when you came home and you found this kind of uncomprehending response, what happened?</span> <span id="s1099">What -- what happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: Well, there was a period which I really can barely remember, in which I wandered about, as I say, going to the cinema.</span> <span id="s1101">Sort of not knowing quite what to do.</span> <span id="s1102">I eventually went to work for the Jewish Refugee Committee in their emigration department.</span> <span id="s1103">And then finally, from there, I was asked to work with the Committee for the Care of Children from Concentration Camps, working with a group of young children and adolescents who’d been brought to this country whilst I was still in Germany.</span> <span id="s1104">They came here in 1945.</span> <span id="s1105">They were young people, orphans who’d been in Auschwitz, and been in the slave labor camps.</span> <span id="s1106">And because of my background I was asked if I would be a caseworker with that organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: Well, w-why don’t you tell me a little bit about that organization and the -- and the work that you did?</span> <span id="s1108">We’re taking a little pause.</span> <span id="s1109">Yes.</span> <span id="s1110">Before we move on to look in some depth at the work you did when you came back to England, give me an assessment of what you, your organization, and people like you achieved in Germany after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: I think that had it not been for Henry Lunzer, with his or -- with his sort of military organization, in setting up an administration, and an office that actually could operate within German, and particularly in the British zone, but not only in the British zone, in terms of provision, in terms of negotiation with British military government for the needs of different individuals and groups, I think that we would have achieved very little.</span> <span id="s1112">I think we -- and I think that his support of the need for children to go to the sanatoria in -- in Switzerland was -- was good, and he gave me all the support -- moral support that I needed in order to do that.</span> <span id="s1113">I think that he was misjudged, as is often the case, where you have a small -- where you have small resources, and you have a base in another country of purse holders and trustees, who have the reputation of the organization at heart, and want it to succeed, but do not, and cannot seem to have a view, a good overview of what Henry Lunzer was trying to achieve there.</span> <span id="s1114">So there were inevitable, and there always are, I think, tensions, even in organizations today, which are well known, where the base is held perhaps here, and the outreach work is done in remote parts of the world.</span> <span id="s1115">It’s very difficult to keep those communications clean and good.</span> <span id="s1116">And it certainly was a handicap in -- in the -- in the Jewish Relief Unit at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: Let’s move on now then, fairly swiftly to the work that you be -- began to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: But I -- I did want to -- but I do -- I do really, at this point, want to pay tribute to Henry Lunzer because I think that he was a courageous negotiator and was very knowledgeable.</span> <span id="s1119">He knew Germany well, he spoke German well.</span> <span id="s1120">He could speak to military government.</span> <span id="s1121">I think, you know, somebody needs to say he did a bloody good job, because he did.</span> <span id="s1122">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1124">Let’s talk then about the work that you did once you came back to London after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A: Once I’d recovered my equilibrium, which took some months before I could actually face the world, really, I was appointed a case worker to the Committee for the Care of Children from Concentration Camps.</span> <span id="s1126">I think I mentioned this a little earlier.</span> <span id="s1127">It was an organization sponsored and financed by the Central British Fund, and had a board of trustees.</span> <span id="s1128">And it’s director was a practicing psychoanalyst, called Oskar Friedman, who I’d admired very much.</span> <span id="s1129">Who had been the director of a type of [indecipherable] institution in Germany, until he himself, as a Jew, was expelled and taken to a concentration camp before the war started, and finally released, and who came to this country, or at least came to Britain as a refugee.</span> <span id="s1130">And he was, as I say, a practicing psychoanalyst, and he brought to the work of the committee, a knowledge of institutional life, and of working with people who in turn were trying to care for what was considered to be a -- in the best sense, perhaps, but nevertheless, a difficult or complex group of young people.</span> <span id="s1131">I came back in 1947, in the early months of 1947, so the children had already been, and -- or -- and adolescents had already gone through a kind of preliminary phase of being in special homes, out of London, where they were helped with language and many different things.</span> <span id="s1132">By the time I got to work with them, they were looking at schooling, at advance study, at apprenticeships, and some kind of future.</span> <span id="s1133">Again, we were looking at a very vigorous, articulate, demanding group of young people, competitive.</span> <span id="s1134">Now, they were very different in some ways from the people that I remembered from the camps.</span> <span id="s1135">Their survival, as -- as had the people in the camps, but let’s just make this kind of -- let’s mark this difference.</span> <span id="s1136">The people in -- the peop -- the pe -- the young people I was working with had survived the daily selections for work, or for the gas chamber, through their ability to maintain strength, to maintain totally focused on their survival, nobody else’s but their survival.</span> <span id="s1137">Although of course, some were concerned with friends and siblings, but basically focused on their own bodily survival.</span> <span id="s1138">They had to prove their strength, their capacity to work another day.</span> <span id="s1139">Silence, not reacting to anything, however cruel, was part of their survival.</span> <span id="s1140">So in dealing, in communicating with this group of people, one always had to have in one’s mind that that was how they survived.</span> <span id="s1141">And there was never going to be an easy, immediate communication and trust.</span> <span id="s1142">There couldn’t be.</span> <span id="s1143">Nobody in their life really could be trusted for some time.</span> <span id="s1144">So it was very important to find a way to build that trust, and to build a form of communication that took into account their need for their own private space.</span> <span id="s1145">And this is quite important because I found it very important in working with them that -- for example, I -- I spoke about taking someone’s hand in the camps.</span> <span id="s1146">What I found with the young people to be very important was to pi -- allow a space between you and them.</span> <span id="s1147">A kind of actual, physical space so that -- and I -- I could never quite put my finger on why, in the early days, that was so important to maintain that space, but it was.</span> <span id="s1148">And I believe that it gave them a sense of their own kind of power base, their own sense of identity and strength.</span> <span id="s1149">And I did not invade it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: This is tape number four, side A of an interview with Helen Bamber.</span> <span id="s1152">You were talking about the space and your approach -- you were talking about your approach to these young people, and how actually they needed precisely the opposite kind of approach to the people you dealt with in Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1154">And a -- a -- this space was -- was a recognition, a kind of instinctive recognition.</span> <span id="s1155">It wasn’t something that I could put down to tuition or guidance from Oskar Friedman, although he was a guidance to me in many of the cases that I had.</span> <span id="s1156">But I just -- it was something that I just sensed as very, very important.</span> <span id="s1157">Now, my job then was to try and help the young people to be placed in jobs, to begin a life that would be possibly creative, or would certainly give them some sense of solid -- solidity.</span> <span id="s1158">However, I have to say at some stage that we were not encouraged to, so to speak, open the lid on the horrors that they had experienced.</span> <span id="s1159">And I do feel that there was, in some way, a denial of need here.</span> <span id="s1160">I believe that these young people -- and I’ve said earlier I believe, in the tapes, that people did not have the opportunity, the ability or the resources in time to mourn their dead.</span> <span id="s1161">And it’s not only to mourn their dead in the sense of their dying, but in the sense of their grotesque manner of dying.</span> <span id="s1162">And to mourn the grotesque is more complex, and needs skill.</span> <span id="s1163">I don’t think that we had thought that through, and even if we did fumble towards an understanding that their inner world was not being addressed, such was the -- the kind of culture of the day, that the idea that -- you see, Britain at the end of the war was a country blunted by war, where the message to everyone was to -- to just put the past to rest and let’s move forward.</span> <span id="s1164">A new world is born, the war is over, let’s get on with life.</span> <span id="s1165">That was the message of the day.</span> <span id="s1166">Soldiers were not encouraged to speak about their inner fears and their nightmares.</span> <span id="s1167">They were not encouraged to talk about the horrors of war.</span> <span id="s1168">All the war films that came out were really like something out of Peter Pan, they were so -- so banal, and so sentimental.</span> <span id="s1169">So sentimental a -- you know, sa -- the war was sentimentalized.</span> <span id="s1170">It wasn’t portrayed at that stage with all it’s horror.</span> <span id="s1171">And to bring the horror of the Holocaust out in the open was felt not to be appropriate.</span> <span id="s1172">Now, I’m not saying that there wasn’t some attention to their inner world.</span> <span id="s1173">I believe there was some.</span> <span id="s1174">The Anna Freud clinic was involved in some way in observing the young people.</span> <span id="s1175">But I don’t believe that we dealt with the need to mourn.</span> <span id="s1176">And when I look today at the -- at the older people as they are now, men in their 60’s and 70’s, women, and I look at their relationships and the next generation, I don’t believe that we did as good a job, perhaps, as we could have done.</span> <span id="s1177">It’s easy to say that in hindsight.</span> <span id="s1178">I believe that we did quite a lot of good, and most of the young people have, in social terms, flourished, made good, married, had children.</span> <span id="s1179">But if you observe them, and their relationships, and their long -- I don’t want to use the word long-suffering, but in their very supportive wives, and you speak to the children, not everything is as good as it looks.</span> <span id="s1180">So, I mean, I went about my task of trying to help people, young people t -- into jobs.</span> <span id="s1181">I negotiated yet again with schools, and colleges, and institutions and most in a -- most unpleasant sometimes, landlords, landladies, and -- and -- and -- and employers.</span> <span id="s1182">It was a hard time.</span> <span id="s1183">It had been a hard war, and people were tough, and employers were tough.</span> <span id="s1184">And the fact that these young people were -- I was just going to say asylum seekers -- were -- as the young people were Holocaust survivors, it did not call for compassion.</span> <span id="s1185">Some were good, some were very good.</span> <span id="s1186">And many people worked well with the young people, and offered much.</span> <span id="s1187">And there was a club, and there were facilities and money was sought for special needs.</span> <span id="s1188">But I would have liked to have dealt better with some of the strange things that happened.</span> <span id="s1189">I had a young man, for example, who’d been -- who had TB.</span> <span id="s1190">And I went every week to see him here, in a sanatorium near Brentwood.</span> <span id="s1191">He was a delightful young man from Poland.</span> <span id="s1192">We spoke together, we talked about his needs.</span> <span id="s1193">We talked about all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s1194">But one day when I went there, after many, many months of treatment, and he was doing very well, he wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s1195">And I was quite upset and I asked the nurses what had happened.</span> <span id="s1196">And they said he just got up and went.</span> <span id="s1197">Now he -- we don’t know what happened, and I still to this day don’t know exactly what the process was, whether it was long planned, or whether it was a sudden whim, or what, but certainly Oskar Friedman was very enquiring of me as to why I hadn’t noticed a problem.</span> <span id="s1198">But such was the defense of this young man that he could converse week after week, and I could become quite close, and we could talk about quite intimate things, about sexuality, about the difficulty of being ill, about a possible girlfriend, all these things we could talk about.</span> <span id="s1199">But somehow he could, nevertheless, just g-get up and go.</span> <span id="s1200">So it’s that kind of thing where the defenses have been developed through crisis, through extremis, through the most terrible losses and catastrophes, and genocide.</span> <span id="s1201">Where people have built defenses that are no longer so good in every day life, and do not make for absolute intimacy and trust.</span> <span id="s1202">And this is what I think happened with this young man.</span> <span id="s1203">We ca -- w-we managed to speak about it later, but it happened, and it felt like a failure, and was judged to be a failure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: One boy out of many, then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: Well, I mean, he succeeded.</span> <span id="s1206">He got better, he had a girlfriend in the end.</span> <span id="s1207">No, I don’t think it was a total failure.</span> <span id="s1208">He was one boy out of many.</span> <span id="s1209">There was another boy I took, a very, very brilliant boy, who I’ve lat -- just recently found as a professor of chemistry in Canada, in university in Canada.</span> <span id="s1210">I looked for many months, years in fact to find him.</span> <span id="s1211">He had TB of the spine, and I wondered if he’d survived.</span> <span id="s1212">And I -- I took him before a group of headmasters in a special school in north London, because he was a very brilliant child, and we had wanted a particular standard of education for him.</span> <span id="s1213">In coming before the headmasters -- it was a team of headmasters, to judge this young man.</span> <span id="s1214">I had to, of course, to say that the -- he had lost quite a number of years of his education.</span> <span id="s1215">Brilliant as he was, he had lost years.</span> <span id="s1216">And I explained that he’d been in this camp, and that camp, slave labor, etcetera, etcetera, Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1217">And then the chair of the headmasters turned to me and said, “But didn’t they give them books to read?”</span> <span id="s1218">And I was so aghast.</span> <span id="s1219">I couldn’t believe it, and I couldn’t find anything to say.</span> <span id="s1220">Sufficient to say that the young man was taken into that particular school.</span> <span id="s1221">But I’ve never forgotten that, and it’s an indication of society’s capacity to deny what is taking place.</span> <span id="s1222">But there was also denial amongst the Jewish community when I came back from Germany, as to what had happened to our brethren, to our brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s1223">And denial can exist in every population.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: Why did it exist among Britain’s Jewish population?</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">A: I think it was partly guilt, that s -- si -- a -- si -- their own survival and other people had not survived.</span> <span id="s1226">I -- I shared that.</span> <span id="s1227">I shared that feeling of -- of having survived when nobody -- you know, when other people did not, and you know, just by the luck of the draw, really.</span> <span id="s1228">Many of my relatives in Poland indeed had not survived.</span> <span id="s1229">So -- my father’s relatives.</span> <span id="s1230">So I think it was partly guilt, but it’s also denial.</span> <span id="s1231">If you deny something, you don’t have to do anything about it.</span> <span id="s1232">If you recognize something, you have to do something.</span> <span id="s1233">And you know, I’m faced with this every day, in my every day life now.</span> <span id="s1234">It’s the denial of society to accept that certain people have suffered sufficiently to require our attention.</span> <span id="s1235">And I think that’s what I felt when I came back from Germany.</span> <span id="s1236">It wasn’t just the experience of the camps, of the people, of the ghastliness, of everything I’d seen and heard.</span> <span id="s1237">It was the fact that when I came back I couldn’t get anybody to even unders -- want to -- want to understand what had happened.</span> <span id="s1238">And so this really is my -- my most urgent plea.</span> <span id="s1239">It’s not only about remembering the past, it’s about preserving the future.</span> <span id="s1240">And we can only preserve the future if we recognize what we are doing to each other, and what that means for the victims, and what we need to do if we’re to be a compassionate society.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: Little pause here to allow us to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: Oh, I thought that was the fi --</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Q: When did you finish working with the boy survivors, and -- and what did you do next?</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">A: I worked for many years, about eight years on and off with the -- the boy survivors.</span> <span id="s1245">Of course, there were girls, we always called them the boys, but there were girls.</span> <span id="s1246">And I continue to stay in touch with them.</span> <span id="s1247">When I say I continue to work with them, the work finished probably after a -- a few years, I think, after about four years, but I continued to see them, and continued to work with them for a number of years after that.</span> <span id="s1248">And I still see them, particularly one or two of them.</span> <span id="s1249">But I then went on to do some hospital jobs, social work jobs in hospitals.</span> <span id="s1250">I joined Amnesty in 1961.</span> <span id="s1251">And I -- I just do want to say something about why I joined Amnesty, I know it’s not relevant, except to do with hatred.</span> <span id="s1252">It was very easy to hate one particular nation, and one particular group of people.</span> <span id="s1253">And I’d enjoyed, if I can use that word, or indulged in that hatred for many years, particularly as my husband also had been a s -- a survivor in many ways, and seen his family destroyed in grotesque ways, and I -- at least his -- certainly his father, who was beaten to death in the house in which they were on the Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s1254">So living with his depression and his misery over the death of his mother, and rest of his family in Majdanek concentration camp, I certainly nursed my hatred of the Germans for many years.</span> <span id="s1255">But it was when I began to realize that torture and other human rights violations were going on in so many countries in the world.</span> <span id="s1256">That the French were torturing the Algerians, that other people were torturing.</span> <span id="s1257">That you could not put -- you could not put a frontier up and say this is where it begins, and this is where it ends.</span> <span id="s1258">And I’m not making, and I’m not comparing one genocide, or one cat -- catastrophe with another.</span> <span id="s1259">The Holocaust will always remain the most terrible of genocides of the 20th century.</span> <span id="s1260">But I still feel that we mustn’t close our eyes to other terrible disasters, such as we’ve seen recently, for example, in Rwanda.</span> <span id="s1261">So I joined Amnesty [indecipherable] in the spirits, you know, with the idea that I can’t nurse this forever.</span> <span id="s1262">I have to accept and have to understand that violence and persecution goes on in many different forms, and I needed to understand it better.</span> <span id="s1263">My work in Amnesty went on for many years.</span> <span id="s1264">I -- I helped to form the first medical group in the British section of Amnesty International, taking testimony and documenting evidence of torture and human rights violations from relatives and survivors who’d come to this country, and in going on missions abroad for Amnesty.</span> <span id="s1265">And it was coming out of that -- that work, knowing that we could document, and we could take testimony, and we could supply evidence of human rights violations to organizations and institutions concerned with human rights, including the United Nations, but that we weren’t actually treating the survivors.</span> <span id="s1266">That made me feel we weren’t really fulfilling our task.</span> <span id="s1267">And as people were beginning to ask us to take care of asylum seekers, refugees and asylum seekers from many different countries who look -- resided in this country, and who’d been tortured and violated in many different ways, and lost sometimes, all their members of their family, that made me feel that we needed to move on.</span> <span id="s1268">We established as an independent charity, the medical foundation for the care of victims of torture at the end of 1985.</span> <span id="s1269">And we had a vision, and visions are difficult to hold onto.</span> <span id="s1270">And the vision was to combine human rights, and the care of the victims.</span> <span id="s1271">In other words, to take heed of people’s protection, their human rights, to be part of that.</span> <span id="s1272">If necessary even to be advocates for that, which is not easy for therapists.</span> <span id="s1273">But also to look at the medical, psychological and social needs of the people who came from the -- to the medical foundation.</span> <span id="s1274">We’ve treated over 35,000 people, from over 91 different countries, and I have to tell you that my room every day, my consulting room every day, is filled with horrendous stories of torture, of deliberate mutilation, of hideous rapes, of dreadful executions from all over the world.</span> <span id="s1275">And I suppose really, that is the beginning and end, in some ways of my story.</span> <span id="s1276">I’m doing what I set out to do.</span> <span id="s1277">I know I can’t save everybody.</span> <span id="s1278">I know that my own skills are limited.</span> <span id="s1279">We’re an organization with no -- insufficient resources to meet the needs of everyone.</span> <span id="s1280">I believe we live in as hostile an environment as -- or at least our survivors do, as they ever did in the 30’s.</span> <span id="s1281">People are not welcomed, people are deported back to the countries which tortured them.</span> <span id="s1282">European countries are closing the doors, we have a fortress Europe.</span> <span id="s1283">We don’t look for good solutions.</span> <span id="s1284">We didn’t in the 30’s and we don’t now.</span> <span id="s1285">So really, my work is again about human rights, and the care of the individual, and the individual’s family.</span> <span id="s1286">And that can be very rewarding work, even if it can also be quite distressing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: Is there a thread that directly links your experiences at -- of Belsen with the Medical Foundation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: I don’t think I would have established the Medical Foundation, and worked so long in the Medical Foundation if I hadn’t been to Belsen.</span> <span id="s1289">What I learned in Belsen was about a kind of suffering that we have never really begun to understand, about loss, about grotesque death, about the need to mourn.</span> <span id="s1290">About -- about despair and the desire to die.</span> <span id="s1291">I learned all of these things in Belsen, but I also learned about the resilience, and something about the human spirit and people’s capacity to survive, and people’s capacity to overcome, if you are able to resource something within them.</span> <span id="s1292">And that’s what I’ve learned.</span> <span id="s1293">I didn’t understand how to resource it for many years.</span> <span id="s1294">But with time, you are able to resource people’s skills, people’s -- you are able to retrieve something of who that person was.</span> <span id="s1295">And that’s very, very important.</span> <span id="s1296">You are able to deal, or to try to come to terms with grotesque death.</span> <span id="s1297">To find ways of burying the dead that are very unusual.</span> <span id="s1298">And this we’ve had to do in the Medical Foundation.</span> <span id="s1299">It’s about an holistic approach to trauma, and to loss, using medicine, using psychology, but also using very adaptive measures.</span> <span id="s1300">You can’t deal -- you know, you can’t bring a very traditional form of therapy very often to people from different -- from certain dif -- from different cultures, from different beliefs in healing.</span> <span id="s1301">You’ll have to listen to what is going to help them, and you have to find very creative ways of working with people, and I can give many examples of that, but I don’t think that that is the purpose of this discussion.</span> <span id="s1302">I think the Medical Foundation has learned how to address government, it’s home office.</span> <span id="s1303">It doesn’t always succeed, but it tries.</span> <span id="s1304">It’s learned skills of negotiation and understanding other people’s difficulties.</span> <span id="s1305">But how you hold the vision, and how you deal with continuing -- a continuing lack of compassion and understanding, both in the public -- or some of the public, not all of the public, we have quite a following, but in some of the public, and in some of government, is very difficult to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: Now, on a slightly different tack, but not entirely, one aspect of the work that you’ve done for the Medical Foundation, I believe in June 1993, you went to Israel and you testified on behalf of a Palestinian prisoner.</span> <span id="s1307">Could you tell me about that whole case, and your involvement in it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">A: I’ll tell you some of it, because it would take a lifetime to discuss it properly.</span> <span id="s1309">I went to Israel to take part with a colleague of mine who is formerly -- was -- was born in Israel, but lives in this country and works as a psychologist.</span> <span id="s1310">I went to attend a conference of the Israeli and Palestinian Physicians for Human Rights.</span> <span id="s1311">The Medical Foundation does link to various human rights organizations.</span> <span id="s1312">And because of my background, and because of the background of my colleague, it seemed very appropriate that we should link to something that sounded as constructive as an Israeli and Palestinian Formation for the Benefit of Human Rights.</span> <span id="s1313">We knew, and had met the Israeli members of the organization, and the Palestinians.</span> <span id="s1314">I had known and worked with for many years -- that means to say, when I say worked with, I mean I’ve communicated with a very profound child psychiatrist from Gaza who studied in this country, and is working with the Gaza community mental health team in Gaza.</span> <span id="s1315">So it seemed a logical thing to do, for us to attend the conference, which regrettably was on the subject of torture.</span> <span id="s1316">Torture worldwide, torture throughout the world, but torture also in Israel.</span> <span id="s1317">And when I was there, I was asked by the Physicians for Human Rights if I would help them in the case of a Palestinian where it had become obvious from the papers that had been found of his interrogation, that he had been tortured in order -- in order for him to confess, whether I will be prepared to help them.</span> <span id="s1318">And I met the lawyer, the Jewish lawyer involved in his case before I made any decisions.</span> <span id="s1319">And I was very impressed with his integrity, and his dignity, and his desire as an Israeli to provide fairness and justice where he felt it was appropriate.</span> <span id="s1320">On reading the document, it was obvious to me that certain forms of what we would call torture had taken place.</span> <span id="s1321">And I agreed, reluctantly may I say, to, as a visiting director of an organization concerned with torture, to take part in a certain aspect of his trial.</span> <span id="s1322">It -- it was agreed -- it was agreed with the lawyer that this -- I mean, it was at the lawyers request that I acquiesced to this.</span> <span id="s1323">And I produced a document, and I attended the court.</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">End of Tape Four, Side A Beginning Tape Four, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">Q: This is tape number four, side B, of an interview with Helen Bamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">A: And so we went -- I went with the -- with the lawyer, the Jewish lawyer, and my colleague who had come with me and escorted me from the UK, to Hebrum.</span> <span id="s1327">It was extremely hot.</span> <span id="s1328">And we had to wait for many hours because the judge was not happy about my giving any evidence in the court.</span> <span id="s1329">And I think that she, quite understandably, had to take advice from other authorities before she could proceed, and she went on really for many hours before eventually, I was allowed to come into the court, and to give only very restricted information.</span> <span id="s1330">I could not refer to certain aspects which they considered I was not qualified to refer to.</span> <span id="s1331">So, my role was rather a limited one.</span> <span id="s1332">But I could talk about confessions under torture, and that confessions under torture can never be reliable ones, for quite obvious reasons.</span> <span id="s1333">That people will often say something in extreme discomfort that isn’t necessarily true.</span> <span id="s1334">And as torture is universally outlawed, it does seem rather inappropriate for any court to take, to accept a confession that actually took place under coercion, and under extreme pressure.</span> <span id="s1335">Before I went to the court, I sat for some time in a very small, hot flat, without air conditioning, to see what it felt like to be hooded with a thick, smelly, kind of wooly, wool material, army material hood.</span> <span id="s1336">I didn’t have such an exact hood, but I had sufficient to give me a feeling of how claustrophobic, and how terrible such a feeling would be.</span> <span id="s1337">I wasn’t able to adopt the position that is adopted, that was adopted, and is -- is often used in such cases in Israel, where somebody is placed on a low chair, their hands tied behind them, and the chair’s feet are shorter in the front than the back, so that the -- when you are hooded, and exposed to quite a lot of noise, loud noise, and you are also in this very uncomfortable position, sitting on this seat, which has a traditional name, which I shall remember soon, I think if anybody were to try that position, they would find it extremely uncomfortable, because the weight of the body is distributed in such a way that there’s enormous pressure on the back, and one is in extreme discomfort and fear, and exposed to noise.</span> <span id="s1338">Man also had an injury that had been recorded in the notes, but which I was not allowed to refer to in the court, which was an injury to his nose, which the doctor had recorded.</span> <span id="s1339">Now, I -- it’s difficult for me to discuss this particular case.</span> <span id="s1340">It so happens that the case was resolved, inasmuch as an expert came from -- an expert in confessions under pers -- under duress, came from the Mordsley hospital as an independent expert, and gave evidence in this case.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: A British hospital, that is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: Yes, a British hospital.</span> <span id="s1343">Because, as they professed to be uns -- not satisfied with my credentials as an expert witness, I did suggest to the court, that if they were concerned, as they said they were, to ascertain whether the man had confessed under torture, then perhaps the best way of doing it was to get somebody whose expertise could not be denied.</span> <span id="s1344">And so this was agreed, and eventually an expert, as I say, from a renowned institution, and whose seminal work is in confessions obtained under duress [indecipherable] attend the court.</span> <span id="s1345">And the man’s sentence was commuted.</span> <span id="s1346">Is i -- is that the word?</span> <span id="s1347">From I think 15 years, which was his convicted -- was the -- was what he was convicted -- was what he was given on conviction.</span> <span id="s1348">But I think it -- he w -- did -- it was then --</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q: Reduced, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">A: Reduced to a very short period, and he was released quite soon.</span> <span id="s1351">It was a very, very difficult experience for me.</span> <span id="s1352">For me, with my background, to stand in Israeli court, defending a Palestinian, who was there, and who looked extremely fearful, and obviously with a -- some -- well, was very hard.</span> <span id="s1353">But it was much harder to do nothing.</span> <span id="s1354">If had done nothing, I could never really have lived with my principles, which is that nobody, under any circumstances should be signaled out for torture, and that there are other ways.</span> <span id="s1355">If you do want information, you have to find, with all the ingenuity that exists within societies, other ways.</span> <span id="s1356">But you do not torture, you do not torture.</span> <span id="s1357">Torture is such an abominable, devastating experience, both to those who practice it, I believe, in the end, and those on who it is inflicted.</span> <span id="s1358">It is really the most terrible memory that la -- that -- that man can have.</span> <span id="s1359">And the nightmares, and the physical pain, the sense of one’s own betrayal -- the body betrays in torture.</span> <span id="s1360">The body gives out, and the body betrays you in torture.</span> <span id="s1361">And for a civilized country, for civilized people to be practicing torture on an individual is unforgivable, and cannot be condoned under any circumstances.</span> <span id="s1362">And I know there’s a great discussion going on about -- at the moment about whether torture is justified, and others must indulge in that.</span> <span id="s1363">But my views are clear, and my experience of working with survivors is that they -- they do not -- it is very difficult to overcome, just as it is with Holocaust survivors to overcome the effects of torture.</span> <span id="s1364">And for -- to employ people to torture as your agents is, I think the s -- beginning of a very slippery slope.</span> <span id="s1365">If you employ people to torture, or to apply as they say, minimum pressure, or whatever the phrase is.</span> <span id="s1366">It doesn’t matter what the phrase is.</span> <span id="s1367">What it means is to frighten through physical and psychological pain into a confession.</span> <span id="s1368">It’s no way to behave for a civilized society.</span> <span id="s1369">And there are people in Israel who feel very, very unhappy, very uncomfortable about what is going on.</span> <span id="s1370">And torture does exist, I’m afraid, in -- in Israel.</span> <span id="s1371">And I have been witness to a number of testimonies of people who’ve been tortured.</span> <span id="s1372">And it’s an unbearable thought, but I think that we have to -- I take heart from the fact that there are people in Israel who are working very, very hard to find a way to end this, and who’ve spoken out very courageously.</span> <span id="s1373">I wish there were more.</span> <span id="s1374">I know that there’s a great deal of fear, but I don’t with to get into the political scene in Israel.</span> <span id="s1375">People have elected their representatives, and they have made a decision.</span> <span id="s1376">I with there was not so much hatred against the Palestinians.</span> <span id="s1377">And I wish the Palestinians would not do what they are doing.</span> <span id="s1378">I’ve worked with moderate, and intelligent, and caring Palestinians and Israelis who come together and want to bring about change, and it’s our job to help them do that.</span> <span id="s1379">Not to be defensive about what is going on there, but rather to look for a solution, I think, as to how we as individuals can assist people to bring about change in their societies.</span> <span id="s1380">It is about the way people lose it, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">Q: Let me ask you a final question.</span> <span id="s1382">What lessons can you draw so far from your rather extraordinary life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">A: I don’t know whether it’s extraordinary, I -- I would question that.</span> <span id="s1384">But I -- I think really, my concern, what -- what worries me most is lack of compassion.</span> <span id="s1385">I think it’s so easy to turn against people, to create scapegoats.</span> <span id="s1386">I mean, no -- no nation, no group of people can be more conscious of that than the Jewish people, how easy it is for them to be scapegoated.</span> <span id="s1387">They always have been, and they’re still being scapegoated.</span> <span id="s1388">But we have to be careful about this, and we have to be informing all the time, people about the need to understand other people, to be compassionate.</span> <span id="s1389">We’re not a compassionate society here or anywhere else that I can see.</span> <span id="s1390">And we can do so many things.</span> <span id="s1391">We’re now going off to Mars, and to the moon, and here and there, but we don’t know how to maintain compassion.</span> <span id="s1392">What I saw happen in Belsen was the dying of compassion.</span> <span id="s1393">There was outrage and compassion when the camp was liberated, but I watched it die.</span> <span id="s1394">I watched it not there when I came back.</span> <span id="s1395">And when I speak today to people -- I watched it in hospitals where children, in my view, were really abused, and restrained, when they should not have been.</span> <span id="s1396">I don’t mean -- when I say abused, I mean cruelly treated, really.</span> <span id="s1397">Stupidly treated.</span> <span id="s1398">I just -- I just -- I mean, for example, when the Kosovan refugees came to this country -- we can question why, but people came to the airports with teddy bears and presents, and there was all kinds of support and interest in their welfare, particularly families with small children.</span> <span id="s1399">People were able to identify them.</span> <span id="s1400">But even though they were able to identify them, the compassion is gone.</span> <span id="s1401">If I say today that my own government is considering sending back a Kosovan family, who we feel, for reasons of torture and rape and various other situations, really should not go back, but should be allowed to stay, there won’t be that compassion.</span> <span id="s1402">The compassion has died.</span> <span id="s1403">And so I don’t know what maintains compassion.</span> <span id="s1404">And I don’t know how to help people or to instill compassion in people when they’ve lost it.</span> <span id="s1405">And I think that is really the predicament for s -- f -- f -- and always has been.</span> <span id="s1406">It’s about being compassionate to the people who are so different from you.</span> <span id="s1407">And even people you may not like very much.</span> <span id="s1408">I mean, I don’t like all my clients, I don’t have to, it’s not my job.</span> <span id="s1409">I remember when I was in Germany and I said on one occasion to a much more experienced colleague, my God, I’m so tired of -- there’s one particular person that drove me literally -- drove me quite mad, and was very demanding.</span> <span id="s1410">And he said, “Look, you’re not here to like people.</span> <span id="s1411">You’re not here to like them.”</span> <span id="s1412">And that’s quite true.</span> <span id="s1413">I’m not doing this work because I like everybody.</span> <span id="s1414">And I don’t expect to, and it would be foolish for me to do so.</span> <span id="s1415">But there has to be a degree of compassion if we’re to deal with the ills of society.</span> <span id="s1416">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1417">I [inaudible].</span> <span id="s1418">I can’t finish it.</span> <span id="s1419">I’ve come to the end.</span> <span id="s1420">I don’t know, it sounds like a sermon from God knows where.</span> <span id="s1421">I don’t intend it to sound like a sermon.</span> <span id="s1422">It’s not like that, but I’ve watched compassion die so quickly, I just -- it’s just a plea for some kind of understanding that isn’t there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q: Helen Bamber, thank you very much.</span> <span id="s1424">This concludes the
