family?</span> <span id="s48">Were you...</span></p> <p><span id="s49">SS: Yes, very, you know, as an average in those areas, in Czechoslovakia where there weren't any less observant or more

<p><span id="s58">SS: Well, the boys went to yeshivah; after they finished elementary school, the eighth grade, they were sent off to the yeshivahs.</span> <span id="s59">Girls, well, I didn't have a chance to go far enough because I was too young when the war broke out.</span> <span id="s60">But the girls were, tried, my parents tried to give the girls an occupation.</span></p> <p><span

community?</span> <span id="s64">Was there, were there many non-Jews in your community?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s66">We had, actually we were approximately only one-third of the population.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">GB: Population.</span> <span id="s68">Did you yourself personally have any association with the non-Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">SS: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s70">We be--since my father was a blacksmith, and my sister was a beautician, we were constantly involved with the two religions, I mean the two interfaiths, because people were coming and going, and we had a very good relationship with our neighbors.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">GB: What, did you go to the public school?</span> <span id="s72">What was your...</span></p> <p><span id="s73">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s74">I went to Czech schools.</span> <span id="s75">That was elementary school, until 1938 when the Czechs had to leave.</span> <span id="s76">The war broke out in 1938.</span> <span id="s77">The war broke out, and the Czechs had to leave.</span> <span id="s78">And then we were stopped from getting a proper education.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">GB: I want to know a little bit more, before the war broke out.</span> <span id="s80">Did you or your family belong to any Jewish organization, any Zionist organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">SS: No.</span> <span id="s82">My family was very religious, and actually we, the children were for bid den to belong to any of, any Zionist organizations.</span> <span id="s83">My sister, the one that was at the age of 20 at the time of 1934-35, she wanted to go on aliyah, to Israel.</span> <span id="s84">And my parents didn't let her go, because it was against, you know there, the, everybody was following the rabbi's advice.</span> <span id="s85">And if the rabbi said, "No, it's against the Law," so she couldn't go.</span> <span id="s86">But she was very much inclined to belong and to follow the Zionist movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">GB: With the outbreak of the war in Europe, were you aware of what was happening around you?</span> <span id="s88">Well, did your family know anything about what was going on?</span> <span id="s89">Did you realize?</span> <span id="s90">And how was the war discussed in your household?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">SS: Well, it was, until, the Germans did not occupy Austria.</span> <span id="s92">We weren't concerned about the war.</span> <span id="s93">We were going after our daily rou--our lives, and weren't concerned.</span> <span id="s94">But once the Germans occupied Austria, the news started spreading all over that there is war and there are hard times coming.</span> <span id="s95">But nobody was thinking that something like that could ever happen.</span> <span id="s96">We thought that we are natives!</span> <span id="s97">My grand, great grandfather, grandfather, and my parents were born in the same place.</span> <span id="s98">Nobody would have ever thought that something like that would, could ever happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">GB: At any time did you or your father or your, any of your family other than, you mentioned your sister, think of leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">SS: Leaving where?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">GB: Leaving Austria, leaving your, Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">SS: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s103">At the time, in 1936, my two older sisters left for Belgium, because that was when it started already to become difficult and my mother said, "Go children."</span> <span id="s104">She did not want to have all the children in one place.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">GB: And did they leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">SS: They left.</span> <span id="s107">They...</span></p> <p><span id="s108">GB: They left.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">SS: They left.</span> <span id="s110">So I had two chil--two sisters in Belgium, in Antwerp.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">GB: How did the actual invasion of Czechoslovakia affect you and your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">SS: Well, it was a very black day for everybody, although it was a kind of a very mixed up situation because we are at the place that it was kind of like a bouncing ball.</span> <span id="s113">The Russians were claiming that area, and the Hungarians were claiming that area.</span> <span id="s114">So, for weeks they were going like, you know, going on back who is gonna come in.</span> <span id="s115">After the Czechs left--the Czechs were driven out--and after that, it took about a week until, we didn't belong to anybody.</span> <span id="s116">And after a week the Ukraines came in.</span> <span id="s117">And that's, then when hell started already.</span> <span id="s118">The Ukraines had in mind to completely annihilate that area.</span> <span id="s119">They didn't want to have any Jews.</span> <span id="s120">But they didn't last long.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">GB: Then the Germans took over?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">SS: Then the Hungarians came in, and my parents, since my father was a Veteran of World War I, and he remembered the war, World War I, how it was during that time, they remembered still the King Joseph, Franz Joseph, that everybody lived so beautifully there.</span> <span id="s123">So, they were welcoming them with open arms.</span> <span id="s124">Everybody went out with class and everything and they were welcoming.</span> <span id="s125">But it turned out to be a disaster.</span> <span id="s126">As soon as the first Hungarian gendarme walked in into this village, they started pulling the beards and arresting the men.</span> <span id="s127">And it turned into hell.</span> <span id="s128">And everybody, I just, I would see my father, "What happened to those Hungarians?</span> <span id="s129">I remember Hungarians when I was a happy citizen."</span> <span id="s130">And nobody could believe that something like that could happen.</span> <span id="s131">And as soon as the Hungarians walked in, and they started following the German rules.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">GB: This was in 19-...</span></p> <p><span id="s133">SS: That was in 19-...</span></p> <p><span id="s134">GB: '40?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">SS: 1938.</span> <span id="s136">No, 19-...</span></p> <p><span id="s137">GB: '39?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">SS: 1938, the beginning '39, yes, because it was in the spring, before Purim it was, 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">GB: And you were still in your home.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">SS: I was still in my home, and I was only 12 years old at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">GB: What happened, how did you have to, how did it come about leaving your home?</span> <span id="s142">How did you leave your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">SS: Times became difficult.</span> <span id="s144">They took away my father's business, my sister's business, my other sister's business, my...</span></p> <p><span id="s145">GB: You say one sister was a, had a beauty parlor?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">SS: Beauty parlor.</span> <span id="s147">And my brother-in-law had a haberdashery store.</span> <span id="s148">My other sister had a, also kind of a, she was going on markets, you know, also selling clothing.</span> <span id="s149">They took away all these businesses, and we were a family, well, my parents still had at home four, five kids.</span> <span id="s150">My sister with four kids, the other sister with two kids, and there was no, nothing to live on.</span> <span id="s151">Since they closed down everything, and the rationing started.</span> <span id="s152">Jews were allowed only to take, stood in, stay in line for a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s153">And here you had little children, you had to feed them!</span> <span id="s154">So I was the one that had to get, go out at night [pause; tape off then on] to stand in line and bring home a piece of bread for the children, little bit milk.</span> <span id="s155">And that was going on for approximately a couple of months.</span> <span id="s156">And the reserves were drying up, whatever we had.</span> <span id="s157">And we had to live without because we, what ever was at home we had to give away and try to support the kids and to, for survival.</span> <span id="s158">And then my older sister and I said to my mother, "Listen, we cannot stay at home.</span> <span id="s159">Somebody has to bring in some money.</span> <span id="s160">Otherwise we're gonna starve.</span> <span id="s161">We have to leave home.</span> <span id="s162">We're going out to Hungary, to Budapest."</span> <span id="s163">And so, the first day after Pesach we picked ourselves up, my sister and I, and we went off to Hungary.</span> <span id="s164">That was in 1940.</span> <span id="s165">And we worked.</span> <span id="s166">And my sister was a beautician.</span> <span id="s167">That was the single one.</span> <span id="s168">And I was a seamstress.</span> <span id="s169">And we worked there.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">GB: Where did you live?</span> <span id="s171">You, just the, that you and your sister were alone in...</span></p> <p><span id="s172">SS: Alone, in Budapest.</span> <span id="s173">We tried, we got a bed at a fa--in a family, one family.</span> <span id="s174">We paid for that bed, and we slept in one bed and we were several people in a room, but each of us were renting a bed only.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">GB: During this time your mother and the other children and your father were still in Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">SS: Right.</span> <span id="s177">They remained at home.</span> <span id="s178">And we tried to send home money that they would be able to survive.</span> <span id="s179">But times, I guess got worse at home.</span> <span id="s180">And once I went home to visit--that was in 1942--for a holiday.</span> <span id="s181">I went home and somehow, they just got, they lived themselves, they were resigned for the way of living how it was coming.</span> <span id="s182">They didn't even care anymore.</span> <span id="s183">It was some kind of a living that you were looking out for every day just to survive.</span> <span id="s184">My brother-in-law was taken already, the two brother-in-laws were taken already to the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">GB: Work...</span></p> <p><span id="s186">SS: To the working camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">GB: Labor camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">SS: The labor camps.</span> <span id="s189">And they were sent to Poland in the labor camps.</span> <span id="s190">And so my sister and the other...</span></p> <p><span id="s191">GB: Do you know which labor camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">SS: Well, I don't know, because...</span></p> <p><span id="s193">GB: Did you ever see them again?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">SS: Never again, because he got, they got, you know, when the time, somehow, whoever came home after that, they were burned alive in the barracks, in Poland.</span> <span id="s195">They got sick and they, when the Germans were retreating, they didn't left anybody behind.</span> <span id="s196">Just burned up the barracks.</span> <span id="s197">And nobody came home.</span> <span id="s198">They sent home the tefillin from my brother, to my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">GB: Did your, the rest of your family ever come to Budapest?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">SS: No, only the two of us remained there.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">GB: Did you ever see your, the family that remained home, again?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">SS: After 1942, never again, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">GB: Do you know where...</span></p> <p><span id="s204">SS: My little brother came out, the younger brother, we brought up my younger brother to Budapest in 1943, to take him out from there, in case something happens, that at least somebody will survive.</span> <span id="s205">And so we picked him up, and he lived with us.</span> <span id="s206">We tried to teach him a trade there.</span> <span id="s207">We gave him to a place to learn, as a furrier.</span> <span id="s208">So he was young.</span> <span id="s209">He was only 12, 13, 12 years old.</span> <span id="s210">And the, we stayed there, and we, you know, at that time it was still normal life in Budapest.</span> <span id="s211">It wasn't so bad in 1942.</span> <span id="s212">And, so we sent home the money and my mother used to write letters and said, "Children, we don't know if we gonna see you ever again.</span> <span id="s213">The times are getting worse, and the talk is here that we are not gonna stay here much longer."</span></p> <p><span id="s214">GB: How old were you when...</span></p> <p><span id="s215">SS: I was, in 1942 I was 14 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">GB: You remained in Hungary, in Budapest until September of '44.</span> <span id="s217">What happened in September of '44?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">SS: In between when the, we found out, in 1944, Pesach 1944, we found out...</span></p> <p><span id="s219">GB: That was April of '4-...</span></p> <p><span id="s220">SS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">GB: April of '44.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">SS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s223">We found out that our parents were taken away.</span> <span id="s224">And my little brother picked himself up, and he ran away.</span> <span id="s225">He went home.</span> <span id="s226">He went home, and he hardly reached home but he reached home last day before they were taken away, and he went with my parents.</span> <span id="s227">And they were taken away to Beregszáz [Hungarian 1938] in to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s228">And from Beregszáz the ghetto they were...</span></p> <p><span id="s229">GB: Bereq...</span></p> <p><span id="s230">SS: Beregszáz, Beregovo [Czech 1920], Beregovo.</span> <span id="s231">That's the next big town.</span> <span id="s232">Yeah.</span> <span id="s233">To the ghetto.</span> <span id="s234">And from there they were taken to, away to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s235">So my mother, my father, my three little, young, two brothers and sisters, and my married two, two married sisters with their children, were taken away to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s236">But we got a card in between, from some place, Schwarzwald.</span> <span id="s237">That was a sign.</span> <span id="s238">They thought that they're gonna send a card from some place that they will try to eliminate the pressure on the people on the outside that they are working some place, in a camp.</span> <span id="s239">But we found out that Schwarzwald was in Germany.</span> <span id="s240">And they were taken to Poland, in 1940, the beginning from 1944 we knew we didn't have any more any parents.</span> <span id="s241">That was the end of it.</span> <span id="s242">We knew already because the rumors were coming in and young children were running away from everywhere coming to Budapest.</span> <span id="s243">And we knew already that we lost our parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">GB: And you continued to work and to go about your daily routine, knowing that this was...</span></p> <p><span id="s245">SS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">GB: Going on around you.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">SS: That's right.</span> <span id="s248">We, but we did not have any choice, because to go home, we couldn't go.</span> <span id="s249">And that was the only way to survive.</span> <span id="s250">We were hoping maybe some of them, since there were young people, that they will survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">GB: Did you hear or know of Wallenberg?</span> <span id="s252">Of course, we hear so much about him now.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">SS: I was there, and my sister actually was at the Embassy.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">GB: The Swedish Embassy.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">SS: The Swedish Embassy.</span> <span id="s256">When I belonged to the underground...</span></p> <p><span id="s257">GB: You were...</span></p> <p><span id="s258">SS: My sister did not know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">GB: Oh you were involved in the underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">SS: I was, belonged, yeah...</span></p> <p><span id="s261">GB: What was your...</span></p> <p><span id="s262">SS: I was belonged to...</span></p> <p><span id="s263">GB: What were you doing with the...</span></p> <p><span id="s264">SS: I belonged to an organization called Dror.</span> <span id="s265">That's a Zionist organization, Dror.</span> <span id="s266">[Dror is a Zionist Youth Movement which planned resistance.]</span></p> <p><span id="s267">GB: Oh you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">SS: And when it started happening that the Germans started persecuting the Jews in Budapest, we started to organize the youth that it will somehow get a hold of each other, we would know where which one is, in case something comes up, we will...</span></p> <p><span id="s269">GB: Like a lifeline...</span></p> <p><span id="s270">SS: Right, that's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">GB: From one to the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">SS: Right.</span> <span id="s273">So, I belonged to that organization, and since I was, there was some kind of a little bit of an underground we shouldn't tell each other where, who are we and which are we, even my sister did not know about it.</span> <span id="s274">[tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s275">GB: You were I was asking about Wallenberg and you...</span></p> <p><span id="s276">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">GB: Said you were, belonged to this organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">SS: There were rumors by that time that young children could be saved and sent to Israel.</span> <span id="s279">And there were children that they were picked up, and sent to Romania.</span> <span id="s280">And from there, sent to Israel.</span> <span id="s281">If they ever reached Israel, I never found out.</span> <span id="s282">But there were.</span> <span id="s283">My two colleagues, two boys, I was in contact with my two colleagues, two boys their names were Moti and Betsalel.</span> <span id="s284">And we tried to be constantly in contact.</span> <span id="s285">It came to a point where we were driven into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s286">Once the Germans came in in September, we were driven, everybody had to go into the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">GB: In Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">SS: In Budapest.</span> <span id="s289">And the ghetto wasn't easy, because you were hurled into one room so many people, and there were hours you were able only to go out to get some food.</span> <span id="s290">And during those hours, we had a chance to be in contact.</span> <span id="s291">The situation got worse, and they started taking away people from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s292">And they came...</span></p> <p><span id="s293">GB: Did you know where they were going when they were being taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">SS: They were saying that they were taking them to labor camps.</span> <span id="s295">So, we had to go into hiding.</span> <span id="s296">I took my sister in the burned out ghetto.</span> <span id="s297">And they were shooting over our heads.</span> <span id="s298">People lying in the streets in the double [unclear], streets, dead, wounded.</span> <span id="s299">They were shooting just like mad.</span> <span id="s300">It was like hell would have just

went.</span> <span id="s308">She consented.</span> <span id="s309">So, during the shooting I picked her up and I took her to that place, in the [unclear].</span> <span id="s310">And she went in.</span> <span id="s311">They said, "O.K."

where we can meet, and make some arrangement, what to do first.</span> <span id="s318">But it was impossible to get hold of them anymore.</span> <span id="s319">They went, put on Germans' clothing, both of them, and volunteered to train there, [unclear].</span> <span id="s320">[pause] And through that way they tried to get in contact with the organization, with the youngsters, through the

got into a desperate situation.</span> <span id="s336">I decided, "I will have to check out if my sister is not home, in the ghetto."</span> <span id="s337">And as I was walking towards the ghetto, I didn't have a star on me because I was in hiding.</span> <span id="s338">And if they would have asked me--I didn't look like a Jewess, and my name is a German name--so it was easily for me to escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">GB: Your name was...</span></p> <p><span id="s340">SS: Is Weber.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">GB: Weber.</span> <span id="s342">Was Weber.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">SS: That's right.</span> <span id="s344">But, as I was getting closer to the ghetto, a German came and just didn't care who I was, picked me up, and hurled me into the truck, and took me into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s345">And I went in.</span> <span id="s346">And my sis--surely my sister returned from the hiding place.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">GB: From the gentile

six years older.</span> <span id="s363">But I was the daring one.</span> <span id="s364">And so, and the following day--that was on a Sunday--and the following day they came out and took us, everybody from the ghetto, into the horse racing stadium, everybody.</span> <span id="s365">There were thou sands and thousands of youngsters, women, and children.</span> <span id="s366">And we were standing

she is alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">GB: We'll get to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s386">And we came to that little village on the outskirts of Budapest.</span>

had.</span> <span id="s391">And, we were taken out to make trenches.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">GB: For the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">SS: For, yes, because the Russians were already coming.</span> <span id="s394">We were, we heard already the shooting!</span> <span id="s395">From the Russian front, they were so near that you were, it was just like if it would have been a couple of miles away.</span> <span id="s396">And we had to make trenches.</span> <span id="s397">We were working there for approximately a week and one day--I have to tell it in honor of the nebbech [misfortune] of those two people that were so innocent--and just shot for no apparent reason.</span> <span id="s398">They took us out to make trenches, and one of the German Nazis was unhappy for apparent reason.</span> <span id="s399">And he came, and one girl, beautiful girl, tried to run away, and they caught her buying a toothbrush in a supermarket.</span> <span id="s400">And they brought her to the outskirts where we were making trenches, and they stripped her naked, and shot her in front of all of us.</span> <span id="s401">[weeping] Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span

up any reason to kill them.</span> <span id="s404">Picked them up, and they stood this young son, about fourteen years old, [weeping] and then this S.S. man, "You, you, you, you, come, and make the graves for these men.</span> <span id="s405">We want to have those graves in ten minutes.</span> <span id="s406">If not, you're gonna go in."</span> <span id="s407">Well, I didn't have a choice.</span> <span id="s408">We had to work like horses.</span> <span id="s409">And, when the graves were finished, they didn't hesitate.</span> <span id="s410">They put up the father in the front, and the ten men next to him, and then put the son in front of his father.</span> <span id="s411">He said, "You see, if you will try to run away, your fate is gonna be wind up where your father is."</span> <span id="s412">And they just shot him there, next to the trenches.</span> <span id="s413">And even didn't have a chance to cover them properly.</span> <span id="s414">They left them there, open, the grave.</span> <span id="s415">At night we had to, we went back to the barracks, and we never returned to that place anymore, because we were taken on a march to Germany.</span></p>

she had to get a passport for me because she wouldn't be able to survive.</span> <span id="s431">She managed to get a passport for me, and from the Wallenberg Embassy, from the Swedish Embassy.</span> <span id="s432">And she said she is gonna send it out with a messenger.</span> <span id="s433">You know, you saw in the film, how he went to the border?</span> <span id="s434">That's how the passports came to the border.</span> <span id="s435">But, she remained in the Embassy, and they sent out.</span> <span id="s436">By the time the passport reached the border, the Hungarian/German border, I was over already on the other side in Germany.</span> <span id="s437">So that was what.</span> <span id="s438">Let's go back now to the march.</span> <span id="s439">From that little town, from the trenches, we were taken on the death march to Germany, up to the German border.</span> <span id="s440">We were marching forty, fifty miles a day, in the heat, and in the rain, no food, no clothing, no shelter.</span> <span id="s441">We were sleeping around on the edges of the streets, from town to town.</span> <span id="s442">And slowly, slowly, we were getting less and less, because who wouldn't, wasn't able to march, they just shot down.</span> <span id="s443">They left them in the gutters there.</span> <span id="s444">And that was going on for ten days.</span> <span id="s445">No food, no nothing.</span> <span id="s446">When we came to the German border, and we, I forgot the name already.</span> <span id="s447">What is it?</span> <span id="s448">I don't know this.</span></p> <p><span

now.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">SS: Line us up, please, and just get over with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">GB: You lost all...</span></p> <p><span id="s465">SS: We lost all the hope.</span> <span id="s466">We, there was no hope anymore for anything.</span> <span id="s467">We knew, the majority of us were youngsters, that were, our parents were not alive anymore.</span></p> <p><span

before my sister went to the Swedish Embassy, when she came back to the ghetto, those two friends came to the ghetto in German uniform, and made a big commotion in the house, "Everybody out!</span> <span id="s478">Everybody out!</span> <span id="s479">Out!"</span> <span id="s480">But my sister did not know that these are Jewish...</span></p> <p><span id="s481">GB: These were friends.</span></p>

<span id="s490">And Moti says to her, "Ich zich Suri!"</span> <span id="s491">[I am looking for Sarah.]</span> <span id="s492">Then she looked at them and she says, "Oh my God, why couldn't you come one day earlier?"</span> <span id="s493">[weeping] "She is already over the border."</span> <span id="s494">So they picked themselves up and left the house.</span> <span id="s495">And she never saw them again.</span> <span id="s496">A day before the liberation, they found out they were Jews, and they were hung on the [unclear], on trees, [crying] the two of them next to each other.</span> <span

nothing.</span> <span id="s502">So, actually, only a third of us reached that point.</span> <span id="s503">And we reached Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s504">No, we first came to Buchenwald, standing a day in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s505">[tape off then on] A girl from hometown, she was much older, I was a youngster.</span> <span id="s506">She was, she could have been my mother, a much older

able to get to us because they didn't want to have, that we should have contact...</span></p> <p><span id="s534">GB: Contact with anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">SS: With inside that they wouldn't find out what was going on the outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">GB: About what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">SS: But we went through that.</span> <span id="s538">So, once we came through the selection there, somehow, I don't know what their purpose was, but we were three girls--Erika, Ilsa and I--from the whole transport we came from Budapest.</span> <span id="s539">We were the three girls that they left our hair.</span> <span id="s540">We were all, had all long hair, long.</span> <span id="s541">It was pitch black like a tiger, the other one was brunette, and I was a blonde.</span> <span id="s542">We, the three of us had long hair, and they, we didn't understand why they were shaving all the whole transport, and we were the three of us left with the hair.</span> <span id="s543">So I said to my girlfriends, I said, "Listen, we have to get hold of scissors.</span> <span id="s544">Because it's not gonna be good if they have some, if they left us with our long hair, there must be a purpose for it."</span> <span id="s545">So, we managed to get kerchiefs, and tie it around the head, and for the first piece of bread I managed to get a pair of scissors from a inmate, and we cut off our hair, that we wouldn't be, seem different...</span></p> <p><span id="s546">GB: Different.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">SS: Than the rest of them.</span> <span id="s548">Because we knew that Mengele is supposed to come into the camp the following week.</span> <span id="s549">And we were only 16 years old at that time, young, energetic.</span> <span id="s550">And this, I said, "Why would they suddenly choose the black hair, the long hair, and a brunette, and a blonde?"</span> <span id="s551">So we cut off our hair, and we were, there, it wasn't, you know, we weren't working.</span> <span id="s552">And the three of us tried to manage.</span> <span id="s553">We were working in the coal...</span></p> <p><span id="s554">GB: Mines?</span></p>

were bringing the stuff, and we were hurling on the trucks.</span> <span id="s563">And then it was taken down to the ship, and there it was emptied into the ships.</span> <span id="s564">But, we were grateful that, for that at least, because you got already a little bit of warm food, a potato or something, once a day.</span> <span id="s565">So we didn't care, but we were resigned already.</span>

count.</span> <span id="s620">And Mengele used to come in the morning, "You, you, you, you, you, come with me."</span> <span id="s621">And we knew some of them, the younger ones, they were sent into a different place.</span> <span id="s622">The good, in good shape, the youngsters, were taken to a working place.</span> <span id="s623">But it came Christmas night, and they, the Germans got mad and they took out all the Jews, and all the Gypsies, and let us stand for forty-eight hours, not dressed, not food, and nothing, outside.</span> <span id="s624">And they were singing, and they were dancing, and celebrating Christmas.</span> <span id="s625">After Christmas, they took the Gypsy Lager [camp] was emptied completely.</span> <span id="s626">That was the end of the Gypsies.</span> <span id="s627">Mengele came again.</span> <span id="s628">That was January 3rd or something.</span> <span id="s629">And he came and he selected the youngsters.</span> <span id="s630">And we were taken away.</span> <span id="s631">I got so sick in those box wagons.</span> <span id="s632">I never thought I'm gonna be able to make it anymore.</span> <span id="s633">Absolutely not.</span> <span id="s634">I got sick, and I stopped eating.</span> <span id="s635">And I just, I guess I was emotionally completely down.</span> <span id="s636">There was nothing that would hold in me anything.</span> <span id="s637">We were like this for two weeks in those box trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">GB: Boxcars.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">SS: Yeah, boxcars, were for two weeks.</span> <span id="s640">And, we came to Burgau.</span> <span id="s641">That was a tiny little camp, very little camp.</span> <span id="s642">There were, most likely were not more than 500 women in that camp.</span> <span id="s643">They didn't have time any more to arrange any working place of anything.</span> <span id="s644">But when we got out there, somehow my little girlfriend, Ettel, started pushing me, "Suri, you better start getting to yourself.</span> <span id="s645">I don't want to lose you.</span> <span id="s646">I need you!"</span> <span id="s647">She was younger than I was.</span> <span id="s648">"I need you!</span> <span id="s649">I won't make it without you!"</span> <span id="s650">And she started pushing, opening my mouth, with force, and trying to give a little bit of water in my mouth that I would not dehydrate completely, after ten days of no food and nothing.</span> <span id="s651">But, when we got to Burgau, we didn't do anything there, so we sat in the sun all of us.</span> <span id="s652">And I guess the sun slowly, slowly brought out, the warmth brought out a little life in ourselves.</span> <span id="s653">We didn't stay there long, because the allies were coming already.</span> <span id="s654">Then we heard, the first time, that they are evacuating the camps wherever the allies are coming...</span></p> <p><span id="s655">GB: Coming through.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">SS: Forward, heading towards deeper to Bayern [Bavaria].</span> <span id="s657">And on a nice day, after about three weeks in that camp, we were again taken to the boxcars and we were hurled into the boxcars and taken to a third camp.</span> <span id="s658">And that was Türkheim.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">GB: Türkheim.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">SS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s661">That was Türkheim.</span> <span id="s662">We got to Türkheim.</span> <span id="s663">There it was not much time, but there we went out to work on construction.</span> <span id="s664">We had to schlepp big blocks, cement.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">GB: Builders?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">SS: Builders.</span> <span id="s667">They were building some houses for the OTE or something.</span> <span id="s668">I don't know.</span> <span id="s669">Again, the o--well I have, I never was able to figure out what they...</span></p> <p><span id="s670">GB: Was it just busy work?</span> <span id="s671">Did they...</span></p> <p><span id="s672">SS: Busy...</span></p> <p><span id="s673">GB: It was busy work?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">SS: Yeah, no, but I wasn't able to figure out for whom they were working, what...</span></p> <p><span id="s675">GB: Well that's what they were just giving you something to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">SS: Yeah, what the OTE, this O-T-E was [possibly Organisation Todt Einsatzkommando – forced labor construction enterprise].</span> <span id="s677">There was some kind of initials for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">GB: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">SS: For that organization.</span> <span id="s680">I have no idea, never to, well, was able to find out.</span> <span id="s681">And there we stayed, our barracks, I still have some place a picture, underground.</span> <span id="s682">Only the roof...</span></p> <p><span id="s683">GB: Was on top of the ground.</span> <span id="s684">Everything...</span></p> <p><span id="s685">SS: Was on top of the ground.</span> <span id="s686">And inside, in the ground, was a trench, and then on both sides was the soil was piled up, and there where you slept.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">GB: You slept on the ground?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">SS: Yeah, on the ground, you know, where we will be able to go through.</span> <span id="s689">And on the side, and on two sides, the barrack was as big as the, this, well...</span></p> <p><span id="s690">GB: About eight feet.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">SS: Eight feet, yeah, about eight feet.</span> <span id="s692">And there we lived.</span> <span id="s693">But there were already men on the other side of that camp.</span> <span id="s694">And we tried to figure out what do they know.</span> <span id="s695">We came to this camp, we don't know what's going on.</span> <span id="s696">We was left so little.</span> <span id="s697">"What is going on?</span> <span id="s698">Maybe you heard of something."</span> <span id="s699">That was, that's in the Bayern.</span> <span id="s700">So, one of them said, "Listen, just try to do your work.</span> <span id="s701">There is no point of getting into trouble, because here they don't play any jokes.</span> <span id="s702">They just, if you don't obey, take you straight into the forest and you never see anybody again."</span> <span id="s703">So, we were trying to obey but thank God, there we survived, and on April 27th was already gone.</span> <span id="s704">Was already, we were there.</span> <span id="s705">The April 24th they started to evacuate the camp again, because the German, the allies were coming closer.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">GB: Did you hear any guns?</span> <span id="s707">Did you hear any...</span></p> <p><span id="s708">SS: No, no, nothing.</span> <span id="s709">Nothing at all.</span> <span id="s710">And in between I just said, "You thought that the Germans didn't know."</span> <span id="s711">We were taken into town to bring food for the S.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">GB: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">SS: And you want to tell me that they did not know that we were KZ’lers [concentration camp inmates]?</span> <span id="s714">They saw us in our striped clothing.</span> <span id="s715">They saw us in the streets that an S.S. is walking with us, and guarding dogs are walking with us!</span> <span id="s716">We weren't able to move.</span> <span id="s717">We were there only to do the labor.</span> <span id="s718">You want to tell me that they did not know that we were prisoners there?</span> <span id="s719">They did not want to know.</span> <span id="s720">They did not want to even, they looked away.</span> <span id="s721">They turned their heads because they didn't want to see us.</span> <span id="s722">On April 24th, in the morning, they decided they have to evacuate the camp again.</span> <span id="s723">And everybody had to go out.</span> <span id="s724">And they were taking us.</span> <span id="s725">And I was working in the kitchen at that time.</span> <span id="s726">And I looked at their faces.</span> <span id="s727">They was already practically, fathers, on the ground.</span> <span id="s728">There was one father with a son there, so he left his father because he couldn't go anymore.</span> <span id="s729">He was completely emaciated.</span> <span id="s730">There were times that fathers took away a piece of bread from [weeping] their children what was opposite way, because they couldn't control their hunger anymore.</span> <span id="s731">There were times when they were biting the flesh of the dead people!</span> <span id="s732">[crying]</span></p> <p><span id="s733">GB: I'm sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">SS: Because they couldn't control their hunger anymore.</span> <span id="s735">They didn't know that they can survive any more even if they had that food, because that was already poison.</span> <span id="s736">It didn't take long then they were gone, too.</span> <span id="s737">[tape off then on] just couldn't think like a human being.</span> <span id="s738">We were just like a wolf.</span> <span id="s739">You didn't know what to do with yourself.</span> <span id="s740">There was no dignity anymore.</span> <span id="s741">There was nothing left in us anymore.</span> <span id="s742">[crying; pause; tape off then on]--away on the 24th to a place.</span> <span id="s743">And I remained in the camp because we were to be taken the last ones, the group that worked in the kitchen had to go with the kitchen.</span> <span id="s744">And we heard that the allies bombed the train not far away.</span> <span id="s745">And nobody survived there.</span> <span id="s746">So we, at that night, we ran into the forest.</span> <span id="s747">We were about fifteen, twenty people, running to the forest.</span> <span id="s748">And we hid among the brushes in case the Germans come, shooting, in the forest.</span> <span id="s749">So we said, "Listen, it's better than to be shot on sight.</span> <span id="s750">Whatever will happen will happen."</span> <span id="s751">Then we heard at night the shooting and the bombing.</span> <span id="s752">And we stayed in the forest for two days.</span> <span id="s753">The third day it became quiet.</span> <span id="s754">And one of the boys said, "You know some thing, let's go to the outskirts of the forest, because it seems to be very quiet.</span> <span id="s755">We'll see what's going on in the camp."</span> <span id="s756">And he came running back and said, "Let's go out!</span> <span id="s757">Let's go out!</span> <span id="s758">I saw an American tank in the camp!</span> <span id="s759">We were, we are liberated!"</span> <span id="s760">And that was the 28th of April.</span> <span id="s761">We were liberated by a black regiment completely black.</span> <span id="s762">And we were scared of them to tell, we didn't know, we never saw a black person before.</span> <span id="s763">They were giants!</span> <span id="s764">All of them were giants!</span> <span id="s765">We said, "My goodness!</span> <span id="s766">What kind of a people are these?"</span> <span id="s767">Until the captain came.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">GB: Was the captain also black?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">SS: No.</span> <span id="s770">The captain was...</span></p> <p><span id="s771">GB: Was white.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">SS: The captain came, and he said, "Don't be scared.</span> <span id="s773">I'm the captain of the regiment, and this is my regiment.</span> <span id="s774">You can come out.</span> <span id="s775">And let me give you some food."</span> <span id="s776">And so we came out, and we stayed in the barracks about a week.</span> <span id="s777">And then we were taken back to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s778">And then...</span></p> <p><span id="s779">GB: You went back to Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">SS: Right.</span> <span id="s781">And then only the ordeal started.</span> <span id="s782">Going back to Czechoslovakia, I have to tell that, because I don't want to, I don't want anybody to think that there are not decent people.</span> <span id="s783">We came to Czechoslovakia, to Prague.</span> <span id="s784">Walking down on the street are Russian soldiers, a captain.</span> <span id="s785">We were talking mama loshn [Yiddish for mother tongue].</span> <span id="s786">So he heard us talking mama loshn and he came over.</span> <span id="s787">He said, "Kinderlah [children], are you Jewish?"</span></p> <p><span id="s788">GB: The Russian soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">SS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s790">He was a captain.</span> <span id="s791">You know, you can see tall, blonde.</span> <span id="s792">"Are you Jewish?"</span> <span id="s793">So we says, "Yes."</span> <span id="s794">"Where are you coming from?"</span> <span id="s795">So we said, "We've just come from Germany.</span> <span id="s796">We're going home."</span> <span id="s797">"Where are you going home?"</span> <span id="s798">So we said, "We've come from the Carpathians.</span> <span id="s799">We're going home."</span> <span id="s800">So he says, "Kinderlah, don't go home.</span> <span id="s801">Go wherever your eyes carry you.</span> <span id="s802">Don't go home!"</span> <span id="s803">So he says, "Why are you going home?</span> <span id="s804">Do you have anybody in, at home?"</span> <span id="s805">He says, "You don't have anybody at home.</span> <span id="s806">If I would be able to leave my family, I would never go back to Russia."</span> <span id="s807">And that started us on the road to Israel.</span> <span id="s808">We were walking through Europe, at night, from the Russians, from Budapest.</span> <span id="s809">The Russians, to the French, from the French to the English, from the English to the Americans and back to the English, until we reached Marseilles.</span> <span id="s810">And from there we went Aliyah Bet [illegal immigration to Palestine during British Mandate].</span></p> <p><span id="s811">GB: So you were able to...</span></p> <p><span id="s812">SS: Walking.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">GB: Get in.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">SS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">GB: Walking?</span></p> <p><span id="s816">SS: Walking!</span></p> <p><span id="s817">GB: Walking?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">SS: Walking whole Europe!</span> <span id="s819">Walking.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">GB: Walking.</span> <span id="s821">How did you...</span></p> <p><span id="s822">SS: [unclear]...</span></p> <p><span id="s823">GB: Feed yourself?</span> <span id="s824">How did you clothe yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">SS: Well, at that time, at that point already, there were camps established, DP camps.</span> <span id="s826">So, we were able to get in and get a meal.</span> <span id="s827">And then we started to group ourselves.</span> <span id="s828">So we were actually about, our group was about fifteen people and we were trying to get to a point where we're gonna belong to an organization that we would be able to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s829">And then, when we reached Bregenz, in Austria, from there we decided we have to belong to an organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">GB: So what organization did you...</span></p> <p><span id="s831">SS: And we chose, we were from home religious, so we belonged to B'nai Akivah.</span> <span id="s832">And so we made our way slowly, slowly, belonged to a kibbutz here and a kibbutz there.</span> <span id="s833">I have pictures where we were, everywhere, and during, after the war, until we reached Marseilles.</span> <span id="s834">And in Marseilles we went, I got so sick that I went down to 38 kilo.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">GB: A skeleton.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">SS: A skeleton.</span> <span id="s837">They didn't want to take me Aliyah Bet.</span> <span id="s838">But, the family said, "If..."</span></p> <p><span id="s839">GB: Wait, tell me about your sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">SS: Yeah, she went to the Embassy and she said she is not leaving.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">GB: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">SS: No way.</span> <span id="s843">And before, the time came that the Jews had to, were not able to go in the streets because there was, let's say if- Tape two, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s844">GB: Talking about your sister...</span></p> <p><span id="s845">SS: She went back to the Embassy.</span> <span id="s846">And they were pushing and shoving, as I said before, the police on the mountain, the mounted horses...</span></p> <p><span id="s847">GB: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">SS: The horses were trampling over people.</span> <span id="s849">They didn't care.</span> <span id="s850">"You have to leave!</span> <span id="s851">You have to leave!"</span> <span id="s852">And time came that they had to leave because it was the time they weren't able to be in the city.</span> <span id="s853">Whoever was in the city, the Germans shot dead!</span> <span id="s854">They didn't care.</span> <span id="s855">You're in the street, that's it.</span> <span id="s856">That's your fate.</span> <span id="s857">So, she said she doesn't care any more.</span> <span id="s858">She's not budging from that gate.</span> <span id="s859">And they were screaming and crying, "Let us in!</span> <span id="s860">Let us in!"</span> <span id="s861">And apparently, it must have been Wallenberg, because I wasn't there, and, it must have been him, that he opened the gates, and then a stream of people just ran into the gardens.</span> <span id="s862">And there's where she stayed until the war was ended.</span> <span id="s863">I met her in Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">GB: When you went back after you were liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">SS: Back, that's right.</span> <span id="s866">I met her in Budapest, because, oh, when I got to Budapest, first thing, I went where we lived during the ghetto.</span> <span id="s867">And I asked around, and they saw my sister.</span> <span id="s868">So, since she wasn't deported, so they saw her coming and going after the Russians came in.</span> <span id="s869">So they told me that supposedly she is in a, some kind of a organization or club.</span> <span id="s870">And I went looking for her, and I found her there.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">GB: But she's still in...</span></p> <p><span id="s872">SS: Well, she is in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">GB: Oh, she is in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">SS: She is in Israel.</span> <span id="s875">And then my, from my whole family, seven of us returned.</span> <span id="s876">The two sisters from Belgium, she, my sister was hidden in Switzerland with the two children.</span> <span id="s877">They are also survivors, my niece and nephew, because they were in, what's it called [unclear] [tape off then on].</span></p> <p><span id="s878">GB: They were hidden in a convent.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">SS: That's right.</span> <span id="s880">And my they took away my brother-in-law to camp, from Belgium.</span> <span id="s881">She went back for her children into the convent, and she smuggled herself out to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s882">And she was in a camp in Switzerland with her two children.</span> <span id="s883">So she came back.</span> <span id="s884">My single, my other sister from Belgium came back.</span> <span id="s885">The third one never returned and her husband, with the child, from Belgium.</span> <span id="s886">My brother from France was in Auschwitz and in Birkenau, was approximately a year in a bunker, in a what is it called, in a for punishment.</span> <span id="s887">Oh, he went through a lot.</span> <span id="s888">But he came back, thank God.</span> <span id="s889">And my little brother that went away from Budapest...</span></p> <p><span id="s890">GB: That ran away?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">SS: He came back, and the two brothers that they were in the labor camps in Yugoslavia, in, what is it called?</span></p> <p><span id="s892">GB: In the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">SS: No, no, Yugoslavia, in the working, they came back.</span> <span id="s894">So we met in Budapest, and from there we made our way.</span> <span id="s895">We never returned home.</span> <span id="s896">We made our way to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">GB: And how long were you in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">SS: Thirteen years.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">GB: Thirteen years.</span> <span id="s900">And, how did you meet your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">SS: I knew my husband in concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">GB: Oh, you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">SS: I saw him, I--he knew me.</span> <span id="s904">I did not know him.</span> <span id="s905">And, after the war, at the time of liberation, when we came out, when the Americans liberated us, he came out from the forest, too, and we stayed in the same place.</span> <span id="s906">And that's how we...</span></p> <p><span id="s907">GB: And you went to Israel together.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">SS: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">GB: And your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">SS: And I got married in Graz.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">GB: In Graz.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">SS: Graz, and I have two children, give birth to the children in Israel, two daughters.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">GB: And they are...</span></p> <p><span id="s914">SS: And they are?</span></p> <p><span id="s915">GB: They are here with you?</span> <span id="s916">Or...</span></p> <p><span id="s917">SS: Yes, they are here.</span> <span id="s918">One is a..</span> <span id="s919">.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">GB: In Brooklyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">SS: Both of them are married.</span> <span id="s922">One has four children, and is a teacher.</span> <span id="s923">The other one is a social worker.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">GB: And you were able to renew your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s925">SS: You have to.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">GB: Start all over again.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">SS: You have to.</span> <span id="s928">Because otherwise, it would have just broken.</span> <span id="s929">But, there are plenty of times, it took me, a matter of fact I had even a nervous breakdown during the time.</span> <span id="s930">I was very sick, and here already in America, in 1945 I had a nervous breakdown.</span> <span id="s931">It was piling up.</span> <span id="s932">And I couldn't cope with it, and I couldn't talk to anybody.</span> <span id="s933">But, thank God, I got out of it.</span> <span id="s934">And we managed to establish a nice family, and I have lovely two children and grandchildren and I'm living for them, that's all.</span> <span id="s935">I--today, nothing makes me happy, nothing in the world makes me happy, as long as I see my children and grandchildren and they are happy.</span> <span id="s936">I couldn't, materialistic, nothing is important to me,
