Stern.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: When were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: In when or where?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: I actually need both.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: I was born in Budapest in July the 3rd, 1929.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Is that where you grew up?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Can you tell me what was it like growing up in in Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: Well, basically, as the Budapest Jews, we were pretty bad luck, and tragedy or through stories start in March 19, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: I'd like to know a little bit about Budapest when you were a child growing up.</span> <span id="s30">Let me start by asking you about your family.</span> <span id="s31">Can you tell me what did your parents do for a living.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: I was born in a very middle class Jewish family.</span> <span id="s33">My father had a moderate sized department store in Budapest.</span> <span id="s34">He had truly no any financial problems.</span> <span id="s35">I went to the Jewish elementary school, and basically in 1939 I was a nice supposed to go to starting my gymnasium, which is high school, in Hungary and when the classes started.</span> <span id="s36">And numerous classes means that we have a relatively small percentage of Jewish students that are admitted to the high schools.</span> <span id="s37">I believe it was 4 percent of the total of student population.</span> <span id="s38">I'm really not sure about the percentage.</span> <span id="s39">But, yes, in May, I was between those fortunate ones that were admitted to high school and four of us four Jew in class of about 50 started our high school years.</span> <span id="s40">The school which I went to, it happened to be a rather revisionist national and rather anti Semitic school.</span> <span id="s41">And as far as discrimination, certainly it was, but nevertheless, it was tolerated.</span> <span id="s42">They didn't have any, shall I say, outstanding incidence during the years up to 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Can you tell me your parents' names.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: My father's name is Anton, and my mother is Barbara.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Did you have any brothers or sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: No.</span> <span id="s47">I am only child.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: You said that there were incidents that were tolerable, anti Semitic incidents that were tolerable.</span> <span id="s49">Can you be more specific.</span> <span id="s50">What kinds of things did you yourself experience or did you yourself see?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: We were almost constantly in the central of of, I should say, remarks and anti Semitic passions.</span> <span id="s52">But those were kind of rather intelligently, if that is the right expression, and no physical violence, maybe once or twice through the years that I've been in the high school.</span> <span id="s53">And this did not come from the faculty.</span> <span id="s54">It's mostly of peer pressure and anti Semitic peer pressure.</span> <span id="s55">But those incidents become a part of our life.</span> <span id="s56">So, as a matter of fact, we barely noticed them after a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Did you come from a religious family?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: No.</span> <span id="s59">No.</span> <span id="s60">We have always been on the on the reform, quote, unquote, side.</span> <span id="s61">They called us the Yom Kippur Jews, that my parents and myself went to at the Beit Knesset, maybe twice a year.</span> <span id="s62">Nevertheless, I had a very fabulous and big style bar mitzvah.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: Can you tell me about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Well, it was in the in the great Beit Knesset of this and a very large crowd, I would say.</span> <span id="s65">And of course, I knew the Sidra, and there were no any hitches.</span> <span id="s66">And subsequently, it was a rather large reception.</span> <span id="s67">And as a matter of fact, it was in 1942.</span> <span id="s68">And I had no idea that was practically the same time that the Russia ghetto, but sometime after.</span> <span id="s69">It was in Pesach 1942.</span> <span id="s70">And as a matter of fact, that it was after the Nazi conference, and the ____ was already a forced thing.</span> <span id="s71">They didn't know at least we did not realize it.</span> <span id="s72">So our life was relatively not even not even not relatively, but fine, financially, as well as any other area, even socially.</span> <span id="s73">Obviously, our social attachment was almost exclusively Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: So the only traditional observances that you have mentioned that you observed were the bar mitzvah and being a Yom Kippur Jew.</span> <span id="s75">Did you have a kosher home?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: No, we did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Did you observe any of the other holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: Well, especially during the my years in Jewish elementary school, we did.</span> <span id="s79">Nevertheless, our store was open, except in Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s80">And we were rather assimilated Hungarian Jews.</span> <span id="s81">But I have to emphasize, despite the fact that we were assimilated, we were Jews.</span> <span id="s82">It was unquestioned and had never been a question.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: You said your family was not very religious but they sent you to a Jewish school, religious school.</span> <span id="s84">Did they ever explain to you why they did that?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Well, it's probably fact of convenience.</span> <span id="s86">It was close, and there is children that they went to kindergarten together with at the same school.</span> <span id="s87">And I'm sure that my parents were aware of the importance to have some kind of Jewish tradition put in my head at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Do you have any idea of how large the Jewish population was in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Of course.</span> <span id="s90">That is not difficult.</span> <span id="s91">Budapest, at that time, I believe, the population was about a million; and the Jewish population estimated at the time, if I'm not mistaken, 120 or 130,000.</span> <span id="s92">That's the capital of Hungary and obviously in the largest city in the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: When you were growing up, what language or languages did you speak in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Well, we spoke at home exclusively Hungarian.</span> <span id="s95">My parents speak German, and very little of it.</span> <span id="s96">And then during high school, I learned English, but my parents did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: When you were growing up, what did you do for fun when you were not in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Well, as a -- what every young child does, we had a gang of mostly Jewish friends and played around and played around, obviously, and went to movies and sport activities.</span> <span id="s99">We belonged to the a Jewish athletic club.</span> <span id="s100">So we did gymnastics.</span> <span id="s101">We went swimming and some ski, as well as some ice skating in the winter time.</span> <span id="s102">That is nothing the exception.</span> <span id="s103">That was the exactly the same thing that a middle-class Jewish kid does in Europe.</span> <span id="s104">Oh, I had just to emphasize, no one in the family spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s105">I think it's an important point.</span> <span id="s106">As a matter of fact, my grandparents did not speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s107">They spoke German fluently, but none of them spoke Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Did your family have a long history in Budapest?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Well, my recollection, my maternal grandfather was born in a small town close to the Czech Hungarian border, and my other my other grandfather was born in Moravia.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">And subsequently, the family then moved to began to a town which was close to the Czech Hungarian border.</span> <span id="s111">It's called Kom√°rom, which is not far from from Bratislava.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: You were telling me that you were having your bar mitzvah and you were doing all these things like going to movies and sports.</span> <span id="s113">And you had no idea what was going on with Jewish communities in other parts of Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: Well, we were an assimilated Jewish family.</span> <span id="s115">I put it very very bluntly.</span> <span id="s116">We I suppose we did.</span> <span id="s117">Obviously the Jewish laws which the anti Jewish laws which started up in Hungary and we were (?</span> <span id="s118">absolutely?)</span> <span id="s119">and Italy, and up to that with regard to the state of the war and however, the obviously, the extent that horrendous happenings which were not far from us, we did not really realize, except that in the 1940s and 1941, 1942, obviously, first of all, our mere population had gone for paramilitary duties, including, obviously, my father and all the family.</span> <span id="s120">And they were taken most of the time to the Russian front.</span> <span id="s121">And the atrocities regarding the Jewish paramilitary personnel _____+ every day.</span> <span id="s122">And the parents, the friends, the friends of friends, everybody between the ages of 18 to at least at that time, I believe, 48, we have a in the paramilitary units.</span> <span id="s123">And the Hungarian anti Semitism was flourishing.</span> <span id="s124">So it was clear to us what's going on at least within the Hungarian border.</span> <span id="s125">But as far as what's going on, the first realization through the what's happening was when the non Hungarian citizen Jews were deported to come in _____ which was I believe it was in '41, in I think it was in the winter of 1941.</span> <span id="s126">And a few who survived and came back at all had unbelievable stories which was very difficult to realize for us that they are true and they are really reliable information because our life was totally different and we didn't feel this tremendous pressure.</span> <span id="s127">We did feel pressure, but but as individuals, they let they let us at that time to be.</span> <span id="s128">It is true that the Hungarian the Jewish Hungarian professionals are slowly lose their jobs in 1941.</span> <span id="s129">There is a second Jewish law came out, said the practicing professionals lost their licenses, and there was a lot of restrictions.</span> <span id="s130">But as far as personal dangers, so to speak, it was far from us.</span> <span id="s131">In a sense, it was for these delusions, and they said to us that's what's happening across the border.</span> <span id="s132">It cannot happen in Hungary.</span> <span id="s133">After all, we are Hungarian Jews and Hungarians and that that maybe can happen on the east but not in a cultured country like Hungary and the usual hog wash that everyone is basically at least in Hungarian assimilated Jews felt.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Do you recall any talk among the adults that you were rather young among the adults about what was writing and saying and doing vis √† vis the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: But of course.</span> <span id="s136">That's that's obvious.</span> <span id="s137">Again, you see, you have to at that time despite obviously it was clear to us and it was priority of the German not I wouldn't say general journalistic activity because it's a matter of fact that in the 1940 and 1941 it was still sporadic and not totally centrally organized.</span> <span id="s138">But we looked at it in a in a through a pink eyeglasses, that we are out of it, that we cannot it is not the same.</span> <span id="s139">It is it is not and after, I mean, June 1941 when the Russian, the Barbarossa started up, they said, well, it could happen maybe in Russia, but it's never happen in Hungary.</span> <span id="s140">So we were aware of the fact and knew very well, and the the general policy lines were very clear of the Nazi party and Hitler and but but we felt that maybe in a bit we are somehow immune from this.</span> <span id="s141">And of course it's was kind of a of a trying to, so to speak, stay away from the reality.</span> <span id="s142">But it was very difficult later on, obviously, when you find that you your relatives, your father, your friends, in the in the paramilitary and it's and died from typhus or from from tremendous atrocities from the Hungarian _____ and Army personnel.</span> <span id="s143">Obviously we were aware of the fact.</span> <span id="s144">But still the the everyday bourgeois life, so to speak, it's on the we somehow -- I think that was very difficult to the Hungarian Jews that tried to kind of of separate themselves from the reality.</span> <span id="s145">It's really delusional.</span> <span id="s146">That that was the protection.</span> <span id="s147">That was the unseen defense mechanisms, so to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: Did you personally have any contact with anybody who had left had fled from Nazi occupied territory or from Germany itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: Not until 1943.</span> <span id="s150">1943 I had a friend that they were foreign, not Hungarian citizens, and they were _____ and they succeeded to come back to parents of massacre and other family and they came back and back but the first time that that personally I heard that such things could happen.</span> <span id="s151">But it was an isolated incident.</span> <span id="s152">Really.</span> <span id="s153">Subsequently, after that as far as we discussed this problem, she said that it's probably there is a traumatic posttraumatic shock syndrome, the boy doesn't know what the hell he's talking about.</span> <span id="s154">Again, they tried I mean, it's kind of a natural denial type of mannerism, I suppose.</span> <span id="s155">That was it.</span> <span id="s156">But it was the first time that I had personally had some contact with someone who went through hell and back.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Tell me a little about what your days were like in the early '40s.</span> <span id="s158">What was the typical day for you in '41 and '42?</span> <span id="s159">How did things start to change?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Not much, really.</span> <span id="s161">Not much. '</span> <span id="s162">40, '41, '42, as I said I had my bar mitzvah in 1942.</span> <span id="s163">A big tzimmes, everybody happy, a full presence.</span> <span id="s164">And my problems were that in mathematics I got a B instead of an A and that we didn't reach our group in the sport arena didn't do well and there are, you know, no more American films.</span> <span id="s165">Obviously, that was a fact a fact of life.</span> <span id="s166">The German, Italian films were shed, and I mean that was a fact, even na√Øve, and we lived all of us normal student and teenager life.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: When did you start you yourself start noticing that things were changing?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: As I said, in 1943 and in the end of 1942 and '43, then they the close friends and the family started getting involved, and I don't know.</span> <span id="s169">I don't want to sound naive.</span> <span id="s170">But that that's the way that I recollect my my memory.</span> <span id="s171">In any event, in 19 1942 and 1943, the tension began getting high.</span> <span id="s172">And the and the awareness that was living has become more and more obvious for us.</span> <span id="s173">Not talking about, obviously, reading the papers and the German victories and the unstoppable Reich.</span> <span id="s174">It was before Stalingrad, obviously, and before North Africa and Roma, and so forth.</span> <span id="s175">So the whole thing started a lot to be hopeless as far as as a Jewish individual that's in the axis of the _____ Nazi Hungary.</span> <span id="s176">But despite that, still with that, life went on, and no major economic hardships yet.</span> <span id="s177">My father was in the in the that's that's called the work units, but the shop went on, and my life my mother sorry my mother took care of the things, and we still had hope that we had a home.</span> <span id="s178">So the major despite the awareness includes the awareness that everyday life and everyday problems are, no question, the major considerations.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: So when you look back, when was the moment that you began to realize that you were in very serious danger?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: It was a Saturday, and the and myself and my very close friends at school met and walked around the major railway station in Budapest.</span> <span id="s181">That was the northern railway station.</span> <span id="s182">And we saw the first German soldier.</span> <span id="s183">That was a somewhat rainy day.</span> <span id="s184">I recollect that the guys there at the wore a long, black rain coat, and they had a kind of plaque that on their neck, and it turned to be the military German military police.</span> <span id="s185">And that was the day that the Germans had invaded Hungary.</span> <span id="s186">And when we stood by and we looked at this soldiers of police military police persons that are asking papers for everybody is coming out from the railway station and putting people aside in groups, that was really the first moment that it's it's hit home, that we are in real trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: What were some of the things that happened next?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Well, we got home.</span> <span id="s189">And my father was away, of course, in the in the we called it "munkaszolg√°lat" in Hungarian, which is basically forced-labor unit.</span> <span id="s190">And my mother said, "So what do you say?</span> <span id="s191">Did you see them?‚Äù</span> <span id="s192">And he said, "Of course I did see them."</span> <span id="s193">"So?"</span> <span id="s194">"So same thing will happen here that we hear about it in other countries where the Nazis are.‚Äù</span> <span id="s195">Okay.</span> <span id="s196">The things started to escalate very rapidly because the Germans came in in the 19 of March.</span> <span id="s197">And in the beginning of April I believe it was mid April, the 20th of April we already woke up with a yellow star in our chest.</span> <span id="s198">Okay?</span> <span id="s199">That was basically the first decision of the new Hungarian government, that all the Jews have to wear a yellow star.</span> <span id="s200">Still, the schools were open.</span> <span id="s201">So we went to the school with the yellow star on us.</span> <span id="s202">But you know what?</span> <span id="s203">I truly recall that, despite of the heavy anti Semitic atmosphere in the school, nobody said a word, not not just as though nothing happened.</span> <span id="s204">I don't know why.</span> <span id="s205">Maybe it was some kind of a a how should I say?</span> <span id="s206">The consciousness?</span> <span id="s207">I really don't know what was the reason, but we didn't feel that this yellow star is makes any difference in the relationship.</span> <span id="s208">The relationship wasn't good.</span> <span id="s209">I'm not saying.</span> <span id="s210">But certainly it did not influence.</span> <span id="s211">So that was the that was the truly for a teenager the first true and the fact that the _____ that the future is _____+.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">About I think about three or four weeks later, there were massive air bombardment in Budapest, and many buildings were destroyed.</span> <span id="s213">And that was the second thing that I recall that the government they required the Jewish apartments to be evacuated for the casualties, as a matter of fact, those Christians whose homes was destroyed.</span> <span id="s214">So about 2,000 families were kicked out very swiftly from their home.</span> <span id="s215">That was the first one.</span> <span id="s216">And subsequently I believe it was in May that the law came that Jews has to be has to move to certain houses.</span> <span id="s217">There is a clear distinction with the marked houses.</span> <span id="s218">And then, obviously, our life totally crumbled because we had a couple of hours to evacuate our home, which was just I mean, you know, it's very traumatic, obviously, not only for a teenager, but the whole family.</span> <span id="s219">So we practically left almost everything in and a couple of other families which house become a Jewish house were still outside.</span> <span id="s220">That happened in May.</span> <span id="s221">In the meantime, obviously, all the Jewish government employees were kicked out.</span> <span id="s222">All the professionals, they lost their licenses.</span> <span id="s223">And nevertheless, still, I believe until June, the stores the Jews' stores were not nationalized.</span> <span id="s224">That was the time.</span> <span id="s225">I'm not sure about the date.</span> <span id="s226">And then started, shall I say, the news come in that there are ghettos in the country, especially in the northeast part at the beginning as it every day in the the new Jewish laws were printed, placards, and of course in newspapers and so forth.</span> <span id="s227">And the deportations started.</span> <span id="s228">And we were aware of the deportations, obviously.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: When you said new Jewish laws were being you know, were coming out, can you be specific.</span> <span id="s230">Can you give me a few examples of some of these laws that started to come out?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s232">That's no different.</span> <span id="s233">Professional restrictions, subsequently food restrictions, subsequently housing restrictions.</span> <span id="s234">Then some forced labor, especially for women and and male.</span> <span id="s235">So those are they were basically escalating the restrictions which had become more and more and more severe, and you're and your life as an individual was totally and entirely interrupted from every point of view, and on the top of it obviously that you didn't feel yet but you you personally, but you started to notice the problematic the the territories in Hungaria, the countryside, there are ghettos formed.</span> <span id="s236">And the ghettos started to be deported, although they had no idea, as far as I know, not only myself but my family, about Auschwitz, or about the (?</span> <span id="s237">fenishtislagers?)</span> <span id="s238">.</span> <span id="s239">We did not know.</span> <span id="s240">But certainly we did know that these people were taken away as if a packaged or together and all the belongings.</span> <span id="s241">They were rough, and they were violent, and they were in horrible condition.</span> <span id="s242">These people were taken away to the east.</span> <span id="s243">That's what we know.</span> <span id="s244">But we did know.</span> <span id="s245">And so a the tension grew constantly, although, again, we still hoped, at least, or we did not realize or we did not want to realize that the standard of our life is in danger as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: What happened to you next?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: Well, we moved in in a Jewish house.</span> <span id="s248">And then subsequently, I was taken it was in -- I believe it was in June.</span> <span id="s249">I was taken with we've been we've been in Jewish juvenile units.</span> <span id="s250">And that was kind of also kind of a paramilitary business.</span> <span id="s251">It's not paramilitary.</span> <span id="s252">Sorry.</span> <span id="s253">It was nothing to do with military.</span> <span id="s254">Forced-labor plant for business.</span> <span id="s255">So it we were all brought up to collectively go to a a brick factory to work.</span> <span id="s256">I think it was in June.</span> <span id="s257">But I really don't remember exactly.</span> <span id="s258">I think it was end of May, beginning of June.</span> <span id="s259">And we were taken in _____ just a it's basically the _____ the Danube, and it's an old part of outskirts of the city area and in a big factory.</span> <span id="s260">And we worked there, my schoolmates.</span> <span id="s261">We were basically together, and we we it was a 24 hour business.</span> <span id="s262">We didn't get home at all.</span> <span id="s263">So we stayed there around the clock.</span> <span id="s264">It's just like a truly, like a working, like, so to speak.</span> <span id="s265">The whole thing was like closed, and there was German armory around and, in fact, in the brick factory.</span> <span id="s266">The food wasn't too bad and the physically, we were not not insulted.</span> <span id="s267">We were not.</span> <span id="s268">We just had to work, basically.</span> <span id="s269">It was a no special hardship.</span> <span id="s270">Of course, we still had the yellow star.</span> <span id="s271">And as a matter of fact, that yellow star at that time we had to wear a patch, a yellow pass a yellow</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: Armband?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: armband thank you a yellow armband.</span> <span id="s274">And we worked and working about ten hours, with one hour dinner a lunch break, and then in a large barrack we slept.</span> <span id="s275">And in the morning at 6:00 o'clock, we started up again.</span> <span id="s276">So that was that was the thing.</span> <span id="s277">But I very, very rarely remember is that at the brick factory had its own rail station.</span> <span id="s278">It's not rail the rail, because the bricks were transported by rail.</span> <span id="s279">And and they there were large, huge wagons brought in to the brick factory railway.</span> <span id="s280">And we looked at them and we found there are and the and the some have German _____+ in this car.</span> <span id="s281">And this car this railway branch was under the command of the German Hungarian German armory.</span> <span id="s282">And they were they were occasionally they rather friendly.</span> <span id="s283">And we asked them, "What's going on here?"</span> <span id="s284">And they said, "Oh, yours your turn will come very soon too."</span> <span id="s285">So I think that we didn't need too much imagination to know that probably those were the deportation wagons.</span> <span id="s286">That's what I remember very vividly.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: We're going to pause, and I'll change tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: This is Tape 1, Side B. We're interviewing Yehuda Adam.</span> <span id="s289">And you were telling me about working in the brick factory.</span> <span id="s290">I wanted to ask you what exactly was your job in the brick factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: Oh, I cleaned the the place.</span> <span id="s292">That's basically what I did all day long.</span> <span id="s293">And it was a a I'm looking for the word.</span> <span id="s294">What do you use to clean the floor?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: A broom?</span> <span id="s296">A mop?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: A broom.</span> <span id="s298">That's right.</span> <span id="s299">A broom.</span> <span id="s300">As a matter of fact, it's a coarse broom that I had to keep the whole place clean.</span> <span id="s301">We went two of us.</span> <span id="s302">We did cleaning jobs.</span> <span id="s303">That's what was my job.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: You mentioned that you were in a barrack.</span> <span id="s305">I would like to ask you what were the living conditions in the barrack and also in the yellow star houses.</span> <span id="s306">You didn't tell me what the conditions for living were.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: Well, first, the in the brick factory, there was a huge the brick has to be dried, and there is large huts, and on these huts when there were perches, they the wood pads primitive wood pads, and that's basically it.</span> <span id="s308">We had to covers, and that's it.</span> <span id="s309">That was the situation of that.</span> <span id="s310">As far as the the recorded that the houses with the yellow star, it's depends.</span> <span id="s311">There have been families together, and in the most of them, the living conditions were not not atrocious.</span> <span id="s312">It was crowded, obviously, and cramped.</span> <span id="s313">But it was really what I mean is you left behind your belongings, your life achievements, everything else.</span> <span id="s314">It was obviously very difficult, mostly emotionally, but physically it wasn't too bad.</span> <span id="s315">A family had one room instead of four or five, six, or seven.</span> <span id="s316">And they shared facilities, obviously.</span> <span id="s317">But in most instances and I'm talking about people that I know and they were middle class people they had enough.</span> <span id="s318">The food was still although scarce, but certainly didn't it wasn't hunger.</span> <span id="s319">There were restricted hours that you can get out and buy food on your food cards, obviously, which provided you I don't remember as far as the calories or I think no.</span> <span id="s320">I don't want to think because I don't know, really, if it was 1,200 or 1,500.</span> <span id="s321">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s322">I really don't remember the details.</span> <span id="s323">But nevertheless, we had enough.</span> <span id="s324">It happened to be that we moved into a friend's house that had a large grocery chain.</span> <span id="s325">So, I mean, there was no no problem as far as we are concerned.</span> <span id="s326">And a crowded conditions but but livable at that time for us.</span> <span id="s327">So I can't talk about really how the population, Jewish population at large.</span> <span id="s328">Probably they were but I I believe the same thing happened with my vast family.</span> <span id="s329">Until they were in the in the yellow star houses, they were pretty well off.</span> <span id="s330">They were and in a Jewish community and you know how it is.</span> <span id="s331">I think one helps the other, especially in hard times.</span> <span id="s332">It was not too bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: So you were working in the brick factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Right.</span> <span id="s335">Right.</span> <span id="s336">And if I remember correctly, in July, certain part of July I think it was on the 15th or 20th or 25th there was an unsuccessful putsch against party, against the regime at the at the Nazi party the Hungarian Nazi party, which is the Arrow Cross party started to do a putsch.</span> <span id="s337">And there have been a very strict military rules in the in the capital, in Budapest.</span> <span id="s338">And the streets were full with soldiers, and they dug in with heavy artillery and so forth and so on.</span> <span id="s339">And we were ourself and a friend of mine decided that's enough for us, we are going and taking off.</span> <span id="s340">And that's what we did.</span> <span id="s341">We we got through the the partitions and went home.</span> <span id="s342">And we said that's we had to know what's happened with our mothers and and so we escaped and to putting it very mildly, very simply.</span> <span id="s343">So we got home and, well okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: I'm going to ask you, when you walked out, nobody tried to stop you?</span> <span id="s345">Even on your way home, how did you make your way home?</span> <span id="s346">I'd like you to explain how you did this.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: There was a great confusion because of the political situation.</span> <span id="s348">So everybody was busy, especially the the current local German army and so forth.</span> <span id="s349">So in the late evening hours, we took ourselves, and we climbed through the the partition and walked home.</span> <span id="s350">It was about a four hour walk or five and a half hour walk from the brick factory to the middle of the city.</span> <span id="s351">We left.</span> <span id="s352">And and we got home, period.</span> <span id="s353">And my mother was, obviously, extremely happy.</span> <span id="s354">And subsequently, she had the second thoughts of "What will happened?</span> <span id="s355">They will catch you."</span> <span id="s356">No matter nobody looked after me.</span> <span id="s357">That that's the the following week or two weeks, they were so tremendously tense politically that nobody gave a damn that a young Jewish boy escaped.</span> <span id="s358">As a matter of fact, I believe that the most of the of the came from the from the brick factory did the same thing, although I cannot be sure, but certainly we did.</span> <span id="s359">And and simply, we were rather fortunate.</span> <span id="s360">The fact is that they knew the addresses.</span> <span id="s361">If they wanted probably to go after us at that time, they were able to know no problem for them.</span> <span id="s362">But apparently nobody did.</span> <span id="s363">And at the question become whether or not Hungary is jumping out from the war, and there was big changes in the government.</span> <span id="s364">So this was a kind of a period that those who were at least in the capital city, they were a little bit freer to move around than obviously those who were in the forced battalions in the Russian front.</span> <span id="s365">They could not do that.</span> <span id="s366">But we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: So tell me what you did next.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Well, obviously, there were no school, as you know.</span> <span id="s369">That was finished.</span> <span id="s370">And and what happened next is that it was in July.</span> <span id="s371">And in July, a Swedish diplomat arrived to Budapest.</span> <span id="s372">His name, I think, is very well known.</span> <span id="s373">And his first name is Raoul.</span> <span id="s374">And what happened is that my uncle happened to be an in person in Hungary.</span> <span id="s375">He was a physician.</span> <span id="s376">And whoever was a physician, and his daughter as a matter of fact, his adopted daughter speaks Swedish and started to work for Wallenberg.</span> <span id="s377">And due to this family connection, my mother started to do a little work over over there, mostly started to kind of a a how should I put it?</span> <span id="s378">A messenger, taking messages and takes Schutz Pass because the Schutz Pass business started up in about September already, and she was busy then.</span> <span id="s379">She helped.</span> <span id="s380">And and the thing is did not change much.</span> <span id="s381">Nevertheless, I think I have a bit of a blank for the happening in August and part of September.</span> <span id="s382">I really do not recollect anything of significance.</span> <span id="s383">I did my mother my father was away, obviously.</span> <span id="s384">My mother was busy.</span> <span id="s385">And I really don't recall exactly what happened.</span> <span id="s386">And this is a a kind of a blind spot in my memory.</span> <span id="s387">I do not remember what did I really do, if if any.</span> <span id="s388">I helped my mother.</span> <span id="s389">I do remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: What's the next thing you do remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: Well, the next thing which I do remember, very vividly remember, it was the 15th of October.</span> <span id="s392">That's what happened.</span> <span id="s393">On the 14th of October, there was a proclamation in Hungarian radio in which the governor, Horthy, declared that that Hungary is jumping out of the war.</span> <span id="s394">So that was the tremendous jubilation, obviously.</span> <span id="s395">We were still on the same Jewish yellow star house that I already described.</span> <span id="s396">Though we were exceedingly happy that, my goodness, that's the end of the story, after all.</span> <span id="s397">The Russians got in the Hungarian border.</span> <span id="s398">They are progressing beautifully.</span> <span id="s399">And this is really now that half after Romania Romania wanted to jump out of the war and Italy, obviously.</span> <span id="s400">So that was in 1990 in 1944, October.</span> <span id="s401">So we thought that maybe we we will be able to salvage ourselves in the meantime.</span> <span id="s402">The the they through the Swedish embassy, we knew that the SS left the country, basically.</span> <span id="s403">There was special SS dealing with Jewish things.</span> <span id="s404">So we thought that's the end of the story.</span> <span id="s405">And then on the 15th, which there was next morning, we look out in the window, and we saw the trucks for this the Hungarian Nazis with the Arrow Cross part in the automobiles with full regalia and the German I don't really know the realm of the SS, but I know that the presence become very heavy in the area that we lived.</span> <span id="s406">And that that was the turning point, obviously, which, as you know, for the Budapest Jews, because the Hungarian Jews the rest of the Hungarian Jews crossed the 700,000 already was killed in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s407">But still at that time we didn't still, at that time we didn't know really about about Auschwitz whatsoever.</span> <span id="s408">No.</span> <span id="s409">We did know deportation, but Auschwitz, that there were rumors going around.</span> <span id="s410">But truly so that was in in October.</span> <span id="s411">And then the all the women and the all the males were ordered to one of the one of the large assembly places.</span> <span id="s412">And they then the march started.</span> <span id="s413">As you know, the fact being that there were no possibility already to deport from the from the capital.</span> <span id="s414">The fact is that the Russians already closed over all the roads to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s415">So it was after October, there was no way that the deportation could be.</span> <span id="s416">The the Budapest Jews deportation couldn't be done because the roads are already fortunately not the Red Army that occupied them already.</span> <span id="s417">So that time I about two weeks later, a proclamation from the from the Arrow Cross party and the Parliament came that you have to move in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s418">They established a ghetto.</span> <span id="s419">I believe it was in in the first week of November, if I am not mistaken.</span> <span id="s420">But, nevertheless, we were very, very fortunate because we moved into international ghetto, which is basically the protected houses.</span> <span id="s421">We had Schutz Passes from the from the Swedish government, the fact being that probably decent connections I would think that, because as a matter of fact, my wife and uncle is in Stockholm, but I don't know how much would that affect us, because I didn't know my wife at the time.</span> <span id="s422">She was only ten years old.</span> <span id="s423">So anyway, at I made it too complicated.</span> <span id="s424">They had Schutz Passes.</span> <span id="s425">As a reason as a result of the Schutz Passes, we may have been protected in the house, the Swedish house, which was they were around the city.</span> <span id="s426">There were a couple of houses.</span> <span id="s427">I believe there were around eight or ten center houses where the Swedish Schutz Pass bearers could move in.</span> <span id="s428">And I mean, you have half a room, but nevertheless, you had some kind of protection.</span> <span id="s429">So my father was at the time in in the forced arm forced camp in Szolnok, which is about, I would say, 80 miles from Budapest.</span> <span id="s430">And somehow, through the grapevine, we heard that they are going to transfer them through, and supposed to taking them to Germany.</span> <span id="s431">So I, being the head of the the family at that time, obviously.</span> <span id="s432">So I I took off my yellow star, and I went out to the railway station that generally the transport is going through.</span> <span id="s433">I think it was about three or four days after my first visit there, indeed, they the train arrived.</span> <span id="s434">I didn't know at that time that my father was on this train or not.</span> <span id="s435">But suddenly, Wallenberg appeared, his people at least three other people.</span> <span id="s436">And suddenly, I saw my father coming out of the railway station.</span> <span id="s437">And said, "What's going on?"</span> <span id="s438">Said, "Well, had Schutz Pass, and they let me off the train."</span> <span id="s439">So we, without any major incidents, were protected in the Swedish house.</span> <span id="s440">All right.</span> <span id="s441">The things were more or less, besides the fact that obviously tension was tremendous and the ghetto had horrible problems, the _____+ the hunger or the or the only three months was the ghetto.</span> <span id="s442">But still, over 120 or 130,000 people were pushed in less than a square mile to a square area.</span> <span id="s443">The situation was horrible.</span> <span id="s444">And we were much better off because we lived in a protected house, and we had a half a room for ourselves, and water was running.</span> <span id="s445">And as a matter of fact, the telephone was working still in the building.</span> <span id="s446">And I do remember very, very, very clearly that it was Christmas morning that the first Russian show arrived to our neighborhood.</span> <span id="s447">That was a tremendous turn.</span> <span id="s448">Budapest was already surrounded.</span> <span id="s449">And they started, basically, the last stage of the of the Red Army.</span> <span id="s450">The front moved closer and closer and closer.</span> <span id="s451">And as the front moved closer and closer and closer, the the Arrow Cross people become more and more wide, and unbelievable atrocities happened.</span> <span id="s452">And as a matter of fact, one of the Swedish houses it was, I believe, in December that tenants were taken out to the Danube, and they were shot and at the Danube, and nobody stayed alive and maybe they probably all maybe one or two persons out of the house which was over 350 people.</span> <span id="s453">So we knew that, of course, we were fine.</span> <span id="s454">Through the consulate _____+.</span> <span id="s455">So we arrived on the 28th of December.</span> <span id="s456">On the 28th of December, suddenly broke the door of the house, and the Arrow Cross appeared, and everybody down from the apartments.</span> <span id="s457">And and it was the very similar procedure that happened in the other houses which were taken and executed.</span> <span id="s458">Okay?</span> <span id="s459">And it happened to be that my uncle was a lawyer, and as a lawyer, he had a big mouth, and the big mouth he was staying the responsible person for the whole bloody house.</span> <span id="s460">He was the he was the kind of supervisor of the house, if you want to.</span> <span id="s461">So this story, by the way, is written down very well in one of Wallenberg's book.</span> <span id="s462">It's by name, and it's it's very well documented.</span> <span id="s463">So I am just now quoting, as a matter of fact, from the book, telling of what happened.</span> <span id="s464">Basically what happened was there was a one working telephone, and my dear uncle called the consulate, which was in a different part of the city.</span> <span id="s465">And for some unbelievable luck, Wallenberg just happened to be in the consulate in this in a certain location.</span> <span id="s466">So we went down to the -- it's I'm not sure that you know how is the major European houses.</span> <span id="s467">They have a central kind of a a they have a square sorry.</span> <span id="s468">They have a square and in the middle there is a</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: A courtyard?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: a courtyard.</span> <span id="s471">Yeah, it's a closed courtyard.</span> <span id="s472">So we went there, and and we started to move out.</span> <span id="s473">And suddenly, there are our savior arrived Wallenberg and somehow I don't know exactly how the Nazis disappeared suddenly.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Who else was with you in this long but protected house?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Then my father, mother, and my uncle and aunt.</span> <span id="s476">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Who are the other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: The other people?</span> <span id="s479">They are random.</span> <span id="s480">I didn't really we didn't know them before.</span> <span id="s481">Random Jews.</span> <span id="s482">As a matter of fact, I am terribly sorry.</span> <span id="s483">My grandfather and grandmother maternal grandmother and grandfather besides us too.</span> <span id="s484">Yeah, the rest, they were Jews.</span> <span id="s485">I really cannot give you any detailed information because I simply don't know.</span> <span id="s486">They were they were like us.</span> <span id="s487">All of us for some reason or another or because they did have some relatives in Sweden and those who were just randomly selected and happened to have a Schutz Pass.</span> <span id="s488">They were there.</span> <span id="s489">Nothing exceptional, really simple, mostly middle class Jewish families.</span> <span id="s490">So making the long story short, the Arrow Cross gone.</span> <span id="s491">And Wallenberg, as a matter of fact, arranged that the Wehrmacht soldiers stood in front of the house for the next three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: Did you have any other contact, you personally, with Wallenberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: So twice.</span> <span id="s494">I had the two opportunity to see him in action.</span> <span id="s495">One was when my father was released, and the second when my skin was kind of a hot situation.</span> <span id="s496">Those are the two.</span> <span id="s497">I didn't my mother met him much more because of her her volunteer work on the on the it's not the consulate.</span> <span id="s498">It was physically a makeshift office that that they are manufactured the Schutz Passes.</span> <span id="s499">And that's that's it.</span> <span id="s500">And Wallenberg was always on the road and always moving, and death march, and just a historic fact that I don't have to tell you.</span> <span id="s501">It's he pulled out the people from the death marches, supplied food as much as possible.</span> <span id="s502">And he was an absolute marvel and and probably the heroes of hero, that someone who lived this can understand that what this what did this guy did.</span> <span id="s503">But, anyway, subsequently, the front moved in and closer and closer.</span> <span id="s504">And at 10:15 on January 15, I saw the first Soviet soldier, you know, in the street.</span> <span id="s505">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: Can you tell me about the change in control of Budapest.</span> <span id="s507">Was there much fighting in your immediate area that you witnessed?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s509">Well, it was it was a fierce fight.</span> <span id="s510">Yes, it was in the middle of the it was not far from the opera house that our house was in, and I was _____+ living in, and it was through house to house, and fine.</span> <span id="s511">No question about that.</span> <span id="s512">And my mother almost got a heart attack when I didn't go down to the cellar and and witnessed really the this house to house, almost had come in, and it's a yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: Can you tell me about your moment of liberation when you realized you were free.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: That's that's I cannot describe.</span> <span id="s515">That's true.</span> <span id="s516">It's such a moment that first Red soldier came in and I was just looking into the window, and I thought that that's that's basically it.</span> <span id="s517">The utmost pleasure in the world.</span> <span id="s518">As a matter of fact, the Red Army soldiers came into the building and then down to the cellar, and there were a couple of people to move.</span> <span id="s519">They got them in the hands and brought them up, and we found in between them a nice Jewish major.</span> <span id="s520">And he spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s521">I didn't.</span> <span id="s522">But there were a good many people in the buildings spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s523">And that's the end of the story.</span> <span id="s524">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: What did you do in your first moments and days of freedom?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: Well, that's it's a fact that our house was liberated, but the next house not yet liberated.</span> <span id="s527">I mean, they went house to house.</span> <span id="s528">And so the first 24 hours we were happy that alive, there was one part that constant bombardment.</span> <span id="s529">I mean, that was the front of clashes of two huge armies, and the red Army and still the Germans didn't move over to the other side to the border side of the Danube to the the left bank of the Danube.</span> <span id="s530">It happened only three days later that they they exploded and they they bombed took care of the bridges okay before they after they moved over.</span> <span id="s531">So it was a very fluid situation.</span> <span id="s532">We didn't know maybe that the front was moving back or forth.</span> <span id="s533">But 24 hours later, it become very clear that everything is.</span> <span id="s534">So I ventured outside and looked a bit around, and it was on the 20th of January that I really went free and looked around.</span> <span id="s535">And that is a one of the major squares of Budapest is called the Opera Square.</span> <span id="s536">We lived very close to that.</span> <span id="s537">I found two Nazis hanging on the lamp post, not much left from them, I must tell you, because everybody had moved around and spitted on them and so forth.</span> <span id="s538">It turned out to be that one was a German armory lieutenant colonel who killed the the forced labor Jewish forced-labor (?</span> <span id="s539">Simbor?)</span> <span id="s540">in Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s541">The other one was called (?</span> <span id="s542">Zeldin?)</span> <span id="s543">that this guy did a massacre in the also in the Yugoslavia area, and they caught both of them, and they hanged him straight up from the lamp post.</span> <span id="s544">It's a beautiful sight.</span> <span id="s545">What else happened?</span> <span id="s546">Subsequently, we looked around and to see what happened with our apartment.</span> <span id="s547">Of course, needless to say, that there are department stores totally from the _____ that was the building is gone even.</span> <span id="s548">Everything.</span> <span id="s549">Zilch, zero, nothing.</span> <span id="s550">But our apartment is stand.</span> <span id="s551">So we moved back to the apartment and started a new life.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: During the time that things had already gotten really bad for the Jews and where you thought the war might pass you by and yet it didn't, during that time, did you witness any beatings or executions of Jews at the hands of either the (?</span> <span id="s553">gen dorms?)</span> <span id="s554">or the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: No, not personally, no, I did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: Did you witness</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: That some beating, yes.</span> <span id="s558">But it was not but nothing more than that.</span> <span id="s559">A slap in the face or a that's but those things were commonplace then.</span> <span id="s560">But I never saw anybody executed in front of me, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: And after the Soviets had gone through, did you see any beatings or any executions of people who had been collaborators?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: I told you about the still no, I did not.</span> <span id="s563">Really not.</span> <span id="s564">A couple of of them again severe beatings, yes, but nothing more than that.</span> <span id="s565">And we looked around at the big synagogue and the Budapest, and the corpses were in like logs, one on the other.</span> <span id="s566">And and the ghetto situation was really incredible.</span> <span id="s567">Incredible.</span> <span id="s568">And they and and by and large, the euphoria after all this happening that you stayed alive were tremendous, that it blinded you completely.</span> <span id="s569">I mean I am alive.</span> <span id="s570">I am alive.</span> <span id="s571">This is this is just so happening which un-explaining, it's a miracle, and it did really.</span> <span id="s572">It's it it's just a by coincidence that you stayed alive and at least in the last four months of the war.</span> <span id="s573">So we looked everything in an optimistic eye, truly.</span> <span id="s574">And, hell, who cares?</span> <span id="s575">We are free.</span> <span id="s576">I mean, it's it's such an incredible feeling.</span> <span id="s577">It's such an undescribable.</span> <span id="s578">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: When did you come to realize what had happened to the Jews that had been deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: Very soon.</span> <span id="s581">Very soon.</span> <span id="s582">Basically, I believe, in the second week of the heavy we were liberated, that the news started to become clear.</span> <span id="s583">I mean, as a matter of fact, the first time our reaction been, naturally, not believing.</span> <span id="s584">I mean, it was such the I think that the secret of this happening that just so unbelievable that the Germans really couldn't these atrocities were such that they literally hid them.</span> <span id="s585">Imagination -- and can‚Äôt cope with it.</span> <span id="s586">So therefore they really were to do this.</span> <span id="s587">I mean, we truly it took us to digest this thing a long time.</span> <span id="s588">But about a week after we'd been liberated, we already started to hear about Auschwitz and Treblinka and Belzec, Majdanek, but mostly Auschwitz, and the reason being that the Hungarian Jews went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s589">Okay?</span> <span id="s590">So if you just think a minute and you say that the first trains left Hungary to Auschwitz in May the 15th, the last trains before Horthy stopped deportation and July the 10th, those are already the last two trains to take one.</span> <span id="s591">Roughly 750,000 Hungarian Jews were exterminated.</span> <span id="s592">The fact is that there were no selection for the Hungarian Jews back then.</span> <span id="s593">So it's it's such an incredible thing that I am I it's hard to hard to believe that I am I have difficulties really to digest it today, 50 years later, about that time.</span> <span id="s594">It's incredible.</span> <span id="s595">And then, obviously, that, you know, the press started up very soon, because the other part of Hungary was already liberated.</span> <span id="s596">So the press is moved with the Red Army until got the information.</span> <span id="s597">I mean I'm sure you know the (?</span> <span id="s598">Castner?)</span> <span id="s599">business and all these things that that it was clear to them from the very moment from the Hungarian Jews' fate.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: I'm going to pause now and change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">End of File One</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Beginning File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: This is Tape 2, Side A.</span> <span id="s604">We are interviewing Yehuda Adam.</span> <span id="s605">And I wanted to ask you if there is anything that has come to your mind that you would like to add that you haven't already told me about your time during the war, and then just reflect back.</span> <span id="s606">Is there anything you have forgotten to tell me?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: One of the most amazing thing which, if I look back, is that every other country in I'm talking about occupied countries, being France, being Belgium, being Holland, being in eastern countries, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Russia, they took about four years to accomplish the Judenrein policy of the like, and Hungary it took less than three months to annihilate about 85 percent of the Jewish population.</span> <span id="s608">They say that's because Eichmann had become very experienced and things ran very smoothly.</span> <span id="s609">Nevertheless, I think that that's a reflection to the Hungarians.</span> <span id="s610">I do believe that the Hungarians not only cooperated but basically they've been the ones that caused this Holocaust in Hungary.</span> <span id="s611">And I I I, personally, if I hear a Hungarian speak, I am taking a U turn.</span> <span id="s612">It's hard to avoid them.</span> <span id="s613">I think that they are absolutely a very high percentage of the population actively participated with pleasure in the annihilation of the Hungarian Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: Did you lose any members of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: Well, of course.</span> <span id="s616">Is there anybody who didn't?</span> <span id="s617">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: Can you tell me how you found out about what happened to those relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: Well, my my people that died, they died in the in the forced labor camps.</span> <span id="s620">Okay?</span> <span id="s621">My uncles, my my father's brothers.</span> <span id="s622">And fortunately enough, the immediate family, meaning my parents and stayed alive, fortunately, and nothing happened to them.</span> <span id="s623">But but I think that our family may be an isolated incident.</span> <span id="s624">I don't believe that practically one Hungarian Jewish family had no losses.</span> <span id="s625">I do not.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: How long did you stay in Hungary after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: Well, we liberated.</span> <span id="s628">And I finished my high school in Hungary.</span> <span id="s629">And a year thereafter, we left illegally to Israel, and we arrived in Israel in early 1949.</span> <span id="s630">I immediately went to the Army.</span> <span id="s631">And those were the last years of the liberation.</span> <span id="s632">And then immediately went up to Jerusalem and started my studies in the Hebrew University, Hadassah medical school.</span> <span id="s633">I worked through medical school, finished my studies in 1956.</span> <span id="s634">Then did my internship at the University Hospital in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s635">Then I was a year in government service because this was the year of the big Aliyah in Israel that was mostly from the Arab countries.</span> <span id="s636">There was an influx of Jewish population.</span> <span id="s637">Then I finished my year in the Negev Desert, started my residency in Rambam, which is a large government hospital in Haifa.</span> <span id="s638">In 1962 came to the States to finish my residency.</span> <span id="s639">I did my residency in New York City in surgery at Albert Einstein college of medicine, and I finished, and I got my fellowship at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.</span> <span id="s640">And in 1969 I went back to Albert Einstein on the staff as a young assistant professor doing surgical oncology.</span> <span id="s641">In 1972 I was invited as a chief of surgery one of the University Hospitals in Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s642">So obviously I returned to Israel.</span> <span id="s643">And I served ten years as the chief of surgery.</span> <span id="s644">And in 1982, I came out of my sabbatical, spent a year of my sabbatical in Baltimore, and then I was offered a position as associate professor at UCSD, which is University of California, San Diego.</span> <span id="s645">My mother became ill and, unfortunately, passed away, and therefore, being their only son, I had to go to return to Israel, and then subsequently we came back.</span> <span id="s646">And I am working and developed a medical group cancer group and teaching at Georgetown University.</span> <span id="s647">Hopefully, next year, retiring and going home.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: And home is?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: Tel Aviv.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: You mentioned your wife.</span> <span id="s651">She's also a survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: Yes, she is.</span> <span id="s653">She is a younger generation, of course.</span> <span id="s654">I don't know when she was born, of course.</span> <span id="s655">But she is also from Budapest.</span> <span id="s656">And she experienced the ghetto, and she was liberated in about two days later, I believe, than we are.</span> <span id="s657">We and the family of her the immediate family is stay together.</span> <span id="s658">And nevertheless, the rest of the family who were outside of Budapest, they were practically all deported to Auschwitz and did not return.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: Is there anything you'd like to add before we conclude?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: I am very happy to talk and do this interview, I tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s662">This concludes the interview today.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">End of File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
