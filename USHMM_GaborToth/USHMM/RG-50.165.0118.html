and even before.</span> <span id="s53">I was kind of open to the idea as a teenager, but I didn’t really believe in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">WH: What makes you Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">FT: I’m culturally and intellectually Jewish.</span> <span id="s56">I know more about Jewish history and culture than the average person.</span> <span id="s57">Certainly more than the average religious Jew who will know more about the halacha and the Talmud.</span> <span id="s58">This is my link.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">WH: How about emotionally?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">FT: Very much so.</span> <span id="s61">It is my group, my clan.</span> <span id="s62">I have no choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">WH: But you do have a choice.</span> <span id="s64">You could change.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">FT: Well, since religion was never a real part of it, I would not pick Christianity or Buddhism or Islam because I don’t believe in that either.</span> <span id="s66">I identify in the sense that most of my paintings are on Jewish themes.</span> <span id="s67">We keep a kosher house for the sake of Rebecca’s family.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">WH: Will you give your child any sort of Jewish education when he is older?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">FT: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s70">Let him have that part of a Jewish education which I did not have so he can make him up his own mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">WH: What helped you survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">FT: I think I did one thing in particular and I owe it to my father---that my head was in good working order.</span> <span id="s73">I knew who I was, what I was, what the German’s were trying to do to me, and that there were certain things I could do and could not do.</span> <span id="s74">I understood the value system by which I lived and that Nazism would perish by its own weight.</span> <span id="s75">In my darkest moments in Auschwitz I thought, maybe I will not make it, but Nazism is doomed.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">WH: Where did you meet your first wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">FT: In Prague.</span> <span id="s78">She was literally the girl from down the street.</span> <span id="s79">We met in 1940, just before I went to camp.</span> <span id="s80">She was in Terezin and in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s81">After the war we married.</span> <span id="s82">She was badly maimed emotionally and physically.</span> <span id="s83">She died of cancer.</span> <span id="s84">She also was manic-depressive.</span> <span id="s85">We divorced in the 1970’s because in her manic phase she tried to kill me several times and once nearly succeeded.</span> <span id="s86">She was hospitalized fourteen times.</span> <span id="s87">Eventually lithium helped somewhat.</span> <span id="s88">She couldn’t have children.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">WH: I guess you really loved her to keep the relationship going through all that turmoil.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">FT: Yes, yes, but eventually I saw it couldn’t go on like that.</span> <span id="s91">She died soon after we divorced; she had neglected the cancer.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">WH: When did you come here?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">FT: In 1952.</span> <span id="s94">It took seven years to get a visa.</span> <span id="s95">At first we stayed in the Hotel Paris on 97th Street for a very short time until we found a top floor penthouse at 838 West End Avenue.</span> <span id="s96">We stayed there about two years.</span> <span id="s97">The rent was about $80.00 a month.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">WH: What type of work did you do at first?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">FT: I was a production expediter for a vacuum cleaner company.</span> <span id="s100">Then I worked in a place that produced religious art for Catholics.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">WH: Did you become friends with survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">FT: We stayed away from survivors.</span> <span id="s103">There are two kinds of survivors---the ones who never got out of the camps and the ones who got away from the camps.</span> <span id="s104">I think I’m one of those who got away.</span> <span id="s105">The first group only talked about the camps---what happened to whom; who was where.</span> <span id="s106">I feel that’s living backwards rather than forwards.</span> <span id="s107">Our survivor friends didn’t focus on the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">WH: How would you feel about that when compared to the idea of zachor?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">FT: I’m very much involved in that.</span> <span id="s110">Yesterday I was out in Jackson Heights, Queens, talking to a group of school children.</span> <span id="s111">But I’m slowly stopping it because it wipes me out emotionally.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">WH: What do you think of the survivor organizations, like the one that meets at Madison Square Garden?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">FT: That’s a “Group Number One”.</span> <span id="s114">They’re professional survivors.</span> <span id="s115">I think they do some good.</span> <span id="s116">That’s their way of handling it.</span> <span id="s117">It’s not my way.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">WH: Are your politics liberal?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">FT: Definitely.</span> <span id="s120">I vote Democratic.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">WH: Does that fact that Rebecca’s parents are survivors make it easier for you to relate to her?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">FT: It certainly makes it easier.</span> <span id="s123">In fact, she’s pushing me to write a book about it, to write my memoirs.</span> <span id="s124">But I don’t have enough facts to do that.</span> <span id="s125">It’s enough that I speak.</span> <span id="s126">And my closing statement usually is: “I want you to remember 60 years from now that you spoke with a survivor in 1990.”</span></p> <p><span id="s127">WH: What lesson do you think all that happened should teach us?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">FT: I think it’s a simple lesson---you’ve got to get involved.</span> <span id="s129">Jews were involved, but German’s weren’t involved in local day-to-day politics.</span> <span id="s130">And I’m involved in local politics here on every level.</span> <span id="s131">We fought the machine on the Upper East Side and became a Reform club.</span> <span id="s132">I was on the nominating committee which gave me a lot of power.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">WH: Were you involved in any Jewish organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">FT: Because my first wife was so badly maimed emotionally, any involvement as a Jew was impossible.</span> <span id="s135">It would have scared her out of her wits.</span> <span id="s136">I had a few books on Jewish topics and they were carefully spread through the library.</span> <span id="s137">If I occasionally went to a meeting of something Jewish, she would never go.</span> <span id="s138">It wasn’t that she didn’t want to be Jewish; she just didn’t want to be involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">WH: What did you think of the Central reunion?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">FT: I thought it was a pretty abominable setup.</span> <span id="s141">I mean, everything was done the wrong way.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">WH: What did you think of the people?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">FT: It was like, you know, being taken on a trip to see the aboriginese in Upper Ogoshu.</span> <span id="s144">I don’t run into this kind of a group often enough.</span> <span id="s145">I come out of a Central European Jewish configuration.</span> <span id="s146">This was second, or third generation, Eastern European, a religious group.</span> <span id="s147">I have contact with Gerer Hasidim through Rebecca’s family.</span> <span id="s148">I see it as a contradictory lifestyle because they have to deny a lot of evidence around them, including what happened from 1939 to 1945.</span> <span id="s149">To be a religious person means to do some kind of intellectual calisthenics---children dying and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">WH: Do you belong to a synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">FT: Yes.</span> <span id="s152">I don’t believe but I go because Jews go to shul.</span> <span id="s153">They light candles on Friday night and say a blessing.</span> <span id="s154">It’s not logical, but that’s what we do.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">WH: Where did you meet Rebecca?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">FT: In a subway---51st Street and Lexington.</span> <span id="s157">We had come back from a big Holocaust survivor’s rally in 1982.</span> <span id="s158">Jerzy Kosinski was speaking.</span> <span id="s159">We were married half a year later.</span> <span id="s160">I’m 67 and Rebecca’s 43, but I’m in good health and our son is three.</span> <span id="s161">I thought that this child will have an old father and that I’m depriving him of a father who does things with his son; but its great fun and I love it.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">WH: What achievements in life do you take the greatest pride in?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">FT: Trying to lead a sensible life, painting a handful of paintings that will survive.</span> <span id="s164">I have a painting in the Yad Vashem Museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">WH: Have you met other artist survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">FT: Only one and he became very successful painting nudes.</span> <span id="s167">But now nudity doesn’t mean anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">WH: Do you ever get annoyed at seeing obtuseness of people who don’t appreciate art?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">FT: Not at all.</span> <span id="s170">It’s the rule rather than the exception.</span></p></body></html>
