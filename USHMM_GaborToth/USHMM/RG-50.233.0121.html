Scislowski</span></p> <p><span id="s2">August 19, 2992</span></p> <p><span id="s3">Q: We can just start with your name.</span></p> <p><span id="s4">A: My name is Michael Scislowski, Polish pronunciation Michal Schislowski.</span> <span id="s5">I was born in Siedlce, Poland.</span> <span id="s6">The town is located approximately 100 kilometers from Warsaw which is about 60 miles, east.</span> <span id="s7">In 1933…</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Q: Let’s just get your birth date also, your date of birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">A: Date of birth, September 30, 1922.</span> <span id="s10">In 1933 I was a grammar school pupil going to school near Ruvna in Polish Ukraine area which was called in Polish Woin.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: This was public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: That was public school, yes.</span> <span id="s13">I graduated from the school in 1935.</span> <span id="s14">I lived there with my father, my mother and sister.</span> <span id="s15">My father was a military career officer who had fantastic talent in organizing orchestra bands or amateur theaters anywhere we went and because of being military person he was rotated on his duty from one place to another, therefore we recognized and lived in many, many towns on the eastern Polish border.</span> <span id="s16">He was comparing with American organization was similar to FBI.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: So it was an investigative branch of the…</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: An investigative counterespionage, army counter-espionage intelligence service.</span> <span id="s19">So in 1935 after graduating from grammar school, my father was transferred to another town north of Ruvna by name of Kostopol which is now in Russian territory.</span> <span id="s20">And he didn’t want me to waste time on learning Ukrainian language and therefore he brought me to my grandmother’s place, back to Siedlce where I was born and I enrolled to gymnasium which is Polish high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: Was it a special gymnasium or just general studies?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: No, it was general studies, right.</span> <span id="s23">And how different and how more informative Polish gymnasium was compared with American high school, then you know yourself.</span> <span id="s24">So I was in Siedlce in first and second year of high school and then I joined my father who requested transfer to area where he could have also high school in town and he received Wilno district, Vilna now is capitol of Lithuania but it was Polish and near Wilno was town by name of Wilaka, Wilaka Poyeto.</span> <span id="s25">So I completed high school, the third and fourth year in Wilaka.</span> <span id="s26">.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Your whole family was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: And my family was there, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: Did you have a particular subject that was most interesting to you at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: All subjects were dictated by national education system and therefore the beauty of this was that no matter where anybody from military family or any other the child was transferred from one town to another at this particular town you found exactly the same program in every subject.</span> <span id="s31">And we had twelve subjects including geography that in this country kids don’t even know where Washington D.C. is.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: You took languages there and German?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: In order to graduate from Polish high school you had to know two foreign languages and one classic.</span> <span id="s34">So I had German and French and Latin language as classic.</span> <span id="s35">So in 1939 I should have started Liceum.</span> <span id="s36">Liceum was approximately corresponding with American college, first year of college.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: That’s a generic name, Liceum?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: Liceum, L-I-C-E-U-M.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Oh, like the French.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Like the French.</span> <span id="s41">So when war broke out, September 1, that was our first day of school.</span> <span id="s42">And immediately after the ceremony we started digging trenches.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Did they tell you why?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: Yeah, yeah, we knew immediately that war broke out and Germany attacked Poland, at four o’clock I understand in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: What were these trenches like that you were digging?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: They were just like in the frontlines, any action, any military action in the front lines, trenches.</span> <span id="s47">They were about seven feet deep covered with some heavy materials and then covered with topsoil.</span> <span id="s48">So from the top, from the airplane you couldn’t see it, camouflaged.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: This was still in the Wilno district you were in?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Yeah, in Wilaka where the high school was, on the high school territory.</span> <span id="s51">Well so you could see that we couldn’t proceed with our lessons because the action, Germans, were approaching Warsaw almost every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Where was your father, was he mobilized to go someplace else?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: No, my father was still with us until September 17.</span> <span id="s54">On September 17 the Soviet Russia attacked Poland according to agreement with the Germans.</span> <span id="s55">Ribbentrop-Molotov agreement.</span> <span id="s56">And they gave us the final blow in the back.</span> <span id="s57">So we didn’t know how they would behave entering Polish territory so my father took us, my sister, mother, myself, took us with him on the evacuation trip from Wilaka to Wilno.</span> <span id="s58">On our way there we have seen already preparations of Polish troops to fight the approaching Soviet tanks.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: But the Polish army was relatively weak.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: Weak, yes, and it was already in very much in disastrous situation.</span> <span id="s61">Therefore, he left us in Wilno with his friends and went with his group of agents he said to headquarter, I believe, to headquarter, and I have never seen him again until after war.</span> <span id="s62">So as I understand they crossed the Lithuanian border, Lithuania was for a few more days free, and when the Russians came, all these Polish military personnel was taken by the Russians and sent to various concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: Who were you staying with in Wilno, you said they were friends of your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Friends of my father, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Military friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Military friends from World War 1.</span> <span id="s67">And then the Soviets ordered all people should return to their homes.</span> <span id="s68">So we went back to Wilaka.</span> <span id="s69">And after a few weeks they ordered all students return to their classes, but because of the extra-curriculum given by Russians in Russian language in Communist history, in party Communist history, we were taken one year back -- because they told us we complete our education as Communists after two years of indoctrination.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: So you were in classes learning Russian now and Soviet propaganda?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Yes and Soviet Communist Party history.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: How did you personally feel about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: Well, you had absolutely nothing to say.</span> <span id="s74">You tolerated but you were definitely disgusted about this and we were trying to make some sort of ironic remarks all the time during the classes.</span> <span id="s75">But our teachers were army officers and they were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: They pretty much replaced teachers that were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: So all your other studies went by the wayside?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: No, other studies, a few of our teachers escaped, and whoever escaped was replaced by the army teachers, Russian army teachers.</span> <span id="s80">Well I attended Communist classes until January 1st, 1940.</span> <span id="s81">That was if somebody still is alive could remember, we had the worst, the strongest, the coldest winter of my time.</span> <span id="s82">The temperature very often was dropped to minus 40 degrees.</span> <span id="s83">And during the night like that, with of course certain agreement with my mother, I decided to escape to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s84">So I took the train and I went to the last station before the borderline between Russian occupation zone of Poland and German occupation zone of Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Why did you want to escape?</span> <span id="s86">What was your goal?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Good question, because they started to arresting all Polish intelligent family members such as doctors, lawyers, former police department members.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: So clearly your father if he were there would have been a target.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Yeah, and I would be a target, definitely.</span> <span id="s90">So I decided to escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: That was in January?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: That was January 1940.</span> <span id="s93">Taking advantage of -- they gave us two weeks vacation.</span> <span id="s94">So arriving to this last station I had to go about five miles on foot with a group of some people.</span> <span id="s95">They thought I know more about the location of the border line than themselves.</span> <span id="s96">And I led them directly to the guards building and when we started running away, they noticed us and they started shooting.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: These were the Russian guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Russian guards and I was caught first time when I tried to cross the border.</span> <span id="s99">And as penalty they placed us in the brick outhouse in the lower level where I had to stand in excrement, human excrement up to my knees.</span> <span id="s100">So I couldn’t kneel.</span> <span id="s101">I couldn’t relax, nothing.</span> <span id="s102">I had to stand there for three days before they took us out and they told us, now go back to Wilaka and you should study because you are a young student and you will be a good Consumer (?)</span> <span id="s103">.</span> <span id="s104">Then I cried but I had to try again.</span> <span id="s105">So with my second try, instead of turning left, I turned right.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Did you go all the way back to Wilaka?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: NO, NO, NO, NO.</span> <span id="s108">Right after this maybe I went two kilometers towards the station and then I turned sideways when I noticed, because that was during the night, I noticed they couldn’t see me anymore and I tried again, with the help, of course, of one guy who was also crossing not the first time.</span> <span id="s109">And he helped me out and I found myself on the other side in the morning.</span> <span id="s110">People on the borderline were very wonderful people.</span> <span id="s111">They fed me, they washed me a little bit, because I stunk like a beaver.</span> <span id="s112">And after a few hours I arrived to Siedlce because I thought my grandmother is still in my place where I was born, Siedlce.</span> <span id="s113">When I arrived there I only met my aunt.</span> <span id="s114">My grandmother was in Warsaw at that time.</span> <span id="s115">So between January of 1940 -- oh while reaching the destination, I sent a message to my mother in Wilaka a friend who was leaving for Wilno because he had a family over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Was he crossing from the German side?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: He was crossing from the German side to the Russian side.</span> <span id="s118">And I give him description how I crossed and I urged them also to try to come over.</span> <span id="s119">You see the difference between Russian occupational zone and German was that they were both death enemies of Poland.</span> <span id="s120">However, on the German side you could at least dress as a civilized people.</span> <span id="s121">You could use your tie, you could use your hat, you could use your nice shirt, versus looking like a peasant all the time and be completely as a savage looking.</span> <span id="s122">So this is, you should remember, this is the reason why so many people couldn’t stand Communists because that was hypocrisy to the highest extent.</span> <span id="s123">Now what struck me first on my arrival to Siedlce that Jewish people, they were wearing the armbands with the Star of David and they had to take hats off and step aside before every German soldier.</span> <span id="s124">So you could see that that was horrible experience right from the start.</span> <span id="s125">And I was wondering right then how long I would be safe in this area.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Did anybody ever check your documents at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: No, No, nobody…</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Once you were there they just assumed….</span> <span id="s129">.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Yeah, once you were there….</span> <span id="s131">.</span> <span id="s132">It took me one month to take bath, Turkish bath every day in order to get rid of the smell I absorbed sitting in that outhouse there.</span> <span id="s133">It was horrible.</span> <span id="s134">Well, I started working in Siedlce first at the construction to clean, because Siedlce was also bombed during the war and there were many masonry buildings that required removal.</span> <span id="s135">And the break was the price of gold so we were cleaning from the mortar, we were cleaning every brick and…</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: How would you clean the mortar off?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: With chisels, and once you cleaned a thousand bricks a day, you had good pay.</span> <span id="s138">And so I worked there, but it was too hard for me.</span> <span id="s139">So after two months, that was about March, in March I met one friend who suggested to me we should open photographic business because Germans were taking pictures of all the Polish ruins and Polish various monuments and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Had the Germans assigned you to that task of cleaning up the buildings?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: No, no that was private.</span> <span id="s142">It was private Polish company.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Did you have to clean a thousand a day to get paid?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: But if you cleaned a thousand you would get reasonable pay?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Yeah, you could work two days or three days but you were paid for one thousand bricks.</span> <span id="s147">And I went in business developing pictures.</span> <span id="s148">I knew this because we had our own darkroom in Wilaka.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: In your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: In my home, yeah, so I was photographing bugs since I was nine years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: You had a camera?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: I had camera, yes.</span> <span id="s153">So it was easy for me and I was making good prints and everything.</span> <span id="s154">That’s why we had fantastic business.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Did you actually have a store?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: We had a store, yeah, we had a store in a half demolished building, but it was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: That’s extraordinary.</span> <span id="s158">What about getting supplies?</span> <span id="s159">Was it relatively…</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: The Germans were giving you supplies.</span> <span id="s161">The Germans were bringing supplies to your store.</span> <span id="s162">Therefore, you were allowed to charge them just for your labor.</span> <span id="s163">They were giving you prices for every print, every enlargement, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: Do you remember developing anything especially interesting?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Oh we collected some nice, yeah, they were very fond of taking pictures of the hanging ceremony and we had quite a bit of collection of German photographers indicating the executions.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Were these Jews mostly that they hung?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: No, no, anybody who was against them who was caught doing something that they -- for everything, as you know maybe, everything was death penalty, no matter what you did, against the Reich it was death penalty.</span> <span id="s168">Now, my mother and sister arrived in Warsaw in May 1940.</span> <span id="s169">They had also tremendous, tremendous difficulties.</span> <span id="s170">They were separated for 48 hours during their trip and my mother thought that they kidnapped my sister because she was only, at that time, maybe twelve years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: Were you living with your aunt?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: I was living with my aunt, yeah, in Siedlce.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: And that’s where the store was, in Siedlce.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: In Siedlce, yeah, before my mother and sister arrived.</span> <span id="s175">When my mother and sister arrived in Warsaw she sold everything what we had, possibly whatever was available and in their clothing and various pieces of undergarments se sewed in all the bank notes, high bank notes of one thousand zloty.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: So we collected, it was a very nice sum, when we tear off all these garment we found quite a nice sum of money.</span> <span id="s177">And that was the last day in Warsaw to exchange the old Polish money into the general government, they were called general government money.</span> <span id="s178">And we decided to open a business.</span> <span id="s179">And then between Warsaw and Siedlce is Minsk Mazowiecki and we decided to go back to our first family town when everybody knew us and we knew that if something goes wrong, we will get help.</span> <span id="s180">And therefore the first try was to open a regular general store in Minsk Mazowiecki.</span> <span id="s181">And since the only place for the building was in suburbs didn’t go so well, so therefore my mother obtained somehow lease of the building on the main street.</span> <span id="s182">And she decided to change from general store to delicatessen.</span> <span id="s183">And we had fantastic business.</span> <span id="s184">We had fantastic business and I could start attending various classes and getting my education because as you know, once Germans occupied Poland, they liquidated all high schools, lyceums, colleges, and universities.</span> <span id="s185">Only the grammar schools were open because they told us that we are designated as labor force only.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Right, so all you need is a certain level of education.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: Right, they don’t need Polish intellectuals anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Where were you able to take classes then?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: No, no, they were secret instructions given to us by Polish professors.</span> <span id="s190">And I continued later on when I tell you after my first arrest.</span> <span id="s191">So I was in Minsk Mazowiecki till, no let’s say this, at that time I also started learning English.</span> <span id="s192">There my first English classes were taking place.</span> <span id="s193">Maybe I told you before I had nice big family, so my first cousins who lived in Warsaw were arrested and sent to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s194">That was June of 1940.</span> <span id="s195">One of them is still alive and I now contact with him, so he promised to contribute something also to the museum in Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Why was he arrested?</span> <span id="s197">Was he in the underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: No, no, they knew that all Polish youngsters, they like to work underground.</span> <span id="s199">They didn’t realize yet that we already had certain first beginning of the underground organizations but they were trying to -- they started in 1940 in June arresting many youngsters.</span> <span id="s200">So I was even hiding in the attics, in the cellars, just not to be surprised during the night when they come and take you away.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Were you actually working in the underground then or did they suspect any young person?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: No, no, not yet, they suspected any young person, not yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: So just as a preventative, they figured they might as well arrest them before they start something.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: That’s right, correct.</span> <span id="s205">So in November of 1940 being located on the main street of Minsk Mazowiecki we noticed first movement of German troops toward the east.</span> <span id="s206">Okay, that’s important fact.</span> <span id="s207">And we were wondering, what the hell for.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Did several columns come through your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Mechanized columns?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: Mechanized columns, yeah.</span> <span id="s212">And as you know Brazilitov which was the borderline between Germans and Russians, it was maybe another 150 miles.</span> <span id="s213">In January 1941 my friend started talking about underground organization to fight the Germans right here in Minsk Mazowiecki that was January 1941.</span> <span id="s214">In March of 1941 we noticed increased movement of German troops east and as you know in June of 1941 Germany attacked Soviet Russia.</span> <span id="s215">And that was end of their friendship and collaboration.</span> <span id="s216">During this time in Warsaw the first Wapanki, Wapanki, it was type of certain -- the idea of closing the streets and avenues in such a way that whoever is trapped in this four or six blocks together was led to one only exit and was identified and if they caught, few times they caught very important people of underground organizations and other Polish famous guys.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: So it was almost like rounding up cattle, livestock, getting into a smaller and smaller area?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s219">And the same way there were hostages also selected from this kind of engagement.</span> <span id="s220">Now between June ’41 and August ’42 there were continuous Wapanki, continuous arrests, continuous, no matter where.</span> <span id="s221">Even Minsk Mazowiecki was no more safe anymore.</span> <span id="s222">And now one morning, at six o’clock in the morning when I was going to my uncle’s house for certain information, I was passing by the Ukrainian SS troops who were stationed at the beginning on the east side of Minsk Mazowiecki borderline of the township and there were plenty of them, I would say about entire company, about 100 people.</span> <span id="s223">I was wondering what happened, and when I was staying with my uncle because we had business together….</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: He was part of the deli?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: He was part of the deli, yah, he had his own business also.</span> <span id="s226">And what we learned that they came to liquidate Jewish section of Minsk Mazowiecki who were the market place was in front of the Catholic church.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: Was there a ghetto there?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Just a Jewish neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: Jewish neighborhood, yes.</span> <span id="s231">They took all of them into the marketplace.</span> <span id="s232">It was a nice area about 300 meters by 300 meters, that would be 900 feet by 900 feet.</span> <span id="s233">They concentrated them and the Ukrainians shot them dead.</span> <span id="s234">So the blood was floating all over the place.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: They shot women and children?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Everybody, yeah.</span> <span id="s237">I mean, some of them who were able to escape, they were escaping.</span> <span id="s238">Before that massacre they were forcing the Jewish gvina (?)</span> <span id="s239">rabbis to donate to commandateur, the commanding officer of the garrison of Minsk Mazowiecki about one kilogram of gold every two months or every three months I cannot tell.</span> <span id="s240">But we knew that they were forced because Jewish friends told us that they had to donate all gold.</span> <span id="s241">Once they stripped them with entire possessions, then they killed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Did you see this massacre?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: I saw only after massacre when they were using remaining Jewish people to load the bodies on the tracks and taking them away to some massive graves.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: Was that the first real atrocity you saw committed by the SS?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: I would say so.</span> <span id="s246">Well, I saw hanging executions in Siedlce when I came.</span> <span id="s247">That was my first experience.</span> <span id="s248">That was my first experience of atrocities.</span> <span id="s249">And here I approached the end of my freedom for the first time in September of 1942.</span> <span id="s250">I was arrested and kept overnight by the Ukrainians in their SS garrison in Minsk Mazowiecki and then the very next morning I was sent together with a group of about thirty kids to Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Did they send you by truck or walk you or.</span> <span id="s252">.</span> <span id="s253">?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: Sent by truck, by truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Did they ever give a reason for arresting you?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s257">They came -- I was with my mother and my sister in the store during the day and they took me from the store.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: The Ukrainian SS have a fairly bad reputation.</span> <span id="s259">Did you agree with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Oh, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: That they were ruthless?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Ruthless, especially to Poles, because they were pushed by the Germans and the Germans were smart.</span> <span id="s263">They didn’t do this biggest atrocities.</span> <span id="s264">They were always taking somebody who was serving them well.</span> <span id="s265">Okay, that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s266">Now I was held in ??</span> <span id="s267">I think that was warehouse or high school, I don’t recall.</span> <span id="s268">There were many, many empty halls where they kept all these kids, few hundred kids were kept there.</span> <span id="s269">And checking my health, checking my structure, medical examination, they told me I would be send to main post office in Vienna to work.</span> <span id="s270">And I saw my mother for the last for the two weeks that I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: You were held in this warehouse for two weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Two weeks, yeah, and my mother was there every day crying so I tried to tell her, don’t worry about me, don’t worry about me.</span> <span id="s273">She said one of my uncles promised to help us.</span> <span id="s274">And really combining our money together because I believe she had to pay 7,000 zloty to the chief guard and he let me go.</span> <span id="s275">But I wouldn’t dare to go back to Minsk Mazowoecki.</span> <span id="s276">Therefore, I remained in Warsaw and here I really joined the lyceum courses, that was confidential courses arranged by professors of colleges and universities for the kids who couldn’t go to school any longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: What did they teach you?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: They were teaching me everything, mathematics, all the courses that are necessary.</span> <span id="s279">I at that time already decided to become an architect.</span> <span id="s280">So History of Architecture.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: Where did they hold the classes?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: The classes were held in each professor’s private home.</span> <span id="s283">So we had to travel all over Warsaw.</span> <span id="s284">One class was held on Wilsa Street, another class on Dubra Street and from Dubra back again on Marshallkoska Street.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: How many students were with you at a time, usually?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: Usually the complete was six kids in a class.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: And you paid the professors?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: No, whoever was able to pay, he paid, whoever not they were all patriotically inclined.</span> <span id="s289">Nobody even thought about material gains.</span> <span id="s290">And also at that time I started taking lessons on piano, piano lessons.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Where were you living?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: I was living with my uncle who bought -- I contributed some of my money and some of my mother’s money and we bought apartment on Dubra Street, 53, corner of Radna.</span> <span id="s293">So that was September of 1942.</span> <span id="s294">October more arrests, more hostages, more executions.</span> <span id="s295">That was the time that Jewish ghetto was enclosed completely.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: You’re caught within the Jewish ghetto at that time, that is within the area they designated?</span> <span id="s297">I know a lot of Poles who moved out.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s299">I was not affected because I was closer to Vistula River area.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: You recall watching them build the wall, I suppose.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: Yes, yes, I was passing on a streetcar many times through the ghetto.</span> <span id="s302">And at the beginning when I was there the life was normal.</span> <span id="s303">You couldn’t recognize any differences only it looked very congested, looked very congested.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: This was the streetcar that actually went in the ghetto and out the other side?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Right, it had to pass by.</span> <span id="s306">What I would like to stress here, Kevin, please believe me this is not propaganda.</span> <span id="s307">Whoever wanted to leave or escape, he could.</span> <span id="s308">The Jewish gmina members, the highest instance in ghetto, that were ruling spiritually also and morally entire population, they never believed that the Germans would liquidate them and that was the biggest mistake because they had whoever wanted to go, he could.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: If they wanted to get out there they could try to get out?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Absolutely, even jumping at the stop, jumping into the tramway and wh -- t, you’re out.</span> <span id="s311">You take off the band.</span> <span id="s312">The only thing is whoever was looking Jewish, he had no chance, that’s true.</span> <span id="s313">That was Mother Nature’s dirty trick.</span> <span id="s314">If you happened to look similar to other faces by all means you could save.</span> <span id="s315">And they were saved, many, many thousands, hundred thousands were saved.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Did you ever hear of the group Jagoda?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: I know that they saved a lot of Jews in Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: Oh sure, and how many thousands were executed because they were trying to save.</span> <span id="s320">I know a few around the village in Minsk Mazowiecki.</span> <span id="s321">It was rough.</span> <span id="s322">So let’s go because we never finish this.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: I won’t ask more questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: No, no, ask me, ask me, it’s wonderful, ask me because I will supplement you immediately with my opinion if I have any.</span> <span id="s325">In 1942, Christmas time now, I took a chance.</span> <span id="s326">Came to Minsk Mazowiecki at night with my friend for Christmas Eve dinner.</span> <span id="s327">And that was the last time I saw my mother, grandmother and sister.</span> <span id="s328">Now 1943 January….</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: Was that Christmas Eve meal or Christmas day meal or just around…?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: Christmas Eve meal because Christmas Eve meal that just like Jewish holidays are falling always at night like Friday night, like Shabbat Shalom.</span> <span id="s331">Well in January I was sworn into ZWZ, Zwiazek Walki Zbrojnej.</span> <span id="s332">That was the organization which was preceding AK, Armia Krajowa.</span> <span id="s333">And together with my friend, Stanchachovski and we two were sworn in by Bal-Komorowski himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: This was in Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: That was in Warsaw, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: I’m not familiar with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: He was the commander-in-chief of all organizations at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Were you nervous about doing this?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: Oh, sure, yeah.</span> <span id="s340">Now I received the first underground work in the railroad machine shop in Praga.</span> <span id="s341">Praga is on the other side of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s342">On one bank is called Warsaw and another side is Warsaw Praga, okay?</span> <span id="s343">And not a lot of fun because on March 19, 1943 hoping that my uncle is at the doors of my apartment at six o’clock in the morning, I opened the doors and that was Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: They were knocking at the door?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Knocking on the door, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: What kind of work were you doing in the railroad machine shop?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Working as a carpenter.</span> <span id="s348">That’s why I almost saved my life later on in the concentration camp because I declared myself a carpenter.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: When you were sworn in what was the philosophy of the underground?</span> <span id="s350">I’m sure they said that our goals are to ….</span> <span id="s351">.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: …to free, free Poland of enemies, yeah, regardless of whether they were Germans or Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: So since was the predecessor to the AK this was also an armed resistance group?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: What did they have you build?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Have me build, what do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: As a carpenter what were you building for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Oh, no, that was some parts.</span> <span id="s359">You wouldn’t know.</span> <span id="s360">You would never know what is the final item.</span> <span id="s361">So you had only parts, certain hundreds of pieces of lumber cut to certain piece.</span> <span id="s362">It was on various tact.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: Assembly line?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: Assembly line, yes.</span> <span id="s365">So please remember they entered apartment at six o’clock in the morning and at seven o’clock, one hour later, I was in Poliak prison, shaved, undressed and thrown into the basement solitary compartment.</span> <span id="s366">And then I started crying.</span> <span id="s367">Because I said what the hell for honestly, what have I done, I didn’t do anything yet so as to be locked up.</span> <span id="s368">So during my presence in Poliak I was interrupted by Gestapo three times on Alaya Shucha where the headquarters of Gestapo was.</span> <span id="s369">Alaya Shucha.</span> <span id="s370">And probably you heard about tramway we called the special room of the sizes about 25 by 12 or 25 by 15 rooms that people who were waiting to be interrogated had to wait with face the opposite dead wall.</span> <span id="s371">And the guard was behind you.</span> <span id="s372">If you turn only a little bit of degrees left or right, he calls you to the passage and you have to make one hundred sit-ups until you were exhausted.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: They call that the tramway, this corridor….</span> <span id="s374">.</span> <span id="s375">?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Each room.</span> <span id="s377">The tramway was each room.</span> <span id="s378">So shortly after that I was taken to the department five in the Pavia called Fifth Floor .</span> <span id="s379">I can remember now which was Transport floor and with our prayers because we didn’t want to stay in Poliak on May 3 since that was famous Polish holiday and usually they were executing hostages.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Those interrogations, what did they ask you or what did they say to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: They were, first of all they were asking you are a member, we know that you are a member of underground.</span> <span id="s382">Tell us only who was with you and then we let you go.</span> <span id="s383">That was the famous statement, a very naïve one, so you had to have power, will power to tell them all the time that you don’t belong to any other organization and you have never belonged to any organization.</span> <span id="s384">They were beating up with a stick from top of head to the end of your behind, entire back.</span> <span id="s385">You had red and purple when you came back to Poviak prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: So any time you didn’t answer….</span> <span id="s387">.</span> <span id="s388">?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Correct, you got beating.</span> <span id="s390">So we arrived to….</span> <span id="s391">Oh I should mention that now, shortly before our departure, ghetto uprising took place and we saw through our windows how Germans were systematically going from one building to another dropping napalm bombs into the basement to be sure that entire building will catch flames.</span> <span id="s392">And whoever was hiding in the building, if he didn’t come out, then he burned to death.</span> <span id="s393">There were some constant day and night machine guns and single shots fired.</span> <span id="s394">We couldn’t sleep because of that and because of tremendous smoke that penetrated the windows of the prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: You had a window in the cell you were held in?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: This was a group cell?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Group cell on the top floor.</span> <span id="s399">I was already in the Transport floor so absorbed most of the smoke.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Then you could see the ghetto from that window?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: Yes, you could see the streets also, the tanks on one hand and some individuals shooting at the tanks from another end of the street.</span> <span id="s402">So that was the end.</span> <span id="s403">The smoke was still on when they took us to a transport and we arrived to the Warsaw freight station and placed eighty prisoners in one freight car.</span> <span id="s404">Total of transport was 1,200 prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: All from Poviak?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: From Poviak.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: These were the cattle cars they put you in?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Cattle cars, yeah.</span> <span id="s409">One more thing that I should mention because it was significant.</span> <span id="s410">Was adding to our tortures was the amount of bedbugs that was eating you alive during the night and you couldn’t escape because when you even slept on the table providing every leg of the table into a pail of water, they were crawling on the wall and then on the ceiling and dropping on your body from the ceiling directly.</span> <span id="s411">It was amazing.</span> <span id="s412">It was completely impossible to fight them.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: They give you some food within the prison?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: Yes, you were getting very small amount.</span> <span id="s415">Well now things were rolling very fast now because between Warsaw and Piajkov the very next big station going west from Warsaw few guys who worked in Poviak in the machine shop, they somehow smuggled hand drill at their body so when I found myself with them in the same cattle car, with small holes they drill through a few planks, wooden planks, removed it from the top and you could slide down and upward between the channels, steel channels there were wooden planks.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: This was the floor of the car?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: No, that was side, between the buffers, between the cars, parallel with the trucks.</span> <span id="s418">And they removed few planks, enough for human body to go through.</span> <span id="s419">They just placed themselves nicely under the buffers and one after another started escaping because the caboose where the soldiers were never expected first somebody might escape.</span> <span id="s420">They were playing cards or something, did not paying attention.</span> <span id="s421">So the first few, seven only, were able to escape.</span> <span id="s422">I was also in the line to escape but the first shot was fired as noticed them running away.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: This was daytime?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Daytime, yes.</span> <span id="s425">And their nice situation was that the machinist were appalled so he rode the engine for another maybe half a mile before he stopped.</span> <span id="s426">So they had enough area to be separated from the train so they didn’t bother to chase them.</span> <span id="s427">But all the madness they concentrated on the car where we were in.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Right, somebody was going to suffer for this.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Right, so when the train stopped, the first SS jumped on the buffer, taking advantage of this open spot through which they escaped and he emptied entire magazine of the machine gun.</span> <span id="s430">So he killed two guys and he wounded about five guys.</span> <span id="s431">I heard only whistle above my head so for the first time I had a barrel of the gun facing against me.</span> <span id="s432">That was the first time.</span> <span id="s433">Immediately they opened the doors and they took us all out and it was some small how to say, it’s not village, it’s not town.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: It’s the railroad siding?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: Railroad siding, people who lived closed to railroad tracks.</span> <span id="s436">Put us against the fence with two machine guns right on both sides and the officer started telling us now who was the leader we want to know or you will all be shot.</span> <span id="s437">So people next to me already started giving certain smell away and everything physiological part of your body is very weak if you’re under duress.</span> <span id="s438">And something was telling me all the time that this is not the place where you’re going to die and I was kept so I went cool.</span> <span id="s439">Now we were lucky.</span> <span id="s440">In our group there was one fellow who spoke perfect German.</span> <span id="s441">We knew German language but not to such extent as could assume you are of German origin.</span> <span id="s442">But this guy was fantastic and he told with certain respect.</span> <span id="s443">You should know before you execute us he said that it was not our will.</span> <span id="s444">They had gun, they had instruments, everything ready for their escape and it was not our fault that you have not probably cleared them or caught them when you were loading us at the platform.</span> <span id="s445">And that was reason that he got mad but he realized that he was telling the truth.</span> <span id="s446">It is possible.</span> <span id="s447">That was not a story but possible to accept.</span> <span id="s448">And he opened next two cars, split the group in half and put additional guys on both cars and we quietly arrived to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s449">That was eleven o’clock in the evening.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: So it was a full days journey?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Full day journey.</span> <span id="s452">And the soldiers were still mad at us and they were wounding people with bayonets pushing us between the platform, railroad platform and the main gate of the camp.</span> <span id="s453">It was also quite an area, maybe half a kilometer or so.</span> <span id="s454">So during this small distance they still had a chance to wound few prisoners with their bayonet.</span> <span id="s455">When we arrived there nothing happened.</span> <span id="s456">We were in such a disarray and tired.</span> <span id="s457">The very next morning they told us to undress.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: Where did they hold you overnight?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: In one of the barracks -- get undressed, washed, and before we got cup of tea you might call.</span> <span id="s460">That was something -- combination of all kind of herbs collected from the fields dried and they were making tea out of this weeds, giving us to drink every morning.</span> <span id="s461">So I didn’t drink, I only rinsed my mouth and brushed my teeth.</span> <span id="s462">The next thing was to be sure that everybody’s name they have and we received a tattoo.</span> <span id="s463">And please mark the number, 119431</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: So they issued you the uniforms also with the vinkel on it?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Oh no, not yet.</span> <span id="s466">Only the next day or so.</span> <span id="s467">So I was taken to one of the barracks and there were attendants checking twice.</span> <span id="s468">First time at six o’clock in the morning and second time at six o’clock at night.</span> <span id="s469">Since the entire area was still not completely adjusted the ground was mud so after rain, there were puddles.</span> <span id="s470">That was my first experience with the assistant to kapo.</span> <span id="s471">You’re supposed to stand in a row that would be perfect horizontally, 90 degrees between rows and lines.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: This was the Appell?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Appell, yes.</span> <span id="s474">So when there was a puddle, huge puddle in front of me so I stood little bit off the line, the guy came to me and pushed me into the puddle with tremendous blow with a stick that they were carrying similar to the baseball stick, baseball bat, and he said, you SOB you are afraid of what, are you gonna drink this water.</span> <span id="s475">.</span> <span id="s476">From now on don’t forget that you are not a man you are only a number.</span> <span id="s477">And I think that was quite characteristic.</span> <span id="s478">I never forgot this because I realized that I was only a number from now on.</span> <span id="s479">After two weeks being in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s480">.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Were you pretty much idle at that time, they weren’t working you?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: Yeah, we were working on the Fraulager that means preparing the area to be occupied by women that’s supposed to arrive to Birkenau.</span> <span id="s483">Birkenau is not Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s484">Please distinguish these two locations.</span> <span id="s485">One is apart from another approximately one mile.</span> <span id="s486">And all transports to Birkenau always, not to Auschwitz just like my transport.</span> <span id="s487">After two weeks I was transferred to Auschwitz thanks to my cousins because they were first in Auschwitz and they noticed from the list obtained from Schreibshtuber that I was in transport and they took me under pretext that I am sick.</span> <span id="s488">They took me to Kreinkinbau, that means hospital in Auschwitz located -- buildings, number of buildings, I think 24 or 25 something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: They told you to pretend you were sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Pretend I am sick, yeah.</span> <span id="s491">So one guard and me walked from Birkenau to Auschwitz and when I arrived I met immediately I saw my cousin but he told me pretend that we don’t know each other.</span> <span id="s492">He placed me in the hospital and I was there for three days only and then remain in Auschwitz but still since I did not have two weeks quarantine that was required for all newcomers we were called Tzuganga.</span> <span id="s493">Tsugang is the new arrival.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: What did you say you were sick with?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: Cold, cold, yeah, fever.</span> <span id="s496">I was there not quite two weeks as on quarantine because I fainted in the next week or so standing in line for Appell and when I was first time, I met these two gentlemen from my hometown.</span> <span id="s497">Their names just to record them I have to mention Jan Musdorf and Oleg Guretsky and they saved my life because when I went to hospital for the second time I really had pneumonia in full swing with pleurisy, water in my lungs, completely flooded, and if not for care of these two guys I wouldn’t live today.</span> <span id="s498">Unfortunately I must tell you that one of them, Jan Musdorf, was executed as a member of the Underground.</span> <span id="s499">Somebody squealed when he was in camp in Auschwitz and he was executed together with other Polish patriots at the end of 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: With pneumonia did you go back to the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: No, I was recuperating and my friends since my cousin was an old prisoner, since June of 1940, he had many, many friends, and therefore they respected old prisoners.</span> <span id="s502">I was kept in this block where there were after illness you had to recuperate.</span> <span id="s503">Usually you were staying one week in hospital SS doctor was coming and sending you to gas chamber immediately as an Arbeit Shoy.</span> <span id="s504">Arbeit Shoy means afraid of work.</span> <span id="s505">So you had to be very careful.</span> <span id="s506">That’s why I was always hiding, always hiding, lucky to have friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: You stayed in a barrack hidden.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Yeah, and now during my presence there, that was summer of ’43, another atrocity occurred that could indicate what kind of inhuman treatment you could expect from the Nazis.</span> <span id="s509">They executed first thirteen members of the surveying group that one of them escaped.</span> <span id="s510">Thirteen were executed at Black Wall on Block number eleventh and twelve remaining after one month just as an example that no one should even think about escaping, they hung them in front of all of us, twelve members of the surveying group.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: So one was shot and the rest were…?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: Thirteen were shot and twelve were hung.</span> <span id="s513">That was July 17 of 1943, the execution took place.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: So they made all the other prisoners come out and watch this?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: And watch yeah, and they were hung in front of the kitchen.</span> <span id="s516">They were hung there for at least three days before the bodies were taken away and gallows was removed.</span> <span id="s517">And while I was on that -- I received a red point which meant in the distinction of the camp meant he’s not allowed to work outside the camp because they called us Flukfergocht which means suspected of any escape.</span> <span id="s518">I received this probably because the Gestapo had me from the first, my first escape from the Skarasheska Street.</span> <span id="s519">And maybe all the guys who were with me in this car, the train that was carrying us from Warsaw to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: This was that red triangle?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: No, under, below the number and the red triangle I had red point on white piece of cloth, red point here on my left side of my chest under the number, then on the right side of my leg, right below the jacket and in the back I had also a red point and letters IL which meant in German “I’m Lager.”</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: In camp.</span> <span id="s523">You say a point.</span> <span id="s524">What did it look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: It was approximately one- inch diameter that was red on white piece of cloth and here were letters IL.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: So it looked something like a Japanese flag?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: Like a Japanese flag, yeah.</span> <span id="s528">So my cousin said to me, Michael, you will live about two weeks, that’s all, because that was the approximate time elapsing between….</span> <span id="s529">.</span> <span id="s530">they didn’t want to keep the Im Lager, the Red Points in camp.</span> <span id="s531">You could be shot after six o’clock when you were walking.</span> <span id="s532">After working hours when you were walking in camp SS soldiers were trying to experiment or exercise their aim at the points and they were shooting at you like to a rabbit.</span> <span id="s533">So immediately after being discharged from quarantine I started working in the washroom.</span> <span id="s534">I was so good at folding the SS shirts that they gave me the storeroom to take care of, otherwise I had to keep every SS guys names inside my notebook and receiving the dirty clothes and giving them back already washed and cleaned and pressed and everything.</span> <span id="s535">So it was pretty good.</span> <span id="s536">That happened until December 1 of 1943.</span> <span id="s537">They decided to collect all the Red Point guys and put them to bunker.</span> <span id="s538">So I was taken to Block 11 which was known from the executions and that was the final stage of your -- like the death row or the final alley before they executed you.</span> <span id="s539">So you imagine how I felt.</span> <span id="s540">And that was the time when new commanding officer of Auschwitz arrived and this blood thirsty son-of-a-bitch was replaced by name of Liebehenstetshen (probably Arthur Liebehenschel) or something like that.</span> <span id="s541">He, would you believe, he said that during his presence there would be no more executions.</span> <span id="s542">So I was saved again but he concentrated all these guys who were on the black list and he sent us to another trip from Auschwitz to Flossenburg in Bavaria, Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: How long were you held in Block 11?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: From December 1 to February 2.</span> <span id="s545">Arriving in Flossenburg, here in Auschwitz we had fantastic weather.</span> <span id="s546">There was no more than about 35, 38 degrees, no lower, and we arrived to the elevation of 900 meters which is over 2700 feet above sea level and with six feet of snow on the road, cold as hell, and we were only dressed in thin German prisoner uniforms.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: They took you by cattle car to Flossenburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Oh yes, the same thing, and we went through Kemnitz, I remember, station all the way around Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s549">They didn’t go through Czechoslovakia, all the way around Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s550">Flossenburg is situated in Northern Bavaria close to town of Weiden and that was -- we didn’t know why we are there but we started working on the Shtassenbau Commando, two mountains which we were about to cut to certain level and fill the gap in the valley to create a highway.</span> <span id="s551">A few guys died at that time.</span> <span id="s552">We had two Jewish friends, prisoners, with us.</span> <span id="s553">They killed one by name of Blum.</span> <span id="s554">He was famous in Jewish society in Poland.</span> <span id="s555">Plus two additional guys that they told us they would be transferred to camp where they have additional Jewish prisoners.</span> <span id="s556">In Flossenburg we had no Jewish prisoners.</span> <span id="s557">So I had, there were many stories I could tell you about my presence in Flossenburg camp but that was camp that I finally transferred to the Messerschmitt factory that they had in the mountain.</span> <span id="s558">We were not afraid of any air raids or anything because it was in the quarry.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Isn’t the salt mines?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: No quarry, granite mountains.</span> <span id="s561">I was there till the end, which means till April of 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: So most of your time there was spent working in the Messerschmitt factory?</span> <span id="s563">First you built the roads?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: First we built the roads for the first two weeks and then they called all carpenters and good thing that I said that I am carpenter.</span> <span id="s565">He look at my hands and he slapped me and he says you son-of-a-bitch, you telling me that these are carpenter’s hands and I said well I was a student before I was arrested and I didn’t have hard work at Auschwitz so I couldn’t have any calluses on my hands, however, I am acquainted with all the carpenter’s tools.</span> <span id="s566">He says okay then we take you but if you show me any ignorance to handling the equipment I will kill you personally he says.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: Is this a kapo or an SS?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: That was an SS officer.</span> <span id="s569">So I was directed to the Killer Fur Klidem for Messerschmitt which was a small aluminum box that my duty was -- it’s on a conveyer -- and I had to make approximately sixty holes in one minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: You had to drill them in?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: Drill them in, yeah, through the dzig.</span> <span id="s572">So many guys were afraid to break the bits.</span> <span id="s573">Once you broke the bit you got 25 lashes.</span> <span id="s574">So I became famous because I learned how to sharpen the bits and to work enough to be allowed to break them.</span> <span id="s575">You had to perform already a certain work with every bit before you could break it.</span> <span id="s576">So after that on May first 1944 in Flossenburg they allowed us to play ball for the first time.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: Football?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: That was like soccer, but only by hands.</span> <span id="s579">Instead of kicking the ball, since there was not enough room, we also had two goals operating with our hands.</span> <span id="s580">Would you please believe me that I became a star.</span> <span id="s581">Because of that, I received better position to be again in a store issuing the tools every morning and collecting them at the end of each shift.</span> <span id="s582">And that was also very good because I had one more dish of soup just to maintain my physical strength for the game.</span> <span id="s583">Germans were betting on me how many goals I will shoot.</span> <span id="s584">And we were only allowed to play Sunday afternoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Did you throw the ball to one another?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: Yeah, just the same thing.</span> <span id="s587">You operated with your hands the same as your feet and would you believe that this is something I never expected and we had definite knowledge that Germany is losing the war because for the first time they allowed us to have some kind of entertainment.</span> <span id="s588">Their national holiday, May 1, social what they call MS and they are pair, right?</span> <span id="s589">National Socialistice Deutsch Arbeit Bartai.</span> <span id="s590">And from this point on it was a little bit better.</span> <span id="s591">They added sugar to our morning tea so you can imagine, huh?</span> <span id="s592">Now two things happened.</span> <span id="s593">First, after unfortunate uprising in Warsaw the first prisoners arrived from Warsaw directly to Flossenburg.</span> <span id="s594">And second thing happened….</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: This was after Polish uprising?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: Polish uprising, yeah, so in September of….</span> <span id="s597">Polish uprising was August 1, 1944 -- in September the first group arrived from the uprising, prisoners.</span> <span id="s598">And the second thing happened, the plague of typhus.</span> <span id="s599">So I experiences I mentioned to you, red box in Poviak forgot to tell you about fleas in hospital in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s600">Tremendous fleas that you could cry because you couldn’t catch them and they were biting you all night long.</span> <span id="s601">And here lice.</span> <span id="s602">To receive set of shorts and shirt you had to exchange these two items for one portion of bread.</span> <span id="s603">Bread was like money.</span> <span id="s604">You could buy anything with portion, daily portion, of the prisoner’s daily portion of bread.</span> <span id="s605">I tell you what value of bread was, one Komisbrodt the German military shvartz brodt that was similar to our pumpernickel, you know black pumpernickel, it was also like square, so divided into four portions.</span> <span id="s606">One bread was one beautiful white-blue diamond, that was the corresponding value, okay.</span> <span id="s607">So after that I, not only Polish but also Czechs and German prisoners were dying.</span> <span id="s608">Germans in camp were always occupying some functions whether they were in charge of the barracks or in charge of your work commando or whatever.</span> <span id="s609">However there were also Czechs in Flossenburg.</span> <span id="s610">In Auschwitz, majority were Polish.</span> <span id="s611">About 80% were Polish.</span> <span id="s612">Here, however, we had about 40% of Czechs, maybe 35% of Poles and other nationalities, including Americans, the flyers who were shot down.</span> <span id="s613">They were there but very short period of time and they were immediately executed.</span> <span id="s614">Now to finish my story, I was there till April 21.</span> <span id="s615">We started moving in group of 5000 surrounded by again Ukrainian SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: You were being marched out?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: Marched out.</span> <span id="s618">And they told us they would try to move us south towards Dachau.</span> <span id="s619">But because Third Army, we later learned, Third Army was moving so fast and they were pushing us southeast from Flossenburg and therefore after passing about sixty miles in three days.</span> <span id="s620">Out of 30,000 prisoners they killed 15, 000.</span> <span id="s621">Whoever couldn’t walk they were shot in the ditch with dum-dum bullets.</span> <span id="s622">They were all found after liberation by the Third Army members, General Patton’s army.</span> <span id="s623">We had possibility of getting taken care of immediate by the American Red Cross hospital, field hospital, and I went with my friends, tried to go as far a possible west.</span> <span id="s624">We arrived to Erlangen near Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s625">Erlangen was not bombed, was academic city with a university there.</span> <span id="s626">First camp for refugees was formed by the US army.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Were you liberated just one morning?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: Yes I was liberated on the third day of our evacuation march.</span> <span id="s629">Was a beautiful, beautiful, never to forget situation, because we were concentrated on the mountain and we have seen on the other mountain, we have seen first American tanks and together with us there were Soviet army members who jumped on the Ukrainian SS guards.</span> <span id="s630">They shot them, killed them instantly and with the guns they were started moving toward the American troops.</span> <span id="s631">Since that was some kind of horseshoe area we were trying to go into the valley and then come up the mountain and making ourselves a short cut.</span> <span id="s632">And when we were, we were there three of us, we found a group of SS soldiers armed to their teeth and we almost got killed.</span> <span id="s633">It’s unbelievable, right there.</span> <span id="s634">You sense you had freedom in the air and you could be killed at the last moment.</span> <span id="s635">That was my fourth time when I faced the gun.</span> <span id="s636">And good thing that my friend spoke German and then we said we are Germans from Silesia.</span> <span id="s637">We want to go home now.</span> <span id="s638">So he said only as Germans don’t tell them that we are here.</span> <span id="s639">My luck was that when I arrived to the first group of the Yanks, the commanding officer I think of the first division of the Third Army and most of them were Poles from Buffalo, New York area and almost every second spoke Polish, broken Polish, but they knew Polish language.</span> <span id="s640">So I told him in Polish who we met on our way here.</span> <span id="s641">So he said okay you will see what’s going to happen and they shot immediately first warning like a rocket down to the valley.</span> <span id="s642">After a few moments lower white flag arrived at the main building, just like city hall or something like that and he said look what’s gonna happen now.</span> <span id="s643">And all these tanks maybe a dozen of them from all around the area they started shooting everything they could reach.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: So they were being held in a little town in the valley?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: Yeah, so finally after that first salvo, finally white flag appeared on the steeple.</span> <span id="s646">And, therefore, that was the end of military action in this area.</span> <span id="s647">So later on as I mentioned to you before, I was able to join the American army and after five years of serving with Labor Service Company I arrived to New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: So five years employed by the US army?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: Yes, from September 1945 to September 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: So you were liberated what month?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: I was liberated in end of April, April 24, 1945 near Ulm very close to the German Czechoslovakian border.</span> <span id="s652">I didn’t tell you many, many details when I was in the bunker.</span> <span id="s653">I was facing the experimental Block number 10 to tell you but this is….</span> <span id="s654">.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Do you want to tell me now or….</span> <span id="s656">?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: Well I could mention only one detail we were witnessing how they took one prisoner and this happened to be one of the members of Polish Voskafala which was some ??</span> <span id="s658">hour on Polish radio before the war.</span> <span id="s659">He was Jewish and he was fantastic comedian.</span> <span id="s660">He was a star on Polish radio before the war.</span> <span id="s661">He was taken one morning to this experimental block, Block 10 and they removed one testicle from him.</span> <span id="s662">When he came back we ask him what did they do to you.</span> <span id="s663">He said that first they had special machine to ejaculate him when he was normal person with two testicles and then after that they removed one testicle.</span> <span id="s664">After three weeks they called him for another ejaculation just to compare how human sperm can work, can be used with one and two.</span> <span id="s665">With women we have seen something they were working but this will be described in my book.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: You were able to see them doing the experiments?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Yes, before they closed the windows.</span> <span id="s668">They realized later that we were watching, we were witnesses, and they bricked up the windows.</span> <span id="s669">But for the first two weeks of December I could observe that and after two weeks the masons blocked the windows.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: Women they were doing similar kinds of experiments?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">(TAPE ENDS ABRUPTLY)</span></p></body></html>
