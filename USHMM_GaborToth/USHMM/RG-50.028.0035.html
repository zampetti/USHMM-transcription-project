I see.</span> <span id="s36">What type of work did your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A. My father was an artist.</span> <span id="s38">He was working for the largest factory of printing material.</span> <span id="s39">And he was working there, first of all, as a designer, and then he became a colorist.</span> <span id="s40">That is, a counselor in artistic work for printing materials.</span> <span id="s41">He was working 55 years in the same place.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q. I see.</span> <span id="s43">And what type of education did you receive?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A.</span> <span id="s45">We had a wonderful family life.</span> <span id="s46">Family was very quiet.</span> <span id="s47">Artistically inclined, of course.</span> <span id="s48">Music had a big part.</span> <span id="s49">My father was playing violin.</span> <span id="s50">I got some piano lessons.</span> <span id="s51">We so had nice time together.</span> <span id="s52">He gave me also lots of painting lessons.</span> <span id="s53">We used to do everything together.</span> <span id="s54">My mother also was a very fine person.</span> <span id="s55">She used to work with me.</span> <span id="s56">Everything was play and laughter.</span> <span id="s57">We were just a happy family with no problems whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q. And what type of a school did you attend?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A. Well, first the local school.</span> <span id="s60">And then afterwards I went in this time they had school which was called middle school.</span> <span id="s61">It was a school between the common school and the high school.</span> <span id="s62">And I was in that school when the war started off.</span> <span id="s63">I also have to say that we were a very religious family.</span> <span id="s64">Very strong Catholics.</span> <span id="s65">And God meant a lot for us in my whole life.</span> <span id="s66">As a little baby and child already God was the center of our home.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q. I see.</span> <span id="s68">What was your town like when Hitler came to power?</span> <span id="s69">If you can remember when Hitler came to power in Germany, What was the talk in the community?</span> <span id="s70">Do you remember that at all from your parents or from</span></p> <p><span id="s71">other neighbors?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A. Well, I was too small.</span> <span id="s73">I was, you know, only three years old when Hitler came to power, but as I said, in 1937-38 we came in contact with the Bible, and through it and through Jehovah's Witnesses with a book called the Crushik Against Christendom (ph) written by Brother Tersha (ph), and this gave some X-rays of letters and testimonies from witnesses who have been in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s74">So from that date on, of course, at home we would speak about what the system meant.</span> <span id="s75">It was against freedom.</span> <span id="s76">No freedom of speech, no freedom of action, a lot of talking about that.</span> <span id="s77">But the Alsatians, they were divided, you know.</span> <span id="s78">There's something I have to say about my home country.</span> <span id="s79">People used to say German is the fatherland and France is the motherland.</span> <span id="s80">So that means that the Alsatians have been as much on one side than the other.</span> <span id="s81">And there was lots of dividing in the houses.</span> <span id="s82">Some for, some against.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q.</span> <span id="s84">What was it that attracted your family to Jehovah's Witnesses?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A.</span> <span id="s86">It was just plain Bible truth.</span> <span id="s87">As the Bible came in our home, Bible reading became a very important part, and they realized, especially my father realized, that the outstanding point of a Christian would be to live according to love, love your neighbor as yourself.</span> <span id="s88">And he used to cite lots of times the Text of John who says that Cain was a man-slayer, and everybody who doesn't like his neighbor would be like a man-slayer.</span> <span id="s89">So he believed that he had to impress on his family, his wife and me, the fact that love of neighbor is the main thing.</span> <span id="s90">Never to harm anybody in no ways.</span> <span id="s91">This was his view.</span> <span id="s92">So when he found that in his Bible and found other Bible truth, well, he decided that other people should know about it, and he became a very active Witness just shortly before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q. Do you have any pictures of your parents that we might see at this time, perhaps back in that period of time?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A. Well, I have only one picture, or two I should say, with my father.</span> <span id="s95">This is my father and me when I was about 6 years old in the mountain region.</span> <span id="s96">And the other one is --</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q. Would you hold that up a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A. And the other one is my father as a young artist back in 1916.</span> <span id="s99">No, that's not a good one.</span> <span id="s100">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s101">This is a good one.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q. Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A.</span> <span id="s104">So those are the only two pictures I have of my parents just before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q. I see.</span> <span id="s106">Now, what did you expect then when the war started with your new religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A. Well, we expected to be arrested.</span> <span id="s108">We knew that it was impossible in this regime, the Nazi regime, to keep our high standards of neutrality and love of the neighbor when pressure, political pressure had come upon us.</span> <span id="s109">So we knew exactly.</span> <span id="s110">We were expecting to get in trouble, but we didn't believe it would go so fast because we had no problems with our neighbors.</span> <span id="s111">It was a peaceful family.</span> <span id="s112">So we thought that maybe we could get through a certain time, you know, but things turned out differently.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q.</span> <span id="s114">So when was the period or what year and month do you remember that it all collapsed?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A.</span> <span id="s116">It collapsed the 4th September 1941.</span> <span id="s117">My father was arrested in his working place.</span> <span id="s118">And he was brought to the police.</span> <span id="s119">But we, my mother and myself, we didn't know anything about that.</span> <span id="s120">So two o'clock in the afternoon, the time my father would come home from work, the bell rang.</span> <span id="s121">I opened the door.</span> <span id="s122">I thought it was my father coming in.</span> <span id="s123">And there were two men shouting, "Heil Hitler."</span> <span id="s124">They were the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s125">They came.</span> <span id="s126">They sent me in my room, and they had a cross questioning with my mother.</span> <span id="s127">They wanted to have the addresses of all the Brothers.</span> <span id="s128">They wanted to know if we had the Watch Tower, if any secret connection.</span> <span id="s129">And that went on for four hours in our apartment.</span> <span id="s130">And my mother was doing a wonderful job.</span> <span id="s131">She never would betray anybody.</span> <span id="s132">Worked very hard.</span> <span id="s133">One would write down her answer and come back on it.</span> <span id="s134">Every time they would think they could squeeze something out, they would just come back on it.</span> <span id="s135">And during that time I got scared because I thought, we have a Bible the Germans don't like because it has the name Jehovah in there.</span> <span id="s136">It's the Albert Frieder Bible (ph).</span> <span id="s137">I knew where it was.</span> <span id="s138">So I went hiding that Bible in the garden of our neighbor, thinking that it would be better that the thing wouldn't be home.</span> <span id="s139">Well, the police didn't check our house, and we felt a little bit surprised about that, you know.</span> <span id="s140">At the end, that is, four hours later when they left mother, they were shouting from the street.</span> <span id="s141">We were living up in the second floor of the house.</span> <span id="s142">They were shouting from the street, "If you want to see your husband, he's in our hands."</span> <span id="s143">And they said, "Anyhow, you won't see him anymore whatsoever.</span> <span id="s144">And you and your child will be soon in the same place."</span> <span id="s145">And my mother cried, "That doesn't depend on you.</span> <span id="s146">It depends on God."</span> <span id="s147">So we knew that he was arrested.</span> <span id="s148">And mother went to prison to find out if she could get in touch with father, and it wasn't possible.</span> <span id="s149">We didn't know where he was.</span> <span id="s150">She wanted to get money.</span> <span id="s151">The bank was closed.</span> <span id="s152">She wanted to go working.</span> <span id="s153">The working car was taken away.</span> <span id="s154">She couldn't work anymore.</span> <span id="s155">We were staying without money.</span> <span id="s156">They arrested daddy on the day of payment.</span> <span id="s157">He had his whole payment of September month with him.</span> <span id="s158">So we didn't have any money.</span> <span id="s159">We didn't have -- my mother couldn't work.</span> <span id="s160">There just wouldn't be work for this kind of people like we were, you know.</span> <span id="s161">So there was a group of Witnesses.</span> <span id="s162">There were only about 30.</span> <span id="s163">They gave mother some work, mending and sewing.</span> <span id="s164">So she would go to one and then the other.</span> <span id="s165">And a Brother, a good friend of my father stepped in to do the raising, the spiritual, and material also.</span> <span id="s166">And Brother Kerr Adolf was a very important Brother in connection with the Watch Tower, which we got in France, which we copied nights, put it in German, and sent it over to Germany.</span> <span id="s167">And he was one of the main link in this underground work.</span> <span id="s168">And I had the privilege to work in this underground until I was arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q. And how old are you at this time while you were doing this?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A. Well, I started out at 11 years.</span> <span id="s171">And we would go the first Sunday each month to a certain place to get the Watch Tower.</span> <span id="s172">It was put in a certain place.</span> <span id="s173">And we would come down and have the translation done.</span> <span id="s174">And so it happened that the Congregational Communals became a link for the Watch Tower to go over to Freiburg, Germany and to some other parts, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q.</span> <span id="s176">So all of the Witnesses at this time in your little town were not put into prison?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A. Well, after my father was arrested, some other Brothers were arrested.</span> <span id="s178">There was Brother Hube (ph) was arrested.</span> <span id="s179">He died in concentration camp in Dachau.</span> <span id="s180">He was 64 years old.</span> <span id="s181">He was a faithful man with the hope of heavenly reward for his faithfulness.</span> <span id="s182">There was Brother Sarin (ph).</span> <span id="s183">He had two children.</span> <span id="s184">Brother Lenz (ph), who had five children.</span> <span id="s185">And Brother Dosman (ph).</span> <span id="s186">They all were arrested.</span> <span id="s187">And we expected mother and I to be arrested, and we were waiting for it, and it didn't come, you know.</span> <span id="s188">So there was a little time when no one was arrested.</span> <span id="s189">Some calm.</span> <span id="s190">And then suddenly two families were sent off.</span> <span id="s191">The Gestapo come nights and say you take your luggage, 30 kilos luggage, each one, and you go to south of France.</span> <span id="s192">Now this family was Chadonney (ph) and Chalar (ph).</span> <span id="s193">They were -- they had to leave all their house and everything, their belongings, and they were brought to south of France.</span> <span id="s194">Then after that came the arrest of a Sister.</span> <span id="s195">There is a lady who studied with my mother who became a Witness.</span> <span id="s196">And she started off discussing the Bible.</span> <span id="s197">She was working in a restaurant.</span> <span id="s198">She started off discussing the Bible with a man.</span> <span id="s199">He wanted to come to the underground meeting.</span> <span id="s200">Mother gave her the counsel not to let him come.</span> <span id="s201">Just keep on studying.</span> <span id="s202">So he got impatient, and after two months of that, he turned his collar.</span> <span id="s203">He was a Gestapo.</span> <span id="s204">And he arrested her.</span> <span id="s205">So he was mad because he couldn't get into the group through her.</span> <span id="s206">So during this time, her own -- no, this was Sister Gret (ph) was her name.</span> <span id="s207">And her sis -- Gret's (ph) sister, who was also Witness, was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s208">She just went for an operation.</span> <span id="s209">And two days after the operation, her husband came with two Gestapo and her husband said, "Now this one is also a Witness.</span> <span id="s210">I don't want her home anymore."</span> <span id="s211">So they arrested her.</span> <span id="s212">And she got a shock.</span> <span id="s213">She lost her speech.</span> <span id="s214">For over one year she couldn't speak anymore.</span> <span id="s215">So she was put to camp.</span> <span id="s216">And during all this pressure time it looks like they forgot my mother.</span> <span id="s217">I was gone already.</span> <span id="s218">I was already in prison when this happened, you know.</span> <span id="s219">This happened after my departure.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q. All right.</span> <span id="s221">Well, would you tell us then what happened to you, how old you were when you were picked up on that day and so on, how it all came about.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A.</span> <span id="s223">This is quite a story.</span> <span id="s224">As I said, I was in the school.</span> <span id="s225">And, you know, the regime, the Nazi regime, asked that every time a teacher would come into the class the class would have to stand up and say "Heil Hitler."</span> <span id="s226">Now, something very peculiar about that which I would like to mention, which I think is interesting.</span> <span id="s227">When the priest used to come into the class, he would greet the class by the words, "Blessed be the one that comes in the name of Christ."</span> <span id="s228">And as soon as the Germans were there, the same priest would say, "Heil Hitler, blessed be the name -- be the one that comes in the name of Christ."</span> <span id="s229">And in all the schools they put the picture of Hitler down -- up and the cross down, so you had just in every class, you know, the picture of Hitler, and underneath, you know, the cross, because Alsace-Lorraine is a very strong Catholic country.</span> <span id="s230">So when the priest came, I didn't want to stay in his class, so I had to wait outside.</span> <span id="s231">And when I was waiting outside, the teacher came by.</span> <span id="s232">I didn't see her.</span> <span id="s233">So I didn't salute her.</span> <span id="s234">So she came back on me.</span> <span id="s235">She asked me to salute with Heil Hitler.</span> <span id="s236">I refused.</span> <span id="s237">She asked me why.</span> <span id="s238">So I told her that according to the Bible, the heil belongs only to the highest because he is the name that is given in which salvation can be given to men, not through a man.</span> <span id="s239">So she got upset about that.</span> <span id="s240">She crossed the road and went to the main director.</span> <span id="s241">So my teacher called me in the following day and said, "Don't do what you do because you cannot resist the German spirit."</span> <span id="s242">He even gave me the counsel, he said, "I am a Baptist, and you can see I am saluting the flag with the left hand, not with the right.</span> <span id="s243">And when I do so, I say to myself, God knows I don't want to, though this is only to save my life, but my heart is with God.</span> <span id="s244">So do the same thing.</span> <span id="s245">Salute with the left hand."</span> <span id="s246">I said, "I don't compromise.</span> <span id="s247">The heil is only for Jesus.</span> <span id="s248">I just cannot compromise."</span> <span id="s249">So the following day a letter came along, and the letter read that a child is not subduing to the ideology of Nazism and so on, and the government will give it a week time to think the situation over.</span> <span id="s250">If not, the child has to leave school and go back to common school.</span> <span id="s251">And it was written underneath on that paper, it was written, "This letter has to be read by Simone Arnold."</span> <span id="s252">So Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, I did nothing else but go from class to class in all the classes and have that letter read to the children.</span> <span id="s253">So I read that letter about 60 times, about 60 classes, boys and girls, you know.</span> <span id="s254">And on Saturday morning when we came to the class, no teacher, nobody was there.</span> <span id="s255">The children were all seated.</span> <span id="s256">Comes the director, and the teacher comes in, so the class was already scared.</span> <span id="s257">Nobody knew I had -- I was the one that had the trouble.</span> <span id="s258">So he started off giving a talk about the freedom -- yes, the freedom -- of Nazism, giving me the choice.</span> <span id="s259">I was free to choose to stay in school or to leave and what that meant for the future, of course, and then something he said, "Now the child who recognizes himself gets up."</span> <span id="s260">So I stood up.</span> <span id="s261">Everybody in the class went "Ohhh," because they didn't believe I would be the one.</span> <span id="s262">So they said, "All right.</span> <span id="s263">We give you five minutes, five minutes from now on.</span> <span id="s264">Here is your papers to leave the class, or you salute in front of everybody.</span> <span id="s265">Get up here in front of Hitler's picture."</span> <span id="s266">That was the cross and Hitler's picture on top, you know.</span> <span id="s267">So I got up there, and my heart was beating.</span> <span id="s268">My head was just thick like that, you know.</span> <span id="s269">I felt almost like fainting.</span> <span id="s270">And I just said "I just want to be faithful, faithful, faithful.</span> <span id="s271">I want that paper he has in his hands.</span> <span id="s272">I want nothing else but the paper.</span> <span id="s273">I want to leave."</span> <span id="s274">So he got up.</span> <span id="s275">He looked five minutes on his watch.</span> <span id="s276">You could hear a fly flying.</span> <span id="s277">The breath got really heavy with the children, you know, crushing situation.</span> <span id="s278">And suddenly he stood up and said, "Heil Hitler."</span> <span id="s279">And the whole class "Heil Hitler," standing there, stiff like anything, and he took the paper and run away.</span> <span id="s280">So that was the beginning of the problems.</span> <span id="s281">That was suddenly.</span> <span id="s282">And one day I had to go to the common school.</span> <span id="s283">Mother came along with me.</span> <span id="s284">And there the director said, "I do not accept the child who doesn't salute.</span> <span id="s285">I don't want her."</span> <span id="s286">So mother said, "All right.</span> <span id="s287">Give me the paper.</span> <span id="s288">I cannot keep the child home.</span> <span id="s289">The child has to go, according to law, to school.</span> <span id="s290">So give me a paper."</span> <span id="s291">She said, "I cannot raise my child myself.</span> <span id="s292">I don't need you.</span> <span id="s293">But I need your paper.</span> <span id="s294">You give me the right to do it."</span> <span id="s295">So he couldn't do that.</span> <span id="s296">So he said, "All right, she will stay here, but the promise that she doesn't talk to no one at school about the reason why she has been sent off from high school down to common school again.</span> <span id="s297">I don't want any propaganda.</span> <span id="s298">Not a word."</span> <span id="s299">To tell you the truth, this is easy to say, but it's hard to live because children get very mean.</span> <span id="s300">When I got up to that class, they said, "Ha, you are back here.</span> <span id="s301">What did you do?</span> <span id="s302">Did you steal?</span> <span id="s303">Did you lie?</span> <span id="s304">Did you" -- and I had to keep quiet.</span> <span id="s305">I just couldn't talk.</span> <span id="s306">So it went on for weeks and weeks.</span> <span id="s307">And suddenly, the child who was seated next to me -- I should say they sent me in the end of the class with the mention nobody should take care after me.</span> <span id="s308">No lesson.</span> <span id="s309">No repeat.</span> <span id="s310">Nothing.</span> <span id="s311">Just like I wouldn't be there.</span> <span id="s312">I was very small.</span> <span id="s313">They put me with the tallest one in the back.</span> <span id="s314">Just forgotten in the class.</span> <span id="s315">So I was next to the tall lady.</span> <span id="s316">That tall girl, I should say.</span> <span id="s317">And then one day she said to me, "Oh, I figured out why you have been sent off from high school.</span> <span id="s318">You are just a French patriot.</span> <span id="s319">You're just against the Nazis.</span> <span id="s320">And you are fighting for the French government."</span> <span id="s321">Well, that was too much for me because that's not the reason I was there.</span> <span id="s322">So I just said to her, "No, I'm here because I'm a Christian."</span> <span id="s323">She said, "No, I'm a Christian too."</span> <span id="s324">I said, "That's not possible because a Christian just gives the heil to Christ.</span> <span id="s325">He cannot give the heil to a man.</span> <span id="s326">That doesn't fit together."</span> <span id="s327">So then we started off talking about the matter, and she refused to salute.</span> <span id="s328">Now, when she refused to salute, the teacher knew I was talking.</span> <span id="s329">So the whole thing went over and over again.</span> <span id="s330">The next point I had to go to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s331">The Gestapo came.</span> <span id="s332">It was supposed to be two psychiatrists.</span> <span id="s333">They wanted to know how I reason.</span> <span id="s334">So we went with mother there.</span> <span id="s335">There was a room, whitewashed.</span> <span id="s336">My mother had to sit behind me.</span> <span id="s337">I got a big glass in the face.</span> <span id="s338">One would ask me one question, and at the same time the other one would ask me the other question.</span> <span id="s339">It went about like this, just an example.</span> <span id="s340">"Give me the names of the five continents."</span> <span id="s341">And at the same time the other would say, "You had a meeting last night, did you?</span> <span id="s342">Yes or not."</span> <span id="s343">The other would say, "Give me the name of the river, the River."</span> <span id="s344">And the other said, "You got the Watch Tower on the board.</span> <span id="s345">Did you?</span> <span id="s346">Yes or not."</span> <span id="s347">And it went on like that for almost one hour.</span> <span id="s348">And I got weaker and weaker and weaker.</span> <span id="s349">And suddenly the phone rang and the men had to leave, and I couldn't conclude anything.</span> <span id="s350">And I'm happy to say even so I was a child and I knew everything, I knew where the Watch Tower came from and where it went when it was done underground, I was able to keep quiet and not give out the names of the other Witnesses.</span> <span id="s351">So after that, most probably the director of the school, I guess, got some news about this.</span> <span id="s352">He decided that my class should go to a Hitler camp.</span> <span id="s353">The whole class was supposed to pay for it on top of it, you know.</span> <span id="s354">So I thought I better refuse to go there in the beginning because in those Hitler camps they would salute the flag in the morning, in the evening, and the songs and all that.</span> <span id="s355">So I thought I better refuse in the beginning.</span> <span id="s356">It might be very hard, but at least it won't be every day.</span> <span id="s357">The class left for 14 days.</span> <span id="s358">So when he heard that, he got so mean.</span> <span id="s359">He took me in his class.</span> <span id="s360">He was having the class going up and down and up and down on their feet for about three hours' time.</span> <span id="s361">And he was there and he said, "It's because of her.</span> <span id="s362">It's because of her."</span> <span id="s363">Then he called every child to give him back his work, you know, and he was slapping the face with it and throwing the thing in the class.</span> <span id="s364">"It's because of her."</span> <span id="s365">And he expected the whole class to get on me when I came out of the school.</span> <span id="s366">And it was the opposite.</span> <span id="s367">Those children were smaller ones.</span> <span id="s368">I was 12 years old then.</span> <span id="s369">They must have been about 9.</span> <span id="s370">They came to me and said, "You keep going.</span> <span id="s371">Keep strong against him."</span> <span id="s372">They didn't know why.</span> <span id="s373">They absolutely didn't know the reason, but the fact they most probably didn't like the man, so they felt that my resistance would be to some good against him.</span> <span id="s374">So at the end of the week he asked me to do a certain kind of work a Witness just wouldn't do.</span> <span id="s375">Now, this is also peculiar to war time.</span> <span id="s376">The Germans asked -- that is the Nazis asked -- to bring every week three pounds of material to school, which would be bones or paper or material or cans, empty cans.</span> <span id="s377">And this, of course, for war reasons.</span> <span id="s378">I never brought a single paper in there.</span> <span id="s379">So it was written in a border.</span> <span id="s380">My border was completely empty.</span> <span id="s381">So he knew I wouldn't do that.</span> <span id="s382">So at the end of the week he said, "Now you go there where the stock was and you put the paper in one corner, and you put the bones in the other, and you put the cans in the other, and you work in there."</span> <span id="s383">So I was standing there, and I refused to do that.</span> <span id="s384">So when he came, he asked me why I hadn't worked.</span> <span id="s385">So I said, "As a Christian, I don't work for war."</span> <span id="s386">He said, "That's stupid.</span> <span id="s387">What does paper to do with war?"</span> <span id="s388">I said, "Well, if I take the paper away and the material away, I have the cans, and the cans I know is going to work for war."</span> <span id="s389">So he said, "That's stupid because when you work in a garden and raise potatoes and the soldiers are going to eat the potatoes, then you are also responsible for war."</span> <span id="s390">And I said, "Well, I'm not responsible for what a man does with the potatoes when he eats.</span> <span id="s391">I'm responsible for moral reasons.</span> <span id="s392">I just won't do that work."</span> <span id="s393">So he jumped up again.</span> <span id="s394">He was beating me with the edge of the hand in the neck.</span> <span id="s395">And I fell unconscious in those bones and papers and everything lying there until the kids came out from school.</span> <span id="s396">They found me there.</span> <span id="s397">They took me home.</span> <span id="s398">Mother got the doctor.</span> <span id="s399">The doctor said I should stay home a few days because I got hemorrhages.</span> <span id="s400">And two days after, the police came, caught me, brought me back to school, and the doctor said -- they went to the doctor and told to the doctor, "The next time you are writing one of Jehovah's Witnesses sick, you go to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s401">Those people have no right whatsoever."</span> <span id="s402">So in the meantime, the end of the school year came.</span> <span id="s403">I should say that in between somewhere I was called to the judgment, a regular judgment.</span> <span id="s404">And they are going to speak for the judge how good it would be if I could be a Nazi.</span> <span id="s405">I would get free schooling and so on and so forth, and a nice home and so on.</span> <span id="s406">And if not, the penitentiary home, and then afterwards the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s407">And they gave me the opportunity to sign exactly the same -- the same declaration they had in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s408">You know, they could resign, in camp.</span> <span id="s409">They could -- there was constantly a paper where they could resign their faith.</span> <span id="s410">How shall I say that?</span> <span id="s411">It was a document which was ready.</span> <span id="s412">The only ones -- only the Witnesses had that.</span> <span id="s413">Nobody else could go out of the camp except the Witnesses.</span> <span id="s414">There was a paper they could go to the commander and ask to sign a resignation -- is that English?</span> <span id="s415">Resignation?</span> <span id="s416">Is it?</span> <span id="s417">A resignation that I am not a Witness anymore, you see.</span> <span id="s418">So he gave me the resignation, and he gave the condemnation.</span> <span id="s419">So I signed the condemnation.</span> <span id="s420">So I knew from that time on that I would be arrested from one day to the other, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q. Well, what was it about your belief that was so strong that kept you going on --</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A. Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q. -- with this resolute stand?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A. I should say my mother, the letters of my father, the help of Brother Kerr, that all kept my determination alive by the reading and always my mother used always to stress the point that love for God is the only way to prove love to man because after God will help to do the things God wants us to do, and this is positive for our neighbors.</span> <span id="s425">So instead of looking on the neighbors what they do all believe, rather look on God what he's asking from us, live according to it, and then you will do good around you.</span> <span id="s426">So this was constantly given to me as a teaching.</span> <span id="s427">She always mentioned that a Christian shouldn't be double-minded.</span> <span id="s428">Christian should be humble, shouldn't resist with a resisting spirit but with the integrity spirit.</span> <span id="s429">And she always made the difference between resisting and integrity.</span> <span id="s430">Integrity is one thing, and resisting is another.</span> <span id="s431">And she always said, "You don't resist.</span> <span id="s432">You do everything you can to live in peace with your neighbors, but the integrity gives you the borders as far as you can go."</span> <span id="s433">So this helped me along all the time because the time came where I had to stay away from my parents.</span> <span id="s434">There was no contact anymore.</span> <span id="s435">But she really knew how to get that point specifically across, you know.</span> <span id="s436">So it happened that I went back to school.</span> <span id="s437">The children had come back from that camp, you know.</span> <span id="s438">And the whole class was against me.</span> <span id="s439">Nobody talked to me anymore.</span> <span id="s440">I wondered what was going on.</span> <span id="s441">Came the last day, school day, before the summer vacation.</span> <span id="s442">They gathered the whole class together.</span> <span id="s443">All the classes, I should say, boys and girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q.</span> <span id="s445">About how many?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A. Oh, about 800.</span> <span id="s447">And they had them on a square with the flag in the middle for the flag ceremonies, the three times Heil Hitler, you know, and the song, the songs, I should say.</span> <span id="s448">There were two or three different songs.</span> <span id="s449">The children were standing there all with their hands lifted up, you know, and they had me in the middle of it, completely isolated.</span> <span id="s450">And I was standing straight.</span> <span id="s451">And inside shivering, cold.</span> <span id="s452">I get the same feeling, you know, being a very, very small little chick completely lost.</span> <span id="s453">And the speech came that the school is going to have a demonstration, what it means to be resisting to Nazism.</span> <span id="s454">And the ceremony went on, and I expected that I could get beaten or something would happen to me.</span> <span id="s455">And nothing happened.</span> <span id="s456">Nothing.</span> <span id="s457">Everybody left.</span> <span id="s458">I wondered what was going on.</span> <span id="s459">I went home.</span> <span id="s460">I had a funny feeling, a feeling of emptiness.</span> <span id="s461">I don't know.</span> <span id="s462">I was walking home.</span> <span id="s463">I said, "What does it all mean?</span> <span id="s464">Such a big demonstration and nothing to it.</span> <span id="s465">No punishment.</span> <span id="s466">Nothing to it."</span> <span id="s467">I opened the door of the apartment.</span> <span id="s468">My room was on the end place.</span> <span id="s469">The door was open.</span> <span id="s470">My clothes was lying there.</span> <span id="s471">Mother wasn't there.</span> <span id="s472">On the table, a letter.</span> <span id="s473">I looked at the letter.</span> <span id="s474">The following morning at 8 o'clock was the time for departure for the penitentiary home.</span> <span id="s475">So my mother was on the balcony.</span> <span id="s476">When she saw that I had read the letter, she came over, she took me in her arms and she said, "You know, Simone, you're now going to be a grown-up girl.</span> <span id="s477">You'll be off all by yourself.</span> <span id="s478">Your God, our God, will help you.</span> <span id="s479">Jehovah will be with you as long as you are faithful to him.</span> <span id="s480">So take this as an education for your future life.</span> <span id="s481">What's going to happen now will help you later on during your lifetime.</span> <span id="s482">And I'm sure that Jehovah is going to help you."</span> <span id="s483">So the following morning, I went to the station with my mother.</span> <span id="s484">And there were two ladies waiting for me.</span> <span id="s485">And I was supposed to take the train to go to Konstanz in Germany where the penitentiary home was located.</span> <span id="s486">And mother wanted to go with them.</span> <span id="s487">And the lady said, "No, you just cannot come."</span> <span id="s488">She said, "Why not?</span> <span id="s489">That's a regular train.</span> <span id="s490">I can take the regular train."</span> <span id="s491">So she took a ticket and went on the train.</span> <span id="s492">Now, while we were on the train, those were the old trains where you had to go on the trains on the platform.</span> <span id="s493">On every end of the wagon would be a platform, you see.</span> <span id="s494">So while we're traveling there, mother said to the ladies, "Now, can I step on the platform with my child?</span> <span id="s495">I would like to talk to her."</span> <span id="s496">And they said, "All right.</span> <span id="s497">As soon as you come in when we go into a station, you know.</span> <span id="s498">Okay."</span> <span id="s499">So we made the trip from Melhouse to the Swatzvelt (ph) to Konstanz.</span> <span id="s500">On the platform it was raining, cold.</span> <span id="s501">It was night.</span> <span id="s502">June 1943.</span> <span id="s503">It was cold.</span> <span id="s504">It was raining.</span> <span id="s505">And there my mother took me in her arms and she went over Bible examples like Daniel who was faithful in the lion's ditch and the three Hebrews and the fire oven and the first Christians, and she brought out the faithfulness of father who was already in camp three years and so on.</span> <span id="s506">And she kept giving me counsel how I should be polite and work hard and never have any problems with submission or with the -- I mean, a child who was agreeable was polite.</span> <span id="s507">And even so the people wouldn't be nice to me, I was supposed to be nice to them.</span> <span id="s508">And then she gave me a counsel, a counsel that truly went on all my life.</span> <span id="s509">She said, "When a person gets mean in front of you, instead of looking at the mean face of the person, instead of trembling," well, she said, "Simone, why don't you look at far above and see how the angels agree to your integrity, your steps of integrity.</span> <span id="s510">If you can visualize the satisfaction of the angels and of God and of Christ, you just won't see those ugly faces anymore."</span> <span id="s511">And I can say that it is true.</span> <span id="s512">This has helped me along.</span> <span id="s513">So we came to Konstanz, and as we arrived in that place, well, a lady there said that she couldn't take me because the papers were not yet there.</span> <span id="s514">So mother asked where we could go overnight.</span> <span id="s515">So she said, "Why don't you go to Meersburg -- that's the other side of the lake -- for the last night, and you step in tomorrow."</span> <span id="s516">The two ladies were excited.</span> <span id="s517">They didn't want that.</span> <span id="s518">But we managed to go to the other place.</span> <span id="s519">We went to the hotel, and after the hotel we went to a vineyard.</span> <span id="s520">It's a country with vineyards.</span> <span id="s521">We went to the vineyard because mother didn't feel like being able to talk in the hotel because of the ears of people around, you know.</span> <span id="s522">She wanted to go out.</span> <span id="s523">So there with mother we had our last prayer.</span> <span id="s524">We were singing a song together.</span> <span id="s525">It's an old song which said, "Shall we meet again?</span> <span id="s526">Yes, in the resurrection," because we expected to die.</span> <span id="s527">We just didn't think it would be possible to go through living with this whole pressure on us.</span> <span id="s528">So there we were on our knees, and we prayed and we sang together.</span> <span id="s529">We went back to the hotel.</span> <span id="s530">For the last time my mother put me to bed.</span> <span id="s531">And the following morning the things went very quick.</span> <span id="s532">Had to take the boat.</span> <span id="s533">We came to the house.</span> <span id="s534">The door opened.</span> <span id="s535">As soon as the lady saw us, she called another girl.</span> <span id="s536">She said, "Take her away."</span> <span id="s537">I couldn't say goodbye to my mother.</span> <span id="s538">It was just like that.</span> <span id="s539">They showed me my bed, how the house was running, and that was it.</span> <span id="s540">It was just like that.</span> <span id="s541">It was a complete different atmosphere.</span> <span id="s542">As human like it was the day before, it was like a prison door.</span> <span id="s543">Well, the house wasn't a prison, I mean, but it looked -- the impact was really that, you know.</span> <span id="s544">So you might wonder maybe what kind of life there is in such a home.</span> <span id="s545">Well, this home was about 200 years old.</span> <span id="s546">It was founded by Visenbark (ph).</span> <span id="s547">He was a bishop.</span> <span id="s548">Wouldn't give his property to the church but gave it to the City of Konstanz for orphans.</span> <span id="s549">And Hitler changed it over to a penitentiary home for girls.</span> <span id="s550">And there were about 35 girls there between 6 and 15 years old.</span> <span id="s551">All those girls were there for reasons of bad conduct, thieves or things like that, you know.</span> <span id="s552">We had no right to talk to each other.</span> <span id="s553">Never.</span> <span id="s554">Not a word.</span> <span id="s555">We got up at morning at 5:30.</span> <span id="s556">We only had cold water to wash.</span> <span id="s557">We had 37 children.</span> <span id="s558">No men do the work.</span> <span id="s559">All the works were done by the children.</span> <span id="s560">We made our own food production, the garden, everything.</span> <span id="s561">The wash was still washing in the hands, you know, with practically no soap.</span> <span id="s562">And that brings up my first experience because when I came there, it was in the morning, the 10th of June.</span> <span id="s563">They gave me six pair of socks to mend, with the mention of nothing to eat tonight if they're not done.</span> <span id="s564">And they had to be done very nicely, not just putting them together, you know.</span> <span id="s565">One stitch after the other like embroidering.</span> <span id="s566">Well, my mother had taught me sewing and cooking before I left.</span> <span id="s567">That made my life very easy in comparison to the others who came there and didn't know anything and got beaten until they understood what they should do, you know.</span> <span id="s568">Whatever they would give me to do, my mother had thought of it.</span> <span id="s569">I had learned it before with her the easier way.</span> <span id="s570">So I did the mending, but I was crying and crying and crying, and the tears were just running down, and the socks got wet.</span> <span id="s571">It was a hard time to get the wool through, but anyhow, the evening and the night I was crying and crying.</span> <span id="s572">And there I got hemorrhages again.</span> <span id="s573">And in the morning my bed was flooded with blood the first day.</span> <span id="s574">I said, "Goodness, what's going to happen to me now?"</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q. Were you hemorrhaging from the nose?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A. No, no.</span> <span id="s577">I was a girl and I started off a woman's problem, you know.</span> <span id="s578">So I waited until the teacher came.</span> <span id="s579">The first one who came across said, "What happened?"</span> <span id="s580">She called a girl.</span> <span id="s581">She said, "Show her how to wash her sheet."</span> <span id="s582">So I was standing there outside, without shoes.</span> <span id="s583">The shoes were taken away the first of April till the first of November.</span> <span id="s584">We're barefooted, standing outside with cold water with that thing to wash.</span> <span id="s585">I couldn't get the stain out of that thing.</span> <span id="s586">I was rubbing, rubbing, completely -- my hand was bloody from rubbing, you know.</span> <span id="s587">It was hard, the material.</span> <span id="s588">And I started crying again.</span> <span id="s589">There I cried and cried.</span> <span id="s590">Then she came out of to the door.</span> <span id="s591">I still can see that woman.</span> <span id="s592">She stood up and said, "Ah ha, you're crying?</span> <span id="s593">Why, ask your Jehovah to wash your sheet."</span> <span id="s594">Well, I looked at her, I dried up my tears, and I promised to Jehovah never should I cry anymore in this place because this cannot be that a Witness is giving a bad witness the strength God has given.</span> <span id="s595">And that was it.</span> <span id="s596">She did lots of times try to get me out again in the same condition, but this had helped me, you know, straighten up a little bit my sentimental reactions.</span> <span id="s597">So no letters from the parents.</span> <span id="s598">No contact.</span> <span id="s599">Nothing for several months.</span> <span id="s600">And then something outstanding happened.</span> <span id="s601">When we had to work in the afternoon, either the garden or washing house or whatever, whatever you did, you always had a second girl with you.</span> <span id="s602">You couldn't even go to the toilet alone.</span> <span id="s603">They would always give you someone with you, you see.</span> <span id="s604">So in the afternoon, we got the work, and that peculiar day I was supposed to go to get some fruits out in the garden.</span> <span id="s605">But this was in the front of the house, and no child was supposed to go to the front.</span> <span id="s606">That was just on the edge, you know.</span> <span id="s607">So I asked -- my name was Maria in this place.</span> <span id="s608">Simone being French, they didn't want to pronounce a French name, you know.</span> <span id="s609">This is against Nazism, the French language.</span> <span id="s610">This is forbidden.</span> <span id="s611">So they called me Maria.</span> <span id="s612">And she said, "Maria, you go there and get this fruit in."</span> <span id="s613">So I said, "With whom?"</span> <span id="s614">So she looked and she said, "Not much work.</span> <span id="s615">You go alone."</span> <span id="s616">Well, I went there.</span> <span id="s617">It was near the street.</span> <span id="s618">And the whole property was surrounded by greens, you know.</span> <span id="s619">You couldn't look in.</span> <span id="s620">But on that particular place where I was supposed to work there was one of those trees dead.</span> <span id="s621">So you could look through.</span> <span id="s622">I was there picking up those fruits.</span> <span id="s623">Suddenly I heard a voice, "Simone.</span> <span id="s624">Simone."</span> <span id="s625">I looked.</span> <span id="s626">And who was on the other side but Brother and Sister Kerr.</span> <span id="s627">They come in the morning.</span> <span id="s628">They wanted to see me.</span> <span id="s629">And they're told "No visit.</span> <span id="s630">No right to visit."</span> <span id="s631">But in the afternoon before they took the train back home disappointed, they thought, let's walk once more in front of the property to get the feeling of the place.</span> <span id="s632">So there I was, and he said, "Your mother is fine.</span> <span id="s633">She's very, very strong.</span> <span id="s634">She keeps going.</span> <span id="s635">The letters of your father are good.</span> <span id="s636">And how are you?"</span> <span id="s637">I said, "My faith is as strong as it was when I came."</span> <span id="s638">We didn't talk much, but that really brought a lot of help to me and to my parents because they could go back and say to mother, "We have seen her face, and she's doing all right."</span> <span id="s639">So after that I was in total isolation until November.</span> <span id="s640">In November they called me again for another judgment.</span> <span id="s641">They wanted to see what it had done to me, you know, the hard life and everything else.</span> <span id="s642">I should say that on Sunday, the children would go to church.</span> <span id="s643">Well, the first Sunday, the two Catholics went to Catholic church and the 33 Protestants went to the Protestant church.</span> <span id="s644">So I thought I'm going to ask if I could read the Bible.</span> <span id="s645">Now, we had Bibles because it's made mostly of Protestants.</span> <span id="s646">So Bibles were there, you know.</span> <span id="s647">So, okay, the first Sunday, the director -- she was an elderly woman -- she gave me the right to read the Bible.</span> <span id="s648">Now, when the Catholic teacher came back, the one who told me the story that God should help me to wash my sheet, she heard that I had read the Bible.</span> <span id="s649">She got upset about it.</span> <span id="s650">And she decided that from that time on, on Sunday I should do the cooking for the whole house.</span> <span id="s651">So from that day on, I did the cooking for the 35 children and the special cooking for the teachers.</span> <span id="s652">I was too small to twirl in the pots, so I had to step on a ladder in order to be able to turn the big pot because 35 people that's lots of -- that's quite a quantity.</span> <span id="s653">And I couldn't read the Bible anymore.</span> <span id="s654">But about the same time, that lady asked me too to clean her room.</span> <span id="s655">It was already privileged work, you know.</span> <span id="s656">And by cleaning the room, I was supposed to go every day under the bed to clean under the bed.</span> <span id="s657">There shouldn't be a bit of dust nowhere.</span> <span id="s658">And I was lying under there, and I should say that I was able -- I was able when I came to the place to get a little Bible into that home.</span> <span id="s659">And I put that little Bible underneath the bed in the -- what do you call -- where the mattress is on --</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q. Springs?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A.</span> <span id="s662">The springs.</span> <span id="s663">Thank you.</span> <span id="s664">To put it in the springs.</span> <span id="s665">And she was lying on there.</span> <span id="s666">I was always thinking I hope the Bible doesn't fall on the floor because the lady was lying on the Bible.</span> <span id="s667">Every day I would go cleaning underneath, I would read my Bible there.</span> <span id="s668">There was a way to keep Bible reading.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q.</span> <span id="s670">It was under her bed.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A.</span> <span id="s672">Her bed, yeah, in her room.</span> <span id="s673">So when judgment time came upon, well, the same problem.</span> <span id="s674">The resignation was against there, and the other one, so I guess I did again sign the other one.</span> <span id="s675">And that was something because I was there before the paper, and I don't know why -- I still don't know why -- I took the paper and went signing it on another table, but I couldn't tell why I did that really.</span> <span id="s676">It was a feeling something could get wrong underneath.</span> <span id="s677">And according to the reaction of the judge, that must have been true.</span> <span id="s678">There must have been another paper underneath, a negative one.</span> <span id="s679">He got so mad about it.</span> <span id="s680">Most probably he thought that the negative signature would be sent to my father.</span> <span id="s681">And he got really excited and he said that I couldn't be recuperated.</span> <span id="s682">I was really the worst kind of person you can find and so on.</span> <span id="s683">He was nice to me before.</span> <span id="s684">The way he switched around, something wrong must have happened.</span> <span id="s685">Father told me later on that he got the double, the double of what I had signed.</span> <span id="s686">And he got beaten up because of it, mistreated because of my stand.</span> <span id="s687">But he was happy and took the stand in spite of the fact that he got mistreated, you know.</span> <span id="s688">So anyhow, from that day on I couldn't get letters.</span> <span id="s689">Then the sister in between my mother got arrested.</span> <span id="s690">I shall tell you later on about my mother's arrest.</span> <span id="s691">But in between my aunt came to visit me, the sister of my mother.</span> <span id="s692">And she would take along the Watch Tower.</span> <span id="s693">Now, the first time we had a little walk together.</span> <span id="s694">The second time we're two hours together.</span> <span id="s695">The third time we had the day off.</span> <span id="s696">And there is an interesting story about it because the lady said, always the teacher, she said, "Well, why don't you go with Maria to Meersburg."</span> <span id="s697">Now, Meersburg was the last evening with my mother.</span> <span id="s698">Why she wanted me to go there, well, I suppose that she had some reason.</span> <span id="s699">Anyhow, we went there, my aunt and myself.</span> <span id="s700">And we went back to that vineyard where we had our last prayer with mother, and there in the vineyard we were studying the Watch Tower.</span> <span id="s701">And a time came where we were to take the boat to go back to Konstanz, and then suddenly I said to my aunt, "Well, if they ask me what I was doing the whole day, I won't be able to fill out the day because we were doing too much reading."</span> <span id="s702">So she said, "Let's have a quick look on the castle."</span> <span id="s703">There's a castle from the Middle Age, you know.</span> <span id="s704">We wanted to go there, and it was closed.</span> <span id="s705">It was closing.</span> <span id="s706">You couldn't take it anymore.</span> <span id="s707">So we bought cards, the inside sights.</span> <span id="s708">And on the boat, I was studying those cards, the cards she took along.</span> <span id="s709">And on Monday morning the teacher said, "Maria, why don't you tell us -- why don't you write down what you did yesterday."</span> <span id="s710">So I gave her whole details about the castle.</span> <span id="s711">And due to that, she said to my aunt when she came back, "Maria loves the lots of Germany.</span> <span id="s712">She loves the castles.</span> <span id="s713">So why don't you go and see another castle."</span> <span id="s714">I never visited the castle.</span> <span id="s715">We stayed in front of it with the Watch Tower and looked at the castle through the cards.</span> <span id="s716">So Jehovah helped me along to get spiritual food a few times.</span> <span id="s717">We couldn't write to each other, you know.</span> <span id="s718">I couldn't write to my father.</span> <span id="s719">I couldn't write to my mother.</span> <span id="s720">It was not possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q.</span> <span id="s722">Did you ever receive anything from them?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A. No.</span> <span id="s724">My aunt brought me -- because she was in freedom, so she could get our letters.</span> <span id="s725">And she would make the contact between one or the other, you see.</span> <span id="s726">And this kept on for 11 months.</span> <span id="s727">And then war condition made it impossible.</span> <span id="s728">So I didn't hear anything from my parents from August was her last visit, August '44 until April '45.</span> <span id="s729">Completely cut off, absolutely.</span> <span id="s730">Now, what mother's concern -- what I should say -- let's go back to my father's arrest because father was arrested, as I said before.</span> <span id="s731">It was not possible to find out where he was.</span> <span id="s732">And then suddenly we heard he was in Shimlick (ph).</span> <span id="s733">Shimlick (ph) was a special camp for the Alsatians.</span> <span id="s734">They made this camp -- every Alsatian who wouldn't work for the Nazis would go there for six weeks or something like that, you know, and then put in freedom again.</span> <span id="s735">And they told him, "Don't talk to no one but your soul.</span> <span id="s736">If you do talk about something, you go to concentration camp."</span> <span id="s737">So they came back, you know, thin.</span> <span id="s738">They wouldn't talk to no one.</span> <span id="s739">They would just follow the, you know, the houses like that.</span> <span id="s740">Each time you want to talk to them, they were afraid, they would go in, close themselves up.</span> <span id="s741">So everybody knew this was a terrifying condition.</span> <span id="s742">So the time came when we heard that daddy was there.</span> <span id="s743">He made his six weeks there, and then it was Dachau.</span> <span id="s744">He went to Dachau.</span> <span id="s745">All five of them went to Dachau.</span> <span id="s746">And there daddy told us quite a lot when he came out afterwards, you know.</span> <span id="s747">He is an artist.</span> <span id="s748">One SS had some contact with him and asked him to repaint his kitchen.</span> <span id="s749">So, okay, daddy was doing his kitchen.</span> <span id="s750">So he said, "You know, you're really an artist, and I think we -- I could use you for designing for printing material, you know.</span> <span id="s751">But in order to get you out of Dachau, you have to paint boxes where the army would hide pieces of military material, you know."</span> <span id="s752">Well, daddy said, "Well, this I won't do."</span> <span id="s753">The SS couldn't understand that he was accepting to work for him and not for the army.</span> <span id="s754">And father said, "Well, you are a human with your rights.</span> <span id="s755">You have -- it's your right you have a clean kitchen and a clean home.</span> <span id="s756">I'm not going to refuse you a clean home.</span> <span id="s757">But I'm certainly not going to work for war.</span> <span id="s758">Now what you're asking is for war.</span> <span id="s759">And that's why I don't do it."</span> <span id="s760">So he got again excited about him, you know, and he brought the whole matter in front of the commander, the head.</span> <span id="s761">And there daddy explained that they were making fun of the Witnesses, fun of Jehovah's name, and daddy got so shocked by the way they were talking against God, and he told them, "Sir, please don't use the name of Jehovah like you do because it's the Almighty's personal name."</span> <span id="s762">And then suddenly there was a silence in there.</span> <span id="s763">And daddy expected to be executed because of having dared saying that.</span> <span id="s764">And he said nothing has happened.</span> <span id="s765">But a few days later, he was taken to the doctor, and the doctor would inoculate him for malaria.</span> <span id="s766">He took a fly in a little cage and had it on his arm, and the fly was eating his blood.</span> <span id="s767">They figured out if he would survive on this or not because before about two or three months before that happened he had typhus, and he was 14 days unconscious on typhus.</span> <span id="s768">So the doctor thought that maybe he got an immunity of typhus, which would help malaria for the soldiers in North Africa.</span> <span id="s769">They were working for that.</span> <span id="s770">So daddy was walking around with a fly in there eating him up, and he didn't get sick.</span> <span id="s771">And one day he was on the list for extermination.</span> <span id="s772">The truck came to take him out to get exterminated.</span> <span id="s773">He was just stepping on it when the doctor came by and said, "What is this one doing here?</span> <span id="s774">I'm not through yet with experiments.</span> <span id="s775">So come down and come with me."</span> <span id="s776">He brought him back, and the experiment went on a little while, and then they decided to send him to Mauthausen, the extermination camp, which is the worst than Dachau.</span> <span id="s777">Now, in Dachau he said he had occasions to talk to some Catholic priests.</span> <span id="s778">There were quite a few Catholic priests in there.</span> <span id="s779">And daddy had talks with them, and he would ask them why they were in camp.</span> <span id="s780">And mostly of the priests they were there because either they were giving some food to some prisoners or they would have given some help to escape or hide Jews or would do any kind of, well, I should say, good works.</span> <span id="s781">But in reality, human good works.</span> <span id="s782">They had nothing to do with the standing of rights.</span> <span id="s783">They were not there because they were Catholics.</span> <span id="s784">They were just there because they were humans and they were resisting the system on the human basis, but not for integrity to a God.</span> <span id="s785">It was two different things.</span> <span id="s786">And mostly of the priests they agreed with father when they said they were not there because they were Catholics.</span> <span id="s787">They were there because of resisting the inhumane way the Nazis were handling the situation.</span> <span id="s788">As a matter of fact, Jehovah's Witnesses were the only ones who had the neutral stand because of their faith.</span> <span id="s789">They had no hatred against nobody.</span> <span id="s790">They were just there because integrity keeps us through God's principles.</span> <span id="s791">Daddy also told in Dachau he used to see the Nazis singing songs of Christmas, making big Christmas trees and singing religious songs, and they were covered with blood.</span> <span id="s792">They had drunk, they went out killing people, and they come back and they started off again singing Christmas songs.</span> <span id="s793">And I can say all his life after camp daddy couldn't hear any songs anymore.</span> <span id="s794">That always brought back to his mind those terrible sights of bloodshed through the streets, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q.</span> <span id="s796">You mean the songs about Christmas?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s798">He couldn't stand them anymore because he said it was something awful to see, people who were singing Christ's birth covered with blood.</span> <span id="s799">Anyhow, he was sent to Mauthausen, and in Mauthausen he was sent first to the camp because Mauthausen has lots of little camps all around.</span> <span id="s800">So he was sent to Mauthausen Gusen.</span> <span id="s801">You might have heard about the stairs of this camp where the prisoners had to carry their stones on the back, hundred seventy-five or hundred eighty-five -- I'm not sure of the number -- up and the killing that was going on there.</span> <span id="s802">It was something awful.</span> <span id="s803">He was working there for several weeks.</span> <span id="s804">And one day a Brother came, another Witness.</span> <span id="s805">He was from Konstanz, too.</span> <span id="s806">He made some electric repair.</span> <span id="s807">And he saw the triangle on father.</span> <span id="s808">So he got him out of the stair of the camp of Gusen, and he could bring him over to Ebensee, knowing Ebensee they had a system.</span> <span id="s809">It was a pool with hot water in there, and they would put some kind of chemicals in there and a cloth and put prisoners in it to walk this way, this way, this way, this way, this way, this way, to do the washing.</span> <span id="s810">They had water under here as hot as possible, the dogs behind, to get them turned round, round, round.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q. To act as an agitator within the water.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s813">So daddy was working in there.</span> <span id="s814">One day he got an order from an SS.</span> <span id="s815">He started to have troubles with his hearing.</span> <span id="s816">He didn't get the order.</span> <span id="s817">And he saw just the dog jumping at him.</span> <span id="s818">The dogs when they jumped, they jumped on the throat.</span> <span id="s819">He just could see it.</span> <span id="s820">So he switched over.</span> <span id="s821">He fell on the stair, and the SS put his foot on the neck and crushed the whole face in the stair.</span> <span id="s822">But he escaped.</span> <span id="s823">His life escaped.</span> <span id="s824">So he was there until the end.</span> <span id="s825">That was father's story.</span> <span id="s826">Now, what mother's concerned.</span> <span id="s827">My mother had brought me down to Konstanz, she came home, and she just couldn't stand the apartment anymore.</span> <span id="s828">Whatever she looked at, the paintings of daddy, the piano, my dolls and everything, it was too much on her.</span> <span id="s829">And she asked the Brothers not to come to visit her because she knew that everybody that would come in her house would be photographed and get in trouble with the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s830">So she had no contact anymore.</span> <span id="s831">And she also would go to no one for the same reason.</span> <span id="s832">So she decided to go to her mother, to her farm.</span> <span id="s833">Now, grandmother wasn't favorable for the Witnesses at all.</span> <span id="s834">She was raised a strong Catholic and she was Nazi-inclined, I'm sorry to say.</span> <span id="s835">Grandfather was French, as I said in the beginning.</span> <span id="s836">Grandmother was German.</span> <span id="s837">And she had her reasons.</span> <span id="s838">I guess they were human reasons, good reasons, because in World War I, the French Army had taken her eight cows away, and she had to raise Five children with no milk and nothing.</span> <span id="s839">So she got a hatred against the French in favor of the Germans.</span> <span id="s840">I mean, that's easy to understand.</span> <span id="s841">So when the Germans came, she was happy.</span> <span id="s842">And now since she couldn't follow our reasoning, well, that worked against us.</span> <span id="s843">But anyhow, mother decided to go to her mother because in between she got sick and she needed help.</span> <span id="s844">So my mother was working up there in the mountain, very hard work.</span> <span id="s845">And she was there about, let me see, two and a half months or something like that.</span> <span id="s846">One day -- well, the house is along in the mountains, and one day a man came up, and he had an order to arrest her.</span> <span id="s847">And he asked her, "Which way do you want to go?</span> <span id="s848">Through the village?"</span> <span id="s849">because she was supposed to go to the other village where my father comes from, "or out through the woods?"</span> <span id="s850">She said, "The shortest way.</span> <span id="s851">The shortest way is through the woods."</span> <span id="s852">He said, "All right.</span> <span id="s853">You go through the woods, and I'll go through the village."</span> <span id="s854">Well, it was obvious that he gave her the occasion to freedom because the border was only a walk from there to go over to the French side.</span> <span id="s855">But we were hostages.</span> <span id="s856">Father was arrested.</span> <span id="s857">I was already gone.</span> <span id="s858">So she realized that that wasn't the thing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q. Could you show us a picture of that, perhaps?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A. Oh, yes, certainly.</span> <span id="s861">This is a picture here.</span> <span id="s862">This picture has been painted by my father in 1945.</span> <span id="s863">That is after camp.</span> <span id="s864">It shows the village where my father was born as well as the house where my mother was raised.</span> <span id="s865">So this is a place where my mother fled when she left, when she was alone.</span> <span id="s866">And she was working here, you know.</span> <span id="s867">My grandparents used to have a farm.</span> <span id="s868">You have this, which shows you the same house from the other side.</span> <span id="s869">That means that this tree is this tree.</span> <span id="s870">It's just the opposite.</span> <span id="s871">So mother was here, and the man came from this village, which you don't see here.</span> <span id="s872">He came up this road.</span> <span id="s873">He talked with mother here.</span> <span id="s874">And mother ended up going down here and turning over, decided to go here through the woods, the shortest way, where she had to come to the police station.</span> <span id="s875">Now, this route my mother was doing regularly when she was young.</span> <span id="s876">She was 14 years old, and she was working down in this village.</span> <span id="s877">So she went up and down.</span> <span id="s878">It's also the place where she met my father because my father came from here, you see.</span> <span id="s879">So she had lots of memories, positive ones.</span> <span id="s880">And as she was walking through here, she knew that the border was here.</span> <span id="s881">The border was just on the top of those mountains.</span> <span id="s882">The other side was the French territory.</span> <span id="s883">Here's the Alsace territory.</span> <span id="s884">It was considered being Germany.</span> <span id="s885">She knew that if she would go over there she would have a chance to escape, of course, because she knew all the little roads in there, but we were hostages, and she knew exactly that that meant that father would lose his life.</span> <span id="s886">Maybe me too.</span> <span id="s887">So she decided she better go down there.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q. Okay.</span> <span id="s889">Thank you.</span> <span id="s890">To go to meet him then, rather than try to escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A. That's right.</span> <span id="s892">So she went down there, and there they gave her a second occasion.</span> <span id="s893">Because she had to go to the police station in Melhouse.</span> <span id="s894">It was about 20 kilometers further.</span> <span id="s895">She had to take a train, and there again they let her go alone to the train.</span> <span id="s896">And she would have been able to escape once more.</span> <span id="s897">But she believed that to that point she had to face the facts.</span> <span id="s898">It was her turn.</span> <span id="s899">And so she decided she would go to the police.</span> <span id="s900">Now, when she came to the police, he said to her, "I'm sorry."</span> <span id="s901">It was a German man.</span> <span id="s902">He said, "I'm sorry, Mrs. Arnold, I have to arrest you and send you to Gestapo.</span> <span id="s903">I just couldn't do it otherwise."</span> <span id="s904">Now, the police station was across the street from the priest's home.</span> <span id="s905">That's what you saw when you looked out the window.</span> <span id="s906">And the policeman looked out the window and he said to my mother, "Mrs. Arnold, many dogs who are hunting a rabbit, the rabbit can't go away."</span> <span id="s907">And he was looking across the street when he said that.</span> <span id="s908">That's a figurative sense.</span> <span id="s909">"Many dogs who are hunting the same rabbit, the rabbit can't get away."</span> <span id="s910">Well, mother was brought to the Gestapo, and the Gestapo sent her right away to Shimlicki (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q. Which is near where?</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A. Shimlicki (ph) is the same camp as daddy was in but the woman's camp.</span> <span id="s913">And this is located in Alsace-Lorraine.</span> <span id="s914">It's next to the Strudehoff (ph).</span> <span id="s915">Strudehoff (ph) is a camp which is located in the mountains, the same range of mountain which you have seen on the picture.</span> <span id="s916">You go further up to the north near Strasbourg.</span> <span id="s917">So she was there, and she was doing some sewing work.</span> <span id="s918">And when she was sewing a -- I think it was a cover, a bed cover or something, they took the bed cover away and they gave her a military jacket to mend.</span> <span id="s919">So she refused it.</span> <span id="s920">She said, "I don't work for war.</span> <span id="s921">Give me any kind of work.</span> <span id="s922">I will do it gladly, but I won't work for war."</span> <span id="s923">So they put her in the bunker, solitary confinement.</span> <span id="s924">And there, nothing to eat, nothing to drink, until the jacket is mended.</span> <span id="s925">Well, first day over, second day.</span> <span id="s926">Buchta, was the name of the camp commander, came along and said, "You crazy woman.</span> <span id="s927">Do you think we all military men are wearing mended jackets?</span> <span id="s928">This jacket is going to serve for other prisoners."</span> <span id="s929">My mother said, "You could have told me that yesterday.</span> <span id="s930">All right.</span> <span id="s931">I'm working for prisoners."</span> <span id="s932">So she started off mending.</span> <span id="s933">But she took the shoulder pads away.</span> <span id="s934">She changed the back.</span> <span id="s935">Closed it down.</span> <span id="s936">She took all the military signs away.</span> <span id="s937">She mended the thing.</span> <span id="s938">The following day he came and he was all happy.</span> <span id="s939">He said, "Ah ha, I got you."</span> <span id="s940">And suddenly he turned away and said, "What did you do?"</span> <span id="s941">"Well," she said, "you told me it was for prisoners.</span> <span id="s942">I don't think you'd give prisoners jackets that look like military jackets.</span> <span id="s943">They could escape on it."</span> <span id="s944">But he had her there for several months in that bunker.</span> <span id="s945">And he got her out, and it started all over again.</span> <span id="s946">She refuses a second time.</span> <span id="s947">And then they put her in the bunker, which was the worst thing you can imagine because it was underground.</span> <span id="s948">She could see just on top of her cell a little bit light.</span> <span id="s949">Somebody would walk very close, she could see the shoes.</span> <span id="s950">That's all she could see.</span> <span id="s951">No light.</span> <span id="s952">Only daylight would come in a little bit, you see.</span> <span id="s953">No artificial light.</span> <span id="s954">Nothing.</span> <span id="s955">And this was next to the place where they tortured the prisoners.</span> <span id="s956">And the blood would come into her cell, and she stayed there for three months in this condition.</span> <span id="s957">And afterwards they took her out and then put her with women who had -- you say that in English -- syphilis?</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q. Syphilis.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A. Syphilis.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q. Venereal disease.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A. Yeah, to contaminate her.</span> <span id="s962">And after that the war condition, the condition in general, the camp being in Alsace-Lorraine, they decided to move the camp to Gaggenau.</span> <span id="s963">That's on the other side in Strasbourg, German side.</span> <span id="s964">And there she was.</span> <span id="s965">She was to go to Ravensbrück because she was heading for the woman's camp, but because the bridges and everything were broken down and time to go on.</span> <span id="s966">Anyhow she stayed in Gaggenau awhile.</span> <span id="s967">And while she was there she was working in an SS home, mending and sewing, and so she was quite an artist in sewing, and she started off coughing and take creme.</span> <span id="s968">She couldn't work anymore.</span> <span id="s969">She just stayed in the barrack.</span> <span id="s970">And that is also a start in which there was a happening of standing.</span> <span id="s971">One day the responsible for the camp, the commander, said whoever wanted to go working in the field to get potatoes out of the ground can go.</span> <span id="s972">And there was one of Jehovah's Witnesss from the home town who never had seen a potato plant in her life decided to go.</span> <span id="s973">So she was taken, and it was an old man who took her to the field.</span> <span id="s974">The Germans were gone.</span> <span id="s975">There were no men anymore.</span> <span id="s976">The women were alone home because all the men were on the front.</span> <span id="s977">So they got prisoners out to get their potatoes in and things like that, you know.</span> <span id="s978">So the man said, "Why are you in camp?"</span> <span id="s979">She said, "Because I'm Jehovah's Witness."</span> <span id="s980">He stopped talking.</span> <span id="s981">They came to a crossroad and he said to her, "This place here, they sell milk there.</span> <span id="s982">The lady who's there is an old lady.</span> <span id="s983">She's one of Jehovah's Witnesses.</span> <span id="s984">I'm going to the village and get me some cigarettes.</span> <span id="s985">And I meet you here again."</span> <span id="s986">So she didn't know if she should go there or not.</span> <span id="s987">Anyhow, she went there.</span> <span id="s988">It was an elderly person.</span> <span id="s989">When she heard that she was a Sister, she gave her a little bottle of milk to drink.</span> <span id="s990">And Rose said, "Please, let me take it to the camp.</span> <span id="s991">My spiritual mother is dying.</span> <span id="s992">She has no strength anymore.</span> <span id="s993">She's only a few days to live.</span> <span id="s994">If I could get that milk in."</span> <span id="s995">She said, "All right.</span> <span id="s996">You come by every day and get your little bottle of milk, and I show you how you can bring it in.</span> <span id="s997">You take your jacket, hang it over the arm, and the sleeve on the top, you put the little bottle in there so the white won't show up."</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q. Now, what do you mean by spiritual mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A. That's a good question.</span> <span id="s1000">It was my mother that took care of the Sister whose name is Rose Gusman (ph), and when she was young, she had studied Bible studies with them, but also prison counsel.</span> <span id="s1001">She was a true mother to her because she was standing alone in life.</span> <span id="s1002">She would give her all kinds of counsel.</span> <span id="s1003">Even sewing, even cooking, even everything, you know.</span> <span id="s1004">And that's why she called her spiritual mother because she got everything from my mother.</span> <span id="s1005">Now, another thing, the place where mother was working, when she couldn't go anymore, another Sister, spiritual sister, a Witness, I should say, would go working there, and knowing that mother was condemned to die, because her cough she had was a hunger cough.</span> <span id="s1006">Every day she would go through a garden and take two carrots and sew them in the sleeve from here to here.</span> <span id="s1007">Because she realized when she had to go in camp she had to put her hands like that, you know, and they went searching this way.</span> <span id="s1008">So she found out they were searching just from here on so.</span> <span id="s1009">She put the carrot a little bit above the thread and sewed it in there, and with those two carrots and a little bottle of milk my mother survived.</span> <span id="s1010">She was completely on the edge.</span> <span id="s1011">This gave her sufficient strength for the last part.</span> <span id="s1012">Because a time came they decided to move that camp, you know.</span> <span id="s1013">So they had the people march, and she was supposed to go to Ravensbrück, and they had them walking very early mornings and very late nights, not in daytime, and of course a lot at nights.</span> <span id="s1014">And in daytime they would put them in -- what do you call it -- bottom of the house --</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q. Basement?</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A. Basement.</span> <span id="s1017">Thank you.</span> <span id="s1018">Put them in basements and nobody would see them, you see.</span> <span id="s1019">So they were walking for, oh, days and days.</span> <span id="s1020">Couldn't get any train.</span> <span id="s1021">Everything was bumped, you know.</span> <span id="s1022">And one day they were locked in, in the basement, and suddenly one of the prisoners said, "It's funny, but it looks like nobody is here anymore."</span> <span id="s1023">So he tried to open the door.</span> <span id="s1024">He could open it.</span> <span id="s1025">He looked out and the SS were gone.</span> <span id="s1026">There was freedom.</span> <span id="s1027">Everybody was happy.</span> <span id="s1028">Everybody was running toward the allies, except mother.</span> <span id="s1029">Mother said, "I'm not going to leave Germany with my child there.</span> <span id="s1030">I want to get my child first."</span> <span id="s1031">So she started off walking and walking, hitchhiking.</span> <span id="s1032">There came a truck.</span> <span id="s1033">She went on the truck.</span> <span id="s1034">It was an uncovered truck.</span> <span id="s1035">And suddenly there came a bomb attack, flying down.</span> <span id="s1036">So the truck stopped.</span> <span id="s1037">Everybody was thrown out.</span> <span id="s1038">And she was thrown on the street in the hard part of the street.</span> <span id="s1039">When she got up, her whole face was bloody.</span> <span id="s1040">Her urine was bloody, but she kept walking.</span> <span id="s1041">Walked to the station.</span> <span id="s1042">There's something I would like to stress.</span> <span id="s1043">In this time the Germans, as such, the nation, the people, the common people, were humans.</span> <span id="s1044">And when they saw an elderly lady or somebody who was hurt or a pregnant lady, they would have priority.</span> <span id="s1045">So when she came to that station, she got priority because her face was burning.</span> <span id="s1046">She went to the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s1047">They had nothing for her except a black stuff which was supposed to clean a little bit the wounds, you know, to put that on.</span> <span id="s1048">And she got on a train.</span> <span id="s1049">She was favored because of that face.</span> <span id="s1050">She got on the train.</span> <span id="s1051">The train didn't go far.</span> <span id="s1052">It wasn't the right train anyhow.</span> <span id="s1053">She had to, you know, go to right at a certain time, and the train didn't go there.</span> <span id="s1054">She had to just get on again.</span> <span id="s1055">She went again to the Red Cross to find out if she could get treated.</span> <span id="s1056">They had a yellow powder.</span> <span id="s1057">They put a little bit of yellow powder on it, on that black.</span> <span id="s1058">And she again got priority to go on the next train to Konstanz.</span> <span id="s1059">When she came to Konstanz, she thought, "I cannot go like that.</span> <span id="s1060">They will get scared when they see my face."</span> <span id="s1061">So she went to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1062">They had nothing anymore.</span> <span id="s1063">They had a little bit, shall I say, you know, the wrappers you make around a wound.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q. Bandages?</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A. Yeah, very small, and they just would put together, you know, the wounds which were completely open.</span> <span id="s1066">Just a little bit designs on her face, you know.</span> <span id="s1067">Now, that day when she came we were in the basement because of the bomb attack on far away from town.</span> <span id="s1068">I was trained as a nurse in case of a bomb attack, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q.</span> <span id="s1070">They trained you at the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s1072">And we had a hard wind behind us because we had wonderful trees in this place, and they were cut down so the border would be clear, well, the border of Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1073">And we girls were four of us.</span> <span id="s1074">We cut down those trees, big trees, sawing them through, getting the roots out of the ground in order to be able to plant potatoes.</span> <span id="s1075">It was work the last part I was there.</span> <span id="s1076">So when she came, we were just working at that and went in the basement.</span> <span id="s1077">And I got up.</span> <span id="s1078">We had no right to leave the basement, but I don't know, something pushed me to go up.</span> <span id="s1079">I still don't know why I went up.</span> <span id="s1080">I did go up.</span> <span id="s1081">And I met my teacher.</span> <span id="s1082">And I said, "Um, um, um, what is going to happen to me?"</span> <span id="s1083">I never was disobedient.</span> <span id="s1084">And no matter I always was careful, and there I was disobedient because I was not supposed to be there.</span> <span id="s1085">I had nothing to do upstairs.</span> <span id="s1086">She looked at me, gray eyes, cold, and nothing happened.</span> <span id="s1087">And after a little silence she said, "Maria, your mother is here."</span> <span id="s1088">She opened the door, she called me in.</span> <span id="s1089">I didn't recognize her with that face.</span> <span id="s1090">And I got my embroideries.</span> <span id="s1091">I showed her all the work I had done.</span> <span id="s1092">That's the way we were taught to react in case somebody would come to the house to get a maid, we were supposed to react a certain way, you know.</span> <span id="s1093">We were taught we should bring up our sewing and everything.</span> <span id="s1094">So I just did that to my mother, you know.</span> <span id="s1095">I showed her everything.</span> <span id="s1096">And she just was as cold as I was.</span> <span id="s1097">We looked at each other.</span> <span id="s1098">And then she said, "I would like to take my child."</span> <span id="s1099">She said, "No, it's not possible.</span> <span id="s1100">She's here under judgment, and only a judge can get her free."</span> <span id="s1101">So she said, "Can we go together and see the judge?"</span> <span id="s1102">She said, "All right.</span> <span id="s1103">Maria knows where it is.</span> <span id="s1104">So you go."</span> <span id="s1105">So in the afternoon we went to the judgment hall.</span> <span id="s1106">Everybody was gone.</span> <span id="s1107">Everybody was fleeing.</span> <span id="s1108">There were no judges anymore.</span> <span id="s1109">Secretaries.</span> <span id="s1110">Nothing else.</span> <span id="s1111">My mother was pleading and pleading and pleading to get the paper, and they all said, "We can't.</span> <span id="s1112">We can't.</span> <span id="s1113">We can't."</span> <span id="s1114">And when I heard her asking for my freedom and asking to get me back, that voice, that fight, It was like my mother again.</span> <span id="s1115">Yes, she was my mother.</span> <span id="s1116">Yes, I was crying, crying for hours.</span> <span id="s1117">Oh, it seemed that all the tears that I had kept for years they all came out at once.</span> <span id="s1118">But we came home to the house and I couldn't go away.</span> <span id="s1119">So she stayed there several days, giving a helping hand to the house.</span> <span id="s1120">And one day they said, "Mrs. Arnold, you better go away with your child to the Swiss border.</span> <span id="s1121">We don't want to have a French girl here.</span> <span id="s1122">It's a French army that is heading to Konstanz, and we just don't want any problems with the French.</span> <span id="s1123">So please go away."</span> <span id="s1124">So we went away through Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1125">And I have to say, it was wonderful how the Swiss acted, helped us, with food and clothing and everything.</span> <span id="s1126">But something I cannot forget is that first day when we arrived, they had us undress completely because they were afraid we would bring sicknesses into Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1127">I was 15 years old.</span> <span id="s1128">I was there.</span> <span id="s1129">My mother was naked.</span> <span id="s1130">I was naked.</span> <span id="s1131">And I saw her misery.</span> <span id="s1132">That body.</span> <span id="s1133">Something unbearable.</span> <span id="s1134">It was really shocking to me.</span> <span id="s1135">I think it was a mistake.</span> <span id="s1136">They shouldn't have handled the same way the Nazis had handled the people.</span> <span id="s1137">They handled the same way in reality, you know.</span> <span id="s1138">Well, anyhow, we wondered what we would find when we came home.</span> <span id="s1139">We found our home like we left it.</span> <span id="s1140">We didn't expect that.</span> <span id="s1141">We knew the SS wanted to live in our place, so we thought most probably they had stolen everything.</span> <span id="s1142">Now, what happened in reality, it's rather cute.</span> <span id="s1143">The SS had my father and my mother in camp, and I was in a penitentiary home by a different authority, the children's authority.</span> <span id="s1144">It had nothing to do with the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1145">So they said, "Well, we have to pay for her education, so the apartment is ours."</span> <span id="s1146">And they closed the apartment up by judge.</span> <span id="s1147">Now, the Gestapo came along and said, "Well, we have too.</span> <span id="s1148">This apartment is ours."</span> <span id="s1149">And they also closed it by another judge.</span> <span id="s1150">So the apartment was closed up by judges.</span> <span id="s1151">One couldn't go in without the other.</span> <span id="s1152">They were fighting back and forth for two years' time, two years gone.</span> <span id="s1153">So when we came home, everything was just right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q. Everything was the way it was, intact?</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A. Exactly the same.</span> <span id="s1156">Exactly the same.</span> <span id="s1157">Now, in the street everybody had lost their stuff because it was no-man's-land.</span> <span id="s1158">There was shooting going on three months' time.</span> <span id="s1159">We had the windows -- the shades closed so nothing has happened inside.</span> <span id="s1160">But the other ones had the shades open because they had to go out of their apartment and everything open because in no-man's-land.</span> <span id="s1161">That's how they handle the situation.</span> <span id="s1162">So they lost lots of furniture.</span> <span id="s1163">They lost lots of things in the street.</span> <span id="s1164">And on our way from concentration camp, came home, and found everything.</span> <span id="s1165">But -- there was a but -- we had no news from daddy.</span> <span id="s1166">Absolutely no news.</span> <span id="s1167">Every day we would go and check and no news.</span> <span id="s1168">And one day on top of the list was father's name Arnold, Adolf on the dead list.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q.</span> <span id="s1170">He died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s1172">That seemed unbelievable to us.</span> <span id="s1173">And it was a feeling that couldn't be.</span> <span id="s1174">Just couldn't be.</span> <span id="s1175">We were out three weeks home.</span> <span id="s1176">In the afternoon the bell was ringing.</span> <span id="s1177">Came Sister Kerr.</span> <span id="s1178">I opened the door, and I said, "What surprise."</span> <span id="s1179">She never used to come in weekdays because she was working.</span> <span id="s1180">She said, "Simone, I am not alone.</span> <span id="s1181">Your father is with me."</span> <span id="s1182">And there between the first and the second flight my father was standing.</span> <span id="s1183">He hardly could make it up to the second flight.</span> <span id="s1184">He came up.</span> <span id="s1185">I didn't recognize him.</span> <span id="s1186">Four years he was gone.</span> <span id="s1187">He didn't recognize me either.</span> <span id="s1188">I had grown up in between.</span> <span id="s1189">He went straight to mother.</span> <span id="s1190">Mother wanted to talk to him.</span> <span id="s1191">He didn't hear anymore, not one word.</span> <span id="s1192">He had lost his hearing.</span> <span id="s1193">It was a reunion.</span> <span id="s1194">We made a prayer together.</span> <span id="s1195">It was joy and tears, laughter and sorrow, everything together.</span> <span id="s1196">But we were together again.</span> <span id="s1197">Daddy was fighting for months and months between life and death.</span> <span id="s1198">Mother also had a hard time.</span> <span id="s1199">He couldn't work.</span> <span id="s1200">Even so the place he was working had kept his place open.</span> <span id="s1201">He could come back, but he had no strength.</span> <span id="s1202">And he couldn't be a counselor anymore because he couldn't hear.</span> <span id="s1203">So he decided to try to work and keep his family going by redoing some artwork for printing materials.</span> <span id="s1204">And he got a specialist on it.</span> <span id="s1205">He did a wonderful job on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q. Could we see some of that, please?</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A. Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1208">Oh, it happened that the place he was working was trying to go into Africa to do the printing for the African people.</span> <span id="s1209">And so he started this type of work is called called fancy (ph), and it's specialized for Africans.</span> <span id="s1210">This is the design he made.</span> <span id="s1211">He made it, of course, on paper and then it was reprinted on material and sent to Africa.</span> <span id="s1212">It was this style.</span> <span id="s1213">This other one, for instance, this is Calacrete (ph), the City of Calacrete (ph).</span> <span id="s1214">Those are poppy flowers all around.</span> <span id="s1215">You had to be very careful not to use anything the Africans wouldn't like who was taboo.</span> <span id="s1216">This was his artwork.</span> <span id="s1217">He had different kinds.</span> <span id="s1218">This one, too.</span> <span id="s1219">Now, this was a well-known family.</span> <span id="s1220">It was a well-known family.</span> <span id="s1221">The name is written on there, as you can see.</span> <span id="s1222">And it was made especially for anniversary.</span> <span id="s1223">She was 30.</span> <span id="s1224">It was an anniversary for a special occasion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q. Elephant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A. Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1227">This is all kind of work.</span> <span id="s1228">This is the same as Calacrete (ph) but with color.</span> <span id="s1229">We had this one before in brown.</span> <span id="s1230">This is just with lighting.</span> <span id="s1231">Good color.</span> <span id="s1232">This is another type.</span> <span id="s1233">Now, he is the creator of this type of printing.</span> <span id="s1234">Using only three colors he gets this effect.</span> <span id="s1235">By working or putting one color on top of the other, he gets all this effect.</span> <span id="s1236">Now, this work is actually in the Museum of Art in Mulhouse because he is the creator of this type of printing.</span> <span id="s1237">And this is the same thing.</span> <span id="s1238">There's only three colors in there.</span> <span id="s1239">He gets the reaction by putting one color on top of the others.</span> <span id="s1240">It becomes a different shade.</span> <span id="s1241">This is also --</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q. And all of this was produced after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">A. That's all since 1947.</span> <span id="s1244">He worked until he retired.</span> <span id="s1245">1947.</span> <span id="s1246">He retired in 1963.</span> <span id="s1247">48 years he was working in the country.</span> <span id="s1248">Gold letters.</span> <span id="s1249">I see letters from the department, the government -- Where is the other one?</span> <span id="s1250">The occasion of a visit, the union between France and the African union, community, French-African community, and the different cities involved.</span> <span id="s1251">There was also Brasaville (ph).</span> <span id="s1252">I already showed you the other ones.</span> <span id="s1253">And it shows General de Gaulle over there.</span> <span id="s1254">You have de Gaulle on there, all the cities which are in the French community.</span> <span id="s1255">And on the bottom this is the sign de Gaulle used to have, the V, victory, with this cross in it.</span> <span id="s1256">So he did that for that occasion.</span> <span id="s1257">He was a very good artist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q. Okay.</span> <span id="s1259">Now your father was also an oil painter.</span> <span id="s1260">Would you like to explain this, please?</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s1262">This one, this oil painting you are just looking at he did while he was 16 years old.</span> <span id="s1263">He did it in the art school before World War I.</span> <span id="s1264">He did some artwork in oil.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q. Your father was very accomplished.</span> <span id="s1266">Now, Simone, would you like to show us some of your painting as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A. Well, you know, my father never worked on flowers.</span> <span id="s1268">That's why I guess I started off working in flowers.</span> <span id="s1269">Those are flower paintings.</span> <span id="s1270">The ones I did when I was 16 years old, too.</span> <span id="s1271">And they're in the same art school as my father.</span> <span id="s1272">And the other ones I did later on.</span> <span id="s1273">Those are pastels.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q.</span> <span id="s1275">What was the art school that you attended?</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A.</span> <span id="s1277">In Malhouse.</span> <span id="s1278">It's a special art school.</span> <span id="s1279">It's specialized for and always for designs for printing material.</span> <span id="s1280">And I would have been able to go to Paris.</span> <span id="s1281">I had the opportunity, but I preferred to go into the missionary work.</span> <span id="s1282">So I do only occasionally artwork.</span> <span id="s1283">Like, for instance, acrylics, you know, things like that.</span> <span id="s1284">Just little specialized I call them.</span> <span id="s1285">This is all around here, Aix-les-Bains, where we live now.</span> <span id="s1286">This is a fall picture.</span> <span id="s1287">That's also a fall picture.</span> <span id="s1288">And then the other one is winter.</span> <span id="s1289">It's all winter.</span> <span id="s1290">Different hours of the day.</span> <span id="s1291">This is morning.</span> <span id="s1292">Nights.</span> <span id="s1293">This is Aquahile (ph).</span> <span id="s1294">I also worked -- here they are -- on animals.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">Q. On animals as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">A. Yeah.</span> <span id="s1297">See?</span> <span id="s1298">Kitty cats and dogs.</span> <span id="s1299">Now, this is acrylic.</span> <span id="s1300">This is same type of work than oil.</span> <span id="s1301">This is all acrylic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">Q. All right.</span> <span id="s1303">Now, perhaps your husband could come over.</span> <span id="s1304">Husband, perhaps you'd like to show us those pictures you have there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s1306">Here's a picture of my mother during the time my father was arrested.</span> <span id="s1307">I wasn't yet.</span> <span id="s1308">That's why you see the serious face of my mother.</span> <span id="s1309">The same time this is the picture when I was sent off from school before I was arrested.</span> <span id="s1310">Here we are together, my aunt, my mother and I, just a week or so before I went to Konstanz in Germany.</span> <span id="s1311">And here is the class where I stayed in.</span> <span id="s1312">I am here.</span> <span id="s1313">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s1314">I am here.</span> <span id="s1315">And this is the girl she had who took a stand by refusing to salute the flag.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q. Oh, that young lady.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A. Because of her I was arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q. And whatever happened to her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A. She's a Witness.</span> <span id="s1320">She stays in the Paris section.</span> <span id="s1321">Now, here is my father when he came over from camp.</span> <span id="s1322">This is the first picture of reunion.</span> <span id="s1323">We have been out of camp already six weeks when he came.</span> <span id="s1324">My father had before he went to camp 65 -- no -- 75 kilo.</span> <span id="s1325">And when he came he had 41.</span> <span id="s1326">So he was really down.</span> <span id="s1327">This is Brother Kerr and his wife, the one who came and visited me.</span> <span id="s1328">Here's the same group with my aunt, and this is the lady that brought the milk to my mother so she could survive the camp.</span> <span id="s1329">You see this is taken two years later, and you still see on the face my father the camp.</span> <span id="s1330">He hasn't overcome yet completely.</span> <span id="s1331">But he was already doing his artwork in this picture.</span> <span id="s1332">I would like to mention also -- here is the one.</span> <span id="s1333">This is the house I have been in Konstanz.</span> <span id="s1334">That window just behind was my bed.</span> <span id="s1335">That was the director of the house.</span> <span id="s1336">And here is another picture.</span> <span id="s1337">Now, this Jehovah Witness was the last baptism my father performed in the bathtub in our apartment before he was arrested.</span> <span id="s1338">And he was beheaded in 1944 because he refused to serve in the German army.</span> <span id="s1339">This letter is mentioned in the Year Book of Jehovah's Witnesses under the French history.</span> <span id="s1340">And his name is Marcel Suter (ph).</span> <span id="s1341">And he was a very young Witness.</span> <span id="s1342">He was 23 when he was beheaded in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">Q. All right.</span> <span id="s1344">Could we meet your husband now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A. Oh, yes, of course.</span> <span id="s1346">My husband, my dear husband.</span> <span id="s1347">Where is he?</span> <span id="s1348">Yeah, this is a picture of the whole family.</span> <span id="s1349">You see?</span> <span id="s1350">Just four years after the war.</span> <span id="s1351">Reunion.</span> <span id="s1352">This is my mother.</span> <span id="s1353">This is my father.</span> <span id="s1354">I think this is a very good picture of him because he really -- he was healthy.</span> <span id="s1355">And that's my aunt, the one who was visiting me.</span> <span id="s1356">And here comes my husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A. (Mr. Liebster) I just found the book Let Your Kingdom Come.</span> <span id="s1358">This Marcel, which is a friend of my wife, on page 159, "He was neutral until his death."</span> <span id="s1359">He was executed, beheaded.</span> <span id="s1360">And this is often used in the publications of the Society.</span> <span id="s1361">Let Your Kingdom Come.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q. Would you both like to sit down and tell us how you met?</span> <span id="s1363">After the war, evidently.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A. (Mr. Liebster) Yeah.</span> <span id="s1365">I met Simone the first time in Portland at Bethel (ph) on the 48th, 1st November 48th on the 56th.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">Q.</span> <span id="s1367">When you say Bethel (ph) --</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">A. (Mr. Liebster) Bethel (ph) in Portland.</span> <span id="s1369">That order of Jehovah's Witness, 124 Columbia Heights.</span> <span id="s1370">I worked there for seven years in 16 different languages.</span> <span id="s1371">And Simone had the privilege to come over to the states from France 1950 to back up the preconvention work of the first big convention in the Yankee Stadium.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">Q. I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">A. (Mr. Liebster) I met Simone the first time in '50.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q. Simone, and what did you think of him when you first met him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">A. Well, this is a question which is pretty much I say at first, really completely at first, I didn't want to hear anything about him because I came from Europe, and I had plenty of stories of concentration camp and so on.</span> <span id="s1376">And when the Witnesses would say, "We would like that you meet someone who was in camp," I did everything not to meet him, to tell you the truth, you know.</span> <span id="s1377">But it was not because of his personality, rather because I just didn't want to go over all the things again, you know.</span> <span id="s1378">And when I did meet him, of course, I couldn't escape.</span> <span id="s1379">We were invited by the same family.</span> <span id="s1380">Well, I was impressed by his wholeheartedness, for his spiritual questions.</span> <span id="s1381">And to tell the truth, I was always fond of a Jewish person coming to know the Messiah and serve His interests.</span> <span id="s1382">It was always something that attracted me.</span> <span id="s1383">So slowly things came about because it took about six years until we decided to marry.</span> <span id="s1384">In between I went to Gilliad School (ph).</span> <span id="s1385">I went to North Africa, Algiers, as a missionary, came back to France, and then finally we were together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">A. (Mr. Liebster) And I was impressed with her experiences, that her father and parents were in the camp, had the same experiences as I. And the Alsatians and the people I embraced had many things in common and the common background.</span> <span id="s1387">And she was doing artwork, and I was very interested in decoration work and artwork.</span> <span id="s1388">So we had many things in common.</span> <span id="s1389">And this time, of course, not easy to decide, everyone knew that the work is very important, and we were encouraged to stay at Bethel (ph.) As for the knowledge she could come over to do artwork for the printing for the Watch Tower, Brother Nord (ph) told me that in France they have only 4,000 publishers.</span> <span id="s1390">"If you like to marry her, let you right away go to Gillead (ph), and I send you over to France, and you learn the French language."</span> <span id="s1391">So I told Brother Nord (ph), I'm now 40 years old.</span> <span id="s1392">I have learned with difficulty English.</span> <span id="s1393">I can't learn French anymore to do good work in France."</span> <span id="s1394">He said, "You have learned English.</span> <span id="s1395">You will also learn French."</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">Q.</span> <span id="s1397">Who is this Brother Nord (ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A. Nord (ph) was the president, vice president, of the Jehovah's Witnesses of the New World Society at this time.</span> <span id="s1399">So when he let me go the first occasion go from Bethel (ph) headquarters of Jehovah's Witness right away to the Gillead (ph) missionary school of Africa, and he was sending me to France.</span> <span id="s1400">So we got married in September '56.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">A. (Mrs. Liebster) We stayed in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">A. (Mr. Liebster) Six years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">A. (Mrs. Liebster) Yeah, we stayed in Paris, and then it happened that my mother got it hard in France.</span> <span id="s1404">And I'm the only child, and we took care of my parents.</span> <span id="s1405">And, well, there were many Witnesses in Mauthausen in Melhouse because we were missionaries, and it wasn't able to carry on missionary work because the percentage of Jehovah's Witnesses wasn't high.</span> <span id="s1406">My parents were ready to move to anyplace where some missionary work --</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A. (Mr. Liebster) Where the need would be great.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">A. (Mrs. Liebster) Would be able to be learned.</span> <span id="s1409">So it was decided upon Aix-les-Bains, and we came over here.</span> <span id="s1410">We lived together 17 years we lived in this place, my father and my mother.</span> <span id="s1411">And I can say that we were very grateful that we could help them.</span> <span id="s1412">They got to their age 1980 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">A. (Mr. Liebster) 82.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">A. (Mrs. Liebster) 81 82 and my aunt 89.</span> <span id="s1415">They had due to the camp, of course, quite some serious health problems.</span> <span id="s1416">We could help them along.</span> <span id="s1417">Max was a wonderful son-in-law.</span> <span id="s1418">He is a lot to my parents to help them along.</span> <span id="s1419">Daddy didn't hear anything.</span> <span id="s1420">So they had a peaceful time here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">Q. May I ask you a question?</span> <span id="s1422">What type of a town is Aix-les-Bains?</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">A. (Mr. Liebster) Aix-les-Bains is a place for cures.</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">USHMM Archives RG-50.028*0035 PAGE 24</span></p></body></html>
