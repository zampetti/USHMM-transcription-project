something and it was a lot of going on you know.</span> <span id="s7">So we all went to the windows, but it was dark you couldn't see much.</span> <span id="s8">But the day break was still trains coming through with prisoners, now the communication wasn't like nowadays, you hear everything you see everything.</span> <span id="s9">There's a lot of people didn't know that the war came to a, to a end, and their were freight trains coming through with German guards standing on the, in on the steps, and we hollered to the prisoners, the war is over, you're free, but they were so numb that there was not, not even a reaction from those people.</span> <span id="s10">And eventually some people start coming in, men with their colored arm bands, you have it around your arm you know, it was saying police or something, they just came up overnight, and they were taking off the German guards out of the trains and taking their weapons away.</span> <span id="s11">And I think they became prisoners, and then they were marching through.</span> <span id="s12">But that, for a while, that just didn't make any difference, because we still didn't have any food, people were kept dying from dysentery, from sicknesses, there was, I wouldn't, you didn't know if you have to feel joy or what, you were just more or less so dehumanized that some people were happy, some people were just staring, I mean there was no, no-no feeling like you get hijacked or something and so, and then you get liberate [laughs] after six years, there was, you didn't know what happened to your family or, why you're here
