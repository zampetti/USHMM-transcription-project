was liberated in a strange way.</span> <span id="s7">I was in a prison in Czechoslovakia because i escaped twice.</span> <span id="s8">And finally I was found and put in a prison.</span> <span id="s9">And that prison was totally abandoned by the Nazis and we were locked in until the Red Cross, the International Red Cross came in and liberated us, and opened the doors for us.</span> <span id="s10">But where I was liberated where the Russians came in to liberate the place, that area.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">In Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s12">So I was--of course, they didn't just let us go, but they--we had health check-up, we were de liced and sent to the hospital the persons that needed it, needed hospitalization were sent there.</span> <span id="s13">I went to the hospital.</span> <span id="s14">Because I suffered from undernourishment and I had the symptoms, and while I was in the hospital something happened that really made me feel good.</span> <span id="s15">I saw the mighty German armies through the window in the hospital, I was the armies walking with their arms up and hands behind their heads, and the Russians soldiers that were leading them.</span> <span id="s16">And this is when I really believed the war is over.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Sandy: Tell me how organized it was after the Red Cross came in, what happened.</span></p>

change of clothes and little bit of money to tie me over and from then on--I did not want to go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s26">If I wish to go back, they would have arranged it.</span> <span id="s27">But I didn't want to go back, I had no one to go back to.</span> <span id="s28">So I stayed in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s29">I got, I met a girlfriend, and we had small apartment that was left by the Germans that escaped and we stayed there, yeah, and I wasn't quite well yet.</span> <span id="s30">I met that girl in in the pr, in the hospital and I had to look for a way to make some money.</span> <span id="s31">And of course registered as a Czechoslovakian citizen.</span> <span id="s32">I totally rejected my Polish background at that</span></p> <p><span id="s33">time.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Sandy: Was there much support ,,,?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">IRENE WEBER: I did not feel abandoned, I felt free.</span> <span id="s36">It was very hard for me.</span> <span id="s37">But the strange thing is that I was not in contact with any other people that came from concentration camps , so I was really totally detached from everything.</span> <span id="s38">And I wanted to make life for myself and go to school and I had to work and learn on the job because I wanted to be free and I wanted to be away from from everything.</span> <span id="s39">.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Sandy: Tell me about the --tell me about the physical condition you were in when you were liberated.</span> <span id="s41">Like what you looked like, how much you weighed.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">IRENE WEBER: I lost a lot of weight and I had wounds in my mouth from undernourishment, so I was treated for that.</span> <span id="s43">And I had, I had

id="s49">Sandy: Did they--you said they gave you clothes, do you</span></p> <p><span id="s50">remember the clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">IRENE WEBER:</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Yes, Sandy: Tell me about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">IRENE WEBER: A pair of shoes, flat heeled shoes, socks a dress that I remember distinctly, quite nice, and that's about all.</span> <span id="s54">And the reason I could in that apartment and not need anything because everything was left behind, linens and dishes and things like that.</span> <span id="s55">But I still was not quite well, I had the gastro-intestinal problem for long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Sandy: Now tell me about the occasion that you came to a</span></p> <p><span id="s57">displaced persons camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">IRENE WEBER: Well, after a while in Czechoslovakia, the Russians, the communist party was voted into power, and as soon as this happened we were not allowed to leave the country and we were closed in.</span> <span id="s59">We had to have out IDs with us all the time, and there was lots of propaganda, how wonderful life is under communism.</span> <span id="s60">I was very young, somehow I did not believe that because I thought if can not leave, if I cannot travel and leave the country, it didn't sound good to me.</span> <span id="s61">I was not very well informed on the ideology of the communist party, but I just didn't like it.</span> <span id="s62">So I went to Prague.</span> <span id="s63">Was Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ.</span> <span id="s65">2/14/95 Int.</span> <span id="s66">IRENE WEBER Page 4 very difficult, I just left everything behind,i just take the little bag, took a little baggage with my clothes and went to Prague and tried to get help to get out of the country.</span> <span id="s67">I was very determined to get out and be free.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">That was my--this is what I wanted most just to be free.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">And with there was an organization, underground organization that smuggled people through the border and I remember we had, I had to stay in Prague a couple of days and then we went on a bus.</span> <span id="s70">There were several people.</span> <span id="s71">WE went on he bus to the border line.</span> <span id="s72">There we spent the night which was absolutely horrible, and at a certain time we were told, now we can crawl under the fence and get to the other side to Germany.</span> <span id="s73">And that was the American zone of Germany.</span> <span id="s74">And I did that and it was a terrible experience this whole thing because there were renegades and people that were not very kind to us.</span> <span id="s75">And we our my life was in danger in really.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">But once I crossed the border, there was a bus waiting for me,for several people I guess, and we were taken to Landsberg In Germany, in west Germany.</span> <span id="s77">And there we were in</span></p> <p><span id="s78">a DP camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Sandy: Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">IRENE WEBER: I didn't like it at all because again I was in a camp with bunkbeds and crowded and lots of people and no privacy.</span> <span id="s81">And it just felt that I was in a camp again except thee were no Nazis around.</span> <span id="s82">Ad I don't know how I met--and people lived there, they were getting married, they had babies.</span> <span id="s83">And they didn't have babies while I was there, but they were pregnant,and I thought, this is not a life--I can't do that, I cannot stay here.</span> <span id="s84">And then I found out that one of our people somehow was on a farm several miles away from Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ.</span> <span id="s86">2/14/95 Int.</span> <span id="s87">IRENE WEBER Page 5 Landsberg, and I wanted to see her and I walked several miles and met her.</span> <span id="s88">I knew her from concentration camp, and I told her I wanted to stay with her, I don't want to be in a camp again.</span> <span id="s89">I want to stay with her if she will have, let me stay until I find a different way and I can settle and something until?</span> <span id="s90">figure out what to do with myself.</span> <span id="s91">And so I did.</span> <span id="s92">I picked up my little bundle again, and I went to the farm.</span> <span id="s93">And I was working, it was a German family that owned the farm.</span> <span id="s94">And I was working on the farm a little to earn my keep.</span> <span id="s95">And in the meantime, I found out that there is a place that there are several of our people settled in and that is Rosenheim.</span> <span id="s96">Not too far from Munich.</span> <span id="s97">And this is--and I went there.</span> <span id="s98">I went to Rosenheim, and I got a room, two room, actually, a sitting and a bedroom, with a German family.</span> <span id="s99">And I paid them.</span> <span id="s100">The only means of paying them I had is because the jewish organization was sending us cheese, 5 found boxes of cheese, and wine and cigarettes.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">And I didn't drink the wine and I didn't smoke the cigarettes.</span> <span id="s102">I ate the cheese.</span> <span id="s103">So I sold it and some kind of shortening, I sold all that to the Germans, I gave it to them and they let me stay and gave me a few dollars, marks, not dollars.</span> <span id="s104">And I stayed there and then I thought now what next step is.</span> <span id="s105">I have to go to school.</span> <span id="s106">I have to do something.</span> <span id="s107">And I found about that was ORT, I think, the American ORT.</span> <span id="s108">I went to Munich and I found out about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">And I, I chose nursing school.</span> <span id="s110">And then I had to go to Foehrenwald,which is a small town, a village and this is</span></p> <p><span

the hospital, and when I finished I got my diploma, I got a job in Poking which was a DP camp also.</span> <span id="s117">But I lived in the nurses quarters.</span> <span id="s118">And I was, my patients were all survivors.</span> <span id="s119">And many people were going on the Alia to Israel.</span> <span id="s120">And we were taking care of, taking blood and helping out that way, and I also had a steady job in the hospital, in the DP hospital, hos hospital</span></p> <p><span id="s121">for displaced persons.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Sandy: Tell me about the people going to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">IRENE WEBER: They were people just like myself.</span> <span id="s124">Some of them, young, some of them older people.</span> <span id="s125">They all wanted to go.</span> <span id="s126">And many of them did, I think.</span> <span id="s127">Of course, it was not yet, Palestine was not yet the state of Israel, is was Palestine, and they actually were entering illegally.</span> <span id="s128">The country that is now Israel.</span> <span id="s129">But nevertheless they wanted to go there.</span> <span id="s130">I probably would have gone to Israel after finishing my duty.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">I felt that I am doing a very important job.</span> <span id="s132">working as a nurse in a DP hospital.</span> <span id="s133">And then I thought that I may eventually go to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Sandy: Tell me again about not wanting to stay in Landsberg</span></p> <p><span id="s135">and why.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">IRENE WEBER: Why I didn't want to stay, I have to stress very much that the conditions were very crowded.</span> <span id="s137">No privacy of any kind, and too many people, and too much eh emotionally it reminded me of the concentration camp, although it was not.</span> <span id="s138">And I realize that all along, of course, and I was free to leave Working transcript: not spell checked or verified

<span id="s142">But the life in those, in the DP camp was not for me.</span> <span id="s143">Lots of people were very happy that they had this safety of those camps.</span> <span id="s144">I just chose not to stay there.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Sandy: What about being in Germany, travelling in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">WERe you afraid?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">IRENE WEBER: No, I was not afraid, because I kept still my place in Rosenheim, My room, And I was quite a distance away in school, so about once in two weeks I used to come by train back to my place, knowing just I want I just had to know I had a place of my own, my privacy is so important to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">And I traveled back to school throughout the whole night because the railroads were bombed, and I had to change two or three trains, and I slept while waiting for the next train, I just slept on the bench and the station master knew me, and the gave me some blankets, army blankets to cover myself up because it was cold.</span> <span id="s149">And I was never afraid, Somehow I was never afraid.</span> <span id="s150">I was the only at that station in the middle of the night because I travelled at night.</span> <span id="s151">I started late afternoon and I travelled at night so I could be back in school in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Sandy: Were you given enough support after liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">IRENE WEBER: Well I tried really to help myself as much as I could when I was in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s154">I didn't get any support because I left this whole, you know, network of help, you know.</span> <span id="s155">So I didn't get it.</span> <span id="s156">But when I went back, when I came to Germany I did get the support.</span> <span id="s157">Whether it was enough or not, I Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP

helpful.</span> <span id="s162">So, but I thought I cannot continue doing this forever.</span> <span id="s163">I wanted to build-make some life and future for myself.</span> <span id="s164">And when I was working in the hospital, of course, there was some money that I got.</span> <span id="s165">I was paid for my job and also we still had some aid from the United States, Jewish Organizations, the Joint Organization and the UNRAA and such, so it was.</span> <span id="s166">Yes, I did travel in Germany.</span> <span id="s167">And I just simply did not have any fear at all because I felt that
