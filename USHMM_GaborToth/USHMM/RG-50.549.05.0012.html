I guess what I’ll do is just briefly summarize for the tape some of what was discussed in your first interview and then you can correct me if I get anything wrong.</span> <span id="s23">So, Mr. Rosenberg was born in 1927 in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, and moved with his family in 1937 to… well, moved to Berlin and between then and 1937 and then moved to Holland in 1937, where he lived until he and his family were deported to the Westerbork camp in Holland.</span> <span id="s24">And were there, and that was, you said you weren’t certain whether it was 1942 or ’43, when you were…?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: That is correct.</span> <span id="s26">I keep thinking it was September of ‘42 and we were there until the beginning of ‘43.</span> <span id="s27">My brother thinks I’m off by a year, but I think he’s off by a year.</span> <span id="s28">I clearly remember Easter of ‘44 and we had to have been there about a year by that time, so I think my dates are correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: And Easter of ‘44 what you remembered was being in Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: That is correct.</span> <span id="s31">Yeah, it was an air attack… well, a group of B-17’s was returning from a bomb run, possibly Hanover, and the escorting fighter planes came down to have a look.</span> <span id="s32">And our super-smart guards decided to let go with machine guns from the guard towers and they fired back.</span> <span id="s33">And nobody got hurt, but I clearly remember that incident.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: I wanted to ask you a little bit more about Bergen-Belsen, but I guess first what we’ll do is… okay, so you were deported from Westerbork to Bergen-Belsen some undetermined date.</span> <span id="s35">And then were in Bergen-Belsen until 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: ‘45.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Oh, yeah, around April 10th, 1945 you were away, and it was close to the time… of course.</span> <span id="s38">And liberated somewhere outside of, somewhere in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Yeah, east, Tribitz (ph) was the name of the little village, which is about ten, 15 miles east of Torgau.</span> <span id="s40">Torgau is on the river Elbe, where the German and Russian troops met on that same day, April the twenty-third, that we were liberated early in the morning by the Russian army.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: Let’s go back then, one question that I had was about your earlier childhood before the war started.</span> <span id="s42">And you had mentioned in your first interview something about your family.</span> <span id="s43">Your father was an investment banker.</span> <span id="s44">You had a brother who was ten months… was he ten months older or younger?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Younger, younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: Ten months younger.</span> <span id="s47">And did you, and you said that your family was not very religious.</span> <span id="s48">You basically went to synagogue for high holidays.</span> <span id="s49">Was your family really very assimilated?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Yes, I would say so, with hindsight in particular I would say so.</span> <span id="s51">Yes.</span> <span id="s52">My dad certainly considered himself German first and never expected the violence to get to the level that it did.</span> <span id="s53">And certainly would not affect him since he was a veteran of World War One that was wounded.</span> <span id="s54">Had volunteered for the army in the first place and was wounded, I believe two or three times and had the Iron Cross, which I’ve been trying to locate and can’t find.</span> <span id="s55">So that I would say they considered themselves primarily German and assimilated is the right word.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Did you speak Yiddish or Hebrew?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Were any of your friends, were most of your family friends Jewish and your own personal friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: I think so, but I wouldn’t know for sure.</span> <span id="s60">In Amsterdam I would say that was not necessarily the case.</span> <span id="s61">But I really don’t remember, I remember only really family from Germany.</span> <span id="s62">I don’t remember any children from school or acquaintances of my parents.</span> <span id="s63">For that matter I wouldn’t know what their religion was.</span> <span id="s64">So, I really can’t answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: And then another question from a different time.</span> <span id="s66">When you were living in Amsterdam, I believe you mentioned in the first interview that before your family was actually caught in a round-up and deported to Westerbork, you had been caught in another round-up and somehow managed to get out.</span> <span id="s67">Now that wasn’t clear to me from the first interview what had happened during that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: I don’t remember whether I was picked up at home or off the street and taken to a collection point where we were supposed to have been deported somewhere.</span> <span id="s69">And I walked away from it, and wasn’t challenged in the process and got back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: So it was just you?</span> <span id="s71">It wasn’t members of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s73">I think it was just me, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: And what happened the second time when your whole family was deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: The second time they, as they always did, they came in the middle of the night and you had five minutes to get dressed and get your, your bags were always packed because you knew it could happen.</span> <span id="s76">And you were hauled off in a truck along with other people, taken to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s77">Put on a train not knowing where to.</span> <span id="s78">And then I went to Westerbork, which was the transit camp that the Germans had established; it’s in the eastern part of Holland near Zwolle.</span> <span id="s79">And we were held there for about six months.</span> <span id="s80">I don’t think there were any other deportations.</span> <span id="s81">There may have been one or two trains before we were hauled out.</span> <span id="s82">And I think the general impression was that they were going to go to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s83">Why I don’t know.</span> <span id="s84">But… never heard of Belsen before.</span> <span id="s85">As a matter of fact, we were one of the earliest ones in there.</span> <span id="s86">Belsen was… I’m not sure if it was on a previous tape or not.</span> <span id="s87">When we got there, of course it was a very large facility.</span> <span id="s88">Part of it was a Russian POW camp.</span> <span id="s89">But obviously designed for officers, because they had little cabins and gravel walks between them and that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s90">And then there were two sections to the non-POW prisoners.</span> <span id="s91">One was for, called criminals and the second section was for the Jews.</span> <span id="s92">And as they started to fill up the Jewish section there were a number of trainfuls of Jews from Holland, a lot of Hungarians, French women.</span> <span id="s93">They were the wives of officers who were POW’s from the French Army.</span> <span id="s94">And then after the, in ‘44, after the invasion of Italy, a lot of Libyan Jews that Rommel had shipped off to Italy and they had been held in camps in Italy and apparently under Red Cross supervision.</span> <span id="s95">They all had British uniforms and heavy British, woolen coats and the like, and lots of good food.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Yeah, you did talk some about that in the first interview.</span> <span id="s97">When you were heading towards Westerbork, did you know anything about Westerbork before you arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: No, never heard of Westerbork.</span> <span id="s99">And of course, you know, it’s maybe a two hour train ride at most.</span> <span id="s100">No, never heard of it before, at least I hadn’t, I don’t know whether my parents ever had.</span> <span id="s101">No idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Did you have any idea at the time of what had started to happen to Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s104">They always said we’d be relocating in a work camp or whatever.</span> <span id="s105">Or vague promises of exchanging for money, that relatives, particularly in America could buy you and so forth.</span> <span id="s106">But no, nobody had any inkling of what lay ahead in terms of the violence.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: And you talked in some detail about what you remembered of your time in Westerbork and that you had been, you had contracted polio.</span> <span id="s108">Had you really recovered from the symptoms of that by the time that you were deported to Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: I would say so.</span> <span id="s110">The problem that I had were primarily with the right knee and I still have some problems with that knee.</span> <span id="s111">But I was spared the recurrence that apparently happened to older people when it was discovered in the last ten or 15 years or so.</span> <span id="s112">It must have been a fairly mild case even though polio, of course back then was rampant.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Tell me if, I have an impression, and tell me if it’s correct.</span> <span id="s114">I have the impression that your family was fairly close-knit and that you’re weren’t necessarily forming strong bonds with other people outside of your family.</span> <span id="s115">Is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Yeah, I think so.</span> <span id="s117">I don’t think anybody formed any bonds at all.</span> <span id="s118">It was a matter of survival and I don’t mean to imply that you tried it at the expense of somebody else.</span> <span id="s119">But once we realized, I’m not sure we really realized, but when it became a matter of trying to survive, you didn’t and a fellow that was in the bunk either with you or next to you may not wake up in the morning.</span> <span id="s120">Nobody really tried to get attached to anybody else.</span> <span id="s121">You didn’t form any bonds other than to, you didn’t try to antagonize anybody, but there wasn’t any real friendships or relationships of any kind.</span> <span id="s122">Well, there really wasn’t much time either.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Do you remember, was there kind of a gradual sense of deepening horror and insecurity or was there a moment when you really, that you remember having been really, realized what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: No, it was, that was, in a way the tragedy was that it was a gradual tightening of the noose, so to speak, in that… I remember the first two days in Belsen, there was so much food we couldn’t eat it.</span> <span id="s125">There was no nutrition, but a liter of soup, even if it was only a liter of warm water with nothing in it.</span> <span id="s126">You’re not used to drinking a liter of volume, a quart.</span> <span id="s127">It took two days and you ate it all and were hungry.</span> <span id="s128">And then the amount of food that you got kept getting less and less.</span> <span id="s129">And initially there were, the guards kept changing constantly and surprisingly they kept getting more and more vicious rather than less so.</span> <span id="s130">The last group which maybe was there for a year, year and a half, I don’t recall for sure for how long, were World War One veterans who were too old or too feeble or had been wounded.</span> <span id="s131">But they were not suitable for frontline service in the German Army.</span> <span id="s132">And you would think that they would be not so hateful.</span> <span id="s133">And they weren’t maybe the first week, but they got there very quickly, got to be pretty vicious.</span> <span id="s134">And I’m not sure whether they were told to or it was a natural progression as the sensitivities wore off.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: So even as a young child you grew somehow hardened to this experience would you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Well you had to if you wanted to survive.</span> <span id="s137">You couldn’t, it wasn’t that you wouldn’t help somebody up if they had fallen, but you had to be very careful.</span> <span id="s138">Yes, you probably were… maybe more encapsulated than hardened.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Do you remember private conversations that you were able to have with your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: None, absolutely none.</span> <span id="s141">I don’t really remember very much.</span> <span id="s142">You remember the weird things but not the everyday.</span> <span id="s143">And I’m sure that others would have remembered something totally different that I don’t even remember happening.</span> <span id="s144">Like that Easter Sunday, the fighter attack.</span> <span id="s145">Well, because of it, one of the barracks that got shot up was the warehouse.</span> <span id="s146">And one thing the Germans had were cans of beef in its own juice.</span> <span id="s147">And apparently some of those got bullet-riddled so they had to use them right away.</span> <span id="s148">For a couple of days we actually got food, but then they made up for it for a long time with nothing, because the food was gone again.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Do you remember the day that you were deported from Westerbork to Bergen-Belsen?</span> <span id="s150">Anything about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: No, nothing in particular.</span> <span id="s152">They, I guess in the afternoon the train was pushed into, the empty train was pushed into the compound.</span> <span id="s153">It was passenger cars.</span> <span id="s154">Then they posted names, they called them out and you had to be there whenever, an hour or so later.</span> <span id="s155">Got on the train, nobody knew where it was going to go.</span> <span id="s156">Supposedly it was just a relocation and they always promised you something better.</span> <span id="s157">Of course it never was.</span> <span id="s158">But particularly initially you didn’t know.</span> <span id="s159">And I guess they had to, that I’m sure explains why there was no really massive resistance.</span> <span id="s160">If you knew you were going to go to the gas chamber you may as well try and fight it.</span> <span id="s161">So you get shot on the spot.</span> <span id="s162">I think that’s why there’s, the general docility of the deportees.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Had transports been leaving from Westerbork for some time before yours left?</span> <span id="s164">In other words, were you…</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: We were not the first ones, but yes, but I don’t know whether we were the third or fifth or tenth.</span> <span id="s166">But yes, there had been others.</span> <span id="s167">And of course you never got any feedback in terms of where they went or how they were treated.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: So, you may have had the sense then that at any point your name could be called and you’d be getting on the…</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Yes, yes, I think so.</span> <span id="s170">Yeah, I think it was generally recognized that Westerbork was a transit camp and not a permanent installation.</span> <span id="s171">So, I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: And about your time in Westerbork, I’m sorry, in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s173">You were there relatively early as you just mentioned.</span> <span id="s174">And I wondered if in the long term you feel that having been there early on enabled you to, or was an advantage as far as… you did mention that it was an advantage as far as food.</span> <span id="s175">But I wondered if your resistance was stronger and if you knew the system better?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Well system, there was really no system.</span> <span id="s177">But yeah, I think so, because the people who came very late, particularly if they did not come from another camp but straight from home so to speak.</span> <span id="s178">They were plunged from a normal diet to 200, 300, whatever it was, calories a day.</span> <span id="s179">And I think they died faster than those of us who, even though they may have had physical, physically more reserves than we did, who our reserves were spent.</span> <span id="s180">But we may have been a little bit more cautious.</span> <span id="s181">And also we were so disease-ridden and I don’t know whether our immune systems had strengthened.</span> <span id="s182">Those are medical issues that I don’t know about.</span> <span id="s183">People who were plunged into this diarrhea, flea, lice, you know all the vermin.</span> <span id="s184">They could not tolerate it as much as those of us who were exposed to it more slowly.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: To what extent did you have contact with the other members of your family while you were in Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: We saw them almost every day.</span> <span id="s187">My dad and my brother and I, we were in the same barrack.</span> <span id="s188">At night the men and the women were separated, but during the day they could mingle freely if you were there.</span> <span id="s189">We all were in work details.</span> <span id="s190">My mother worked in the, what do you call it?</span> <span id="s191">Hospital, there was no hospital, so the infirmary.</span> <span id="s192">So, she physically stayed inside the camp.</span> <span id="s193">My dad worked, I think he worked the whole time on the shoe disassembly detail.</span> <span id="s194">I was on it for a little while before they shipped me outside to work details outside.</span> <span id="s195">My brother was working outside the camp too, I think.</span> <span id="s196">But I don’t remember where, what details he was assigned to.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: And what about, you mentioned having to steal food in order to survive.</span> <span id="s198">Was that something that the newer prisoners maybe wouldn’t have known how to do or that you kind of eventually learned?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: Well (laughs)… no, I think everybody… you didn’t steal from each other, generally.</span> <span id="s200">Even though it was a matter of survival.</span> <span id="s201">I mentioned the Libyans who came from Italy.</span> <span id="s202">They came with humongous quantities of food.</span> <span id="s203">And we had the opportunity to steal some of it.</span> <span id="s204">And we actually buried it between the tracks so we could bring it back slowly.</span> <span id="s205">The other thing is being on the outside you were, not always, but sometimes you were patted down, and so you couldn’t have anything on your body that didn’t belong to you.</span> <span id="s206">They must have had a bad storm some years prior to establishing the camp.</span> <span id="s207">Bergen-Belsen was inside a military training camp, similar to Fort Knox.</span> <span id="s208">A lot of trees had been, had fallen over in this storm or storms.</span> <span id="s209">And they had cut the trees and hauled them off, but there were the roots, you know, standing up.</span> <span id="s210">And for a number of months I worked in the woods digging up those tree stumps, which were then, were hauled into… once a week they came out with the horse-drawn wagons and we had to load those tree stumps that we had dug up on it and they were hauled in.</span> <span id="s211">There was another detail inside the camp that was chopping them up into firewood.</span> <span id="s212">That’s the one I was assigned to the day of that air attack.</span> <span id="s213">There were blueberries growing in the woods and one, of course we ate as much as we could, but also we all had, like a bag that was tied to your belt inside your pants.</span> <span id="s214">So you could pick berries and bring them in for the family to eat.</span> <span id="s215">So there was that and then, of course, if we could we stole the food from the guards.</span> <span id="s216">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s217">Boy, they’d take a whipping.</span> <span id="s218">They would get their food and most of the time if they didn’t finish it, it just sat there.</span> <span id="s219">And if somebody, we got a chance, we would try and get those cans and eat it.</span> <span id="s220">But apparently one day we ate them before they had eaten and so we got a pretty good whipping for that.</span> <span id="s221">It was probably worth it.</span> <span id="s222">It was good food.</span> <span id="s223">They didn’t eat too bad.</span> <span id="s224">They got pretty decent food.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Was there a real uniformity of cruelty among the guards or were any of them kind at all to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: There was one sergeant, who the rumor had it later on that he was a spy for the British, he seemed to be more of a… I wouldn’t want to call him humane, but had a better sense of humor.</span> <span id="s227">And some individual guards were exceedingly cruel and would use any excuse to either kick you or club you with a rifle or shoot you, shoot at you.</span> <span id="s228">There was one incident that I recall where one of the guards was giving one of the men, this was in the woods, gave him hell.</span> <span id="s229">And he responded in Dutch, “Man, you’re crazy.”</span> <span id="s230">And it turned out to be a Dutchman, the SS guy was a Dutchman, and boy did he beat the living daylights out of him, out of the prisoner.</span> <span id="s231">And then when we came back that evening, the sergeant was there and he, we all had to stand at attention.</span> <span id="s232">And he demanded to know if anything had happened and this turkey said, “Yes sergeant, this man said I’m crazy.”</span> <span id="s233">The sergeant said, “That man was right, detail dismissed.”</span> <span id="s234">We got sent on.</span> <span id="s235">But it varied.</span> <span id="s236">Some of them would turn their back and just did their job.</span> <span id="s237">But they constantly changed.</span> <span id="s238">You never knew.</span> <span id="s239">You never spoke to any of them.</span> <span id="s240">Some of them would drop a cigarette butt and walk away.</span> <span id="s241">Others would drop the cigarette butt and wait for you to, try to pick it up and then step on your fingers.</span> <span id="s242">You never knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: What about friendships in Belsen?</span> <span id="s244">Did you, was it still pretty much each one for his own?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: Yeah, you didn’t have time for friendships.</span> <span id="s246">You tried to sleep as long as you could in the mornings.</span> <span id="s247">You had a few minutes to wash your face and get dressed and stand at reveille, that’s not the right word.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Roll call?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Roll call, thank you.</span> <span id="s250">Until they got done, depends on how they felt whether they got done or not.</span> <span id="s251">And then you went to wherever your work assignment was and then when you came back at night, there could have been another roll call before or after and you may have got something to eat and you went straight to bed.</span> <span id="s252">There was never any time to talk to anybody, unless somebody you worked with, the guard had a back turned you could talk to each other.</span> <span id="s253">But most of the time you couldn’t.</span> <span id="s254">They wouldn’t let you.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: So was it seven days a week, every day the same?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Oh yes, pretty much so.</span> <span id="s257">Except they got better food on Sundays.</span> <span id="s258">They got three cans instead of two.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Did you have any sense of time or way to keep track of time?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Yeah, you knew pretty much what day of the week it was, what time of day it was, I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s261">I don’t think anybody had watches.</span> <span id="s262">Because at noon time they would bring the food out to where you were working.</span> <span id="s263">We may get five or ten minutes to eat and that was it.</span> <span id="s264">And sunrise and sunset, but other than that whether it was ten of eleven or ten of twelve, nobody cared whether you knew it or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: You mentioned that you were transferred after you were chopping the stumps into the detail that was meeting the rail cars as they were coming in, and you said something about the Libyan Jews.</span> <span id="s266">I was wondering if you, were you there when the French women prisoners were coming in?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: No, I think they were already in the camp.</span> <span id="s268">Trains came and went all the time, not only with prisoners, but also soldiers.</span> <span id="s269">They used the same railroad station.</span> <span id="s270">Occasionally we would meet POW’s.</span> <span id="s271">The Americans always were good.</span> <span id="s272">They would throw us packs of Camels where we could get them.</span> <span id="s273">But I don’t remember when the French women came.</span> <span id="s274">There were only two hundred of them, so they may have come in a group with others.</span> <span id="s275">Probably since very few of them died, I would think they probably came fairly late.</span> <span id="s276">But I just don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: I read something about it, that was partially why I asked.</span> <span id="s278">It mentioned they came in the first half of ‘44 from Drancy in France.</span> <span id="s279">And I just was curious if you remembered anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: Oh, I would think they would have been longer than that.</span> <span id="s281">I’m sure they were there longer than that, because first half of ’44… Oh, I’m sorry, forty, yeah it would have been about a year and a half, a little over.</span> <span id="s282">Yeah, that’s about right, I would think.</span> <span id="s283">No, I don’t remember, other than I knew they were there, and… End of Tape 1, Side A Tape 1, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Tape one, side B of an interview with Alexander Rosenberg.</span> <span id="s285">So you want to just repeat what you had just said?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: Yeah, later on they brought in women from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s287">And I have to back up here a minute.</span> <span id="s288">There was an area where they had a huge circus tent, was set up.</span> <span id="s289">That’s where they had the shoes.</span> <span id="s290">Apparently, I don’t know over how long or what, the Germans had collected shoes for recycling or for donations or whatever the reason they gave to collect them.</span> <span id="s291">And then also there were a lot of military boots in there since many of them had bullet holes in them or shrapnel holes apparently from either wounded or dead soldiers.</span> <span id="s292">And what one of the big, quote, “industries” was, was separating the upper leather from the soles and heels and then separate the leather from the rubber heels and/or soles.</span> <span id="s293">And that was done in that big tent.</span> <span id="s294">And then there was a… the leather soles, I guess, was what they couldn’t reuse.</span> <span id="s295">And so they were stacked up in a humongous pile that was on the main drag and kept getting higher and higher.</span> <span id="s296">People, that was my first assignment was working on that.</span> <span id="s297">You had a wheelbarrow hauling those, and then you had to stack them so the whole thing wouldn’t just fall over.</span> <span id="s298">And they emptied that, emptied that tent of all the shoes, and they started to bring in women and they established a separate woman’s camp.</span> <span id="s299">And it turned out that one of the first groups in there included the wife, who had been with us, of a fellow.</span> <span id="s300">She had worked in the kitchen and she got caught taking some food to try to give to her husband.</span> <span id="s301">And first they shipped her to, I guess to Lüneburg, to jail.</span> <span id="s302">And she was there in jail for a while and the police apparently were trying to protect her from the Gestapo, but couldn’t.</span> <span id="s303">And ultimately she was shipped to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s304">But the police had warned her about Auschwitz and so as she arrived she managed to walk from the incoming group to an outgoing group which happened to come to Belsen.</span> <span id="s305">And so she was back and she was in that group.</span> <span id="s306">And she went to the fence and hollered at somebody to tell her husband that she was back by way of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s307">That’s how we knew that group had come from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s308">You could talk to them usually across the fence as long as you didn’t get too close to the fence.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Were you mostly speaking in German while you lived in Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Dutch.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Did you use your German in speaking with any of the camp guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: No, you never spoke to the camp guards.</span> <span id="s313">And I’m not so sure I still could speak German back then.</span> <span id="s314">But no.</span> <span id="s315">They may give you an order, but that was it.</span> <span id="s316">You never talked to them.</span> <span id="s317">There was no conversation at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: Okay, moving to the time when you were, when you were shipped out of Belsen again, you described that time in the first interview and how you had kind of gone on a two-week tour of Germany.</span> <span id="s319">And seen Berlin completely destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: Beautiful sight.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: I thought maybe we could just pick up with that time.</span> <span id="s322">And I wondered if you could tell a little bit more about, well the time of liberation, encountering the Russian soldiers.</span> <span id="s323">And you mentioned how they were sharing bread and so forth.</span> <span id="s324">Were they, the Russians have… had a reputation for being sometimes vicious even with the people that they liberated.</span> <span id="s325">Did you witness any of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: No.</span> <span id="s327">Initially we woke up because of… we were on the train still and the train was stopped.</span> <span id="s328">And all kinds of noises, and here were the Russian Cossacks just the way they were pictured, you know, in their furs and horseback and rifles slung over their shoulders.</span> <span id="s329">And we had learned, like you said, the one word in Russian, chleb (ph), which is bread.</span> <span id="s330">And they let us off, and so we went on into town.</span> <span id="s331">Then there must have been some discussion about where to go and whoever, they told us just to go and if you need to, throw the Germans out.</span> <span id="s332">And we happened to go into a fairly large house along with some others, who… the woman claimed they were in the Nazis, but her husband was a minister.</span> <span id="s333">And he sure was in the SS.</span> <span id="s334">And so we didn’t have any compunction about bullying them.</span> <span id="s335">Somebody, apparently there must have been some people who spoke Yiddish or either the Russian soldiers spoke Yiddish or they spoke Russian.</span> <span id="s336">I remember somebody said something about food, and so one of the Russians just pulled out a gun and shot a cow and said help yourself.</span> <span id="s337">One of the French women recognized the opportunity and went with the frontline unit.</span> <span id="s338">And of course, that morning crossed the Elbe River into the American part of Germany and managed to get back to Paris, which of course had been liberated the year before.</span> <span id="s339">And put an ad in the Paris paper, those who were looking for their wives, and I don’t know whether she mentioned names or it was a specific group.</span> <span id="s340">And they responded.</span> <span id="s341">Many of them were of course in the French Army.</span> <span id="s342">And so they got the American Army to send two of those two and a half ton trucks over to come and get them.</span> <span id="s343">And of course, everybody wanted to go.</span> <span id="s344">And they promised they’d be back and they did.</span> <span id="s345">I guess in the euphoria, you know, the war was over by that time.</span> <span id="s346">I think we were in Tribitz (ph) for about six weeks.</span> <span id="s347">All of the people that were still alive from that train, there were about a thousand of them, were evacuated by the Americans and taken to Leipzig, where they had a DP camp.</span> <span id="s348">And the Russians let the trucks come in and get them.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: What kind of condition were you in at the time of liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: Barely alive if you can even count that.</span> <span id="s351">We had to be very careful.</span> <span id="s352">Many people died because they ate things that they couldn’t digest.</span> <span id="s353">Their digestive system was so severely weakened or disturbed that a glass of milk would kill you.</span> <span id="s354">You just couldn’t tolerate that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s355">You had to be very careful that you ate only a little bit and a little bit.</span> <span id="s356">And of course a little bit was always more than what we had had for a long time.</span> <span id="s357">So that was important that you didn’t… I remember getting a hold, we heard that nearby was a Army depot, food depot, and we went there.</span> <span id="s358">And sure enough there was.</span> <span id="s359">And I got some… I’m not sure I got cans or an open bucket of condensed milk, you know, had a lot of sugar in it.</span> <span id="s360">And we just couldn’t eat it, not for a while.</span> <span id="s361">Because we couldn’t digest it, it was that rich.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: But you were able to walk?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: Oh yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: I think you mentioned how much you weighed, did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Well when I got back to Amsterdam I weighed 78 pounds.</span> <span id="s366">So I don’t know how much I weighed then, maybe fifty or sixty, strictly skin over bones.</span> <span id="s367">If I would have gotten a haircut, I would have taken a pound off.</span> <span id="s368">(Laughing.)</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: They didn’t shave your head while you were in Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: Yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Were you with your entire family at that point while you were riding the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s373">Yes.</span> <span id="s374">We were all together.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Was that moment of encountering the Cossack unit, were you aware this is it, it’s over?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s377">Absolutely, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Was that a particularly emotionally charged…?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: Oh sure.</span> <span id="s380">Oh absolutely, joyous.</span> <span id="s381">Now you had an opportunity, you might live.</span> <span id="s382">Might actually see 1946.</span> <span id="s383">Definitely.</span> <span id="s384">Yeah, everybody… I’m digressing, but I didn’t know anybody on that train.</span> <span id="s385">I had never run into anybody who was, for that matter, never ran into anybody who was at Belsen.</span> <span id="s386">And I guess it’s three years ago now.</span> <span id="s387">We were, we took a trip, first grand circle tour we ever took.</span> <span id="s388">It was a river cruise from Vienna to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s389">It was the first time that I was back in Germany and I wasn’t sure whether I could tolerate it or not.</span> <span id="s390">We decided on this trip because I could just stay on the boat.</span> <span id="s391">Didn’t have to go on land where I would have to be in contact with any Germans.</span> <span id="s392">But one night we’re having dinner with two ladies.</span> <span id="s393">One of whom, very interesting woman—she was the one who introduced the Lamaze method to the United States—and her cousin.</span> <span id="s394">And somehow the other woman was telling us that her daughter was taking her daughter, the woman’s grandchild, to Europe, Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s395">They had discussed Anne Frank in class and she wanted to see the Anne Frank house.</span> <span id="s396">And she said, “I told my daughter there’s always long lines at the Anne Frank house and if you can’t get in, go next door, that’s where your father was hidden during the war.”</span> <span id="s397">And I said to her, “Oh, were you in Amsterdam during the war?”</span> <span id="s398">And she said yes she was, but her two sisters both got found out.</span> <span id="s399">They all had gone into hiding.</span> <span id="s400">And they ended up in Belsen.</span> <span id="s401">I said, “Oh, that’s where I was.</span> <span id="s402">I never met anybody from Belsen.”</span> <span id="s403">I said, “Are they still alive?”</span> <span id="s404">And she said yeah, the one sister was.</span> <span id="s405">But the other sister and her husband died after they were liberated.</span> <span id="s406">They were hauled by train.</span> <span id="s407">“Oh,” I said, “to Tribitz?”</span> <span id="s408">And she said “Yes, how do you know?”</span> <span id="s409">And I said, “I was on that train also.”</span> <span id="s410">And so that’s as close as I ever came to meeting anybody or knowing anybody.</span> <span id="s411">But the irony, irony, small world: the sister who was still alive lived next door to my mother’s closest friend in New York.</span> <span id="s412">So you never know.</span> <span id="s413">But no, I didn’t know anybody and outside of that incident I have never talked to anybody who was there.</span> <span id="s414">As a matter of fact, my brother is very active.</span> <span id="s415">He’s on the Board of Directors of the Anne Frank house.</span> <span id="s416">And I happened to be talking to him about a year or so ago and he told me, and I didn’t realize, I went to school with Anne Frank.</span> <span id="s417">I was in the same class, but I don’t remember her at all.</span> <span id="s418">And I got to wondering if there is a class picture that exists.</span> <span id="s419">I’ll have to ask him of the grade school.</span> <span id="s420">Because we both should be in it.</span> <span id="s421">Just curious.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: There is another woman that we interviewed last year or so, who went to school with Anne Frank as well.</span> <span id="s423">I don’t recall her maiden name, but her married name was Barbara Rodbell.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: There is somebody and my brother knows about it, her, that is apparently active in the Anne Frank House Foundation and goes around speaking.</span> <span id="s425">I’m not sure if it’s the same woman or not.</span> <span id="s426">But somebody that was either a friend of Anne Frank or knew her.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: And actually I might be mistaken, she might not have been in school, she was a friend of hers.</span> <span id="s428">Her sister especially.</span> <span id="s429">But they might have lived nearby.</span> <span id="s430">So, you’re with your family and you’re returning to Amsterdam, and you described some, in the first interview, some of that… you were housed first in the DP camp in Leipzig?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: First in Leipzig.</span> <span id="s432">Essentially what it was, was a military barracks that was used.</span> <span id="s433">We could come and go.</span> <span id="s434">We were not prisoners.</span> <span id="s435">They let us come and go.</span> <span id="s436">Matter of fact, very grateful about many things.</span> <span id="s437">De-lousing with DDT.</span> <span id="s438">They sprayed us from head to toe with DDT.</span> <span id="s439">Think how environmentally unacceptable that is today.</span> <span id="s440">And I’m still alive in spite of it.</span> <span id="s441">But it got rid of the fleas and in particular the lice which was so important.</span> <span id="s442">But we could come and go as we pleased.</span> <span id="s443">And I don’t remember it was with my brother or some other boys, anyway, young men, we would get on the trolley and the conductor trying to collect money from us and we told him what he could do, or what we would do.</span> <span id="s444">We were pretty nasty.</span> <span id="s445">So they left us pretty much alone.</span> <span id="s446">And then we weren’t there all that long.</span> <span id="s447">And then when they were told, they’re going to take us back to Holland, it was on a Red Cross train.</span> <span id="s448">We wouldn’t go onto the beds because they were absolutely starched, bleached, perfectly white sheets.</span> <span id="s449">And here we were, in spite of getting regular baths, pretty filthy.</span> <span id="s450">We only had one set of clothes and shoes.</span> <span id="s451">I’m sure we had shoes.</span> <span id="s452">I had a woman’s blouse, because I remember it, Army blouse, because it buttoned the wrong way.</span> <span id="s453">But they weren’t even able to fit, not small enough.</span> <span id="s454">They insisted we get in the beds and don’t worry about getting them dirty.</span> <span id="s455">And then they brought us bread that was as white as the sheets were.</span> <span id="s456">Couldn’t believe that.</span> <span id="s457">But anyway they took us back to Holland and they put us in a convent in southern Holland, where the Dutch then sorted things out.</span> <span id="s458">And you had to have a place to stay before they’d send you back to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s459">And that was taken care of.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: While you were still in Germany did you witness anybody, any of the former prisoners taking revenge on Germans or did you desire that yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: No.</span> <span id="s462">Well, I suppose if you would have known somebody or run into somebody that you knew had been a, recognized a prison guard, I don’t think he would have survived.</span> <span id="s463">But that would have been such a chance encounter.</span> <span id="s464">No.</span> <span id="s465">Well, for one thing we were wearing what looked like American Army uniforms because that’s the only clothing, I guess, that we were given.</span> <span id="s466">I’m not sure what else the Red Cross had that they gave us.</span> <span id="s467">So that the Germans gave us a pretty wide berth.</span> <span id="s468">Because they didn’t have anything to do anyway.</span> <span id="s469">Things were pretty chaotic.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: Do you recall how you felt at the time?</span> <span id="s471">Angry or happy or any hopes?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: Hopeful is probably the best.</span> <span id="s473">No, I don’t think anger set in until later.</span> <span id="s474">At that point you’re just trying to revive, was probably the closest word to describe it.</span> <span id="s475">You’re still fairly weak.</span> <span id="s476">You’re beginning to get a little better.</span> <span id="s477">You can eat a little bit more.</span> <span id="s478">Beginning to feel a little better all the time.</span> <span id="s479">And at this point you’re just trying to survive.</span> <span id="s480">You’re really not thinking about the future, what you want to do, or what you have to do or what you’re going to do.</span> <span id="s481">You’re still preoccupied with eating, primarily.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: And getting enough to eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: And getting, yeah, yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s484">And we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: What about your, when you returned to Amsterdam and just adjusting to daily life again?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: Well, initially of course, I think we were all spread out.</span> <span id="s487">I stayed with one family who was a friend of my parents.</span> <span id="s488">My brother stayed with a friend of his.</span> <span id="s489">His closest friend was an American.</span> <span id="s490">His father was the distributor for Holland and Belgium of RKO, the movies.</span> <span id="s491">And I think he stayed with them.</span> <span id="s492">And my parents stayed with, I don’t even remember who it was.</span> <span id="s493">Somebody.</span> <span id="s494">So we were in different locations.</span> <span id="s495">We weren’t really, and this was like, talking the summer of ‘45.</span> <span id="s496">There really wasn’t much going on.</span> <span id="s497">Trying to see about getting back into school.</span> <span id="s498">My high school class had graduated.</span> <span id="s499">I think we may have actually been back in Amsterdam when the graduation was, but of course they wouldn’t give me my diploma.</span> <span id="s500">Hadn’t been there in four years.</span> <span id="s501">Four out of six wasn’t good enough.</span> <span id="s502">And so my mother was making arrangements to see what the school about me trying out, well both of us, trying to get back into school in the Fall.</span> <span id="s503">What the requirements would be, and trying to line up a tutor and a place to live.</span> <span id="s504">And I think, somebody… the Dutch did things fairly reasonably.</span> <span id="s505">The person that was living in our house had gotten there in good faith.</span> <span id="s506">He did not know, or they did not know that was the property or the residence of deported Jews.</span> <span id="s507">And so what they did, if the person had something in good faith, so you don’t have, just transfer the victim from one person to another.</span> <span id="s508">They could stay there.</span> <span id="s509">So my parents found a place to live.</span> <span id="s510">And I don’t know where the furniture came from, whether that was, whether those were donations or purchases or whether they had given some of that furniture to somebody to hide.</span> <span id="s511">But anyway we ultimately had an apartment where we lived.</span> <span id="s512">And then school started pretty soon.</span> <span id="s513">We had a tutor trying to get us up to speed, because I was allowed into the senior class on the condition that if I didn’t measure up, that the school would have the right not to let me take the comprehensive exams at the end of the year.</span> <span id="s514">Well that’s the deal they made with my parents, obviously.</span> <span id="s515">Apparently I did all right because… and I do remember having to go to a couple of teachers after classes for additional instruction.</span> <span id="s516">It’s kind of tough to pick up solid geometry if you haven’t had trigonometry.</span> <span id="s517">So, trying to catch up.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: Was it easy for you to focus on studies after what you had been through?</span> <span id="s519">Was that a challenge at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: I never thought of it in those terms, but I suppose so because that’s the only thing we did, was to go to school.</span> <span id="s521">And you come home, and you may have had to stay after class for additional instruction.</span> <span id="s522">And depending on—I’m not sure whether you’re familiar with the European system—it’s not ten minutes worth of homework.</span> <span id="s523">You spent every night doing homework, and we went to school on Saturdays half a day.</span> <span id="s524">And so maybe we were allowed to go and play for ten minutes before dinner.</span> <span id="s525">Or if we happened to get done by eight o’clock, the homework, we could play for a half hour before going to bed.</span> <span id="s526">But it, it was all-consuming, essentially, except maybe for the weekends.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: So you didn’t, you weren’t necessarily ever… was there a point were you remember you started really reflecting on what had happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s529">It really would have been pointless anyway.</span> <span id="s530">The Dutch had been exceedingly helpful, and trying to shield people.</span> <span id="s531">And not personally, but from others that they tried to hide an awful lot of Jews.</span> <span id="s532">The population as a whole, with minor exceptions, had always been very supportive.</span> <span id="s533">And now you’re back after the war and you’re no longer wearing the star, you’re no longer distinguishable from the rest of the population.</span> <span id="s534">And so there was no need for anybody to either bend over backwards or kick you in the shins.</span> <span id="s535">So, no, I don’t think, as a matter of fact, I really haven’t dwelled on it much all my life.</span> <span id="s536">I have a cousin who was a professional Holocaust survivor and I always detested that.</span> <span id="s537">It was one of those things that happened, nothing you can do about it.</span> <span id="s538">I’m not ashamed of it certainly.</span> <span id="s539">I’m not proud of it.</span> <span id="s540">I mean, nothing you can do about it.</span> <span id="s541">I suppose like most unpleasant things, you try and put them out of your mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: This maybe is kind of a digression, going out of the chronology, but was there a point where you really felt compelled personally to talk about your experiences to anyone?</span> <span id="s543">Like that would help you or help other people to…?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: No, never did.</span> <span id="s545">I’ve never been much for psychologists.</span> <span id="s546">(Laughing.)</span> <span id="s547">No, I never, and I suppose a lot of the reason I don’t remember a lot of things because they’re probably suppressed memory, and why bring it up?</span> <span id="s548">What purpose does it serve?</span> <span id="s549">I know a friend of mine keeps after me to try and write a book.</span> <span id="s550">And I don’t, I say absolutely not.</span> <span id="s551">One, there’s not enough to fill a page, but aside from that, no, I don’t… matter of fact, there’s somebody come from the Holocaust Museum this month.</span> <span id="s552">Did you see that?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: I heard something about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: I think it’s, Goldfarb, is that his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: Marvin, Martin Goldfarb.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: Yeah, whatever.</span> <span id="s557">It is Goldfarb, isn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: I’m pretty sure.</span> <span id="s559">I’m blanking on his name right now, but I know him.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: Yeah, okay.</span> <span id="s561">That’s okay.</span> <span id="s562">Okay, that’s all right.</span> <span id="s563">I got invitation, I don’t know where it came from.</span> <span id="s564">It was an invitation to the Holocaust survivors in the second generation.</span> <span id="s565">And I was debating whether to go or not.</span> <span id="s566">Because one thing, I don’t know any of them that are here.</span> <span id="s567">And I’m not so sure whether I care to or not.</span> <span id="s568">I haven’t made up my mind.</span> <span id="s569">I may decide on the last minute whether I will or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: Okay, we have another minute or so on this tape.</span> <span id="s571">Well, that’s interesting.</span> <span id="s572">Your brother has, it sounds like, taken kind of an active role in something that’s related to being a Holocaust survivor.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s574">And that came about because he saw an article in a paper about the Anne Frank Foundation and somebody’s name who was, I guess the Chairman of the Board, who lived near where he lived in Vermont.</span> <span id="s575">And he had never heard of the man before and he called him to meet him, just out of curiosity.</span> <span id="s576">And apparently they got friendly and he got him involved in the Anne Frank Foundation and he’s on the Board of Directors now, has been for a few years.</span> <span id="s577">And he goes around the country every so often making speeches and fundraising and that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s578">And I’m not sure whether he knew, because looking at his tape, I’m not sure whether he mentioned the name of the school that we went to or not.</span> <span id="s579">Anyway I don’t remember what it is.</span> <span id="s580">But it was obviously the same school that Anne Frank went to.</span> <span id="s581">The only thing I remember about that school is we made honey in the Fall.</span> <span id="s582">They had bee hives on the roof.</span> <span id="s583">I was thinking about that earlier, I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s584">Whenever it was ready we would go upstairs and they would take the hives, the honeycombs out and put them in a centrifuge and we made honey.</span> <span id="s585">And I guess carved up the combs and sold it with the wax and the honey.</span> <span id="s586">That’s about the only thing I remember.</span> <span id="s587">(Laughing.)</span> <span id="s588">There was something else, too, animal-related about that grade school.</span> <span id="s589">Can’t think of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: Let’s go ahead and change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">End of Tape 1, Side B Tape 2, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: This is tape number two, side A. And would you say a little bit more about that?</span> <span id="s593">I was wondering about, continuing in this same vein of digression, I was wondering about your feeling as a Holocaust survivor, whether you feel that there’s any benefit to be derived from identifying yourself that way?</span> <span id="s594">With the work that your brother… (Rosenberg bursts out laughing) …it’s a strange way of putting the question, isn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: No, I tell you reason I am laughing is I suppose if you look for sympathy it would be.</span> <span id="s596">But no, I don’t.</span> <span id="s597">I’ve never found any benefit to either, occasionally if I get pushed I will mention it.</span> <span id="s598">I normally don’t as a matter of conversation.</span> <span id="s599">We were in Spain and there was a couple in that group that we were with, who were Germans, who had retired.</span> <span id="s600">He had worked for General Motors and they lived in Windsor, across in Canada.</span> <span id="s601">And they had invited a friend of theirs from Germany to come down and join us.</span> <span id="s602">We were on the trip up to Granada to see the Alhambra.</span> <span id="s603">And on the way back we were sitting at a table and this man came wandering in by himself.</span> <span id="s604">I said to him in German, “How are you doing?”</span> <span id="s605">He complained, “Not very well.”</span> <span id="s606">He didn’t speak English, and so unless his friends were around… blah, blah, blah.</span> <span id="s607">And then on a stop on the way back, we were standing in line together and he said, “How come you speak German so well?”</span> <span id="s608">And I was debating what to say.</span> <span id="s609">I just said, “I was in a concentration camp.”</span> <span id="s610">And I totally devastated that man.</span> <span id="s611">And that evening he sought me out in the bar and came to apologize.</span> <span id="s612">I said, “Hey, it’s not your fault, you were too young.”</span> <span id="s613">This man was in his fifties, he may have been a child at the time.</span> <span id="s614">“Oh, please come to Germany,” he would host us, et cetera, et cetera.</span> <span id="s615">So I’m always very careful because there’s no need to upset people that have no, you know, no responsibility.</span> <span id="s616">I’m not looking for an advantage.</span> <span id="s617">So no, I rarely volunteer the information.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: What about, you’re doing this interview today.</span> <span id="s619">You did one other interview.</span> <span id="s620">What has made you agree to do those?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: Well, it’s the neo-Nazism that says it never happened.</span> <span id="s622">And I think there needs to be as much evidence as possible to show that it really did happen.</span> <span id="s623">And that those many of us who survived are perfectly normal people.</span> <span id="s624">Or what passes for normal, at least I think so.</span> <span id="s625">(Laughing.)</span> <span id="s626">And don’t all go around looking, “Hey, you owe me a favor because I survived.”</span> <span id="s627">But it’s not a bias free society.</span> <span id="s628">Until whatever it is, say five years ago… I’ve been wanting to go and visit my grandparent’s grave.</span> <span id="s629">I just couldn’t bring myself the thought of going to Germany.</span> <span id="s630">One, because it’s Germany; and two, that I wasn’t sure whether I could control my temper if somebody were to say something to me that would set me off.</span> <span id="s631">And so we decided on a trial and that was we went to Switzerland for a week with day trips out of Lucerne.</span> <span id="s632">And the first trip was to the Black Forest.</span> <span id="s633">You get out of it for lunch and you get back on the bus.</span> <span id="s634">The bus was the safe haven.</span> <span id="s635">And then another day for a couple of hours.</span> <span id="s636">And it went all right.</span> <span id="s637">I didn’t feel particularly bad or tense.</span> <span id="s638">But on that boat trip, after Cologne it got to me suddenly, and I had to get out of there.</span> <span id="s639">And I actually during dinner, got up, went up on top of the boat, on the top deck, to make sure we passed that border back into Holland.</span> <span id="s640">Because I just got obsessed all of a sudden, panicky.</span> <span id="s641">And haven’t been back since.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: What about your children?</span> <span id="s643">Have you… people who are as far as can be from Neo-Nazis: do you feel like it’s important to you to leave them some kind of information or some kind of knowledge about your life and your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: Well, they know about it, of course.</span> <span id="s645">At least one daughter, I think has… no, I think they all have copies of the tape of the interview.</span> <span id="s646">The tape that one of my… it’s really my father’s cousin that was much more informative than mine or, for that matter, my brother’s.</span> <span id="s647">This fellow got to Belsen the day before the liberation or two days before the liberation.</span> <span id="s648">The Swedes took him out, sent him to Sweden.</span> <span id="s649">He was in a Swedish hospital for a year.</span> <span id="s650">But he decided to use that year to write down everything he could remember.</span> <span id="s651">And then spend the rest of his life filling in the details that he didn’t remember, and try and get the… and he wrote a book.</span> <span id="s652">The original was published in German and just before he died, supposedly it was published, finally got published in English.</span> <span id="s653">And I never did get a copy of it.</span> <span id="s654">I’ll have to ask my cousin for it.</span> <span id="s655">But I got a copy of his tape.</span> <span id="s656">But he remembers names and dates and… and he went from one labor camp to another labor camp, and the name of the commander of the camp and all that kind of stuff that I have no idea about and really, don’t really care.</span> <span id="s657">And yeah, my kids know, but they also really have no relation to it.</span> <span id="s658">My youngest daughter couldn’t, when I said something to her about the Vietnam War, she says, “But Dad I was only six then.”</span> <span id="s659">You know, so it’s all ancient history.</span> <span id="s660">Just like World War One is ancient history to me.</span> <span id="s661">I know about it.</span> <span id="s662">I’m a bit of a history buff and I wanted to see the Bosporus.</span> <span id="s663">That’s a World War One site.</span> <span id="s664">The British took one hell of a beating there.</span> <span id="s665">That was Churchill’s doing.</span> <span id="s666">And went to Yalta, wanted to see that.</span> <span id="s667">But no, they’re not really interested.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: Did you intentionally at some point start telling your children about…?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: …your history?</span> <span id="s671">It just kind of gradually…?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s673">My wife may have told them something or my mother may have.</span> <span id="s674">It may have come out, a comment here or there or something that occurred that made me bring it up or a program that I watched.</span> <span id="s675">Spielberg had a program, was it last week or week before last, it was on HBO.</span> <span id="s676">I was going to tape it, but I don’t have HBO.</span> <span id="s677">When there’s something on the Holocaust I usually tape it.</span> <span id="s678">More for my information than to show others.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: And I’m curious about what you mentioned a little earlier about someone who you know who’s a professional Holocaust survivor.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: That was my cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: Your cousin?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: Well, my father’s cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: And is that something… and you mentioned that it bothers you.</span> <span id="s684">Can you say more about what bothers you about that or what you think the danger of that is?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: Oh, I don’t think there’s danger in it, it may bore people to death, but you can do that with other things, too.</span> <span id="s686">That was the singular defining incident of his life.</span> <span id="s687">And everything is being related to that.</span> <span id="s688">I… that may have been the most important event in my life, even though I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s689">I think there are much more important things, I mean it’s part of my history.</span> <span id="s690">I was fortunate that I survived it, and I moved on.</span> <span id="s691">I don’t particularly dwell on it.</span> <span id="s692">Or try and say, “Now wait a minute, I married that woman because I didn’t see that woman…” or you know, and relate it to the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s693">It has nothing to do with it.</span> <span id="s694">Well, in his case everything was.</span> <span id="s695">It came up in every conversation.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: And have you had the experience as somebody who has survived the Holocaust, of people maybe assuming that because you are a Holocaust survivor that was the defining event of your life and therefore kind of maybe not seeing you clearly?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: No, because I doubt whether anybody that would know me or that I would know, would find out that I am a Holocaust survivor until they really have known me for a long time.</span> <span id="s698">Because it’s, see I don’t normally bring it up.</span> <span id="s699">Not unless something happens to make it pop up for some reason or another, inadvertently, but no, I wouldn’t think so.</span> <span id="s700">They just see the lack of hair.</span> <span id="s701">(Laughing.)</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: Is being Jewish important to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Yeah, definitely.</span> <span id="s704">I am the only Jew in my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s707">(Laughing.)</span> <span id="s708">And I am proud of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: So, what does that mean to you, to be the only Jew in your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: Oh, I am saying it jokingly and seriously.</span> <span id="s711">My wife is Episcopalian.</span> <span id="s712">Our children were baptized in the Episcopalian church, but are not particularly religious.</span> <span id="s713">My youngest daughter was married in the Catholic church and now her children were just baptized in the last month, because they want… the older one now is going to first grade.</span> <span id="s714">And with the public schools here in Louisville in such a mess, they want to put the boy into parochial school.</span> <span id="s715">And they belong to a parish and apparently they are now going to church regularly, which is fine.</span> <span id="s716">I have no problem with it one way or the other.</span> <span id="s717">Our oldest daughter was married for the first time in the Episcopal cathedral in Lexington, which as you may know is so orthodox that the mass was in Latin.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: They don’t even do that in Catholic church.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: I know.</span> <span id="s720">(Laughing.)</span> <span id="s721">That marriage didn’t last and her current husband is a Baptist.</span> <span id="s722">I’m not sure that they are going to church, but their son goes to Bible school.</span> <span id="s723">He was in, going to public school, not this Fall, but he was in a Baptist kindergarten and preschool.</span> <span id="s724">And the other one doesn’t have any children and as far as I know, they were married by a minister who was, whom they knew.</span> <span id="s725">So that’s why I’m saying that.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: So, what does it mean to you, can you say what it means to you to be Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s728">No more so than what it means being a chemist or of German extraction or married or grandfather or anything else.</span> <span id="s729">You better not say anything anti-Semitic or I’ll blow your head off.</span> <span id="s730">(Laughing.)</span> <span id="s731">But other than that, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: It doesn’t necessarily mean keeping certain traditions or going to synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: Not really, no, no.</span> <span id="s734">Keep certain traditions, but I… bit of a pragmatist, and I’m not all that tradition-bound.</span> <span id="s735">I think the dietary laws make good sense from a health perspective, but I don’t particularly find the need to avoid eating shrimp.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: What about, do you think of Judaism as a… when you say it’s important to you to be Jewish, is it as a religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: Well it’s really more ethnic than a religion.</span> <span id="s738">Did you by chance see that program on trying to find the lost tribes a few weeks ago on PBS?</span> <span id="s739">Fascinating program.</span> <span id="s740">To some people being Jewish is a religion, obviously, Sammy Davis Jr. is probably the… Elizabeth Taylor.</span> <span id="s741">But to… I would think most Jews, it’s more ethnic than religious.</span> <span id="s742">You can’t help whatever your racial or ethnic background is.</span> <span id="s743">I’m not hiding it and I’m not flaunting it.</span> <span id="s744">So, I don’t care.</span> <span id="s745">You know, whether somebody knows or doesn’t know.</span> <span id="s746">It’s not that I don’t care personally, what I mean is I’m not concerned about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: So you’re not a particularly religious person?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: No, I’m not.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s750">Let’s go pick up the timeline again.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: We left off in Amsterdam just after the war.</span> <span id="s753">You’re going back to school, you’re working hard at being a student.</span> <span id="s754">And as far as, you were talking about being hopeful at the time.</span> <span id="s755">What were you, do you recall what you were hopeful for, what you really wanted for the rest of your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: Well, initially to graduate from high school, you know, trying to pass the exams or get far enough along that I would be allowed to take the exams.</span> <span id="s757">And then once they decided that I could, then of course sweating like everybody else to pass them.</span> <span id="s758">But I did.</span> <span id="s759">I wanted to become a chemist or a chemical engineer.</span> <span id="s760">And after I graduated from high school I went to Delft, Technical Institute in Delft for one year, ‘46, ‘47, to study chemical engineering.</span> <span id="s761">Then much to my dismay, my parents decided to come to the United States and I didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s762">Well for one thing, you had to leave your friends, just getting into the swing of things having done my freshman year in college.</span> <span id="s763">But they didn’t give me a choice, and so then of course the logical thing was… a lot of my mother’s family and some of my dad’s family were over here, had been over here for years, so we came over here in ‘47, Memorial Day, ‘47.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: Did you consider not coming and staying?</span> <span id="s765">By then you were an adult.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: Oh yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s767">Not coming, I said, I wasn’t given that option.</span> <span id="s768">I said, “Okay, I’ll go with you, but I’m going to go back.”</span> <span id="s769">You get used to… it’s a changed situation, and I probably didn’t really give it much serious thought after some months or some years to go back.</span> <span id="s770">Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: Did you have any… what were your notions about the U.S. at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: Well, you know the only notions you have are the cowboys, and the skyscrapers of New York.</span> <span id="s773">And since it was Memorial Day when we got here, the night before traveling along the South shore of Long Island you saw the fireworks.</span> <span id="s774">Of course, you didn’t know what was going on.</span> <span id="s775">Memorial Day didn’t mean anything to us.</span> <span id="s776">Then it was hot.</span> <span id="s777">I’m not sure if it was hot for Memorial Day, but like it is right now.</span> <span id="s778">It was one of these early hot spells.</span> <span id="s779">Our, my mother’s brothers came and picked us up, met us at the boat, and took us over to my mother’s sister’s apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: Where was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: In New York, New York City.</span> <span id="s782">My mother was one of 13 brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s783">And one, two, three… four sisters were in the United States, and three of her brothers.</span> <span id="s784">And the three, three sisters and the three brothers lived in New York City.</span> <span id="s785">And my dad’s sister, I think she may still have been in Rochester at the time.</span> <span id="s786">I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s787">And matter of fact, they had written, my mother’s brothers had gotten an apartment for us, which was across the street from one and next-door to one of the other ones.</span> <span id="s788">In Queens, in New York City.</span> <span id="s789">And so we lived there.</span> <span id="s790">I guess, but I’m not sure, we stayed with my aunt for a while until our furniture arrived, because I’m not sure it was on the same boat.</span> <span id="s791">It came later.</span> <span id="s792">I don’t remember, it’s been a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: So, you came by ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: Oh Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s795">The Veyndam (ph) was the name of the ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: Dutch?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: It was a Holland-America Line freighter built in 1914.</span> <span id="s798">I looked it up recently, that’s why I can spout that stuff.</span> <span id="s799">(Laughing.)</span> <span id="s800">It was requisitioned during World War Two and was used as a troop ship.</span> <span id="s801">And then this was the last trip across the Atlantic to the States to be reconverted, to have all of the bunks and all that stuff taken out and be converted back to a freighter and was retired in 1954.</span> <span id="s802">I couldn’t remember the name of the ship.</span> <span id="s803">I looked it up in the New York Times a year or two ago.</span> <span id="s804">They had the comings and goings of all the ships and they listed them in the New York Times.</span> <span id="s805">Listed as May 30th, Memorial, May 30th with 112 passengers.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: You remember anything about the journey?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s808">(Laughing.)</span> <span id="s809">The… I’m not sure how many, 20 or so people could live in the cabins and my parents had a cabin.</span> <span id="s810">Most of us were down in the hold and like all troop ships, you know, seven stacks.</span> <span id="s811">And we used the bottom one or the second bottom one, there was nobody there.</span> <span id="s812">And it was pretty good until the weather got rough.</span> <span id="s813">We really got tossed around and that day that we got tossed around the dinner was bacon and beans.</span> <span id="s814">I just stayed in the bunk.</span> <span id="s815">But one fellow, he was a big eater.</span> <span id="s816">He never missed a meal and he came charging down the steps, threw his teeth on the bunk and ran back up and fed the fish.</span> <span id="s817">Then he came back, got his teeth, and went back to eat the second time.</span> <span id="s818">(Laughing.)</span> <span id="s819">That’s about all.</span> <span id="s820">It was a long trip.</span> <span id="s821">It was 14 days, the ship was slow.</span> <span id="s822">But that’s all I remember.</span> <span id="s823">It was unremarkable.</span> <span id="s824">Left from Antwerp, stopped in South Hampton to Hoboken, which was the Holland-American Line terminal.</span> <span id="s825">Ellis Island had been closed about a month or two earlier, so we didn’t come through Ellis Island.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: Remember first impressions of New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: Hot, hot and dirty.</span> <span id="s828">Of course the high rise, and the frantic activity, cars going everywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: How was your English?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: Non-existent or very poor.</span> <span id="s831">Well, I had high school English.</span> <span id="s832">But didn’t have much choice, had to learn in a hurry, because I got a job within a week as a lab technician at Mount Sinai Hospital.</span> <span id="s833">Paid the glorious wage of 100 dollars a month.</span> <span id="s834">And we had to work half day Saturdays.</span> <span id="s835">And then we took, had to take… we didn’t have to, we took turns taking calls on the weekends.</span> <span id="s836">That paid an extra six dollars.</span> <span id="s837">And the girls all were more interested in going to the beach, so I took all of their calls, because I needed the six dollars more than I needed a suntan.</span> <span id="s838">And then I got a ticket.</span> <span id="s839">Two weeks in this country and I got a ticket.</span> <span id="s840">That was Saturday morning, going to work, I was going down the subway and a cop stopped me.</span> <span id="s841">I didn’t know what he wanted.</span> <span id="s842">I didn’t understand enough of what he was saying.</span> <span id="s843">And so I pulled my passport out and I opened it on the immigration stamp to show him I don’t, you know it was two weeks.</span> <span id="s844">I did understand what identification was.</span> <span id="s845">And so he proceeded to write and tore this thing out, gave me my passport back and tore this thing out and told me it was a ticket.</span> <span id="s846">Well the only meaning of the word ticket I knew was admission to a theater.</span> <span id="s847">Didn’t want to, don’t have time to go.</span> <span id="s848">Tried to explain… finally made me take it, he told me I didn’t have to go myself, I could give it to somebody else.</span> <span id="s849">When I got to work I tried to tell the fellow I work with, I asked him if he wanted the ticket.</span> <span id="s850">He said what for?</span> <span id="s851">(Laughing.)</span> <span id="s852">I told him I didn’t know, but a cop had given it to me.</span> <span id="s853">So he explained to me that I had gotten a ticket for whatever, well, it was June and first of July was the end of the fiscal year and he had to make his quota, so he was writing tickets furiously and I guess I looked like a good sucker for one.</span> <span id="s854">And when I became a citizen you have to list all non-moving traffic violations excepted.</span> <span id="s855">So I went back to court to find out what the heck I had done.</span> <span id="s856">Whatever it was, violation of city code something or other, disposition, two dollars.</span> <span id="s857">Fine of two dollars, that was it.</span> <span id="s858">But it’s on my records.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: It’s not on your records as having, the infraction was not listed on your records?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: No, I had to list it on my citizenship application.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: I mean the cause of the ticket being given.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: Oh it listed whatever it was, the code violation, but I have no idea what it was that I did.</span> <span id="s863">You know, hopscotch down the steps into the subway, who knows what it was.</span> <span id="s864">The reason you had to be so careful… in the ‘30s and ‘40s, well prior to let’s say the ‘50s and ‘60s, anti-Semitism was an acceptable feeling in this country.</span> <span id="s865">And the State Department was so strongly anti-Semitic, they saw it as their function to keep as many Jews out as they could, not to try and rescue as many and let them in.</span> <span id="s866">And the Immigration Service didn’t help matters either.</span> <span id="s867">An uncle of mine when he went for his hearing was asked for his convictions.</span> <span id="s868">He said he didn’t have any.</span> <span id="s869">The judge says, “Think it over and come back in six months.”</span> <span id="s870">This went on twice.</span> <span id="s871">You know, what the hell are you talking about?</span> <span id="s872">Well, it turned out that there was somebody with the same name, apparently, who had gotten a parking ticket in Buffalo, New York.</span> <span id="s873">And they accused him of lying because he didn’t list it.</span> <span id="s874">And he said, “I don’t even know where Buffalo is and I don’t have an automobile.”</span> <span id="s875">So they finally… but his citizenship was delayed for a year over something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: And you think it was because he was Jewish that they…?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: Oh sure.</span> <span id="s878">There wasn’t any… they put a lot of barriers in the way.</span> <span id="s879">Of course then too, you know, the rules were a little different.</span> <span id="s880">You had to be a resident for five years.</span> <span id="s881">You had to demonstrate your fluency in English, not like today where they’ll give it to you in Spanish or French or whatever.</span> <span id="s882">And lastly you had to demonstrate a knowledge of American history.</span> <span id="s883">And the Daughters of the American Revolution used to give courses in American history for foreigners.</span> <span id="s884">Who was the 23rd president?</span> <span id="s885">They asked my dad to name the 13 original colonies.</span> <span id="s886">And he got as far as one or two, I remember, and the judge said, “Guess I asked the wrong person, you tell me.”</span> <span id="s887">Well, I started out with Georgia going up the coast, because I could never remember whether it’s Maine or New Hampshire.</span> <span id="s888">(Laughing.)</span> <span id="s889">And he stopped me when I got to Vermont.</span> <span id="s890">So I got off easy.</span> <span id="s891">I got at least 12 of the 13.</span> <span id="s892">And he asked me, I still don’t know why that was the wrong answer, he asked me, “Why do we celebrate the Fourth of July?”</span> <span id="s893">I said, “Because it’s Independence Day.”</span> <span id="s894">That wasn’t the right answer.</span> <span id="s895">I’m not sure what it was supposed to be.</span> <span id="s896">But they were pretty strict and… depending on the judge, most of those were not all that bad.</span> <span id="s897">But there was… well Dupont did not hire its first Jew until World War Two.</span> <span id="s898">And when I graduated from college in ‘54, Armstrong-Quartz (ph) still didn’t hire Jews.</span> <span id="s899">It was that pervasive still.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: When was your citizenship?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: ‘52.</span> <span id="s902">Matter of fact, my brother couldn’t become a citizen because he was not in the country.</span> <span id="s903">You had to be in the country.</span> <span id="s904">He was in the military.</span> <span id="s905">He had been drafted.</span> <span id="s906">He couldn’t become a citizen because he was not in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: So you in those years, those first years that you came to the U.S… you came in ‘47?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: ‘47.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: Were you, you were aware of having to be very cautious as a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">End of Tape 2, Side A Tape 2, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: This is tape two, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: Well in New York there really was very little that you could or couldn’t do as such.</span> <span id="s913">But being ignorant as to the American way, I asked a girl in one of my classes at City College for a date and she turned me down flat.</span> <span id="s914">She was Italian and I was Jewish and it just didn’t go.</span> <span id="s915">I didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s916">I applied for admission to Columbia and RPI, Rensselaer in Albany, Schenectady.</span> <span id="s917">And I was turned down.</span> <span id="s918">In one instance, the Dutch quota was filled.</span> <span id="s919">You know, all kinds of barriers that existed that you ran into either unwittingly or stupidly, whichever, for me mostly unwittingly.</span> <span id="s920">Natives would have known better and would have avoided the… either embarrassment or whatever you want to call it.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: What were your parents doing once they arrived here?</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: My… you were, you had to come with a job offer and the company that my dad had worked for in Berlin in the thirties had a… what was then a branch in New York, which then or now was of course was the only office.</span> <span id="s923">And they had offered him a job there and so he went to work there the second day we were here or after the first week we were here.</span> <span id="s924">And I had gotten the job at Mount Sinai Hospital.</span> <span id="s925">My brother got a job somewhere, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s926">And so everybody worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: And you all shared an apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: Yes, we lived with my parents and since we were… I’ve been thinking about that, and of course, never asked.</span> <span id="s929">But we were expected to contribute to the household.</span> <span id="s930">And I’m not sure whether that was a matter of need or a matter of discipline.</span> <span id="s931">That you live here, you gotta pay for it.</span> <span id="s932">Earn money, your share, which was no problem.</span> <span id="s933">Once in the Fall, I started at night at the City College of New York, went to night school and worked during the day.</span> <span id="s934">Did that all the way through.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: How did you end up feeling about this country?</span> <span id="s936">You hadn’t been happy to come.</span> <span id="s937">Did you end up feeling, at some point feel at home here?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: Oh yeah, very quickly, certainly.</span> <span id="s939">And I don’t want you to think that I was paranoid about these barriers that you ran into.</span> <span id="s940">It was just ignorance, you learn from it.</span> <span id="s941">One of my uncles took me aside and gave me the facts of life.</span> <span id="s942">That there are some things that Jews can’t do in this country.</span> <span id="s943">(Clock chimes with bird-call.)</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: Cardinal?</span> <span id="s945">That means it’s three o’clock?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s947">(Laughing.)</span> <span id="s948">I guess you didn’t hear the two o’clock bird.</span> <span id="s949">It’s like the rules in, whether you like them or not you have to abide by them.</span> <span id="s950">You’re not supposed to drive more than 65 miles an hour.</span> <span id="s951">And then New York being such a big place you can avoid unpleasantries.</span> <span id="s952">There’s no need to go looking for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: Did it strike you as hypocritical?</span> <span id="s954">Or did you think about that?</span> <span id="s955">This so-called Home of the Free, discriminating against…?</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: No, frankly, no, no, I really never thought about it.</span> <span id="s957">There are some things that you… I guess it really wasn’t very important.</span> <span id="s958">They were minor inconveniences.</span> <span id="s959">It wasn’t any big deal.</span> <span id="s960">I can’t complain about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: So, what happened next?</span> <span id="s962">You’re going to school at night and you’re working in the day.</span> <span id="s963">And…</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: Trying to get better jobs.</span> <span id="s965">Getting paid more.</span> <span id="s966">And then I, of course, the Korean War started and I had to go for my physical.</span> <span id="s967">I was classified 1-A to begin with before I ever took the physical.</span> <span id="s968">And then trying to get a student deferment.</span> <span id="s969">I had a very nasty Draft Board that made all kinds of unpleasant remarks when I went for a hearing for a student deferment, about “What’s the matter, don’t you want to shoot some Chinks?”</span> <span id="s970">You know, that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s971">I graduated in January of ‘51.</span> <span id="s972">And went on to Graduate school, and they just gave me fits all the way through.</span> <span id="s973">They would re-classify me 1-A, had to appeal it.</span> <span id="s974">Then they would get it back to a student deferment for six months, but retroactive to a date of… so half the time I was deferred, half the time I wasn’t, which was a real distraction while in school.</span> <span id="s975">But I made it through all right.</span> <span id="s976">Didn’t even think about it, I went to work for Shell Oil Company and that was deferrable employment because of the oil industry.</span> <span id="s977">Of course the war was pretty well over by that time anyway, ‘54.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: Would you have felt willing to go and fight in the Korean War if you hadn’t been involved in this student… or what were your feelings behind that?</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: Not very happy about it.</span> <span id="s980">I wasn’t even a citizen.</span> <span id="s981">As a matter of fact, my brother, who was drafted, he did not go to school, he was actually sent to Germany.</span> <span id="s982">And when this citizenship hearing came up, he couldn’t, because he was overseas.</span> <span id="s983">I mean, that’s the most preposterous thing.</span> <span id="s984">He was in the U.S. Army therefore he couldn’t become a citizen.</span> <span id="s985">But not particularly happy about it.</span> <span id="s986">Wasted enough time in my life already without having to serve a few more years in the Army.</span> <span id="s987">But no, I wasn’t particularly, I was not unwilling.</span> <span id="s988">I mean, I wasn’t going to refuse.</span> <span id="s989">But I wasn’t going to volunteer either.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: When and how did you meet your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: We lived in the same house.</span> <span id="s992">Well, I have to say that I was too poor to live in the dormitory and three of us shared an apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: I’m sorry, what school was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: This was at Duke, at Duke University in Durham.</span> <span id="s995">And this is one of these old, you know, like old Louisville.</span> <span id="s996">Big homes and they made it into a number of apartments.</span> <span id="s997">We had one apartment upstairs, it was a Divinity student and his wife.</span> <span id="s998">Another apartment upstairs and the landlady rented out one of the apartments downstairs to Alice and her roommate.</span> <span id="s999">That’s how we met.</span> <span id="s1000">I was at Duke, she was working.</span> <span id="s1001">She was a lab technician working at the VA hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: And what was your major at Duke?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: Chemistry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: A particular type of chemistry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: Analytical chemistry.</span> <span id="s1006">That’s what I used to do for a living for a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: Had you thought… well it sounds like you didn’t have any feelings as far as dating a Jew versus a non-Jew or caring a lot on that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: Was your family equally indifferent?</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s1011">My dad certainly was, my mother, I’m not so sure.</span> <span id="s1012">I don’t think any girl would have been good enough for my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: Did you ever talk within your family about what had happened during the war or was this kind of a moot subject?</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: No, oh no, no.</span> <span id="s1015">They uh, no, certainly not.</span> <span id="s1016">They, well as I mentioned, my mother is one of thirteen children, two of them were killed in World War One.</span> <span id="s1017">Of the remaining eleven, three brothers were here and four sisters.</span> <span id="s1018">And the one brother was picked up during the Kristallnacht thing in ‘38 and taken to Dachau.</span> <span id="s1019">And then was released because he had pneumonia, so he wouldn’t die in a concentration camp, so they could count him as having released him, rather than having him die there.</span> <span id="s1020">And he died at home.</span> <span id="s1021">And they decided they better get their son out before he’s going to get it too.</span> <span id="s1022">But my mother’s sister-in-law with her daughter stayed and they perished.</span> <span id="s1023">And another sister and her husband had moved to Belgium in the early ‘30s.</span> <span id="s1024">He was a very prosperous furniture manufacturer.</span> <span id="s1025">They had two daughters.</span> <span id="s1026">And they actually helped one of the other sisters’ children, they managed to get out, I guess, as late as ’42, by way of Belgium and through Portugal.</span> <span id="s1027">They stayed for a while with them.</span> <span id="s1028">But that couple with their children, the sister, they perished.</span> <span id="s1029">As a matter of fact, I had documentation of them at one time, their death certificates.</span> <span id="s1030">And then on my father’s side, my grandmother, my dad’s mother, lived in Amsterdam also.</span> <span id="s1031">And she had cardiac problems so bad, she couldn’t have walked from here to the front door without taking nitroglycerine, but she survived the cattle car ride to the gas chambers and died at Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1032">And one of, his sister was here, but his brother was still in Germany and he perished.</span> <span id="s1033">And so no, we, and fortunately for my mother’s, my grandmother, my maternal grandmother, she died in late ‘44, so she never did find out what happened to her children, those that were in Europe.</span> <span id="s1034">But no, that was a common topic of conversation in the family.</span> <span id="s1035">My… the son that was sent over, he went back to his hometown looking for his parents or for his mother and sister.</span> <span id="s1036">He was in the Army.</span> <span id="s1037">Some of my other cousins that were in the Army went looking for the relatives and for us.</span> <span id="s1038">Of course once we got back to Holland, my parents, my mother contacted her sisters, and let them know that we had survived.</span> <span id="s1039">Of course, they also asked to see if we could find out from there what happened to the other relatives.</span> <span id="s1040">And there’s the extended family as I mentioned, my dad’s cousin, his parents did not survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: Robertson, he… (Laughing.)</span> <span id="s1043">I’m laughing because you ask about the name.</span> <span id="s1044">His name was Rosenberg also and when he was in the hospital in Sweden a man came in, a British Army officer and said to him, “Are you Hans Rosenberg?”</span> <span id="s1045">He said yes.</span> <span id="s1046">He said, “I’m Peter Robertson, your brother.”</span> <span id="s1047">(Laughing.)</span> <span id="s1048">He had been sent out and was drafted in the British Army and they wouldn’t allow the name Rosenberg.</span> <span id="s1049">Because in the event of he would be captured by the Germans that they wouldn’t… he wanted to just anglicize it and make it Montrose, but there’s a Lord Montrose and you’re not allowed to use the name of a famous person, so they made it Robertson.</span> <span id="s1050">And so then when he came over here and became a citizen he decided so he would have the same name as his brother he changed his name to Robertson.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: What was his first name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: Henry, Hans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: Okay, and this is the same one who you mentioned earlier, who had written the book?</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: Yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: So, most of your family’s conversation then, when you were talking about wartime issues was concerned with what had become of various family members and tracking people down and making…</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: Family members, to some extent, property, the carpet which is in our family room used to belong to my parents and then of course, the Germans got it.</span> <span id="s1057">And my dad was, sometime, I’m not sure when, in the fifties, he was in Holland on business and he saw it hanging in a carpet store in the window.</span> <span id="s1058">And he went in and said, “That’s my carpet.”</span> <span id="s1059">Fellow says, “Tough luck, it cost you so much,” whatever it was.</span> <span id="s1060">He took a picture of it, but it didn’t do any good, because as I said earlier, the Dutch didn’t want to transfer the victim from one to another.</span> <span id="s1061">But they ended up buying it again.</span> <span id="s1062">And then I got it after my mother died.</span> <span id="s1063">There are other things that come up occasionally or would come up about something that was missing, or wondering where it was.</span> <span id="s1064">I had a fairly nice stamp collection that I had given to a friend for safekeeping.</span> <span id="s1065">And all the valuable stamps are gone.</span> <span id="s1066">You know, you can be harsh about it, saying they stole from you, on the other hand, they may have traded it for food and needed it.</span> <span id="s1067">They didn’t know whether you were going to come back or not.</span> <span id="s1068">The only one that was absolutely and scrupulously honest was the concierge of the business where my dad worked.</span> <span id="s1069">He had everything that my dad entrusted to him and gave every bit of it back.</span> <span id="s1070">Where many of your so-called friends denied they ever had anything.</span> <span id="s1071">And there’s one thing that’s unfortunate and I didn’t know about it until fairly recently.</span> <span id="s1072">Apparently my mother had written a long letter to one of her sisters, or maybe to all of them, same letter addressed to all of them, about the deprivation, et cetera, et cetera.</span> <span id="s1073">She said her ambition was to die in her own bed between clean sheets.</span> <span id="s1074">And that letter wasn’t discovered until one of my cousins, one of the sister’s daughters, who lived on Long Island, but was moving to Florida and was going through the stuff to throw things away and came across that letter and gave it to… I think there may be one or two pages missing.</span> <span id="s1075">But it was not until a year or so, two years after my mother had died.</span> <span id="s1076">And that explained a lot of things to us.</span> <span id="s1077">But fortunately we were able to do that unknowingly.</span> <span id="s1078">She died at home in her own bed.</span> <span id="s1079">It was difficult to do it that way, but…</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: From where had she written the letter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: From Holland after the war, she had wrote that to her sisters, describing what had happened to some extent during the war and the deprivations and how that was her ambition.</span> <span id="s1082">She wrote in there, “I wasn’t going to give those bastards the pleasure of throwing me into a mass grave.</span> <span id="s1083">I want to die in my own bed between clean sheets.”</span> <span id="s1084">Probably one of the reasons for our survival was my mother’s strong will.</span> <span id="s1085">I think that had a lot to do with it.</span> <span id="s1086">Probably didn’t realize it at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: More so than your father’s?</span> <span id="s1088">Or your father was more of a…</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: Much more easier-going person, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Q: Was your family very close after you came to the States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: Oh yeah, yeah, definitely.</span> <span id="s1092">Not only… you talking my parents and my brother and I, or overall the relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: Both.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">A: Oh yeah, yes definitely, and still am.</span> <span id="s1095">I mean there aren’t that many of us left.</span> <span id="s1096">But I talk to some of my cousins on a fairly regular basis.</span> <span id="s1097">We don’t see each other all that often because we’re now scattered.</span> <span id="s1098">A few years ago in Spring we decided to make a round-trip to Florida and visit Alice’s brother and then take a few days on the beach and then went to visit some of my cousins.</span> <span id="s1099">When everybody lived in New York, when all they lived in New York I would see them whenever I got to New York once a year, but now they’re scattering too.</span> <span id="s1100">Retiring and dying, too.</span> <span id="s1101">Not all of us are alive anymore in our generation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: When you met your wife, did she have any idea of what your history had been during the war?</span> <span id="s1103">Did you talk about that during your courtship at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: I don’t think so, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1105">You’d have to ask her, but I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: And did that become a, later, as you recall, a topic…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">A: That never became an issue, no, not really.</span> <span id="s1108">No, it would have to have only become a topic of conversation… well it did.</span> <span id="s1109">I had back problems, it’s now, what?</span> <span id="s1110">30-some years ago.</span> <span id="s1111">And when I asked the surgeon what, was there any indication what the cause was.</span> <span id="s1112">And he said, without knowing what my background was, he says, “Yeah, severe malnutrition during your growing years.”</span> <span id="s1113">But other than that, normally it was not a topic of…</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: Does she ask you at all about it now or in recent years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: Does she know now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: Oh yeah, she knows.</span> <span id="s1118">I’m sure my mother told her probably a number of things, and occasionally… well, she’s seen the videos also.</span> <span id="s1119">All the kids have seen them.</span> <span id="s1120">I’m pretty sure, I may even have made copies for them.</span> <span id="s1121">They’re aware of it, but it’s just a piece of history, not “the”.</span> <span id="s1122">A lot of difference there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Q: So, what happened after you got married?</span> <span id="s1124">Did you move?</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A: Yeah, we… a bit hectic few days.</span> <span id="s1126">I had my Ph.D. orals on Thursday and a final in a class on Monday.</span> <span id="s1127">We got married on Tuesday and we left during that, after the wedding and went around the coast of Houston, where I had to report for work a little less than two weeks later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: For Shell?</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: What were you doing for Shell?</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: I was a research chemist.</span> <span id="s1132">I stayed there for five years.</span> <span id="s1133">I didn’t like what I was doing and started looking for another job and got a job with GE in Cincinnati and was there for almost ten years and then got transferred down here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: Where were your parents and your brother during those years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: My parents, my dad actually died in ‘67 of a second heart attack.</span> <span id="s1136">And my mother lived in New York, New York City.</span> <span id="s1137">My brother, after he got out of the Service in early ‘53, got a job with a Dutch Ore company that had holdings all over the world.</span> <span id="s1138">And matter of fact that’s why he changed his name.</span> <span id="s1139">His last name is Rosley, R O S L E Y.</span> <span id="s1140">He anglicized it so he wouldn’t be mistaken for a German after the war, when there was still a lot of anti-German feeling all through the world.</span> <span id="s1141">He was essentially overseas in one place or another until 1963, I believe, is when he came back after having been in Brazil for a number of years.</span> <span id="s1142">And he lived in New York then until he retired, oh, some ten years or so ago and moved to Vermont.</span> <span id="s1143">Where he still officially lives in Vermont.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: What was your real interest as far as your profession?</span> <span id="s1145">Did you have any kind of guiding thing that you really loved to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: Problem-solving using chemistry as a tool to solve a lot of technical problems.</span> <span id="s1147">That was probably my forte.</span> <span id="s1148">I was pretty good at it, at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: So you were seeking work that, in which you were really able to do more of the problem solving type than… what didn’t you like about the job that you had in Texas?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: Shell?</span> <span id="s1151">Well, it was a particular development scheme, you took one step forward and maybe two backwards.</span> <span id="s1152">It just got to be a bore.</span> <span id="s1153">And I asked for a different assignment and they said, “No, no, you’re doing too well.</span> <span id="s1154">You’re getting where we want you to go.”</span> <span id="s1155">And I didn’t want to go there.</span> <span id="s1156">And so I started to look for something else.</span> <span id="s1157">And the most interesting job that I was being considered for was with the Navy in San Francisco.</span> <span id="s1158">But the chief of that office was on a year’s sabbatical in Belgium and they weren’t going to make a decision until he came back.</span> <span id="s1159">And I wasn’t going to wait another year.</span> <span id="s1160">And the assignment that they talked to me about in Cincinnati was pretty interesting.</span> <span id="s1161">And I had a good time.</span> <span id="s1162">It was nerve-racking, because I didn’t realize it at the time, it was ACE, the Atomic Energy Commission was the primary contractor.</span> <span id="s1163">And so it was at the whims of the government.</span> <span id="s1164">And two years after I was up there we went overnight from three thousand to three hundred employees.</span> <span id="s1165">Fortunately I was one of the three hundred that they kept.</span> <span id="s1166">I finally decided this is getting too much, these ups and downs, and mostly downs.</span> <span id="s1167">And there was another one coming, so I decided to look around the company for other possible opportunities and they happened to have an opening down here, so I applied for it and got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: This is still for GE?</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: Yeah, in the appliance business here as an analytical chemist.</span> <span id="s1170">And then a year later or two years later, I was made manager of analytical chemistry, chemistry and processes.</span> <span id="s1171">But anyway, essentially a multitude of problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: Did you have any preconceived notions about living in Kentucky?</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: Well… (Laughing) funny, because we talked about it yesterday.</span> <span id="s1174">While we were still living in Ohio, the Riverfront Stadium was the big issue.</span> <span id="s1175">It was being built, where to build it.</span> <span id="s1176">They started construction.</span> <span id="s1177">And they said when they got done with that they were going to build the biggest zoo in the world.</span> <span id="s1178">They were going to put a fence around Kentucky.</span> <span id="s1179">So, that answers that question, right?</span> <span id="s1180">No, not really, didn’t know much about it.</span> <span id="s1181">I was commuting for about six weeks, no, longer than that, two months.</span> <span id="s1182">And so got acquainted a little bit with the area while I was still living up there.</span> <span id="s1183">And there wasn’t that much difference.</span> <span id="s1184">People are people everywhere.</span> <span id="s1185">And a pretty nice group of people here that I worked with and worked for.</span> <span id="s1186">Matter of fact, I’m still friends with, fairly good friends with one of my former bosses.</span> <span id="s1187">And I’m particularly happy about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: For your community of friends, you said… when did you move to Louisville?</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: ‘68, a little over 32 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: And your community of friends and so forth here are most, acquaintances here are mostly through work or…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: Work, neighbors, people I worked with or for, or that worked for me, neighbors, people who live in the area or met at the swimming pool, or wife was in a bridge club.</span> <span id="s1192">And still have friends from Cincinnati days, too.</span> <span id="s1193">In fact, one of our good friends, who was a neighbor in Cincinnati, now lives in Fort Worth.</span> <span id="s1194">Known him for 35 years maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: And no involvement with a synagogue here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: No, not particularly.</span> <span id="s1197">Now I’m on every Jewish organization’s mailing list.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: Why is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: There was an article in the Courier Journal, maybe a year ago, whenever it was, about the Temple and how the Temple needed expansion and they were going to have a quiet campaign for construction funds, for building funds.</span> <span id="s1200">So, I sent them a check with a note attached that “Since you’re having a quiet campaign I’m sending you a check on the QT.”</span> <span id="s1201">And got a very nice letter back, as a matter of fact, a friend of mine who is quite involved with the Temple, the lady showed him the letter not knowing that we knew each other.</span> <span id="s1202">But that got me on the mailing list for every Jewish organization locally, of course mostly asking for money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: And you mentioned a little bit earlier about how you don’t really have contact with other Holocaust survivors in the area.</span> <span id="s1204">And you’re not sure you want to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: Not on that basis.</span> <span id="s1206">I mean, I’m not saying that I say, “You’re a Holocaust survivor, move aside, I don’t want a part of it.”</span> <span id="s1207">What I’m saying is, if I happen to meet somebody who also is, I have no problem with that.</span> <span id="s1208">That’s just… End of Tape 2, Side B Tape 3, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Q: Okay, this is tape number three, side A of an interview with Alexander Rosenberg.</span> <span id="s1210">You were just saying about the Holocaust survivors in Louisville.</span> <span id="s1211">Did you want to add anything else to what you had said?</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">A: No not really, as I say, I’m debating on whether to go to this meeting just out of curiosity.</span> <span id="s1213">See, I don’t think I know anybody… well, I’m pretty sure I don’t.</span> <span id="s1214">I’m sure they have to be all older folks.</span> <span id="s1215">(Laughing.)</span> <span id="s1216">So I may.</span> <span id="s1217">I haven’t decided yet.</span> <span id="s1218">But no, no special interest as a criterion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: How about other, just looking back over your years here after the war in the United States.</span> <span id="s1220">Were you really mainly just focusing on your work and your family or did you have other interests or passions outside of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A: Oh yeah, I have a number of hobbies.</span> <span id="s1222">For one thing, I like to cook and obviously like to eat.</span> <span id="s1223">(Laughing.)</span> <span id="s1224">And gardening, although my garden right now doesn’t show that.</span> <span id="s1225">And I always like to travel, but of course, with a family and work that isn’t always possible.</span> <span id="s1226">So we made up for it since I retired.</span> <span id="s1227">And I enjoy history, learning about it, learned more about it since I retired, I guess.</span> <span id="s1228">Now I have time to watch television and the History channel and A&amp;E and of course, KET to some extent.</span> <span id="s1229">So that… a lot more exposure and therefore an ability to learn a lot more.</span> <span id="s1230">And then too, when we travel, we do it with the intent, not always the same.</span> <span id="s1231">I don’t go for these Caribbean cruises, you know, “Show me, feed me, entertain me.”</span> <span id="s1232">I like cruises because they are a lazy man’s way of traveling—you only pack and unpack once—but there has to be a reason for it.</span> <span id="s1233">And sometimes they are real eye-openers.</span> <span id="s1234">A couple of years we went on an Eastern Mediterranean and Black Sea cruise and we were in Constanta, Romania, which is the major port of Romania on the Black Sea.</span> <span id="s1235">Ovid was exiled there for seven years or whatever.</span> <span id="s1236">Well, never even thought that the Romans as well as the Greeks, both came up the west coast of the Black Sea, east coast of the Balkan Peninsula.</span> <span id="s1237">And that they had gone that far North into what is now Odessa and to the Crimea.</span> <span id="s1238">I’m sure it’s of no importance right now, but in terms of historical event, just didn’t think about that or heard about it.</span> <span id="s1239">A lot of things like that.</span> <span id="s1240">But as we talked earlier about the famine, and what complicity the British had.</span> <span id="s1241">The other day there was a fascinating program on the Vikings.</span> <span id="s1242">They were the kings of Kiev in Russia.</span> <span id="s1243">They went east.</span> <span id="s1244">Nobody… I never heard that before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: What about Holocaust-era history?</span> <span id="s1246">Have you done much reading about that or taken an interest in finding out what happened on a broader scale?</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A: Oh yes, yes, definitely.</span> <span id="s1248">As you know there are a lot of programs, bits and pieces.</span> <span id="s1249">There is a lot… new things, but also things that are being, I think, being hidden from view that never show again.</span> <span id="s1250">The… well of course, in addition to Spielberg’s movie, I’m not sure what the show was the other day, but there are a number of programs that deal with the Holocaust or deal with certain aspects of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1251">Or for that matter, not necessarily in that context, but primarily in the context of Nazis or Hitlerism and their henchmen and how they got involved and what they did.</span> <span id="s1252">And the Holocaust in the broadest sense, in terms of the enslaving of particularly the Slavs, the eastern Europeans and the murder, genocide of them, not necessarily just the Jews.</span> <span id="s1253">But then one thing, and I have a video of it, it was on PBS maybe twenty-five years ago, about Fort Ticonderoga, and I have never seen it again.</span> <span id="s1254">I mentioned to you earlier the anti-Semitism of the State Department.</span> <span id="s1255">In 1943, when the Holocaust became pretty well-known in government circles, but was being hidden from the American population, a number of Henry Morgenthau’s employees went to him and said, “You go to FDR and tell him he does something or else we’re going to go public that the U.S. government knows about this and isn’t doing anything.”</span> <span id="s1256">And as a consequence of that, they brought some six, 800, what was then called DPs, displaced persons, to this country.</span> <span id="s1257">They had to sign a statement, which of course anybody in his right mind would have, that after the war they would go back to their country of origin.</span> <span id="s1258">And they put them into Fort Ticonderoga.</span> <span id="s1259">And after the war was over with, they tried to ship them back.</span> <span id="s1260">Well, you know, you signed this thing.</span> <span id="s1261">But a number of couples had had children here.</span> <span id="s1262">They were born at Fort Ticonderoga and therefore they were native-born citizens, and therefore their parents were entitled to stay here as the parents of minor American citizens.</span> <span id="s1263">The State Department declared Fort Ticonderoga was not American soil and therefore they were not American citizens.</span> <span id="s1264">Can you imagine a place that is so historically important in the American Revolution being declared not being a part of America?</span> <span id="s1265">I mean that’s the kind of convoluting, convolutions, unfortunately, our government went through.</span> <span id="s1266">As I said, that was a PBS show, 25 years ago, I have never seen it again.</span> <span id="s1267">I guess too many toes were being stepped on.</span> <span id="s1268">But… and of course, I went to the Holocaust museum, but I couldn’t take it, make it past the Saint Louis, because I remember that one vividly.</span> <span id="s1269">Another black mark in our history.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: So, it was too painful to be going through and reminded?</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: Yeah, I mean the thing is, painful and the thing is that the Saint Louis had roughly nine hundred passengers and I don’t think two dozen survived.</span> <span id="s1272">It’s incredible that the things that the U.S. government could have done, should have done and never did do.</span> <span id="s1273">It’s that kind of malfeasance that really upset me, particularly in that context.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: Related to that, I’m interested in something you said in your last interview, which was a piece of advice that you were giving to other Holocaust survivors.</span> <span id="s1275">That many have met with very good fortune in their post-war lives and that they ought to do what they can to give something back to the community.</span> <span id="s1276">And so on the one hand you have that compulsion or that desire and on the other hand, you have this knowledge of the shortcomings of this government and the ways that they have, have really not served the… and in particular in the couple of instances you just brought up, Holocaust survivors.</span> <span id="s1277">How do you reconcile those two?</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: Well, those are, in my opinion, two totally separate issues.</span> <span id="s1279">Maybe they are related, and that is by giving back to the community, by helping people that are in need of help.</span> <span id="s1280">Maybe because the government should and isn’t, that you’re overcoming the shortcomings of our government.</span> <span id="s1281">Even though I don’t take that into consideration.</span> <span id="s1282">There are two ways that one can give back, one is financially and that’s the easy way out that most of us take, is to make contributions to a variety of charitable organizations, or non-profit organizations.</span> <span id="s1283">But then the more important one is to give of your time and help people.</span> <span id="s1284">I’m sure the same thing holds true for Lexington, in Louisville there is a shortage, an incredible shortage of volunteers.</span> <span id="s1285">And all of us retirees who have spare time, and we should have spare time, should donate some of that time to some of these organizations.</span> <span id="s1286">Whether it’s Dare to Care to sort out cans of food, or work at the Wayside Christian Mission as an example, any of these shelters, and dish out food for people in need.</span> <span id="s1287">Or I work in the tax program, in fact I have somebody come in who needs help with their taxes.</span> <span id="s1288">One of the great organizations in general of a variety of needs is Catholic Charities.</span> <span id="s1289">And they’re desperate for volunteers.</span> <span id="s1290">Obviously: they asked me to help.</span> <span id="s1291">(Laughing.)</span> <span id="s1292">And I have.</span> <span id="s1293">But the thing is, that is one way that you can give back.</span> <span id="s1294">And whether it’s in your own expertise or if it’s just plain labor.</span> <span id="s1295">Some people are unwilling to become raw labor, drive for Meals on Wheels or drive for Dare to Care and pick up bread at Kroger or whatever.</span> <span id="s1296">But that’s the kind of jobs that need to be done.</span> <span id="s1297">And that’s the kind of things that makes many of these non-profit organizations click.</span> <span id="s1298">Newt Gingrich, who is so maligned, some four or five years ago, for his reasons felt that the public radio should no longer be funded by the U.S. government.</span> <span id="s1299">And I completely agree with him.</span> <span id="s1300">But that doesn’t mean that today they give them big hunk of money and tomorrow it’s zilch.</span> <span id="s1301">Cut it back.</span> <span id="s1302">I work for the public radio stations here as a volunteer.</span> <span id="s1303">And they used that withdrawal of government funds to encourage the public to contribute and they did tremendous, the biggest drive they ever had.</span> <span id="s1304">And rightly so.</span> <span id="s1305">I’m a firm believer in putting the public back into public radio and public television, but it requires a commitment on the part of the people to make financial donations.</span> <span id="s1306">And that’s just one, that’s not nearly as, I suppose, important as helping somebody who’s hungry or reading for the blind, but it’s one of the large variety of volunteer jobs that needs to be done.</span> <span id="s1307">It’s amazing, I don’t do that much.</span> <span id="s1308">I’m not trying to pat myself on the back.</span> <span id="s1309">But one of the people that used to work for me professionally now actually works for me in a volunteer, one of his volunteer activities, got the GE volunteer award of the year, he and his wife, jointly, this past year.</span> <span id="s1310">Between the two of them they put in three thousand hours a year, that’s a hell of a lot of hours.</span> <span id="s1311">That’s almost a fulltime job.</span> <span id="s1312">If we could get half the people to do half that or for that matter, ten percent of the people to do ten percent of that, it would be a lot of help.</span> <span id="s1313">And that’s what I mean by that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: Have you traveled much within Kentucky?</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: Not that much.</span> <span id="s1316">I mean we’ve been all over.</span> <span id="s1317">Been both west and east, and south.</span> <span id="s1318">Essentially covered the whole state more or less, but not extensively.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">Q: Does the culture or the history of the state interest you particularly or are you more kind of limited…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">A: Oh yes, well, no I think or it appears at least that more recently that the antagonism toward Louisville, Louisville versus the rest of Kentucky, seems to be diminishing.</span> <span id="s1321">But that is, you know the large city versus the rest of the state.</span> <span id="s1322">Look at New York and New York City, Georgia and Atlanta and you know, you can go on.</span> <span id="s1323">I think it’s probably true of most states that the large cities are thought to be representative and they’re not.</span> <span id="s1324">Even though they contain most of the population.</span> <span id="s1325">And I can understand that.</span> <span id="s1326">And the interests of Kentucky in particularly are so diverse, from Appalachia with its problems, and Western Kentucky with some of the same problems and some totally different problems.</span> <span id="s1327">And Louisville, of course, for painfully obvious reasons having totally different problems that people in Appalachia couldn’t care less about.</span> <span id="s1328">But that’s true everywhere.</span> <span id="s1329">And it’s amazing, the thing that I thought that the United States was unique, unfortunately, in its race relations problems.</span> <span id="s1330">They’re not.</span> <span id="s1331">It’s the same everywhere.</span> <span id="s1332">It doesn’t matter what country you go to, it may not be like we have, black and white.</span> <span id="s1333">But we were in New Zealand and there was a big ruckus and the Royal Commission on Race Relations or whatever it was, got involved, refused to get involved in it.</span> <span id="s1334">Well, the mere fact that they have a Royal Commission on Race Relations says there’s a problem there.</span> <span id="s1335">And it’s the Maoris, which are no longer in existence.</span> <span id="s1336">The purest Maori is one-eighth Maori and seven-eighths white.</span> <span id="s1337">And in Australia it’s the indigenous people versus the settlers.</span> <span id="s1338">And then of course among the settlers you get the same ethnic divisions that you get everywhere else.</span> <span id="s1339">Look right now, Fiji, the Solomon Islands, the whole world is erupting in ethnic and race problems.</span> <span id="s1340">Africa is just a terrible situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: Were you… was that something that you were particularly aware of in your early years in the U.S., segregation, the Civil Rights Movement, any of those?</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s1343">I read about it and I heard about it and was only peripherally affected by it.</span> <span id="s1344">But in the early fifties, while I was in Durham, the mayor of Durham was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1345">Why I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1346">There’s a fairly good sized, there was a—there may still be—a good-sized Jewish community in Durham because of the tobacco industry.</span> <span id="s1347">Apparently they brought the Jews down in order to make cigars, like they did in Tampa with the Cubans.</span> <span id="s1348">And then, I still remember the man’s name, Bishop Waters was the Catholic Bishop for North Carolina.</span> <span id="s1349">The little town of Washington, North Carolina was two parishes, a black and a white.</span> <span id="s1350">Neither one of them could support a priest, and he ordered them integrated.</span> <span id="s1351">Boy was there ever a stink, but it worked.</span> <span id="s1352">Wasn’t… no more than two months and they essentially had ninety percent attendance of the two parishes in one church building.</span> <span id="s1353">It was unheard of.</span> <span id="s1354">Of course the press would claim race relations are only bad in the South.</span> <span id="s1355">Well, they’re probably a lot better in the South than they were elsewhere.</span> <span id="s1356">But yeah, I certainly was keenly aware of it, and cautious.</span> <span id="s1357">Before I bought a house in Houston, this was in the late fifties, I consulted with a local friend to say “Hey, so that I don’t stub my toe, is there anyplace that I cannot go?</span> <span id="s1358">Where I would be refused because I am Jewish?”</span> <span id="s1359">And he said, “Yes.</span> <span id="s1360">Don’t go to Oak Forest,” or Forest Oaks, whatever it was called, which I couldn’t anyway, that was the rich neighborhood.</span> <span id="s1361">But you learned to do those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: Is there something else that I haven’t asked you about that you’d like to talk about today?</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">A: No, I can’t really think of much.</span> <span id="s1364">I don’t know whether this gets perpetuated or not, but I certainly would urge, not just Holocaust survivors, but all retirees to think about give something back to the community.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q: This is something that’s very important to you, it seems.</span> <span id="s1366">I mean, you brought it up last time, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">A: Yeah, I think so.</span> <span id="s1368">There’s such a terrible need.</span> <span id="s1369">And what makes me particularly, actually angry… I have two or three acquaintances who are retired, who went back to work on a part-time basis, because they don’t know what to do with themselves.</span> <span id="s1370">They’re bored.</span> <span id="s1371">This is utterly ridiculous.</span> <span id="s1372">And I keep trying to get them enrolled in some activity and they just won’t do it.</span> <span id="s1373">But there’s just too many people that need help, who cannot help themselves.</span> <span id="s1374">And throwing money at the problem is not necessarily the solution.</span> <span id="s1375">It isn’t that it can’t be done without money, but it’s the personal help that’s required.</span> <span id="s1376">And here in Louisville, we are blessed with a number of things.</span> <span id="s1377">We have here three groups that make recordings for the blind.</span> <span id="s1378">The Recordings for the Blind, the Audio Studio, and there’s a third one.</span> <span id="s1379">There isn’t another city in this country that does that.</span> <span id="s1380">We have three public radio stations.</span> <span id="s1381">There is not, even New York only has one.</span> <span id="s1382">There are a lot of things that are good things, matter of fact I don’t brag about Louisville, keep down the population influx.</span> <span id="s1383">(Laughing.)</span> <span id="s1384">Selfish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">Q: So, you’re pretty much of a Louisville patriot, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">A: We have it very good here in Kentucky, and particularly in Louisville, and of course, Lexington in many ways, much more dynamic than Louisville is, for one thing they’ve got the city-county government, which we won’t get.</span> <span id="s1387">It’s up for voting on election day, you can bet money on it, it won’t happen.</span> <span id="s1388">The race relations right now are just so terrible.</span> <span id="s1389">All you have to do is look at other communities and other cities and that’s not just… take this house here as an example, which you can buy similar house here for depending on the condition and age, but let’s say 150 to 250.</span> <span id="s1390">Go to Silicon Valley you couldn’t touch it for two and a half million dollars.</span> <span id="s1391">In other areas, yeah you may be able to get for less, but most areas you can’t touch it for twice the amount of money.</span> <span id="s1392">Matter of fact, most retirees moving out of California, sell their houses and live happily ever after, because they can buy another house somewhere else in Arizona or in Florida for a fraction of what it’s worth in California.</span> <span id="s1393">Our food prices are reasonable, with the exception of gasoline in Jefferson County.</span> <span id="s1394">I went to Shelbyville last night and paid 40 cents a gallon less than what it is in Louisville.</span> <span id="s1395">I mean that’s ridiculous.</span> <span id="s1396">Could have gone as far as Simpsonville, that’s only ten miles, 25 cents a gallon.</span> <span id="s1397">But outside of these temporary distortions, Louisville has grown up a lot in the last 15, 20 years.</span> <span id="s1398">I used to get all my bread from Chicago, now there’s a grocery store over on Taylorsville Road that carries it and I can go get it there.</span> <span id="s1399">We used to go to Cincinnati to get a three month supply of cold cuts, now I can buy almost all of it here.</span> <span id="s1400">And so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s1401">We’re blessed here with, within two miles or three, excellent bakeries and different bakeries.</span> <span id="s1402">If you want a certain thing you get it here.</span> <span id="s1403">How many communities can you say that?</span> <span id="s1404">In 20 minutes I’m at the airport.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">Q: You feel welcome here, comfortable here as a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">A: Oh yes, absolutely.</span> <span id="s1407">That is not an issue at all in this community.</span> <span id="s1408">I’m sure there’s always, well like the Ku Klux Klan exists here, but you can ignore that.</span> <span id="s1409">No, I have never had anybody make a disparaging remark to me or denied me something because I’m Jewish.</span> <span id="s1410">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1411">Until the present mayor, the Mayor of Louisville was Jewish, Jerry Abramson, one of the most popular mayors that the city of Louisville has had.</span> <span id="s1412">I think he was in there for thirteen years, the longest that anybody ever has.</span> <span id="s1413">And he was quite, I mean it was not anything that was hidden.</span> <span id="s1414">He was quite open about it.</span> <span id="s1415">No, I don’t think there’s a problem at all here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">Q: Anything else you’d like to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">A: No, nothing in particular.</span> <span id="s1418">Keep the good works up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">Q: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">Conclusion of interview USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0012 PAGE 3</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">PAGE</span></p>
