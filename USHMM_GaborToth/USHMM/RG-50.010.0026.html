DODD INTERVIEWER: HERBERT JENKINS CAMP: DACHAU DATE: JANUARY 18, 1979</span></p> <p><span id="s2">Q: This is January 18, 1979.</span> <span id="s3">I am Herbert Jenkins and I am here to interview Mr. Roy Dodd regarding the Holocaust program and Mr. Dodd's experience in World War II.</span> <span id="s4">We appreciate your seeing us this morning, Mr. Dodd.</span> <span id="s5">Will you give us your name and address and any statement you feel like making.</span> <span id="s6">What kind of surprise or what was your reaction when you were in the act of helping liberate these camps?</span> <span id="s7">So I won’t interfere with your statement, just make a statement in your own words as you see fit.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: I went into the army when I was 18 years old.</span> <span id="s9">We were in Hawaii during Pearl Harbor.</span> <span id="s10">We came back in 1943 and formed the Rainbow Division.</span> <span id="s11">We trained out in Oklahoma.</span> <span id="s12">We went to Europe in 1944.</span> <span id="s13">We were in the Battle of the Bulge and it was quite an experience for me.</span> <span id="s14">We crossed the Danube River and my outfit was one of the first to liberate or get into Dachau.</span> <span id="s15">Of course, I wasn't there on the first day.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">As far as my memory serves me, I think it was either the second or third day.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: What was your outfit?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: My outfit was the 222nd Infantry Division, the 42nd Division.</span> <span id="s19">And it was an experience, if you want to call it an experience.</span> <span id="s20">I can't really say that was an experience.</span> <span id="s21">It was just something that I wish hadn't ever seen and I hope that I never see it again.</span> <span id="s22">Unless you see something like that, it is unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: There was a group that went in ahead of you?</span> <span id="s24">Was it part of the same outfit?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s26">It was either the lst Battalion or the 3rd Battalion.</span> <span id="s27">I was in the 2nd Battalion.</span> <span id="s28">It was a long time ago, but if my memory serves me correctly, it was the 3rd Battalion that was the one who was the first there.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: Did you have any advance notice?</span> <span id="s30">Did you know what you were about to run into?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: We didn't know what we were going into.</span> <span id="s32">Of course, I knew what I was going into because a fellow from either the 1st Battalion or the 3rd Battalion had seen it.</span> <span id="s33">I'm quite sure, though, that they didn't know what they were going into or what they were going to see.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: You had no preparation to be prepared for what you would see.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: No, and I tell you, I've got memories of it.</span> <span id="s36">It didn't affect me, but I'm quite sure that for the persons that were in there it was a horrible sight.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: What did you actually find?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: I never did get into Dachau, but I saw the railroad cars with the bodies in the cars, the boxcars.</span> <span id="s39">They never had removed some of the bodies.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Did you see any of the guards at this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: I can't really say that I did.</span> <span id="s42">I've heard some of the men say that the prisoners were eating bread that was splattered with blood.</span> <span id="s43">Now again, I can't verify that because I wasn't there at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: But the guards had already gone and the American soldiers were in</span></p> <p><span id="s45">charge.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: When I got there, the American soldiers had gotten all the guards and all the dogs.</span> <span id="s47">They had two rows of fences.</span> <span id="s48">The people were in one side and the dogs were in another fence.</span> <span id="s49">It must have be 10 or 12 feet high with barbed wire on top.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Did you see any of the prisoners there?</span> <span id="s51">You saw all these corpses in these boxcars, but how about the people in the prisons that were liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: I never actually got into the prison.</span> <span id="s53">To describe it, I would say it looked like a university from the front.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: A nice appearance?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Oh, it was beautiful.</span> <span id="s56">Well, if you want to use that word.</span> <span id="s57">I wouldn't use it now.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: That was the outside appearance.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: In other words, it was a false appearance, if you want to use those words.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: When you got inside or got nearer, what did you actually see?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: As I said, I never did get inside.</span> <span id="s62">We just saw the what we call [unintelligible] boxcars.</span> <span id="s63">They had never removed all the bodies on the outside</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Did you see any of the prisoners that were coming out?</span> <span id="s65">Prisoners that were being liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: No.</span> <span id="s67">They were processing them I assume.</span> <span id="s68">I could see through the wire that they were either processing them or giving them food.</span> <span id="s69">What they were doing I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: What was your reaction to this?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s72">At that time, I can't recall.</span> <span id="s73">But everybody in my outfit was very angry about it.</span> <span id="s74">If we could have gotten to them, I believe we would have done them the same way they done the prisoners.</span> <span id="s75">I mean, that's just my opinion.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: Is there anything that comes to your mind that you can tell us that will help us understand this situation better such as what caused it and what we are going to have to do to keep it from happening again.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: I wish that I knew.</span> <span id="s78">I wish I could solve that problem myself, but I can't.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: But it was a shocking experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: From what I saw and, like I said, I didn't see one half of what the first men that got in there saw.</span> <span id="s81">I just hope that I never have to see it again.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: How long did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s84">Of course, we were on the move at that time.</span> <span id="s85">We had the war won, but we were just on a mopping up situation.</span> <span id="s86">I guess we stayed around there for a couple of days, if that much.</span> <span id="s87">We were strictly on the move the whole time we were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: And where did you go from there?</span> <span id="s89">Did you have the opportunity to see any other prison camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: No, that was the only one that I saw that I recall.</span> <span id="s91">I might be wrong, but it seems to me that we left there and went to Furth and to Nuremburg and then from Nuremburg we went into Austria.</span> <span id="s92">Of course, that's where I got to come back home from.</span> <span id="s93">Einsbach, Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Thank you very much, Mr. Dodd.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">[Interruption in tape.</span> <span id="s96">Conversation resumes as follows.]</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: You say there's some additional information you might be able to provide us?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: There might be.</span> <span id="s99">We have a Rainbow Division that meets about twice each year here in Atlanta and then we have a national organization.</span> <span id="s100">You could probably write them or get in touch with them.</span> <span id="s101">They've got a book printed but mine got away from me some way.</span> <span id="s102">It has much more information in it than I could possibly give you, Of course, if I had the book here and could go through the pages and remember things, but, as it is, I can't think of the gentleman's name.</span> <span id="s103">He works at Rich's.</span> <span id="s104">He’s the president of our local chapter here.</span> <span id="s105">This organization has been going on since World War I.</span> <span id="s106">There was a Rainbow Division in World War I.</span> <span id="s107">We have a memorial out there at Camp Grouber in Oklahoma.</span> <span id="s108">It the Rainbow Division's memorial, in Muskogee, Oklahoma.</span> <span id="s109">Next time I get one of our papers, I'll send it to you and you can get in touch with the Rainbow Division headquarters.</span> <span id="s110">I think it is somewhere in Virginia, or it might be in Chicago now.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: But the president of your local here works at Rich’s.</span> <span id="s112">Do you know what department he works in?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: No, I was trying to think.</span> <span id="s114">I know that there's a Jack Callaway that lives on Old Ivy Rd. He's World War I veteran.</span> <span id="s115">I don’t know what his address is but it’s Old Ivy Rd. You might be able to get in touch with him and he can put you in touch with the national headquarters.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: You get periodic publications?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: About once a month or one ever two months.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: And when you get the next one, you’ll send us a copy of it.</span> <span id="s119">A: If you leave your address, I certainly will.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Thank you very much.</span></p></body></html>
