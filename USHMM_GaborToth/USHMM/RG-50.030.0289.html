id="s10">RAPHAEL ARONSONPRIVATE</span></p> <p><span id="s11">September 23, 1994</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: I'd like you to start off by telling me your name at the time of war years, and where you were born, and the date of your birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: I am Raphael Aronson, also known as a nickname, Folia.</span> <span id="s14">I was born on June 21, 1919 in Kuanas, also known as Kovno, Lithuania.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: I'd like to start by just learning a little bit about Kovno before the war.</span> <span id="s16">What kind of life was it?</span> <span id="s17">Tell me a little bit about your family, what you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: We were three brothers.</span> <span id="s19">My father was an engineer, mostly involved in importing advanced engineering systems from Germany to Lithuania.</span> <span id="s20">Systems, he introduced to Lithuania, central heating systems.</span> <span id="s21">Also, he introduced processing of meat in sausages and things for food industry.</span> <span id="s22">He was a quite successful businessman until Germany changed their political situation, I should say Hitler started to become active.</span> <span id="s23">Then the Germany companies didn't want to deal anymore with him, or he didn't want to deal with them.</span> <span id="s24">Then he switched around in importing different building materials for construction industry, such as material known as __________, which now is manufactured in United States by __________.</span> <span id="s25">He passed away.</span> <span id="s26">He was a heavy smoker, and developed lung cancer and passed away in 1938.</span> <span id="s27">My mother graduated from the University in St. Petersburg.</span> <span id="s28">She was a pharmacist, but she never practiced as a pharmacist.</span> <span id="s29">She was involved in bringing up the children.</span> <span id="s30">My older brother is -- after the war he was back in Lithuania, but right now, for the last five years, he is in Israel.</span> <span id="s31">He attended the University.</span> <span id="s32">He was also a construction engineer.</span> <span id="s33">He had a hobby as a glider, and he was a member of a gliding club in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s34">Mostly Lithuanians belonged there.</span> <span id="s35">There were one or two Jews, and he was fairly accepted in this gliding society.</span> <span id="s36">He published a magazine about gliding as a hobby.</span> <span id="s37">He learned somehow English, and he had ability to translate these magazines published in the United States or in England into Lithuanian language.</span> <span id="s38">And this was mostly part of his magazine which published in the Lithuania language.</span> <span id="s39">My younger brother, David, he was born in 1921, and after my father passed away he emigrated to the United States.</span> <span id="s40">As a matter of fact, at that time I was going also, me and my mother were going also, to the United States, but I couldn't get a permit, because I was an officer in the Lithuanian Army.</span> <span id="s41">I just graduated from Officers' School, and the Lithuanian Government had certain rules that I had to stay three years in the country until I could leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Let me ask you, why was -- did everybody go into the Lithuanian Army?</span> <span id="s43">Did all the Jewish boys go in?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: The Lithuanian Army everybody at age of 17 or 18, I don't recall, had to go into the Army, but I didn't go into the Army.</span> <span id="s45">I went to Military School, just like West Point.</span> <span id="s46">There was a certain way to do it, but after graduation you go immediately into the Reserve.</span> <span id="s47">I chose to do this.</span> <span id="s48">There were very few Jewish people who did it, but after I graduated from high school, I just felt that I'm not ready for the University.</span> <span id="s49">I didn't know what to do with myself, and I applied, and I was accepted.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Were the Jewish people in the Army treated the same way as everyone else?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: Probably not.</span> <span id="s52">There were three of us Jews that were not part of the complete society.</span> <span id="s53">And Lithuanians are not intellectually advanced.</span> <span id="s54">They are mostly farmers, not very educated, and they looked at a Jew as a foreigner who doesn't belong in this society, in spite of the fact that there were quite few prominent Jews in the Army, very limited, who were colonels or one was a general, but they mostly were connected with medical services through the Army, but not the organization or things of this nature.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Now, you lived in Kovno or Slobotka (ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: No, we lived in Kovno.</span> <span id="s57">Actually, Kovno, at that time Kovno was a capital of Lithuania and Slobotka was suburbs, not suburbs, part of Kovno, but close to the river.</span> <span id="s58">We had to cross a bridge.</span> <span id="s59">Slobotka was known as what's called left side of the track.</span> <span id="s60">Usually people who are not very well to do used to live there.</span> <span id="s61">It's the poor section of Kovno.</span> <span id="s62">This applied -- there was a very high percentage of Jewish population, but also non-Jews lived there.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: In Kovno itself, did you mix with non-Jews?</span> <span id="s64">Was your family religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: My family was -- I wouldn't call orthodox religious.</span> <span id="s66">They were traditionally religious.</span> <span id="s67">They celebrated all holidays.</span> <span id="s68">We belonged to the Temple.</span> <span id="s69">We didn't go every Saturday or Friday to a Temple.</span> <span id="s70">My father was more religious, because my father graduated from a Jewish Hader (ph), which is a Jewish religious school.</span> <span id="s71">But my mother didn't know how to read or write in Jewish, or in Hebrew, because, like I say, she graduated from St. Petersburg, Russia.</span> <span id="s72">She spoke Russian.</span> <span id="s73">As a matter of fact, our language at home was Russian, not Jewish.</span> <span id="s74">Jewish population in Kovno did not mix with Lithuanians or very rarely.</span> <span id="s75">I don't know how it happened that I was the exception to the rule.</span> <span id="s76">The majority of youngsters went to Hebrew or to Jewish schools.</span> <span id="s77">I went to Lithuanian high school, which all subjects were taught in Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s78">We had, I believe, once a month, a Jewish religion class, which was make believe situation just to comply with certain rules and regulations.</span> <span id="s79">After graduation, as I stated, I went to this military school, which was mostly non-Jews.</span> <span id="s80">There were three or four Jews, and then I attended the Lithuanian University.</span> <span id="s81">So, I had quite a sizable exposure to Lithuanians and all nationality Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Did you get along well with them?</span> <span id="s83">Did you experience any anti-semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s85">There were -- I mean, non-Lithuanians were anti-semitic.</span> <span id="s86">They were hiding it, but as a rule things were changing in the '30s, the early '30s, 1930s.</span> <span id="s87">They were changing different laws and regulation to such to take away all wealth and ability to do business from Jewish population.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: In the early 30s?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: The early 30s.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: In Lithuania?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s92">Actually, Lithuania, just going back, became independent in 1918 after the first World War.</span> <span id="s93">At that time, Lithuania, in origin, people who could create Lithuania didn't exist, so they asked Jewish people to help them.</span> <span id="s94">So a Jewish warrior by the name of Hrobison (ph) I believe Hrobison, I'm not sure, wrote the first constitution for Lithuania.</span> <span id="s95">In the same year Hrobinson, later on when Israel became independent, he also helped to create the first Israel constitution.</span> <span id="s96">There were many prominent Jewish people in the Lithuanian government at the time, except the President was not a Jew.</span> <span id="s97">Slowly, once we got the feel of an independent country, they started to eliminated the Jews.</span> <span id="s98">Lithuanians were never involved in any trade.</span> <span id="s99">All trade was controlled by Jews.</span> <span id="s100">Slowly, they were issued different rules or directives to eliminate Jews or to create Lithuanian companies which, for certain religious reasons which Jews didn't have.</span> <span id="s101">But in spite of this, Jewish population, or part of the Jewish population, was fairly comfortable at businesses.</span> <span id="s102">They were professional people.</span> <span id="s103">And then there were a percentage of Jewish people who are not comfortable, just like any other European country or eastern country or western.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Were you aware of what was going in Germany with Hitler and the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s106">We knew all of what was happening, but people were very naive at that time, and they said it's fine, it's in Germany, it's not in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s107">But everybody was very much concerned and tried to do something, but nobody knew what to do because for one, iten one; they were comfortable.</span> <span id="s108">They had houses, buildings.</span> <span id="s109">They were established and somehow they didn't feel like separating from everything that they had created in their lifetime.</span> <span id="s110">Some people, many left Lithuania, not many -- I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s111">Maybe one or two percent of Jewish people left.</span> <span id="s112">Just for example, my brother left, and we were going to leave, but we couldn't as I stated before.</span> <span id="s113">Just an example, when German came to Poland and started the atrocities of killing Jews, many Polish Jews came to Lithuania, run away.</span> <span id="s114">At that time there was Japanese consulate in Lithuania, in Kovno, who I don't know the reason why, was giving out Visas for Jews to go to Japan through Shanghai, I believe.</span> <span id="s115">And there were huge lines in front of the Consulate to obtain a visa to go to Japan.</span> <span id="s116">And this was mostly Polish Jews.</span> <span id="s117">Very few Lithuanian Jews were there, because Polish Jews had already the experience of being under Nazi occupation for a relatively short period of time.</span> <span id="s118">Lithuanian Jews, probably they didn't think this was the right thing to do or were not ready to do it.</span> <span id="s119">I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s120">But I just recently was in Europe and read an article about it, this week, and it was described in detail what happened to this Japanese Consul, I forget, __________ I believe his name is, and the people who obtained visas mostly were Polish Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Were you involved in any political organizations while you were in Kovno before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: I belonged to a student fraternity which was right wing, the fraternity was EL AL, which was right wing.</span> <span id="s123">We followed the leader who was Trobotinsky (ph), and it was just a student fraternity.</span> <span id="s124">We had political involvement, social involvement, just like any other fraternity, and probably I was a right winger not a left winger.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Why did you join this, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Because I had to join -- I mean it was very customary for students, university students, Jewish, to join fraternities.</span> <span id="s127">There were three fraternities.</span> <span id="s128">This one was left wing, which had belief in being left.</span> <span id="s129">One was something in between and many of my friends were in this El Al fraternity, and that's where I went.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: But you were concerned about the principles that Trobotinsky (ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: Yes, I believed in it to a certain -- I didn't believe in what's called Jewish Socialists, or left wingers.</span> <span id="s132">I didn't believe in that.</span> <span id="s133">I believed more in the right wing, with Trobinski (ph) or what was called Batar (ph), and I believe it was a goal to achieve a better life for Jews was better following Trobinski or Batar, as compared to left wing.</span> <span id="s134">Or there were quite a few Jews in Lithuania who are Communist.</span> <span id="s135">Communist was illegal.</span> <span id="s136">There was a particular movement of communist in Lithuania, and a high percentage of members were Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: The reason I'm asking is that it sounds like your family had a fairly comfortable life style, and you were not highly religious and yet you were following -- you were concerned about the future of Jews in Lithuania?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Yes, that's right.</span> <span id="s139">I don't believe it can be limited to future of Jews of Lithuania.</span> <span id="s140">We were always talking about Jews as a nation, not only Lithuania.</span> <span id="s141">We never referred that Jews of Lithuania should be better off or concerned about Jews of Lithuania.</span> <span id="s142">We always talked about Jews as a nation.</span> <span id="s143">And speaking about their comfort, yes, we were comfortable until '34 or '35.</span> <span id="s144">At that time, my father already -- Hitler was already in Germany-- he already, in Germany, he couldn't do business with Germany.</span> <span id="s145">At the same time, he already had certain problems with his health because of smoking, which he never stopped smoking.</span> <span id="s146">Then things started to go down, and when war started and the Communists came in, which was in 1940, then we were just existing.</span> <span id="s147">We were not poor, but we were not well to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: I do want to ask you about how things changed with the Communists, but I think first I just want to get more of a sense of Konov before the War.</span> <span id="s149">Culturally, what the life was like there, was there a lot of opportunity?</span> <span id="s150">Was there a good life for a Jewish boy like yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Actually, there existed a certain opportunity for an educated Jew, like myself, at that time I was probably 20, 22, 23.</span> <span id="s152">I was born in '18, we're talking about '37, '38 and I was 23 years old or so.</span> <span id="s153">Young people of my generation had many possibilities, because first there were families in certain businesses which always, the children used to take over the business from the father.</span> <span id="s154">Second, many professional people were Jews.</span> <span id="s155">Doctors were Jews.</span> <span id="s156">Many lawyers were Jews.</span> <span id="s157">Many nurses were Jews.</span> <span id="s158">There were Jewish factories, big factories producing rubber products like rubber boots and rubber coats into rubber in general.</span> <span id="s159">There were salt factories which produced bakeries.</span> <span id="s160">Industry was fairly much controlled -- not controlled, but it was very represented by Jewish people.</span> <span id="s161">So, there existed opportunity as far as for a Jewish doctor, it was much more difficult to obtain a license to be a doctor as compared to Lithuanian Jew.</span> <span id="s162">You have to know somebody, you have to bribe, like in Israel or any European country actually.</span> <span id="s163">Bribing or knowing somebody was very important way of life.</span> <span id="s164">Even going into the Army certain people, Jewish again, did not want to go to the Army because they could afford, they could pay off to somebody to say they were not physically capable to be enlisted.</span> <span id="s165">There was, I believe he was a colonel, who was in charge of army medical services, top man, and he was a Lithuanian, but he married a Jewish -- his wife was Jewish.</span> <span id="s166">I didn't know it, but now I found out that he was accepting bribes to issue certificates that a Jewish fellow has certain problems, physical problems, medical problems, and he must excuse him in joining the Army.</span> <span id="s167">So, as far as opportunity, yes, but many Jews of my generation, if they could afford, left Lithuania temporarily to attend universities or get education or get experience overseas.</span> <span id="s168">They went to France.</span> <span id="s169">They went to England.</span> <span id="s170">They went to Belgium and right now they are back -- many are back in the United States.</span> <span id="s171">They came somehow.</span> <span id="s172">But, some of them were, during the war, were in England because they left just before the war.</span> <span id="s173">The went to universities in England during the war, and everybody had a dream to leave Lithuania and go someplace.</span> <span id="s174">Naturally, the United States was one of the favorable places to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Did you have an active social life?</span> <span id="s176">Were there a lot of cultural activities you took advantage of?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: The Jewish type?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: Any type, I want to know about Kovno.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: Yes, Kovno had a fairly prominent opera house.</span> <span id="s180">There was a prominent singer by the name of Petroskauf (ph), who was a good friend of a very famous singer, Sholapkin (ph), a short fellow who -- I don't remember.</span> <span id="s181">Sholapkin, this second series to visit this famous terror of Lithuania, and to participate in operas.</span> <span id="s182">Opera was central for social activity.</span> <span id="s183">There were theaters.</span> <span id="s184">The Jewish theater was very good.</span> <span id="s185">The Lithuanian theaters I don't recall.</span> <span id="s186">There were movies.</span> <span id="s187">There was a big university.</span> <span id="s188">There was a School of Medicine and another University Engineering School and Economics School.</span> <span id="s189">Lithuanians had their own societies and their social organization.</span> <span id="s190">There were Lithuanian writers which were promoted by Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s191">In my opinion, they were not very good.</span> <span id="s192">Actually, going back to the history of Lithuania, in 1430, Lithuania had a very powerful king who occupied the whole of Europe from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea belonged to Lithuania.</span> <span id="s193">Then he married a woman who was of Polish origin, and she dropped him and married the King of Poland, I believe.</span> <span id="s194">And then the whole territory that was acquired by the Lithuania King had become part of Poland.</span> <span id="s195">From this point on, Poland was never an independent country.</span> <span id="s196">The next independence that came to Lithuania was in 1918.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: I'm trying to get a sense of how you spent your leisure time.</span> <span id="s198">Were there nice memories before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: As being a youngster or in general population of Lithuania?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: You?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: As a youngster I participated in different sport activities.</span> <span id="s202">I was a referee of a basketball team.</span> <span id="s203">At one time, there was basketball match in Lithuania that all of Europe participated and Lithuania took first place, because they imported all Lithuania basketball players from the United States.</span> <span id="s204">There was only one player who was Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s205">We watched -- we spent a lot of time in this sport complex.</span> <span id="s206">There was tennis and skiing in winter.</span> <span id="s207">Summer we used to go away in the country, rent a bungalow as a family, my mothers and my brothers.</span> <span id="s208">My uncle, who his wife was my mother's sister, had a huge farm not far from town, probably 10 miles, 15 miles away, and we used to go there and spend a lot of time at the farm and do activities.</span> <span id="s209">That's the extent of it.</span> <span id="s210">I was a person that was always busy.</span> <span id="s211">I was never bored.</span> <span id="s212">Until I went to military school, I was involved in going to school, which requires homework and things of this nature.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Did you ever go into Slobotka?</span> <span id="s214">Was there any reason to?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: After -- when I joined Alile(ph), and when I was a student at the University, somehow I used to go because there were certain people who used to live on the shore of Slobotka, just as you cross a bridge, rabbis mostly.</span> <span id="s216">And a certain rabbi's daughter was part of our young society, and I remember she had a wedding, she was married at her father's home, who had a big home in Slobotka.</span> <span id="s217">Maybe I was a few times, but it simply wasn't what I chose to do.</span> <span id="s218">I don't recall.</span> <span id="s219">I was pretty sure I was there many times -- not many times - three, four, five, ten times.</span> <span id="s220">I just don't recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: The reason I was asking was, I know that that was a real center of Jewish life, but it's obviously something that you were not that involved with?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: No, like the Jews Talmud studying in town, which I was not involved in such activity.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: I want to ask you one more question, and then we need to change tapes.</span> <span id="s224">Because you were involved, or you went to school with a lot of Lithuanians, you were in the military with a lot of Lithuanians, did you personally experience anti-semitism before the war broke out?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: I wish I could say yes, I did, but I cannot recall.</span> <span id="s226">I had a few Lithuanian friends, which we were friends in high school, especially in the higher grades of high school.</span> <span id="s227">At the University, I spoke only to a few Lithuanians who asked me certain questions because I was good in mathematics, better than average, and they asked me how to solve this problem or this problem, which I told them and this was the extent of our contact.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: So your friends were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: No, about half, half.</span> <span id="s230">I knew people, but friends is something else.</span> <span id="s231">I had two or three Lithuanian friends and maybe four or five close Jewish friends, probably.</span> <span id="s232">I was in between.</span> <span id="s233">There was an uprising in '35 or '36, I don't recall, where there was a right wing - End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: You were starting to tell me about this uprising in the mid 1930s?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s237">In late 1930s there was Lithuanians in the fraternity, which were very right wingers, and they started to introduce different difficulties as related to Jewish students.</span> <span id="s238">They started to beat up on the street, Jewish youngsters, and the University introduced -- or they did not introduce -- but they forced Jewish people to sit on the top of the auditoriums, the last two or three rows of the auditoriums.</span> <span id="s239">And whoever did not comply with their request was written up.</span> <span id="s240">And some were badly beaten up and had to be taken out by ambulance to a hospital.</span> <span id="s241">Also, they introduced, or they enforced, certain requirements that Jews between them should not speak Jewish at the University grounds.</span> <span id="s242">Only the Lithuanian language should be used.</span> <span id="s243">At that time, it became a not a very favorable place for Jews.</span> <span id="s244">They were not equal with all students.</span> <span id="s245">As time progressed, the Lithuanian fraternity on this organization, which there were two, one was part __________, the second was a student organization, they became more and more powerful and attracted more and more members, and they were very instrumental later on when Hitler or Germans walked into Lithuania.</span> <span id="s246">Things changed probably in '34 '35.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: How did life change under Russian occupation, was that noticeable?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Yes, very much so, because it was a very slow process, a gradual process, and things changed.</span> <span id="s249">First to start with, they closed up all Jewish fraternities.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s251">Could you start over and say when that was when the Russians took over.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s253">When the Russians came to Lithuania after some agreement was made between Russian, USSR and Germany, the Red Army came to Lithuania, and nobody realized what was happening.</span> <span id="s254">First they were met with flowers and everybody was very happy that the Russians came.</span> <span id="s255">Gradually they changed the way of life.</span> <span id="s256">First they closed up all religious -- not religious -- fraternities which relates to Jewish activities or religious activities.</span> <span id="s257">They introduced, for example, Russian language and Russian Communist history in all schools and universities.</span> <span id="s258">They reorganized school systems.</span> <span id="s259">They deported the majority of successful business people from Lithuania to Siberia, and between them there were quite a high percentage of Jewish people who owned business and were prosperous and active in social life of Lithuania before they came in.</span> <span id="s260">Then they started to take over businesses and real estate, and major changes took place very similar to -- eventually became a way of life in Lithuania very similar to way of life in USSR.</span> <span id="s261">At that time, the young generation, which is my generation and my wife's generation, which is people between 16 and 22, something like this, probably felt a certain freedom came in, and they were living up the freedom.</span> <span id="s262">They started to party and enjoying themselves, and they didn't give a damn what's happening.</span> <span id="s263">Suddenly a lot of business activity disappeared for them.</span> <span id="s264">Their parents didn't talk about how to build up the business, how to create something more, how to open another store, or whatever the case may be.</span> <span id="s265">Memories of this era are regretfully, especially my wife's memory, who was younger than me.</span> <span id="s266">It was a year of freedom and partying, and she has good memories of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: I would just stop you a minute.</span> <span id="s268">You were telling me that actually when the Russians came in, there seemed to be less, maybe less structure, less formalities, but for your young people, it was liberating in a way?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: That probably is correct, because somehow in the very beginning, Jews felt that Russians came in, and they should not be concerned anymore regarding anti-semitism.</span> <span id="s270">They were completely wrong.</span> <span id="s271">Several became equal with everybody else, and they felt that their way of life at home became much easier because their parents or relatives were not involved and concerned anymore about their business because business was taken away from them from bigger businesses.</span> <span id="s272">Somehow, I think for the young generation, life became easier in the very beginning.</span> <span id="s273">Later on, things changed.</span> <span id="s274">Certain people advanced because of Russians being in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s275">Certain people went all the way down.</span> <span id="s276">It changed the balance of the society.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: Now, did it change the balance for you in a positive or negative way?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: For me, it changed -- it's difficult to answer.</span> <span id="s279">I missed the fraternity and fraternal life.</span> <span id="s280">And then everybody got involved and became a better student in the University because somehow it was a feeling that if you have enough education you'll succeed.</span> <span id="s281">In the very beginning, before the Russians came in, success was prosperity, how prosperous and successful your parents' business.</span> <span id="s282">Education was very important at that time also, but here you became independent.</span> <span id="s283">You couldn't depend any more on what your parents' had or will have.</span> <span id="s284">You had to create your own space in the society.</span> <span id="s285">In order to do it, you should have education.</span> <span id="s286">So, everybody got involved and became a better student, studied more to get better marks and graduate sooner.</span> <span id="s287">That's what I recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: Tell me about the German occupation.</span> <span id="s289">Do you remember the day the Germans came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s291">The Germans just --they didn't come in in Kovno, but they crossed the border on the day of my birthday, which was June 21st -- I was born on June 21st -- in 1941.</span> <span id="s292">Then we went out with my friends.</span> <span id="s293">We were going to a nightclub party, and they were coming in around 2:00 in the morning or maybe 3:00, because it was getting daylight and all you see from the skies is falling down like pieces of burnt paper or something of this nature.</span> <span id="s294">We didn't know what it is.</span> <span id="s295">We thought somebody threw something out from the airplane.</span> <span id="s296">We didn't know.</span> <span id="s297">I went to sleep.</span> <span id="s298">The next morning, suddenly all streets were full of Red Army running and moving from Kovno, and all streets were just loaded with them.</span> <span id="s299">There were some that were barefoot running, some on tracks, all kinds of means of transportation, and they were just running away.</span> <span id="s300">Germans were already across the border between what's called Memau (ph), which was part of Lithuania, which Germany took away before.</span> <span id="s301">And nobody knew what was happening because there was no communication.</span> <span id="s302">The radio didn't work, nothing worked.</span> <span id="s303">The telephone, I believe, worked.</span> <span id="s304">I believe we tried to get some information by telephone, but it was impossible.</span> <span id="s305">We couldn't get any information.</span> <span id="s306">I'm not sure if it was the same day or the next day, there was no Germans still not in Kovno, but the Lithuanian right wingers opened the jail and let out all prisoners from the jail.</span> <span id="s307">These were all types of whatever people were in jail, murderers, and whatever you want, and they got weapons, and they distributed the white ribbons to Lithuanians, and this was in celebration of the Army of Lithuania.</span> <span id="s308">And the first task of this liberation army was to kill Jews.</span> <span id="s309">And they went in Slobotka, and then from house to house trying to kill many, many Jews, I don't how many thousands, just kill them, chase them out from the houses, took away their possession and there was no law at all.</span> <span id="s310">Then they moved to Kuanas across a bridge and again was going from house to house, and they selected three hundred most prominent Jews in Kuanas, and put them in what's called -- this was called a huge garage where this bath system is stored, a maintenance garage.</span> <span id="s311">And they said you will be here.</span> <span id="s312">The German government will promote you to be in charge of the City, whatever it is.</span> <span id="s313">The next thing, they came with rifles and killed all of them.</span> <span id="s314">So, actually Lithuanian Jewish Society was the leaders of this community.</span> <span id="s315">Then they continued going from house to house.</span> <span id="s316">They came in our house, which we lived in front of a multi story building, not multi story, maybe five story buildings, and back, it was like a one story building which was our house where we used to live.</span> <span id="s317">They killed quite a few people in this building in front.</span> <span id="s318">Then they came to our building.</span> <span id="s319">They walked in, and I put on such an emblems that I am an Officer of the Lithuanian Army, and I said, "What are you doing here?</span> <span id="s320">I am an officer of the Lithuanian Army, you pay attention to me."</span> <span id="s321">They were standing with the rifles and taking us away to kills us, I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s322">Then the caretaker, or the person who took care of the apartment building came to our building, superintendent he's probably called, came in and said, "What are you doing here?</span> <span id="s323">These are nice people, these are nice Jews.</span> <span id="s324">Leave them alone."</span> <span id="s325">So they never touched anybody, and at that time they turned around and walked away.</span> <span id="s326">So this was the end of this.</span> <span id="s327">Then in the next few days, the German Army moved in, and they issued the white arm bands, not to lay down the weapons and follow only rules and regulation which German Government Occupation had issued, that is was illegal to go from house to house.</span> <span id="s328">Then the Germans gave a systematic way how to eliminate Jews.</span> <span id="s329">Actually, there was no more fear that somebody would knock at your door and kill you, but there was rules in the next month or so, all Jews should move out from the City and move into this specific area in Slobotka, which was the beginning of the Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: Before we get to that, the Lithuanians who were running around the City, going in homes, beating up on Jews, do you think they were under German supervision or they were just doing it on their own?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: My feeling is that they did it on their own, because this was this organization, this right wing organization, which was fraternity was a sport club, was very much right wing.</span> <span id="s332">Then they joined all these people who were let out from the jail.</span> <span id="s333">But people who were in the jail, the majority were right wingers because the Russians put them in the jail.</span> <span id="s334">And the Russians came into Lithuania everybody who didn't like the Russians are in Lithuania, mostly Lithuanians put them in jail.</span> <span id="s335">Jail was loaded with so-called right wingers, Lithuanians who, really it's just like if you let out an animal from a cage, they are overwhelmed.</span> <span id="s336">Here they let them out.</span> <span id="s337">They open the door from the jail, give them rifles, go, and they were just running and all others joined them.</span> <span id="s338">When a mass movement starts, there are many joiners.</span> <span id="s339">Anybody who wanted could pick up a white handkerchief around his arm and join them.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Were you watching any of this?</span> <span id="s341">I mean did you actually see any of the beatings or shootings or whatever?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: Yes, yes, because you couldn't miss it, you couldn't miss it.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: What did you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: I saw that they had come and beat up a Jew and let him laying on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s345">I didn't see a shooting frankly.</span> <span id="s346">At least I don't recall, but beating, I saw all the time during this several days.</span> <span id="s347">As a matter of fact, my brother, who worked for some company, engineering company, older brother, just felt that he should go back to his office after -- it was Monday, the 22nd of June, and he came to his office and his best friend with whom they worked together on a certain project says, "I'm glad you are here.</span> <span id="s348">You are under arrest."</span> <span id="s349">And they picked him up and put him in the basement of the office building where he worked.</span> <span id="s350">Somehow, he escaped from there, because he tied a white handkerchief around his arm, and he didn't look too Jewish, so he escaped.</span> <span id="s351">And he was hiding for maybe two weeks, because he was always afraid they would come and look for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: Didn't you wonder where he was?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: Sure, but that's all.</span> <span id="s354">I just wonder.</span> <span id="s355">I got a notice before the 21st from the Lithuanian Government that I should report to a certain place as active duty as a lieutenant and this date was the 22nd.</span> <span id="s356">The 22nd was Monday, the 21st was Sunday.</span> <span id="s357">I should report to a certain place to be reenlisted.</span> <span id="s358">I called this place, and there was no answer on Monday, and nobody knew what's happening.</span> <span id="s359">So, I decided to go to take myself to this place and see what -- because I was afraid if I don't report something will happen to me.</span> <span id="s360">And I came to the last door and knocked at the door and nobody answered, and I turned around and went back.</span> <span id="s361">But as I walked there and back, I was very careful.</span> <span id="s362">If I saw somebody with white arms, I was going in the corner of the buildings.</span> <span id="s363">I knew something could happen to me.</span> <span id="s364">As a matter of fact, my mother told me please don't go, don't go, but I just felt I should.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Your family was very frightened?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: Oh yes, yes, especially my mother because my father was already dead.</span> <span id="s367">He died in '38, '37.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Were you thinking about making any plans?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: At that time, it was already too late to make any plans.</span> <span id="s370">Some people managed to make plans even then to go to Sweden, or some went by boats to Sweden from Lithuania.</span> <span id="s371">Some went, somehow managed to go across the border and go to Russia and go to Siberia.</span> <span id="s372">There were a limited amount of people found ways and means how to escape, but very, very few, very few.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Now, I read that really the first few days before the Germans even came in, people were being rounded up and taken out to, I guess, the forts and shot.</span> <span id="s374">Thousands of people in the first few days were killed.</span> <span id="s375">Do you know anything about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Sure, sure they were.</span> <span id="s377">This was mostly people from Slobotka were killed.</span> <span id="s378">The numbers were something like 7,000 of Jews, and they were taken, not to the Ninth Fort.</span> <span id="s379">The Ninth Fort was established later on by Germans in collaborations with Lithuanians as a major killing spot for Jews.</span> <span id="s380">But there was another fort called Seven Fort, which was just an intersection of two rivers.</span> <span id="s381">They used to take Jews in the very beginning right there and kill them, in that Seven Fort.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Did you know about this at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Is this __________?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: No, I didn't know at that time, actually, probably I found out more about it being here in the United States than in Lithuania, because everybody knew that the Jews were killed.</span> <span id="s386">Where and how they were killed was not known at that time because we were moved from our City to the Ghetto, and yet everybody was disengaged from his everyday existence, a new existence, accommodations were very meager.</span> <span id="s387">They were preoccupied to create the best they can under existing circumstances, and they just knew that many Jews were killed, but they didn't talk about it, the where and how.</span> <span id="s388">Later on, it started slowly, and then after the end of the war when the facts were available became known.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: These killings were in __________, outside of Seven Fort, in __________?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: No, these were just Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s391">These right wingers, I call them right wingers, is a cross section of Lithuanians who wanted financial benefit by doing it, or they hated Jews, or they got a kick out of doing it because Lithuanians probably became later on -- Germans really liked Lithuanians because they were professional Jew killers, and they used to not only in Lithuania but also in Poland and Romania.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: Now, it was still a little over a month before you went to the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s393">What were you doing in that month?</span> <span id="s394">Did life kind of stop?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s396">Trying to get as much information as we could to find out what's happening, you know.</span> <span id="s397">What Germans -- how do we exist, how do we live under German occupation.</span> <span id="s398">What will be next step.</span> <span id="s399">And every day there seemed to be new announcements by German Government regulations related to Jews, and was posted all over the City, from today on all Jews should have to say Heil Hitler or wear a patch, and who doesn't have it will be killed.</span> <span id="s400">Next thing came out were regulations that all Jews should not walk on the sidewalk, should walk on the street.</span> <span id="s401">It's not allowed.</span> <span id="s402">Any businesses which still exit that belong to Jews should put a big sign in front that this business belongs to a Jew.</span> <span id="s403">And the Jews should not attend any universities.</span> <span id="s404">There were all kinds of rules and regulations.</span> <span id="s405">Everyday was something new, and this was anticipation like today you put on the radio to see news.</span> <span id="s406">Here, every morning, you run out to see what the new announcement hangs on the buildings or on -- and every day or every second it was always something new.</span> <span id="s407">Then it was a request to turn in all gold and valuables.</span> <span id="s408">It became illegal to possess gold.</span> <span id="s409">It was a very gradual process, an organized gradual process.</span> <span id="s410">This kept you busy.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: Was there a feeling of you know, violence, I mean were you afraid when you went outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: If you complied with directives which are posted, probably you could walk on the street nobody would touch you.</span> <span id="s413">If you didn't walk on the sidewalk, if you had a yellow star and as a rule, basically by memory, you could walk out -- nobody felt safe, let me put it this way.</span> <span id="s414">But, if you were within all of the directives that the Germans issued, you were mobile, you could go to a store and buy bread or do things of this nature.</span> <span id="s415">And everybody was living in anticipation of what's next, and next came moving to the Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: How did the Ghetto come about?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: I believe one morning they posted a notice that all Jews should move to the Ghetto in Slobotka, and they organized a Jewish relocation committee.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Who organized a committee?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: The Germans.</span> <span id="s422">I don't recall who was on the relocation committee.</span> <span id="s423">But then this relocation committee also established certain relocation consultants, I don't know how they call it, and I was part of them, because the only reason I say they assigned me was because I was a lieutenant in the Lithuanian Army and there were five or six Jewish youngsters, the same as me.</span> <span id="s424">Then they proceeded to tell me that here on this street in the new Ghetto that these families should be relocated in these houses.</span> <span id="s425">And I had this list, and I go up to these people and say you'll be moving to this street to this house at this number.</span> <span id="s426">And that's what I did.</span> <span id="s427">This took maybe two weeks or three weeks.</span> <span id="s428">I don't recall.</span> <span id="s429">Actually a relocation of where Jews from the City to Ghetto.</span> <span id="s430">I'm not sure how long, but it would be safe statement that the period was one month.</span> <span id="s431">I just -- I'm not sure if it was one month or three weeks.</span> <span id="s432">And during this period there was not too many means of transportation.</span> <span id="s433">There were no trucks, actually horses and buggies or wheel barrows or things of this nature.</span> <span id="s434">The majority of people left the bulk of their furniture or posessions in their apartment and moved to Ghetto.</span> <span id="s435">Ghetto consisted of two sections, the main Ghetto and Small Ghetto.</span> <span id="s436">Everybody was assigned apartments.</span> <span id="s437">This location which was assigned for Ghetto used to be occupied mostly by Lithuanians, not by Jews and probably Lithuanians, I'm not sure, paid for the housing and things because they moved out.</span> <span id="s438">They were very cheap, inexpensive private homes.</span> <span id="s439">The majority, which had two, three four rooms and one room was assigned to a family.</span> <span id="s440">In addition, there were two high rise apartment buildings which Lithuania built for government subsidy for poor people -- Lithuanian poor people.</span> <span id="s441">These, two huge, we used to call it blocks, apartment buildings were also occupied.</span> <span id="s442">In each apartment was three or four rooms which in each room would be one family.</span> <span id="s443">Eventually, everybody was moved to the Ghetto, and to once they were in Ghettos, they organized working brigades which is one way they go to work, manual work.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: I just wanted to ask you a little bit more about the Ghetto, and then we'll talk about the war.</span> <span id="s445">It sounds like the effort to get in was fairly organized.</span> <span id="s446">People didn't take furniture, but they were able to take a lot of their belongings, their books?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Yes, some people even took furniture who could afford it, because they still had money.</span> <span id="s448">Money could do many things, or hidden gold.</span> <span id="s449">They used to bribe or pay Lithuanians to provide better means of transportation and these could take their furniture.</span> <span id="s450">Not everybody, but a small percentage.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: So, there was an effort to get all books in and people preserve their --?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s453">They took as much as they could.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: Tell me about where you were living in the Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: We lived in a house which had two rooms, one very small room and one is like a bigger room.</span> <span id="s456">It was on one of the streets of the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s457">There was an outhouse, and I don't recall if there was running water or not.</span> <span id="s458">Frankly, I don't recall, probably not.</span> <span id="s459">And we brought our beds to sleep and pots and pans and clothes and books, albums, things that were of certain value to us as a family.</span> <span id="s460">That's about all I believe.</span> <span id="s461">My brother was married, my older brother, and he was with his wife and my mother and myself.</span> <span id="s462">Somehow we got two rooms because probably we knew somebody, because one room was my brother and his wife used to stay in a separate room from my mother and myself.</span> <span id="s463">That was it.</span> <span id="s464">It was not -- it was not in comparison to what we had in Kovnov before the war.</span> <span id="s465">But we slept well.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: You are an architect.</span> <span id="s467">What did the Ghetto look like?</span> <span id="s468">I know there were two parts and you were living in the larger part at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: What did it look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: It looked like if you see the movies today, western type movies, you see the small towns or villages, the streets are not paved, and both sides of the streets are houses, wooden houses, not very fancy, fairly run down.</span> <span id="s472">There were some stores, not fancy, without any store windows and no lights on the street.</span> <span id="s473">It's a fairly primitive location.</span> <span id="s474">There was nothing fancy about it, except the two apartment buildings which were built.</span> <span id="s475">They were built of brick, no finishes, and no elevators.</span> <span id="s476">It was probably eight stories high, seven stories high, and you had to go up the stairs, seven floors.</span> <span id="s477">There were no elevators.</span> <span id="s478">It had running water, I believe, these apartment buildings, but the majority of houses didn't have, all it had was outhouses.</span> <span id="s479">They didn't have running water, I'm pretty sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Were you allowed to leave the Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: No.</span> <span id="s482">Around Ghetto was a fence built of barbed wire, and there were guards walking around the Ghetto on the outside, and there was only one gate to go out.</span> <span id="s483">This gate was open to let out this working brigade in the morning to go to work and to come back.</span> <span id="s484">Everybody when they come back were searched to make sure he didn't bring anything into the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s485">And the guards around the Ghetto were mostly Lithuanians with rifles in case somebody wants to climb over the fence, if he could, they'll come down the fence and shot him.</span> <span id="s486">It was just like a camp, like a jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: You were sent out on these work brigades?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Personally, no in the beginning I was not.</span> <span id="s489">In the beginning, I was assigned like public works to make sure the roads are properly paved and passable and other facilities are in good working condition, probably because I had an engineering background, construction background.</span> <span id="s490">And then they assigned to me some twenty people or more, I don't recall, mostly elderly people, because they couldn't -- they were not useful to go out and work manual work.</span> <span id="s491">And probably they fix the road in the Ghetto not because they wanted Jews to have a better road, but because they wanted this road passable for Germans in case they come in trucks or cars in the Ghetto so they can pass and collect the Jews __________ whatever, as the case may be.</span> <span id="s492">That's what I did in the very beginning.</span> <span id="s493">Later on, based on my memory, probably roads were passable.</span> <span id="s494">Then I was assigned to a certain brigade to work, which was to load lumber into barges into ships someplace and to unload it.</span> <span id="s495">That's where I met my wife, because she was in the same brigade.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Where were you -- you were loading and unloading this lumber?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Yes, it's wood.</span> <span id="s498">In country they cut the wood and load on the barges and bring it to a place, a mill, where they cut it into lumber and boards and planks, whatever the case may be.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: How did you meet your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: I mean I was assigned, actually each brigade had a leader, and I became the leader of this brigade and this brigade had probably 30 women and 30 men working.</span> <span id="s501">And she was one of the 30 women.</span> <span id="s502">And we had a certain advantage because we used to go out in the country where they used to cut the woods, and there were farmers, and since they were farmers somehow we made a deal with the farmers giving them our clothes that we didn't use or gold or valuables, and they used to bring us and give us food, like big bag of potatoes or flour or baked bread or whatever the case may be.</span> <span id="s503">Then I probably met my present wife at that time.</span> <span id="s504">Since I was the leader of this group, I say we need two or three people who should distribute equally whatever it was from the farmers to each person, because you bring a bag of potatoes, each person got four or five potatoes or whatever to hide.</span> <span id="s505">I had assigned her to be in charge of distributing this food.</span> <span id="s506">She and another two or three.</span> <span id="s507">And, I then got closer and closer to her because I used to come and say how are you doing, and eventually I used to meet her in Ghetto and eventually decided to marry her.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: Well, it's a nice story in the midst of all of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: Yes, 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: Was the work vigorous?</span> <span id="s511">Was it real hard work?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s513">It was hard, but to be very honest, was not as hard as other brigades because -- the worst place to work used to be the airport.</span> <span id="s514">In Kovno, Germans built a new airport next to the existing airport, and there people used to come and dig and carry stones.</span> <span id="s515">And it was very, very hard work.</span> <span id="s516">Not a good working environment.</span> <span id="s517">Many people used to die working at the airport or killed because the guards were not very friendly.</span> <span id="s518">This was a huge brigade, some thousand, twelve hundred people to a unit, and I don't know how many people were in Ghetto, but we used to go out three or four brigades to work at the airport.</span> <span id="s519">This was the worst place to work.</span> <span id="s520">Our place was also hard work, but it was a better environment.</span> <span id="s521">Somehow the guards who watched us were also more human, because they used to go away from big city in the country, and some nights we used to sleep over in the country because we used to go to with the barge.</span> <span id="s522">There's a river where the woods is, and it used to take a day or longer, and they used to sleep there someplace in a barn, on a farm.</span> <span id="s523">And then at night we used to load up the barges and go back to the city where the mills are.</span> <span id="s524">It was -- we didn't have to work continuously, because once you are on the barge you don't work.</span> <span id="s525">So, it was a more relaxed situation as compared to other brigades.</span> <span id="s526">Probably others were in similar situations, but it's just a question of luck.</span> <span id="s527">But, the airport was the worst.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: Did you work at the airport?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: Only a few times.</span> <span id="s530">Maybe a week or two weeks.</span> <span id="s531">I don't remember how long, but I worked there after this public works was over.</span> <span id="s532">Then I worked at the airport for a certain period of time, and then in Ghetto was such a relationship between the Ghetto administration and people who worked.</span> <span id="s533">And administration which would come later on was this Dr. Elkous (ph), and then there was this other person who was, prior we knew from before the war, friends of our family.</span> <span id="s534">I went to complain to them, say I don't want to go to work at the airport, maybe you can do something to reassign me to work someplace else.</span> <span id="s535">And then they make me this leader of this group to pick up woods, lumber.</span> <span id="s536">There was a certain period when I worked at the airport.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Any other work brigades you were part of?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: In Ghetto, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: You brought up Doctor Elkous in the consul.</span> <span id="s540">Tell me a little bit about how the Ghetto was run, how it was operated?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: I mean the Germans organized Ghetto administration and the leader of this administration was Dr. Elkous.</span> <span id="s542">Now why Dr. Elkous, I don't know how they found him.</span> <span id="s543">I just don't know.</span> <span id="s544">Then this committee that worked under him, there were different people, there was one lawyer who was his right hand man.</span> <span id="s545">There was one person who was in charge -- it was called some Arbitza (ph) labor department, who was assigned people.</span> <span id="s546">Germans used to say that we need a brigade of twelve hundred people to do this type of work, so he selected, made a list who are these twelve hundred people.</span> <span id="s547">Or like in my case this 60 people, he made the list, who are the 60 people.</span> <span id="s548">And he was not a very honest person.</span> <span id="s549">Not a very liked person, because he used to take bribes from people who were in Ghetto.</span> <span id="s550">They would say assign me to a better place ____________ I organize for you, I have a pound of butter or whatever the case may be.</span> <span id="s551">I don't know.</span> <span id="s552">So, he was by many people disliked, but some liked him, though.</span> <span id="s553">Elkous was a very honest person and a good leader, and he believed that under his leadership he should negotiate with Germans to get the best possible condition for Jews in Ghetto, which he did.</span> <span id="s554">And to his team he was a lawyer and to other people --.</span> <span id="s555">Then the Jewish police, this was also the police chief, was precincts, I believe three precincts and chief of the precincts and kept the police organization, who were on the surface, they executed orders from Germans, But at the same time, there was a certain amount of underground work where they did not -- they helped the Jewish population and tried to make it easier.</span> <span id="s556">As a matter of fact, Jewish police leadership was killed one time.</span> <span id="s557">They felt that there was something going on, and so they took all the Jewish police chiefs and the chiefs of the precincts and kept whoever was in charge, about twenty-five people I believe, and took them to the Ninth Fort and shoot them, all of them.</span> <span id="s558">And they appointed a new leadership of the Ghetto police, which I believe was also disposed, the second one was disposed, I believe, based on my memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: How were the police and the consulate chosen?</span> <span id="s560">Were they chosen by the Jewish community or were they chosen by the German?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: Basically, appointed, probably by Jewish __________ Elkous group, probably or maybe with consultation with Germans -- I mean leadership.</span> <span id="s562">Regular policemen were just selected by the Administration, the Ghetto Administration.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: How was the Ghetto Administration selected?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: This I don't know.</span> <span id="s565">I don't recall.</span> <span id="s566">Like Dr. Elkous and all of his people, I don't know.</span> <span id="s567">I don't recall how.</span> <span id="s568">But they were probably appointed by Germans in conjunction with Lithuanians and groups that knew Jewish communities in Kovno and probably Germans talked to them and said who should be the leader.</span> <span id="s569">Who would be a responsible person and speaks good German because Elkous graduated from the School of Medicine in Germany.</span> <span id="s570">He spoke good German.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: What were some of the responsibilities of the Jewish Consul?</span> <span id="s572">What were their importance to the community?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: Actually, they were running the Ghetto, and their obligation was to comply with directive which they get from occupation from Germans and to execute it.</span> <span id="s574">Now, once they get it, we negotiate with them and try to change certain small details to make it easier for a Jewish population in Ghetto.</span> <span id="s575">Otherwise, they used to have public sports and Jewish services, religious services, they taught in schools, not schools at home for children, at hospitals there was a place where they used to -- there was a certain industry in Ghetto, to produce certain items or to fix up German uniforms.</span> <span id="s576">They organized this industry, and they were just like any other government except there was no power like in democracy, you have a Congress, representatives by people, but here nobody was elected by people, they had to follow just directives they get from Germans.</span> <span id="s577">But if this was within the scope of the directive the German list would provide, then they organized a standard way of life for a community, hospitals and welfare and food.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: So, in a certain way, it sounds like most of the activities that you would have had before the war, you still had in the Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: No.</span> <span id="s580">What activity?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: Well, you had some schools, and you had --.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: No, we didn't have schools.</span> <span id="s583">We had a hospital, which was a very primitive hospital.</span> <span id="s584">The schools were in somebody's else home, were little schools.</span> <span id="s585">There were ten kids or so, youngsters, just to come and some person who didn't go to work or after work they could teach them.</span> <span id="s586">It was not an organized school system.</span> <span id="s587">The hospital was an organized hospital.</span> <span id="s588">Food distribution was brought in by trucks from outside, bread I believe, there were others, potatoes and was equally distributed between population.</span> <span id="s589">There was a Jewish bakery, only one which was to take flour and bake bread in Ghetto.</span> <span id="s590">There was a butcher shop which used to bring meat and cut up meat in small portions and distribute to the population based on -- everybody used to have a cart to get.</span> <span id="s591">That was the extent of the activities.</span> <span id="s592">There was very little cultural activity as such.</span> <span id="s593">There was just work, go to work, get up in the morning, come back from work and try to figure out how to do the best from which you've got, to prepare a meal so that you will not be hungry for the next day.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: Was there any theater, music or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: Not yet.</span> <span id="s596">Sometimes the Jewish people, usually get together in a group to sing, and then there were Jewish musicians who were musicians before Ghetto time, they used to get together and give a concert.</span> <span id="s597">People used to listen on Sundays, I believe Sundays, and get together and give a concert and play.</span> <span id="s598">One thing which was very unique in Ghetto, I just remembered, during Sundays, Ghetto was on the shore of the river and there was like a little beach.</span> <span id="s599">It was off limits to go out and use it.</span> <span id="s600">At one time, this consul, the consul negotiated with the Germans, and they allowed to open the beach for the Jewish people on Sunday to go for two or three hours and everybody used to come and go for a swim.</span> <span id="s601">Because there was only one public bath in Ghetto and you really had to wait in line to go in there.</span> <span id="s602">So, we used to go in the river.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: So, did you go down to the river once or was it every week?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: For a short period of time it was every week.</span> <span id="s605">I don't know for how long, but this was for half a year or a year, but summer.</span> <span id="s606">But this was something new and something that younger people looked forward to doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: We were talking about activities in the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s608">Did people observe the Jewish holidays?</span> <span id="s609">Was the Temple open, the Shul (ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: Yes, they observed the Jewish holidays.</span> <span id="s611">The Ghetto, as they became more religious and conscious as they are Jews.</span> <span id="s612">There was one small Temple, but then there was a tent, a huge tent, across the consul where Dr. Elkous was, Village Square, and there was a huge tent which was all public services were available.</span> <span id="s613">The barber was there, and a notary, which somebody used to get married used to come there, and they would issue certain pieces of papers that you are married.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: Is that where you got married?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s616">And somebody died, I mean all of the statistical or public records were kept there.</span> <span id="s617">This would also be at Temple during Jewish holidays.</span> <span id="s618">People used to come there, but in addition was a small Temple.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: Did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: I don't recall.</span> <span id="s621">I don't recall.</span> <span id="s622">Maybe I went once or twice, but I was not there every holiday.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: Now, you mentioned that the Jewish police were helpful to the underground movement.</span> <span id="s624">Tell me a little bit about the underground movement?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: I frankly, I was not part of the underground.</span> <span id="s626">My brother was very active in the underground.</span> <span id="s627">He was to leave the Ghetto because he didn't look too Jewish and go to different Lithuanian organizations and used to copy maps where Germans are, German installations, and things of this nature, and bring it back to the Ghetto and give it to the underground.</span> <span id="s628">Underground was very secretive to such an extent that all people were divided into groups of five and nobody knew who else -- you knew these five people, but you didn't know anybody else.</span> <span id="s629">Also, if somebody used to talk about underground with other people, this was -- he could be killed by underground.</span> <span id="s630">There were many people killed by underground because they talked to other people what's happening in underground.</span> <span id="s631">Being in the Ghetto, I didn't have too much exposure, in spite of the fact that my brother was part of it.</span> <span id="s632">One time he was coming back from his trip to outside of the Ghetto, which he had to race to leave the Ghetto in some opening in the fence, and he was caught by a German and beaten up and placed in the jail.</span> <span id="s633">The Germans had a jail at the beginning of the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s634">But somehow he run away from it and came back.</span> <span id="s635">I knew that he was missing for a week or two weeks, but he wouldn't tell us what happened to him.</span> <span id="s636">Now, I know what happened to him.</span> <span id="s637">After the war, he told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: What happened to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: What happened to him?</span> <span id="s640">He was beaten up.</span> <span id="s641">He was in jail, and then he run away from the jail somehow.</span> <span id="s642">I have the details how it happened.</span> <span id="s643">I'll give you a copy of his write up, and he writes how he escaped, but I don't recall offhand.</span> <span id="s644">The police in the beginning supported the underground, and that's one reason why the old police, big shots, police chiefs and so on were killed by Germans.</span> <span id="s645">Then I believe a second time, something similar happened.</span> <span id="s646">At the end of the Ghetto, I believe the Chief of Police was also killed.</span> <span id="s647">They were supporting and this Consul of the Ghetto had knowledge of this activity, and they were supporting it, but this was never revealed to Germans.</span> <span id="s648">Now, we know what happened, but during the war the Germans didn't know the Consul was supporting it.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: When you say that the police and the Consul were supporting the underground, in what ways?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: I mean, the first objective of the underground was to get weapons.</span> <span id="s651">And police were instrumental in controlling the gate, the police.</span> <span id="s652">There were Germans controlling the gate on the one side, the second side, the Jewish police were controlling, and Germans were lazy and so they didn't search people.</span> <span id="s653">Jewish police searched people.</span> <span id="s654">And they used to let in arms.</span> <span id="s655">That's how the underground built up quite a bit of their different arms, their rifles and guns and so on.</span> <span id="s656">I didn't know that.</span> <span id="s657">I was in Kovno, five years ago, when my brother was still there, to convince him to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s658">So they took me in an area where the Ghetto used to be, which there is very little left, but there is one building, one house, and under this house was built underground a complete tunnel, and this was a shooting gallery to teach Jewish partisans how to use guns and how to shoot the target.</span> <span id="s659">And this underground was dug out by the underground, and it was used for this purpose.</span> <span id="s660">Nobody would hear their shooting.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: Who did the teaching?</span> <span id="s662">Who taught them?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: There were -- I mean between the Jewish populations there were people who were in the Army.</span> <span id="s664">As I told you, I was in the Army, I was a lieutenant __________, so I was not, but there were other people who were officers in the Lithuanian Army.</span> <span id="s665">There were some -- I mean there was some movement, at that time already, before Russians came in in 1940, there were some movement to teach Jewish people to be a military people, because they already were thinking then about Palestine.</span> <span id="s666">There was a school in Italy where Jewish families could send youngsters to this school to teach them how to be a Marine and how to fight at war, and they were preparing for it at that time, the beginning the Jewish Army, the liberation Army in Palestine.</span> <span id="s667">Then everything stopped there.</span> <span id="s668">The communists came and the Russians came.</span> <span id="s669">Then there were a group of Jewish people who had a very good knowledge about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: Do you have any idea how the Consul was helping the underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: I don't have the details.</span> <span id="s672">I don't want to guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: Do you think in general there was sort of a strong spirit of defiance or resistance in the Ghetto, or was there something special about this spiritual resistance maybe?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: No, I don't think there existed spiritual resistance or resistance.</span> <span id="s675">To Germans or Lithuanians there exists only one thing: self preservation.</span> <span id="s676">Every person in the Ghetto had a feeling that resistance is a useless type of thing to do.</span> <span id="s677">They felt that resistance would not solve the problem.</span> <span id="s678">Even this underground, the way I understand, made contacts with Lithuanian underground in woods because there was a certain number of Lithuanian underground who didn't like German occupation.</span> <span id="s679">And they didn't accept these people from Ghetto because they are Jews.</span> <span id="s680">They would say it's not what we're looking for.</span> <span id="s681">We're looking to make Lithuanian independent, you'll not help us.</span> <span id="s682">And very few groups accepted Jews.</span> <span id="s683">Then when this rumor started around the Ghettos that Lithuanian underground does not accept Jews, then Jewish people in Ghetto probably felt that this is not the solution.</span> <span id="s684">Solution is self preservation until the end of the war, and we were hoping for the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Were you aware or were you ever told about people trying to escape into the woods or any of the underground activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: Underground activities, no.</span> <span id="s687">Nobody talked about underground activities.</span> <span id="s688">Escape, people escaped, yes.</span> <span id="s689">They say what happened to this fellow?</span> <span id="s690">He escaped.</span> <span id="s691">Underground activity, no.</span> <span id="s692">People didn't talk.</span> <span id="s693">They knew that it exists, but they didn't know.</span> <span id="s694">The thing is it's a very secretive type movement, and they knew that certain people were killed because they talked about the underground.</span> <span id="s695">It was very secretive.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: Were there regular actions or arrests in the Ghetto that you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: Action as in organized killing?</span> <span id="s698">Yes, sure there were.</span> <span id="s699">There were three major ones.</span> <span id="s700">One is liquidation of the Small Ghetto.</span> <span id="s701">When we moved in Ghetto there were two.</span> <span id="s702">There was this Big Ghetto and across the street was Small Ghetto, which had a population of 7,000, if I'm correct.</span> <span id="s703">After Ghetto was established, the Small Ghetto was liquidated.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: Do you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s706">The majority of people who knew there was some pedestrian bridge_ going from Small Ghetto to Big Ghetto because in between was a street.</span> <span id="s707">Then who got the message, said the Germans are thinking to liquidate the Small Ghetto, escape from Small Ghetto to the Big Ghetto, but that left quite a sizable population.</span> <span id="s708">So one day they came in with trucks, mostly Lithuanians, and called the people who were left there, and took them to the Ninth Fort.</span> <span id="s709">It was the first time they used the Ninth Fort to kill Jews.</span> <span id="s710">And they were all killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: Did you know at the time where they were taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: The date?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: No, did you know at that time, where they were being taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s715">After a few weeks or so, we found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: How did you find out?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: First there was certain communication between Lithuanians and people in Ghetto, because people used to work outside of the Ghetto, and everybody knew somebody in Lithuania, or if they didn't know somebody, they would say would you like to buy a loaf of bread from me, and used to tell stories, what's happening.</span> <span id="s718">So, this is how you find out.</span> <span id="s719">Then, I don't know, from this act here, people escaped, but from other actions, people escaped, a few people escaped and come back together and tell what's happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: Was this liquidation the same time that the hospital was ruined, which was I think the beginning of October '41?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: The liquidation of the Small Ghetto was later?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: I'm trying to remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: The hospital was beginning of October.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: Of what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: '41 when the hospital--?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Oh, no, you are talking about the Jewish hospital outside of Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: I thought that was in the Small Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: No, there's no hospital in the Small Ghetto, or maybe there was.</span> <span id="s730">Maybe I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Where was this hospital that was burned down?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: I don't recall this.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s734">Then I won't ask you.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: But the question, what's the date?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: The liquidation of the Small Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: You know, I'm not sure of that.</span> <span id="s739">I thought it was the beginning of October of 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: Can I just look at the paper with the date.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: I have your folder.</span> <span id="s742">Do you want me to bring your folder?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: You were talking about the liquidation of the Small Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: People that were killed, there were three thousand people were killed at the Ninth Fort and some people escaped the small Ghetto and came to the regular Ghetto.</span> <span id="s746">And this was the first so-called action which the German and Lithuanian executed in Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: How did they do it?</span> <span id="s748">Did they burn, did they shoot?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: They just stated on the loudspeaker that everybody should stay at home.</span> <span id="s750">Nobody should walk out on the street.</span> <span id="s751">Then they came with busses and trucks and then from house to house with rifles and say out, out, out, to go in the bus and, then these people, the Germans had people with dogs go through the houses to make sure there were no human beings left.</span> <span id="s752">And he go from house to house and collect all people.</span> <span id="s753">Then this bus was to go to the Ninth Fort.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: Do you know if anybody was able to hide in there?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: In the Small Ghetto?</span> <span id="s756">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: Then a few weeks later there was a big action?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s759">This was done exactly or in a similar manner, with loudspeakers and notice was posted all over that on Tuesday morning everybody should stay in their home.</span> <span id="s760">Nobody should go out from the house.</span> <span id="s761">Then announcement came that everybody should go to a certain big field, like a farm land, and there was Lithuanians and Germans who lined everybody up, six in a row or five in a row, like an Army.</span> <span id="s762">At the same time, Lithuanians were came in, the trucks, the Ghetto with trucks, and they are going from house to house to make sure that everybody was out and whoever was left didn't walk out, they were to kill them.</span> <span id="s763">And then after everybody was lined up, I forgot to say, one German SS man who was in charge of the Ghetto, or who was one of the ones in charge of the Ghetto, went through the line, which there were five people in one row and divided two people here and three people.</span> <span id="s764">Actually he broke up whole families.</span> <span id="s765">And where was this two people row, he would force them to go on busses and trucks to the Ninth Fort.</span> <span id="s766">And whoever was left in the other group, could go back in the Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: Now, were you part of this action?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: Yes, I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: Who did they put in the truck?</span> <span id="s770">What kind of people did they put in the truck versus the people they said could go back home?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: It was unrelated.</span> <span id="s772">They lined up everybody five in a row.</span> <span id="s773">Then broke up these rows, two on the left hand side and three on the right hand side, and then they took this rows of threes, or rows of twos, I don't remember, and say these people will go in the truck, and these people can go back in Ghetto.</span> <span id="s774">It was unrelated to who you are.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: But they didn't say we want the strong people here and the women and children there?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: No, not during this action.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: Do you remember what you were thinking at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: At the time I think this is the end of me, because I was lined up in the row was me, my mother, my brother and my brother's wife and my brother's wife's brother makes five.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: Tell me about your family when this happened.</span> <span id="s780">Who were you with?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: I was with my mother, my brother, my brother's wife and my brother's wife's brother.</span> <span id="s782">There were five in a row.</span> <span id="s783">We were divided two on one side and three on the second side.</span> <span id="s784">The family was broken up.</span> <span id="s785">At that time, some miracle happened and thanks to my brother, who is now in Israel, he started to scream and push people in front of him and two Lithuanians came in and said what's going here, go here, go here, go here, go here and one Lithuanian general, who was in charge, started to scream, hell, what are you doing to these two Lithuanians -- hell what are you doing here, go where to here to this row of people, and they walked away.</span> <span id="s786">And then all of us moved into the good side very fast, and that's how it stayed.</span> <span id="s787">And there were five on the so called good side and others were taken away on the left.</span> <span id="s788">So, it's just a miracle.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: Do you remember other mass arrests or actions?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s791">There was the second action in, I believe, 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: Not until then?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: No, until then I think it was just minor events.</span> <span id="s794">Major, people were killed, but there was one event which I missed which was as soon as __________ was closed and everyone was living in the Ghetto, was issued certain directives that all Jews should turn in all gold and valuables, and whoever did not turn in would be killed.</span> <span id="s795">There was collection points and everybody brought in their silver, gold or valuables.</span> <span id="s796">And what many people decided to hide it, quite a few.</span> <span id="s797">At that time, quite a few were killed because they found they were hiding.</span> <span id="s798">But they couldn't find all because certain people were smart enough to do something about it.</span> <span id="s799">Especially at the time a popular thing was gold coins which Jewish people always collect after first World War, gold coins because they thought it was the safest thing to have.</span> <span id="s800">So there were quite a number of gold coins Jewish people had and it was very easy to hide.</span> <span id="s801">Thanks to the gold coins, food, you could obtain food during Ghetto time and get better accommodation for some good means to sustain yourself with gold coins.</span> <span id="s802">At that time, this was a very tragic time, because then Germans came they brought dogs in the Ghetto, and they were going from house to house to look to see if you turned in all gold, and if you don't hide.</span> <span id="s803">And they even took some people to undress them completely, some women to undress and the dogs were trained go and lick their sexual organs to make sure there is no coins of gold hidden.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: Excuse me, what was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: They had dogs trained, they used to take certain woman, tell them to undress completely, and the dog with its tongue would lick their sexual organ of the woman to find if they put any gold coins there.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: Do you know people that this happened to?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: Yes I do.</span> <span id="s808">This was in the beginning, and it shook up all the Ghetto population, but this was a very tragic event.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Now, throughout this time you were working, your wife was working, what was your mother doing?</span> <span id="s810">Was she working also?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: No, she was ill.</span> <span id="s812">She was sick.</span> <span id="s813">She could barely walk at the time, and she was bedridden.</span> <span id="s814">She could cook, get out of her bed and cook, but mostly she was bedridden.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: But they allowed that, or they didn't know about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: No, I don't know.</span> <span id="s817">At that time, the Ghetto, nobody checked to see if somebody was ill or not ill or children because as long as you provided quite a number of workers, this labor department provided would say we need for tomorrow twelve hundred, fifteen hundred workers for this brigade.</span> <span id="s818">As long as __________ could produce fifteen hundred workers, they didn't care.</span> <span id="s819">They didn't go searching houses, unless somebody told them there must be guns or something.</span> <span id="s820">They didn't care.</span> <span id="s821">There was this second action was in March, I believe, in 1943 and this action was to eliminate all sick, elderly people and children from Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: I think this may have been '44?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: If you could look in the file, it's written there.</span> <span id="s824">Yes, this was the action in '44 where they eliminated all children, sick people and elderly people.</span> <span id="s825">This took place during the day and nobody anticipated that this was the case.</span> <span id="s826">Everybody was out working in the brigades.</span> <span id="s827">And they were going from house to house and anybody left who didn't go to work or was sick or bedridden or old or a child they took in the busses and took to the Ninth Fort.</span> <span id="s828">They took my mother then during that.</span> <span id="s829">When I came back from work, I found she was gone.</span> <span id="s830">Now, for reasons which I don't recall, I went to work but my brother stayed home, and also my wife stayed home at the time, and they made my wife and my brother to carry out my mother to the bus.</span> <span id="s831">I have certain -- not a poem but a story written by my brother, which is a very nice story of how it happened.</span> <span id="s832">How they did this?</span> <span id="s833">She was taken to the bus and was killed at the Ninth Fort.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: When you came back from work, what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: I came home and the whole house was completely messed up, and my wife was there and my brother were there and they told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: Did this happen in all houses?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s838">It's a certain type of word to word communication which exists in our society, but then in Ghetto existed.</span> <span id="s839">It was fairly good organized and once it happened in the first house, then everybody knew it was happening.</span> <span id="s840">And everybody started to hide people, children to hide and elderly people to hide, and to the best of my recollection my wife and my brother tried to hide my mother someplace in the attic, but anyway they found her and she was taken to the bus and taken to Ninth Fort.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">End of Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Tape #5</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: Yes, several people were taken the Ninth Fort, to get out, and after they finished their work the majority of them were killed, and they're killed.</span> <span id="s844">They never came back to the Ghetto, except a certain group of people that escaped.</span> <span id="s845">I'm not certain how many, but I know two people who escaped.</span> <span id="s846">One is __________, who was a good friend.</span> <span id="s847">His wife is a good friend of my wife, and she is alive, but he passed away just recently.</span> <span id="s848">He had cancer.</span> <span id="s849">And he was telling me all the details and stories of how he escaped, etc.</span> <span id="s850">And then there is another person, I don't recall his name, who was in Canada and went to work in a nylon factory, for stockings, became very wealthy, and he escaped.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: What did he tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: Just that they told me exactly what happened.</span> <span id="s853">They were digging out, opening the graves and burning it and crushing the bones left over with certain tools, whatever they had, and it was terrible conditions to work.</span> <span id="s854">It was a terrible smell, and then at the end they knew it, they saw it.</span> <span id="s855">They were killing the workers who worked, who were doing this work.</span> <span id="s856">And somehow by miracles, they escaped.</span> <span id="s857">One person told me, I believe, that he was laying under, made believe that he was shot, and when night came he escaped.</span> <span id="s858">That one person I recall.</span> <span id="s859">This was probably in '43.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: One more question about the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s861">At a certain point, the Ghetto was turned into a concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: What's the difference?</span> <span id="s864">How did that change things?</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: Probably it was changed to concentration camp based on the German classification.</span> <span id="s866">I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s867">It was easier -- I cannot answer the question, because, as far as I recall, there was no change in the behavior of the guards or Germans or Lithuanians who guarded together.</span> <span id="s868">Everybody had to go to work.</span> <span id="s869">I just assumed it was easier to kill a Jew or to beat them up or do things like provide less food in Ghetto.</span> <span id="s870">I don't know.</span> <span id="s871">But I know at one time they changed it, the classification.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: It didn't change your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: I don't recall.</span> <span id="s874">I don't recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: Is there anything else that you experienced in the Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: I believe I covered everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: Any special or difficult memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: I can tell you an item of general interest about the Jewish society in Ghetto.</span> <span id="s879">When I got, when we decided to get married in '43, and we invited our immediate family for a wedding dinner, and at that time we decided to make a cholen (ph).</span> <span id="s880">Do you know what a cholen is?</span> <span id="s881">A cholen is a traditional Jewish meal which you put in potatoes and beans and meat in a pot and it stays for 24 hours, it cooks.</span> <span id="s882">In Orthodox of the Jewish family, you don't cook on Saturday, on Shabbos (ph).</span> <span id="s883">You get the meal at the end of Shabbos.</span> <span id="s884">You do it Friday early.</span> <span id="s885">This was available.</span> <span id="s886">Potatoes were available and beans were available and then somehow we organized a small turkey, which we put in this pot and took it to the bakery to stay in the over, where they bake bread for 24 hours.</span> <span id="s887">When they came back to take it home, and the people came for this festive dinner, the turkey was gone.</span> <span id="s888">Actually, there was stealing between Jews, from Jews to Jews.</span> <span id="s889">Everybody was hungry.</span> <span id="s890">Everybody wanted to get something special other than only potatoes and beans.</span> <span id="s891">The turkey was gone.</span> <span id="s892">I mean this was just a small event.</span> <span id="s893">It wasn't important.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: Were there deportations from the Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: As groups, working brigade to go someplace else to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: Were there people that didn't come back?</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: Didn't come back who was killed during work?</span> <span id="s898">Yes, there was, like I mentioned, at the airport, quite a few people were killed during work, or died from overwork or were killed because they wanted to escape or do something, buy a loaf of bread from a Lithuanian peasant.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: Did the Germans come in and take Jews to camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: From Ghetto?</span> <span id="s901">No, I don't recall it.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: Did you at this point have much information about the camps in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: You were in the Ghetto until the liquidation.</span> <span id="s905">What happened?</span> <span id="s906">What was the liquidation?</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: The liquidation came from directives that the Ghetto be liquidated and all people in Ghetto should report to a certain gate.</span> <span id="s908">There, by trucks, they would be taken to the train and taken to Germany.</span> <span id="s909">Those assigned by District, that first this District, then this section comes, this section, this day and this hour and this was a directive.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: This was in '44, March or April -- August '44.</span> <span id="s912">The majority of people, especially the younger people, knew what was happening, and they already had certain feeling that this would happen.</span> <span id="s913">They were building some hiding places.</span> <span id="s914">There was certain involved activity in Ghetto during last six months before, maybe eight months before, to organize and build a hiding place where you would hide in case -- we had enough knowledge that war was coming to the end, somehow in case they would decide to liquidate the Ghetto, everybody would have a place to hide.</span> <span id="s915">So, we had the place, one of the major hiding place was this two apartment buildings in Ghetto and under the apartment building was a basement and from the basement they dug out a long tunnel, and there they made like a shelter, like a nuclear shelter, to hide.</span> <span id="s916">We thought we would go there, but when we came there, it was just full.</span> <span id="s917">They wouldn't let us in.</span> <span id="s918">Because you know it had a capacity of people for room, on so many people can go in.</span> <span id="s919">So, we turned around, and we built our own shelter, because I had two days time approximately, which the houses in the Ghetto, there was a big field, like farm land.</span> <span id="s920">We dug a big hole about five feet deep or whatever it is, and removed from the house a few doors, put across and put on top some shrubbery, and there we put some water and a loaf of bread, and we went into this shelter, me and my wife.</span> <span id="s921">And we were sitting there and the Ghetto was already, the last transports had left the Ghetto, and then the Germans were walking around the Ghetto to find if there were any people left.</span> <span id="s922">And they came into the house where our rooms were, and we heard the one German tell, there's nobody here.</span> <span id="s923">And they were leaving already and we thought fine.</span> <span id="s924">So, only one German walked over our hiding place and stepped on the two doors where we had space for air to come in and stepped in with his foot, went in, and he started to scream.</span> <span id="s925">He got scared.</span> <span id="s926">He said there are Jews underground and everybody came running and surrounded us with rifles, and said out, out whoever is there and we went out.</span> <span id="s927">And then -- it was terrible in there, we had perspired and there was dirt coming down on us and -- then he put us against the wall.</span> <span id="s928">The German soldier put his rifle to shoot us, and one German officer came over and said, we are taking you to Germany, which is a nice place.</span> <span id="s929">People are usually clean.</span> <span id="s930">You are still young, and I don't think we should kill you, but we will take you to Germany where you will be useful.</span> <span id="s931">And go inside, rush around, change your clothes, which we did, and took us to the special last truck from Ghetto, took us to the train.</span> <span id="s932">After they took us from the train, they came back and blew up the Ghetto, dynamite and who ever was left, hidden in the Ghetto underground or any other place was killed, dynamiting the area, including all my relatives, my cousins.</span> <span id="s933">We were very close.</span> <span id="s934">We were hiding them, and they were killed during the dynamiting of the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s935">So, we came to this train which was cattle cars and each left and went to -- we knew where we were going because it was very crowded.</span> <span id="s936">I don't know how many people were in the car, but we could barely sit down.</span> <span id="s937">I'm not sure if there was food or not.</span> <span id="s938">It was very limited, maybe.</span> <span id="s939">Let we came to first stop which they ordered out all of the woman, left ___________, and this is where my wife left and went to __________ .</span> <span id="s940">And next stop in Germany was Dachau.</span> <span id="s941">They brought us to Dachau main camp and we were tired, and we were exhausted from this trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: How long was the trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s944">Long, five, six, seven days.</span> <span id="s945">Four days, I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: What was it like in the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: It was terrible.</span> <span id="s948">I mean there was no sanitary facilities in the car so everybody did wherever they could.</span> <span id="s949">There was limited food.</span> <span id="s950">People were getting crazy.</span> <span id="s951">Some people who I know, a woman, a young woman got just crazy, was screaming all of the time.</span> <span id="s952">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s953">It was not a pleasant place to be.</span> <span id="s954">It was probably the worst experience I had being in a train.</span> <span id="s955">Then we come to Dachau, and we didn't know what's happening there because they lined us up again like a brigade, four in a row, whatever, and then around us are people who used to be call Kopa (ph) which we didn't know who they are.</span> <span id="s956">It was a certain uniforms had, but this was Jewish people, mostly.</span> <span id="s957">Some were homosexual, Germans, the Nazis took homosexuals and put them in the camp.</span> <span id="s958">They were beating us up, line up, line up, stay here, stay here and then took us to some kind of a barrack, and we went to sleep probably.</span> <span id="s959">We stayed there maybe a week, and then they transferred us to satellite camp Slanseberg (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: You were beaten up by these Jewish Kopos?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: Yes, if you didn't stay in line.</span> <span id="s962">I mean some were Jews, not all, but they were really -- later I found out that they were all -- the majority were Hungarians.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: What did you do for this week in camp?</span> <span id="s964">What was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: I mean, in the morning you have to line up in a certain place, and they take a count of you and assign you a number.</span> <span id="s966">And then they refer to you only by number.</span> <span id="s967">You have no more name.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: You were telling me about you week in Dachau, what your days were like?</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: Probably, based on my memory, they fed us.</span> <span id="s970">They gave better food than in Landsberg, because probably after the transport in the train, we were really in a bad shape.</span> <span id="s971">Probably they wanted to bring us up to better certain standards which they have in order to make most use for us as laborers.</span> <span id="s972">But, they already call the morning crews to line up on a certain place outside, and they count us and assign us numbers, as I told.</span> <span id="s973">After a week approximately, they moved us to Landsberg which was satellite, again.</span> <span id="s974">Landsberg was still a new camp opened at that time.</span> <span id="s975">There was no housing.</span> <span id="s976">They brought masonite and made like tents of masonite where we slept on straw, put straw on the floor and slept there.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: Who were you with at this point?</span> <span id="s978">Were you with a brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s980">I was with my brother, and my wife's father and probably, we had a group of relative people, probably a group of five or six people together.</span> <span id="s981">We tried to stay together.</span> <span id="s982">And when we came to Landsberg, there was no accomidation there was just this masonite tents made with straw.</span> <span id="s983">And then they started to build housing for us which consisted of a long trench, where we dug out a long trench, actually it's U shaped trench, and then on the ground again, they put straw and planks around, and then they put a roof over it, made of steel, a steel roof.</span> <span id="s984">This was the housing and one -- in the middle, a wood burning oven.</span> <span id="s985">I'm not sure, when you walked in the housing, you walked a few steps down to this trench which was dark and on both sides people used to sleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: In the trench?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: No, the trench is to walk.</span> <span id="s988">The trench, you used to walk and on both sides used to be a five foot space, and you used to lay down and sleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: No floor?</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: No, no floor.</span> <span id="s991">And after we finished the construction of this so-called housing, then they started to take us out to working brigades and work was a underground factory for __________ for airplanes.</span> <span id="s992">They felt that the war come to an end soon and decided to build an underground factory, and this was someplace in the woods which was where we were digging, and there was very stony ground and wheelbarrows and carrying stones and digging ditches, mixing cement.</span> <span id="s993">It was a very difficult type of work, manual work.</span> <span id="s994">Many people got sick, of course not enough food, were killed or died working there, and population of this camp was decreasing very rapidly.</span> <span id="s995">I was lucky.</span> <span id="s996">One morning when everybody lined up on the field and takes a count they asked if there was anybody that knows something about architect, or who knows anything about building furniture, and I was standing next to two fairly prominent architects in Lithuania, and they wouldn't pick up their hands and I said why.</span> <span id="s997">They said they want to find out who is educated and kill them.</span> <span id="s998">I didn't believe them, so I picked up my hand.</span> <span id="s999">Then they called me and said what we are getting here many Germans SS men coming here with the families as guard to the camp and there is no furniture for them so we want to open a small shop to build furniture for these Germans.</span> <span id="s1000">Could you organize and find who is cabinet maker between people in the camp.</span> <span id="s1001">Get about eight or ten people, and we will get you some equipment and some wood and build furniture.</span> <span id="s1002">So, it sounded good to me.</span> <span id="s1003">So, we started to do it, and we were still exposed to the same food which was given us, which was just a little soup in the morning, just a liquid, just nothing inside and the same thing in the evening and a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1004">But then the Germans started to come in, and one German told us he wanted this bedroom, this, this and then another German comes in.</span> <span id="s1005">One is like a captain or a higher rank, and I was told to do first for a higher rank officer than for lieutenants of a smaller rank.</span> <span id="s1006">Then the smaller rank would come in, and I'd say we have so many orders for these people to do and we cannot, it would take months and months.</span> <span id="s1007">So, the next day he comes with a piece of sausage or a piece of bread and says can you advance it some how.</span> <span id="s1008">So, that's how I got to organize more food than the average person had, and I shared with my brother.</span> <span id="s1009">At that time, my wife's father passed away already from conditions which were not enough food and hard labor.</span> <span id="s1010">And also, I believe my brother-in-law passed away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: How old were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: Probably late forties I would assume.</span> <span id="s1013">Probably, I'm not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: The conditions were that bad?</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: Yes, it was a very bad condition.</span> <span id="s1016">Then this Landsberg camp had a hospital and Dr. Elkous was in Landsberg together, and he was in charge of the hospital.</span> <span id="s1017">He came over to German authority in this camp and told him, look in order to take care of all the sick people, I need this and this and this medication and this equipment.</span> <span id="s1018">The Germans looked at this and said, okay we'll take care of it.</span> <span id="s1019">But by weeks and weeks nothing happened.</span> <span id="s1020">So then Dr. Elkous went over to them and said I need bed linen because there are more and more sick people here and if I don't get by this day, I will go on a hunger strike, and he did.</span> <span id="s1021">He died of being on a hunger strike for, I believe, ten days.</span> <span id="s1022">He died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: Did you know him personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: Yes, I knew him because my father and him went to the same Jewish School, Hader, in a small town in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1025">And then when he became a doctor in Lithuania, he was our doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: What kind of man was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: He was a dedicated doctor.</span> <span id="s1028">He graduated in Germany School of Medicine and his whole life was medicine.</span> <span id="s1029">He never belonged or did anything other than reading medical books and studying medicine to be more advanced.</span> <span id="s1030">He was very prominent in the medical society in early Lithuania Kovno.</span> <span id="s1031">But he was not involved in Jewish affairs.</span> <span id="s1032">He did not participate.</span> <span id="s1033">I don't know if he was religious or not.</span> <span id="s1034">I'm not sure, but he went to what's called Hader, which you learn history and things of this nature when he was a youngster.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: I don't mean to back track, but since we're talking -- just because you did know him and he was your doctor, did that give you any special privileges in Kovno?</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: Limited amount like I mentioned I was taking care of this public works in the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s1037">It's because I knew him or I knew his sisters which was __________.</span> <span id="s1038">Then when I finished this and I started to work at the airport, and then I became in charge of certain brigade where I met my wife.</span> <span id="s1039">The reason I became in charge of brigade because of certain connection there.</span> <span id="s1040">And then certain major events took place after I got married -- or before I got married, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1041">Germans selected about 20 or 30, I don't know how many, young woman to take them to a farm far away from Ghetto to dig out vegetables that were ripe to pick up vegetables.</span> <span id="s1042">And everybody was convinced that once they finished this work, they would be killed.</span> <span id="s1043">Then I went to Dr. Elkous and this Goldberg who was his assistant and told him, I want to get my wife back, what can you do.</span> <span id="s1044">I mean, please do something about it, and they did something about it, because she came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">End of Tape #5</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Tape #6</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: So, you were actually telling me that there was a hospital in Dachau and people were sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: Yes, and Dr. Elkous went on a hunger strike and died in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1049">I was involved in building the furniture for the German SS people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: Did you have a lot of contact with SS people or German families?</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: No.</span> <span id="s1052">The families not at all.</span> <span id="s1053">The only contact was they would come in for a few minutes and tell that that's what they want.</span> <span id="s1054">They want a bed and a cabinet for to put their clothes and a night table for to eat and a table to it, and that is it.</span> <span id="s1055">There were certain designs of furniture we had to make.</span> <span id="s1056">I mean, they couldn't design their own furniture.</span> <span id="s1057">The only thing was a list of people for whom we are making it.</span> <span id="s1058">Then as I explained before, certain people lower rank wanted before the people who were more higher ranked, and then by manipulating the schedule I obtained some additional food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: So people would ask you for special favors, and then you would get more food to give to your brother and friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: Yes, correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: In general, did they treat you fairly well or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: When I was in charge of cabinet makers, yes, I had no complaints.</span> <span id="s1063">I don't recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: Who were a lot of the other prisoners here?</span> <span id="s1065">Were they mostly from Lithuania or were they from everywhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: In this camp, everybody was from Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1067">Actually there were a few not original from Lithuania because all were Kovno Ghetto, Kovno Ghetto, but in Kovno Ghetto the majority were Lithuanians, but then there were certain Polish Jews who run away from Poland during the war and Hungarian.</span> <span id="s1068">But the majority were from Kovno Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: How big of a camp was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: I couldn't tell you.</span> <span id="s1071">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1072">Probably not too big, probably 8,000 people, 6,000, but I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: Who were your guards, the Kopos?</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: Guards were mostly Germans or Ukrainians who were engaged by Germans, and then there was this German SS and then like a corp of engineers it's called who were in charge of construction, German soldiers in charge of construction because they were in charge of producing this new factory for airplanes, underground factory.</span> <span id="s1075">I don't recall the Kopos, yes, there were Kopos in Lansburg which were Jews, probably.</span> <span id="s1076">I don't recall.</span> <span id="s1077">They were not very important probably in Lansburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: Were there any women there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: No.</span> <span id="s1080">Wait.</span> <span id="s1081">There were very few women who were in kitchen preparing this food and distributing the food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: Did you know any of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: No, not that I recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: Were the guards mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: Yes, especially at the working place.</span> <span id="s1086">And actually the conduct of the guards was something I would say three times during the work, the morning when they used to count us and see when we went up, who didn't feel good, they would kick him out, and they would say take him away, and that was the end of him.</span> <span id="s1087">And in line for food, if somebody would go out of the line for food, he used to pull him out and say no food today and things of this nature.</span> <span id="s1088">They were mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: Did you see any people get punished?</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1091">There was one occasion where three people were hanged in the morning because they did something.</span> <span id="s1092">They stole cigarettes from a German.</span> <span id="s1093">They stole -- I remember cigarettes were involved.</span> <span id="s1094">They stole cigarettes from a German guard or something, and they were just in the middle of morning assembly.</span> <span id="s1095">They were just hung in front of everybody else to show them that nobody should steal from Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: So, you and your brother worked making furniture for the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">A: No, my brother did not, only I did.</span> <span id="s1098">My brother didn't qualify as a cabinet maker.</span> <span id="s1099">They asked everybody their background, and I said cabinet maker, and they said whoever couldn't prove that he is a cabinet maker, but my brother also had certain position in Ghetto which was better than going to work in building the factory, the airport factory.</span> <span id="s1100">After he became-- somehow certain pull between the Germans and whoever it was, I don't recall, and they made him-- there was a warehouse of this uniforms which he used to change it or collect it from people who died, collect the uniform to clean it up, wash it out, and give it to somebody else.</span> <span id="s1101">______ He worked in this distribution point of this uniforms somehow for a period of time.</span> <span id="s1102">Once I finished this furniture business, then I went back to work to this __________ building factory.</span> <span id="s1103">It didn't last forever.</span> <span id="s1104">It lasted for a short period of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: You said a lot of people were getting sick and dying?</span> <span id="s1106">Were the bodies buried?</span> <span id="s1107">What happened to them?</span> <span id="s1108">Who takes care of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: There was a big mass grave.</span> <span id="s1110">You used to take them in -- they're not wheelbarrows, but people used to push it, you know, it's more elaborate than a wheelbarrow, but I don't know how to call it, two wheels and a platform.</span> <span id="s1111">We used to take them out, and there was a mass grave and just dump them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: Who took them out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A: Jews, the people that were in the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: Were there gas chambers there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: Not in Augsburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: Were there any efforts to escape or to resist?</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: I don't think so.</span> <span id="s1118">I don't recall.</span> <span id="s1119">There was no place to go.</span> <span id="s1120">Landsberg was on a hill, like a farm land.</span> <span id="s1121">It was not developed.</span> <span id="s1122">It was just an area and fence around it, a double fence around it.</span> <span id="s1123">And nothing was __________.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: Do you remember about how many people slept in that same area that you did in the barracks or whatever it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A: Probably a hundred, fifty on each side.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Q: Did you have beds?</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">A: No.</span> <span id="s1128">I explained.</span> <span id="s1129">It is very difficult to explain.</span> <span id="s1130">This is ground here, this level with the ground and here is trench.</span> <span id="s1131">People sleep here and people sleep here, and they walk through the trench.</span> <span id="s1132">They come to their place where they sleep and drop and lay down and sleep.</span> <span id="s1133">And this was just straw laying on the ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: How long were you in Augsburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: Until it's liquidation -- not liquidation, disbandment, one morning they took us out on a march.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">Q; Do you remember when this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">A: This was in April of '45 approximately.</span> <span id="s1138">One morning they came and said pick up your belongings, which your belongings which consisted of a little tin jar with food and a spoon, take your belongings, and we're leaving this camp.</span> <span id="s1139">We went on a march just walking someplace, we didn't know where we were walking and were walking towards Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: How many people were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: Whatever was left in camp, before I mentioned, I assume 6,000, then maybe 500, 600 not many.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: Mostly Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: Yes, and then we walked towards Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1144">I was told later on they were hoping to exchange us for German war prisoners.</span> <span id="s1145">And this walk there was not much food, and it was a difficult walk.</span> <span id="s1146">I mean we didn't have shoes, just wooden type ---, and men were just falling down.</span> <span id="s1147">They couldn't take it any more, and they got killed or were left, or we used to carry them to the next place that we could dispose of them.</span> <span id="s1148">Then one day after walking for how many days, we went to sleep in some kind of outdoors in a valley, and in the morning when we got up, there were no more German guards.</span> <span id="s1149">They were all gone.</span> <span id="s1150">And then the German farmers came in and said the Americans are coming and the next thing the American tanks--.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: What were you thinking when you saw these American tanks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: Actually, I just recalled, the Germans came and said come, the war is over, come with us and took us all and helped us to get out of the valley and their barn and brought big containers of milk and cheese and bread.</span> <span id="s1153">And then American tanks pulled in after an hour, two hours, and we were so called liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: What were people doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: The majority couldn't move.</span> <span id="s1156">The majority got very sick, all of them because they were not used to this food which is very nutritious, it had fat and heavy milk and piece of butter, which we didn't see butter for a long time.</span> <span id="s1157">The majority developed terrible case of diarrhea and couldn't move.</span> <span id="s1158">They were vomiting and got really sick, the majority.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: You?</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: Yes, but not very.</span> <span id="s1161">I was also sick, but some were really in bad shape.</span> <span id="s1162">Some even died.</span> <span id="s1163">It was so sudden and those who had been __________, they wanted the best so they started to distribute these candy bars, on top, milky ways, and this didn't help.</span> <span id="s1164">The majority got very sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: How did the Americans treat you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: Very well, no complaints.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: What happened next?</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: Next they took us, they brought trucks or means of transportation, vehicles and took us to -- nearby was a German Air Force Academy which was just recently built, was a very modern up to date building and they took the complete building and converted it into a recovery hospital for all the people who were picked up and brought us to this __________.</span> <span id="s1169">They brought us to this building and assigned rooms and there were doctors and nurses, but people were still sick, especially the sickness, which was diarreah, they couldn't hold anything inside.</span> <span id="s1170">Then Americans brought in Germans to wash everything, I recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q: Was there any reaction towards the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: From so-called prisoners?</span> <span id="s1173">Not at that time, because at that time everybody was in bad shape, they were sick, and they didn't know what was happening.</span> <span id="s1174">They were trying to recuperate and trying to find their families.</span> <span id="s1175">It was very early stages.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: How did the Germans, when they came in to clean, were they nice to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: I couldn't tell you.</span> <span id="s1178">I don't recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: So, you were still with your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1181">And then we stayed there in the __________ for about probably less than a month, two weeks, three weeks, and then come announcement that anybody who is from Lithuania or actually Russia, USSR, but Lithuania was part of the USSR, there would be an opportunity to go back home to Lithuania and a train would be coming to pick everybody up.</span> <span id="s1182">Then it became a big discussion to go back to Lithuania or stay in Germany and eventually go to Israel or the United States or someplace.</span> <span id="s1183">And some people decided to go back and some people did not go back.</span> <span id="s1184">I didn't feel like going back, but my brother insisted we should go back because that is where we would find our wives.</span> <span id="s1185">Then we went back, but at the same time they called out from each railroad car that people should go out and pick up food for the journey.</span> <span id="s1186">From our car I walked out and where I walked out it still was not organized, the train moved away, and I was left.</span> <span id="s1187">So, my brother went on the first train and I was left.</span> <span id="s1188">I went on the second train.</span> <span id="s1189">Then when I went on the train I said, I'm doing something wrong.</span> <span id="s1190">Why should I go to Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1191">I don't have anybody.</span> <span id="s1192">Everybody was killed.</span> <span id="s1193">So, the train stopped in Dresden, which was eastern part of Germany, and I walked off from the train, and there were two or three other people from Lithuania whom I knew and here we were in Germany in Dresden not knowing what to do next.</span> <span id="s1194">Next, this Russian , red army people, security, comes over to us and says who are you and we said we are Jews from a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1195">So, we tell him the story and he says, "Don't tell us this story.</span> <span id="s1196">I know who you are.</span> <span id="s1197">You are fighting against us.</span> <span id="s1198">You are part of the Russian brigade which was fighting against Russia.</span> <span id="s1199">You are a part of this General Flasof (ph).</span> <span id="s1200">You are part of Flasof (ph) brigade," and they put us in a camp.</span> <span id="s1201">And took us every morning in trucks to dismantle German factories to be shipped back to Russia.</span> <span id="s1202">And I was there for maybe a month, and then we escaped from there and escaped, and once I escaped I started moving west until somehow I found out that there are Lithuanian Jews, women settled down and finally I came to Lodz and found my wife.</span> <span id="s1203">She was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: You went to Lodz because you heard there were Lithuania women there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: Yes, it was said in word to word communication because all Europe was moving east or west.</span> <span id="s1206">Because everybody was -- nobody, there were many displaced people in Europe during the war.</span> <span id="s1207">People in the Army, people in camps, people who escaped.</span> <span id="s1208">Everybody moved.</span> <span id="s1209">The trains were free.</span> <span id="s1210">The trains were just moving and anybody could go on a train and go.</span> <span id="s1211">And they used to meet people who were in camps and what do you know where people are.</span> <span id="s1212">They said are you part of an organization, it was a regular organization a Jewish organization to organize emigration to Israel, to Palestine, and Henny joined this organization, and it's collection point was someplace in Lodz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: How did you find the __________?</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: How?</span> <span id="s1215">I don't know, by coincidence, a miracle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q: I came in Lodz by train, and then I asked somebody, some Jewish fellow was standing there, and I said do you know where there are women here in housing who were from Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1217">He said they are from Lithuania but there are certain streets that the numbers where there are quite a few Jewish women, so I went over there.</span> <span id="s1218">I went over there and before walking to the building, the front there was a certain woman standing who recognized me, and she was from Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1219">She said oh, it's you and I said I'm looking for my wife.</span> <span id="s1220">And she said oh, she's in this row.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: You must have been amazed?</span> <span id="s1222">Yes my wife was very amazed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: Yes, I was very amazed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: So, you were reunited there and decided not to go to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">A: My brother was in the Army because my younger brother left Lithuania in '37 in the U.S. Army, and he was in Austria and he was looking for me.</span> <span id="s1226">No, no, then we started to move with my wife and a group of other people west away from Russian zone because Poland was under Russian influence at that time.</span> <span id="s1227">So we went to Czechoslovakia and came to Austria.</span> <span id="s1228">That's where we found out that my brother was in the U.S. Army in Austria and we were going to go to the American zone of Austria.</span> <span id="s1229">Austria was divided, and there was a British zone and an American zone.</span> <span id="s1230">So, we were in British zone in Gratz (ph) and then Britishers came over and said you are Jewish, do you want to go to Israel and put us in a camp.</span> <span id="s1231">We should go to Israel, not Palestine.</span> <span id="s1232">So, we were in Graz for maybe two or three weeks or a month, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1233">Then I got the message that my brother was looking for us somehow.</span> <span id="s1234">And then I went to U.S. Embassy and told them that my brother is in the U.S. Army and he is in Linz, which is an American zone and he gave us -- we somehow we got a certain piece of paper telling us the camp.</span> <span id="s1235">And we went on a train in Linz, and that's where we met my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: That's another miracle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: A miracle.</span> <span id="s1238">I mean you're talking about six million Jews were killed and certain people survived.</span> <span id="s1239">Everyone has a story to tell.</span> <span id="s1240">Something had to happen in order not to be one of the six million.</span> <span id="s1241">It's probably miracles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: Do you remember when you saw your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">A: Yes, sure.</span> <span id="s1244">As a matter of fact, when I came to Linz, he was not in Linz because he went to Vienna to get a permit from occupation from general to go to British zone to pick us up, then I crossed somehow.</span> <span id="s1245">But then the next day, he got the message that we are in Linz, so he came back and it was a nice warm reunion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q: When you look back on this period in your life, are there any lasting images that come to mind, that haunt you?</span> <span id="s1247">Anything that really stands out the most?</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: The most tragic is that I lost my mother and lost all other relatives whom I had, and suddenly I am all by myself in this world and to have to start to create a completely new life from scratch.</span> <span id="s1249">Nobody really helped me, only I have to help myself and in order to achieve it, we atleast, I felt that we should forget the past and start from very beginning and create something new as comparison to other people who were in similar conditions as we were felt that they had to live in the past and they repeated to everybody in the very beginning and whatever they did they did.</span> <span id="s1250">There are two ways to deal with the problem, which way is better way or worse, but there are two ways to resolve it.</span> <span id="s1251">One way it to live in the past, the second is forget the past and go forward.</span> <span id="s1252">This is what we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">Q: Was that easy to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">A: No, it's not easy but especially when the children were born, thought how to bring up our children.</span> <span id="s1255">We never went into the past.</span> <span id="s1256">Later on when they grew up, they could understand that it was hard to talk about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">Q: Anything else that you want to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">A: I don't think so.</span> <span id="s1259">I think I covered everything.</span></p>
