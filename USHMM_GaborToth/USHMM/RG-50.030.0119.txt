And the uh sharführer (ph), an SS man, and he asked us to keep all technical installment in the camp in order. And so he always took a professional for every, and we worked then regularly. We had a, a workshop, and so we knew the organization, we had connections to the kappos, and so we observed what is it. So during this two years, this twenty-eight months exactly, so I could observe, and we were going from one camp to another. There were several camps in Birkenau. And we had a boomshk (ph), you know, a permit, that we are authorized to repair these pipes and this and this and this. And we always get from this sharführer (ph) a letter where we should go.

We cannot came to the cremetoria when they were operating, but when they were not operating some pipes were leaking or something was necessary, an electrician also. So we came and the guard there, and the guard was very exacting. He couldn't speak with the people in this cremetory, it was sonderkommando, but we saw, we saw the corpses. We saw not the - and this, you know, as I told you, this, this uh bunkers, these adapted cremetories, stopped the work and the sonderkommando came, but not I must, I forgot to tell you one very important thing. How I came to contact this underground. So there still was, as I told you, a block when the sonderkommando was guarded, and there were about three hundred men, and they were under the guard always going to this Birkenau, to this woods, and they came back and they, it was prohibited to contact them. And when I was going with my uh, with my box and one of these blocks, sonderkommando, blockältester, the Jew, when I came nearer I saw that he was a Jew, and here S S, Slovak, you know, a very nationality, he had a sign.

And there, there is a piles on the...piles from the rails and they are pouring them with the fluid; and with the fluid, with the shmatas--with the rags. And they are burning them [with] this. And this sonderkommando which you see, they are on the night shift." And he asked me if I can make a lock or something to repair for him. And so he told, but I would not believe it. I couldn't. And he told me (whispered), "You don't believe it." I couldn't believe. Look, I was three years in the camp at the time. "And look, so you will see it." And I didn't know. A few days, came an SS man for me to this kapo. He needs a schlosser [Ger: "locksmith, mechanic or fitter"], a blacksmith, to repair a bearing in this wagon. You know a bearing. And he took me and brought me there, and he stand nearby me when I make this metal (ph), this bearing house from this wagon which was broke. And I saw it. I saw how the Slovak sonderkommando, Slovak prisoners, uh buried...uh took...digged out these open graves. And as they came, the corpses put on these wagons, and brought them back where they were. And from far, I saw also this white bunk house, bunkers--this farm house, where this...I saw it. So from this, moment I believe it. So how hard was it belief to other people, yes. Now, and so...and this, there was the first sonderkommando from Slovakia which came in April 1942, and they were took from these one thousand men, three hundred; and they brought...they used them for this sonderkommando. Yes, and there was the first sonderkommando. And short after, I think in December, they organized a mass escape. And somebody traited...was a traitor and who thought he will save his own life, and he told it to the SS men. And the whole sonderkommando was uh ...one day the whole sonderkommando, and they took them to Auschwitz I and they shot them and burned them.
Q: Tell me about the mass escape which was planned.
A: Yes, the mass escape of this sonderkommando was planned at that time was possible to escape, the fences were not so tight, Birkenau, it was in the middle of the woods and so on, and there were some escapes, yes, but you must see that people refused to work. But in the moment when they refused to work, or didn't work good, the _____ they shot, the SS men shot them, on the spot, yes. And uh this, and their blockältester (ph) this Rosin (ph) ______________________, and still he is living. You should hear him. Yes, I will give you that. This Rosin, Arnold Rosin (ph), he is the only one from this other commando who survived. Only first. Others, all were destroyed, yes. It is in my articles. How, it is interesting how he survived this.
Q: Tell how, describe the plan of the revolt, do you know?
A: I know, look, they tried that they will go, they will uh, they will go far behind the, the uh fenced, behind the area of the, there was no fence. Behind the area where the, the bunkers were yes. It was not fenced. There were SS men, the guards, they were surrounding them, yes. And they told, they were, they were uh, inbofond (ph). There were some guards they will kill and they will go to Slovakia. They organize some cars, yes, and an SS man was involved in this who was a Slovak SS man, yes, a Slovak. And uh, they believed him, and uh, there very exact uh details are not now, maybe there was once, but that, that, and the fact that it was uh, told to SS men, yes, and the one who told it, yes, they killed him with an axe. This traitor, they killed him. They killed him, but it was too late.
Q: The Jews killed him?
A: Yes, the Jews killed him. The name isn't known at all, in the details. And so, and exactly four days or five days later came a new transport from Polish ghettos, and from this transport they took a new sonderkommando, about three hundred men, and from this survived several and I have very detailed uh testimonies of them, and so, and also from this Rosen (ph). From this Rosen (ph) I have this hugh, he escaped later from Auschwitz. Uh we know how he saved Europe, how he saved. Look, it was forbidden to get from this sonderkommando commando, to the other _____________, to transport to another, nobody could go away from this other commando. But this Rosen (ph), he found a, bread, you know, a whole bread, and when he break this bread, inside in this bread was a golden chain and a gold watch, yes. Inside, from the deportees. Someone told it will save his life, so brought him this. And so he was on the block and he gave this a ______ to the blockältester, _______________. (Say it again in English.) Yes, the blockältester was the boss of the block, normally a prisoner or ______________. And the schreiber [Ger: scribe], the clerk, who was his aide, was also. And he corrupted, he gave these valuables, these forms to them and they asked him they should transfer him to another block. Even it, it was written, they did it by the way he is a ill and so on. Even so, and through the infirmary they got him in another block, you known, transmitted. SO he was not there, in this block. And so he saved his life, and he is still living, yes. Arnold Rosin (ph) is his name. So this I will, (let's come back to you), yes, so now you see, so I, how I make the first contact with this other commando with all these people. So I had a survey, how, what, how the barracks. And so I give it to underground and it was the central, was in Auschwitz I, but there was some prisoners, Shmuleski and so on who came in this Auschwitz I who was a tiler you know from the roof.
Q: O.K. Slow down and explain a little more about this whole underground network and your involvement.
A: Yes, so there was an underground of mainly, in the Polish camps, yes, the Polish, but non-Jews. And they central was in the Auschwitz I camp, in the main camp. And the head of this, this I didn't knew at that time, but how was it, Cirankiewicz (ph), later the Minister President of the Polish Republic, he was and he was at that time uh, uh nurse on the, he was prisoner, political prisoner, Polish prisoner, and he was a nurse on the prison uh infirmary. And he has some group, so-called camp group (ph) of Auschwitz, the fighting group of Auschwitz, but there was Austians, some French and some Poles. They didn't took a Jew inside, yes. They used the services of Jews but a Jew was not in there, yes. And one of these liaisons was David Shmuleski (ph). He was a Jew who was fighting in the Spanish, uh, against Franco ( . . civil war). Later he was transported when they lost, so he was in France, to Drancy, and from Drancy came on transport to Auschwitz. And Shmuleski came with this, but he has also very many friends in this, uh, underground. Yes. They trusted him. And so he was a liaison between Birkenau and Auschwitz I. And when he was a roofer, yes, on the roof, you know, the tar, and on the roof is the tar, they were putting roofs and the covered with the tar, youknow, with the paper, you know with this. And for tar, it must be the store for tar was in Auschwitz I, in the main camp, and so from time to time he came to Auschwitz I. We came also from time for some material we needed, so we came to Auschwitz I, only as uh with a guarded with an SS man, but we had connections. And this uh Shmuleski (ph), make the connections with this main camp, and they, and so I gave this and he told, you should all observe and tell me and we will, the Polish uh prisoners have contact with the Polish government in London. They have contact through Armia Kraiova. We have note from Birkenau, but we, he told us, not names, but he, and this he, he knew much, but we knew the details, more details. So I told him the details and he gave it further to this uh, to this uh camp group at Auschwitz, this fighting group at Auschwitz. And they have the contact. But later we knew that they are guarding only their own interests. For Jews, they didn't care. So we then, later we find some Czech-Polish, some Czech civil workers, you know, who worked, but they were Czechs, yes, and the detail how it worked we have three. And they came from time to time, in three months they could go travel to their families to Czechlovakia. And even if they were guarded, they were civil workers, as I told you, at the civil enterprise which were, so one was a carpenter, one make roofs, and one was expert for the canalization, yes for the canalization, the _____ the channels (ph), and for water pipes and so. We make with them connections and so were were connected, and we also, we could stole plans, yes.
Q: How did you steal plans?
A: Somebody would not believe it. How it was possible. It's already, I can show you a letter from Polish museum I got now, a certification for it . . There was a so-called Baulaitung of Auschwitz, a construction office, a hugh construction office of SS, who made the planning and construction of their hugh camps and of the cremetoria, the gas chambers, yes, there was a hugh office, there were several hundred. But they also took some prisoners, some uh, qualified prisoners. So there was, for instance, an engineer, Vera Foltinf (ph). He was an architect, an engineer. So they took him to draw the plans, see, in the office. There was Bitterman, he was an engineer, so they took him and he was in the commando. He took there and in the office he drawed (ph) for the SS men. And so we pursuaded him he should make a small copies of the plans. And he smuggled it out, and we gave it later to these civil workers, and it came to Prague, and the wife of Kraus, my friend who was non-Jewish, and he was, he had contact through the Swiss consulate in Prague. And so the plans went to the Swiss consulate, through this. An original of these plans are in The Death Factory, exactly the plans, yes. They were later when it was this, maybe you know this, when it was revived the Holocaust when the CIA make these pictures, you know, the Americans photographed Auschwitz, (right), you know this, exactly, but they told they didn't knew. They never bombed. Yes. And later, after many years, they make, they published it publically, the, all these pictures. There were seven raids on Auschwitz, and there is also written that _____________ is make according to that factory, they ask that the plans are so exactly, when you see it from, so you see the prints, the basement prints, exactly what we stole from this, from this factory. So it was, and so we had luck. We were lucky that uh, there were many people who paid with life this activity yes. But, and so, that I told you, I was conscious that I can not, it was not according to the human calculation that you would survive. Yes. Especially they guarded us. Yes. So I remember once I was going, it was in '44, in autumn, I was going through the uh, the gate. And always there was a guard. And I always must tell hälfling numeral this and this number are going there and there. And he mark the number where I am in the camp. Yes. That is in evidence. I was going, always without guard, in this guarded area. I could go without guard when I had this permission; and I told him the number--73,000. And there was already 400,000 tattooed. "So what, 73,000, __(ph)__? Repeat!" I repeat. He jumped and go and look on my... "And how's that you are not dead? You should be dead. This is not possible!" So I told him, "Look, I have this...I am expert in this." "Oh, you should not be...you will not alive. You will not wait, Ivan. We have five, you will not wait alive Ivan. You cannot expect that, Ivan. We will save you, yes, the Russians, yes," he told. ______________________. Five minutes before and we , we will shot you said the SS man, very, very angry, yes. So, such an experience. So nevertheless, so uh, I was uh, _______________ crematoria then when they come and
Q: Can't hear you. A little louder.
A: I am... Should I jump to that moment when the crematoria were destroyed and when the uprising was, or still you have some questions.
Q: No, go ahead, I think we're ready to, that's fine. If you're ready to go there, then we're ready to go there.
A: Now, look, first I want you to know about the selections. So, if you have the plans, so you see there are seven camps in Birkenau, yes, and in the middle before the deportment, there were the women's camp, and then the other, the section two, section five. There was built a ramp (ph), a huge three-chain ramp through...
Q: Three-level ramp?
A: No, no. It's called a passing. You know, uh three-rail... the three rail, from Auschwitz station to Birkenau, it was about three kilometer, and the trains came directly before near the cremetoria. And the ramp was between, it was a dead ramp, he told us. It was a three-rail, and like a huge ramp, and on this ramp came the trains. There were sometimes three, five trains, and on every train there came about three, four, five thousand people. And we saw that the squad of the SS doctors, and their Lagerführer, they were making the selection. Yes, they were making the selection. And we saw it, how they were making it. And I was going to the ramp. In the selection, in the process selection, I could go there. But I had these ________, I was sure they will not let me, now they will not take me in. And I was curious how they were making this, yes. So uh, first when I was going from one camp to the other so, it was between these two camps and I had to wait and in the other camp, this was a women's camp, and I had to repair some kitchens there, or some kettles, so I had to wait by the guard. They had the guardstube [Ger: "guardroom"], the guard house, yes; an SS man always guarded it. But when the transport came, I had to wait. The SS man was very curious, and he also tried to organize something, yes, when there was some food or something valuable. So they always tried. So I have to wait 'til he had time to register my name. And so I observed. And this time, I.. . I experienced a very interesting and moving, moving sense. Yes. So the whole, I net (ph) this hundred selections, I saw many. And everybody tell you, "Mengele, Mengele." It's not true. Look, the Mengele, they didn't very often the selection. There were twenty-three doctors--twenty-three doctors--who had the service for selections at the ramp. And sometimes also was Mengele; but Mengele was eager to have the twins, and the people who were not normal. You know, they had the _______ of something distracted people--he was interested in this. So he didn't...he didn't trust also to the selectees...to his colleagues who selected, and he always watched. And so did his _____________, "Are you twins? Are you not twins? ," and so, yes. Or, "What you are of profession?" And they discovered some doctors like Nisly (ph), and he took the doctors and they make for him this uh, yes, this searches of the...of the twins. You know, post-mortem, you know, post-mortem protocol.
Q: Autopsy.
A: Autopsy. They make the protocols, sign it and send it to Berlin (cough), and so.
Q: Do you want some water?
A: So this I saw, I observed it uh consciously, I would know it and so what I knew so I gave to ______, to ______.
Q: You passed the information along to the underground?
A: Yes, but once... Maybe this would be also interesting for you, the Shmulenski (ph), which I told you was the liaison between Auschwitz. And he told, "Look, we need photograph. The world will not believe in our reports. We need photograph." They asked me we should photograph. So I need a photograph he told, Shmulenski (ph). So photograph, it was very hard to, not so hard to organize, but smuggle in the camera. As the people brought many photographs you know, for the parents, all the equipment, they brough the whole equipment for the dentist, for instance, all the people brought with them. And once it came that we were going to the ramp, myself and Kraus (ph), my friend, together, and he saw a carriage, a baby carriage there, after the Holland transport came. It was only the ramp was clean, and still there was a heap of this trunks and of this and so the Kanada kommando took it away to this storage to sort it and to take the valuables from this. You know Kanada, what it was.
Q: Explain Kanada for the tape.
A: Look. The Kanada, it was a special squad--a special detail, so-called averamudienst (ph) in German. Averamudienst (ph). It means that they should clean, they should help when the prisoners, deportees, came. So they had the service; and they always told to the prisoners, in their language, "Out of the wagons, and you should go left. All your luggage, they will bring it in the camp. You should not care." And so they have the task to quiet them a little, yes; and there was also a _______ I can't. And after their...they have to quiet them in their own language. And the SS men were also behind them _______. And after their transport were selected and put...put to...brought to the gas chambers, out of the camps who were working, who were able-bodied. So then it was a heap of trunks of all this, and they brought with a list to the Kanada camp, where there was thirty barracks where all the belongings of these deportees were sorted. Were sorted and checked. Many people uh, uh sewed in their raiments, in their shoes, in every possible hidings, _______, and all. And this were, and the guard sorted, and when they found something so they must give it away. If a prisoner tried to organize, to take something for himself, so if he was catched, he was shot on the spot. But nevertheless, this brunt (ph), this business with the SS man also tried to get something but had access, and so used the prisoners who had access and so on, yes. It was very complicated. And this Kanada, the name Kanada came as it is a __________ in Kanadas, ______________ very far. They are rich people and they have a good living. Kanada, it was known, it was a dream of a welfare society, yes. So they made the name "Kanada" as this kommando always had...always had bacon, had food, had decent... It was a good kommando. A good detail. But they were guarded. And when somebody...many of them were shot for when they were catched from organizing. It was organizing. And, told when somebody would. And so I will come to this camera, and the Kraus (ph) took this carriage, and brought it in the camp. And the in the carriage there was a small package. Look in the carriage. We have in our maintenace squad, there came SS men, they would have tor repair whatever, a lamp (ph), but he couldn't take it by a normal way. So he gave to us in this squad and make also a carriage, some baby carriage. And so repair baby carriage. There was not a wheel, and so Kraus (ph) in the first moment told, yes, baby carriage would be good if there is SS man, we will have a repair, and so I have spare parts, but what we found in this package was food, and there was a camera. A spiegel (ph) camera, camera, spiegel (ph) camera. It means mirror camera yes. And so Shmuleski came, and we showed, look, oh, I cannot . . It must be a _____. Otherwise I cannot photograph. ______, you know. So his plan was that he will go on the roof, yes, and carry the camera to the roof, and manage to exchange a __________ and through this and make the shots. This was his plan. So he would not have this camera. So he, and he seek. But we would destroy this camera, yes. It was very dangerous to have a camerA: So we have a, _________ when the ______ is going to make a fire, and so we have this in our, our equipment. And then there was a friend of Shmulenski (ph) who work on the water barricades who worked with civilian workers on the water and he was engineer of wood, and he was in our squad, and he sometimes came and he had the contact with this Polish civilian workers. Yes. And he told, no look, we can get three, four hundred cigarettes for this, and I will take it and I will give it to civilian worker. So, he took it. He took it and he brought I think uh about hundred cigarettes and divided. But in two months, about, in two months we were called, schlosser ____________, locksmiths in the...they should come to the blockführerstube (ph) in the entrance to the camp, yes. And by the entrance to the camp, there were a guard from Gestapo, they had two clerks, which should observe what happened in the camp, yes. In this, there was the office of Gestapo detail, in this uh, in this guard, it was a guard house, and there was, and we should go, it was called schlosser _______ . But it was nothing because they always asked for something, if there was in another camp. And the Kraus (ph), was going there, yes, my friend the Kraus(ph). And yes, they asked for him. And he came in about twenty minuetes back he was bloody, he was pale and uh, he told look Brazovsky (ph) is lying on the corridor, beaten to blant (ph). Yes, Brazovsky, who took once the camerA: And he told me also I couldn't keep, they beat me so I must confess. I couldn't keep, I must confes. So he didn't go in the office and he returned back. What should we do? We are all involved in this, yes. What should we do? And this was a, ________, a very desperate situation.
Q: Hold it, hold this. You're right at the point where they need to change tape. Let them change the tape and we will pickup
TAPE #3
Q: O.K. Are we rolling? O.K. Let's take it back to that moment where you saw Brazovsky (ph) on the floor and they came back to you and you knew you were in trouble.
A: So and Kraus (ph) came to us, what we should do. We, there was a fiend of us who was in charge of the station for repairing the teeth for SS men, yes. They came there. He was expert for this, he was an artist and a doctor for, dentist doctor. (He was a dentist.) And he told them he was a friend was _________ and uh, in the reserve (ph). His name is Alex Rosenstock (ph) and he told look, I will give you a morphine injection. You will not feel it if they will beat you. Yes. And they gave him a morphine injection and he proved it, and he sticked it in, and he didn't feel. And he was going.
Q: This is Kraus, going back?
A: Can't think what he was told the SS asked him. He was then back, he couldn't, he came in twenty minutes, half-hour back, laughing. Back. Just laughing. And he told the story. I came to this office and there were two SS men, Lachman (ph) and Boger (ph), I knew them. There was a table and on the table was the camera and they ______________ whip. A whip, yes, and it was a pistol. And they asked me did you know the camera. Yes, I know. How did you get to this camera? So I told them the story, I found it a carriage and I brought this baby carriage and we found the camera and so. So why didn't you give up the camera to the SS men? Look, the camera, it's like a machine gun, a machine gun, yes, would you shot me. So we need some cigarettes, so we tried. So, and for what reason you would have this carriage. Ah, this carriage, look, some SS would have repaired some baby carriage, so I told him I will make him a good service, when I can repair, so he told it the guard. So let us know the name of the SS man who ordered, who have from you the repair of a baby carriage. The guard's name I don't remember. So you don't remember, so they give me a slap, they give me another slap. Now, you remember. I cannot. So they opened the door. Look, you will look like this, like Brazovsky, if you don't admit to whom you made the repair. So ___________________________ he told, I never will uh, never will uh, no ________________________ I never will. You speak another language? No. I never will tell uh _________, I never will an SS man to denounce, no. I never will denounce an SS man. So they give him a kick hard. Yes. Nothing. This moment when he told I never will denounce an SS man, why all the SS men were involved in some way with the prisoners, and so when they saw, this is in all prisoners, and he, he will never, in this situation he will not denounce an SS man, so he is a good man. So they kicked him out, and he came back laughing. He told I was so quiet with this injection, so quiet that I didn't feel it, danger, nothing. I was very quiet like comrades to the SS. So, yes, also Brazovsky they let him in the ______, was in the infirmary, and also.
Q: That's quite a tale.
A: So, also this, such, this not the only case. There were another when we have a radio, and so. But this, I never will forget, this one when Kraus came back laughing after this and told this story. Yes. But later, they make the photographs, later. There are known, these photographs, these three or four photographs, and I discovered in the bathroom they were made and the stories about them, it's not true that Shmuleski made them. It's told Shmuleski told he made them but it's not true. I later discovered who, why.
Q: Who made them?
A: It made, a Polish, a Greek officer, a young Greek officer. Who later tried to escape and were killed. Uh, I puzzled the place where from it was done. Shmulevski told it was done from the roof, yes, and he told him but he wouldn't ________. And so, but when I was in Yad Vashem working, and so I showed these photographs to a photographer who was there and he asked me how it was done. I told him from the roof. It is not possible, the angle is not possible from the roof, it is not possible. And yes, he was true. And later I know how it was from the frame, we found the frame of the gas chamber in the cremetorium number four, there from it was done. Yes, so this is the story.
Q: Interesting. Let's go back to you, go back to Erich Kulka. What happened after that camera incident?
A: After the camera incident, nothing. Nothing. With this moment when he told if I ____________the SS man, it was forgotten - no medal, nothing.
Q: O.K. What did you do, you were involved with the underground at that point and kind of with a commando, what kinds of things were you involved in?
A: Look, always...every man who survived long time and held the position...look, it was the surviving. It was possible to survive for eight or three, four, five percent of people to survive. Who--people, prisoners--who had a luck to get the job which the SS men needed. This were the doctors, the nurses, and all kinds of artisans--tilers, and so on. They needed them. Therefore, first they had a better possibility to move. They had the possibility to eat, yes, to organize food; and they had always some connections. Sometimes the connections were very dangerous. The SS men shoot the people and so on. When they feel they are in danger, yes. So you were never very sure of this. So connections, I __________ in Kanada. And so, in the Kanada ...look, the Kanada...the details. Kanada was very, uh very severely watched, yes; if they are organizing, if they came to the camp, they were always checked. And so, in spite the SS men knew that they are organizing and in spite they always are interested that they should organize for them, yes. So it was so.
Q: Be specific. You are talking about bribes and the cheating...
A: Yes, now. So look, the Kanada had this special camp. It was E.. . Camp E.. . I forget. G camp. I can show you on the plan. In this camp, there were about thirty barracks, like prisoner barracks. And in these barracks were sorted all the belongs which the...the...which were taken off from the deportees. Yes. And in these barracks, when they came, they was sonderkommando. The prisoners, they must go and take off all their uh _____. And in another barrack, they got another uh suits, clothes. So...and when they returned they must...they must make also in one barrack, and then another. So they could not keep, or very hard to keep, something in their raiments. The same was with the SS men, the SS men who observed; they came to the Gestapo, they came to make SS _________, shower, and in an elegant way. And also must keep their...their suits. They get other suits; and through the Gestapo...through the bathroom, yes. So also they could keep. So who could keep. Sometimes they managed. But the...the artisans, for instance, we were called to repair electrician, or to repair a pipe or repair something. I remember an SS man asked when we should organize for him a fur, yes. Organize it a fur. A real fur, yes. A nice fur for his wife. So when we came to this, when we have some work in Kanada, we knew that we would come there. So there the floor was...there was no planks, nothing. It was mud, on the...such...packed. Yes.
Q: Oh, O.K. Packed dirt.
A: Yes. Packed dirt, yes. And so we contacted these from Kanada, the prisoners which were in a neighboring camp. And he promised he will dig in in the floor something what we were interested, some ring or brilliant--something small. And we had in our uh boxes, __________, water crane (ph), uh, water pipe. Yes, this...what is water running, what is that?
Q: The water closets, they're for the pipes.
A; For the pipes. No, when the water is running?
Q: Faucet.
A: Faucet. And in the middle of this faucet is such a hat (ph) you know, if you can dismantle it. So you can in the middle of this such a hat (ph). And this we operated out, and there we put this contraband, you know. And we screwed it very tightly. And so...we were going, so we checked this and this. But he didn't find. And so, I wanted to how...how they traded (ph) the SS men with us. So before we came from our camp, it was the camp __________ to the camp ______, we had to pass three different guards, guard barracks, yes. And so when we came from one camp, so the SS men told, "Look, what you bring? I know the rings or watch or something."
Q: The SS men knew about this?
A: Sure. You in Kanada, so you bring this and this. They knew. And he found another SS man, and told, "Look, this uh blacksmiths, they will bring some valuables. If you will find them, you can have it." So...so we were going through this. And the SS men [said], "You have something." "No. We have nothing." So we tried and ______ and they didn't find. And this SS man, when we came on the camp to this SS man who offered this: "So where have you...?" "Uh, be patient. We will bring it to you." So we came to our...our maintenance barrack squad, into shop, of the squad, and the ____________. And for our eyes he was a good ring or something. He phoned to another SS man, before me, _____ you fool, how did you check these people. They brought it. Yes, so if, he asked how it's our secret. So this is the way, but we were sure, if he would find this prisoners who make this organization, gold or something very valuable, he would give him slip and he would sew in pocket. He would not _______. But even if he would find a letter, even so innocent letter from a wife to a man at another camp, immediately he would take a notice to a Gestapo office, and they would brought you and murder you and kill you. Just, even make a case, a great case of a spy. And I don't know what. But _______________ they never make it _____, the SS men.
Q: They would put it in their pocket.
A: Yes, they were very eager to get some value from this. And this I knew. Yes. So this was, but it was dangerous, but it happened sometimes, this. So this I explain you, the Kanada.
Q: Take us down to the liberation and what happened.
A: Look, the liberation, so it was, you don't understand. I will tell you also that my wife and my eleven-year son came to Auschwitz. They were in Theresienstadt when I was already long time in Auschwitz. Normally, the deportees were always selected and the wives with children were put in the gas chambers. It was normal. But the first time into us, in September 1943, it came from Theresienstadt a transport of Czech prisoners. And no of them were selected and all were put in a special camp, so-called a Czech "family camp." In Birkenau it was a camp. And nobody was allowed to go from the camp, and nobody was allowed to go in. It was isolated. The people were not shaved their hair. They didn't work opposite...outside the camp. They get the better food. And there were rumors that they will be exchanged for German prisoners. Yes. And they believe it, believe it all. They had special rights, special conditions. And there was in my wife and our family, and my son also. So I also...yes. But we couldn't believe for the first time they took the transport to Birkenau. And the reason for this was that there were rumors that from Theresienstadt, who was proclaimed as special and prominent uh ghetto, yes, that the people were deported to the east and killed. There were rumors. So that they would uh block these rumors. And these people who came to Theresienstadt from the camp, they must write every month a letter to Theresienstadt or to other. And they wrote a letter and could ask for to send them a package of food; and they got the food from Portugal, from France, from Switzerland, yes. And they wrote letters to Theresienstadt, where their relatives or friends were. But the address to avoid any connection with Auschwitz; so they wrote the address: "Arbeitslager Birkenau." This [means] "working camp Birkenau." "Bei Neu Bieru_"--it's near Neu Bieru_. It was about nine kilometers far. There was a post office there, you could find it on the map. "Lagerstrasse" and number--it is a street, a camp street; this house number, and this and this. So they avoid any... And so they came to [NB: from] Theresienstadt, a new camp, a working camp it's all. There were some...in the text we tried to mark it in hiding the letter that there is a camp of that, and we need some people that were already dead. But they couldn't understand it. But after half a year, they had decided the whole camp to anihilate. They put them all in the gas chambers, yes. And in this camp also was my son and my wife, and also in this transport. And by...it was in the records, my son at the time he was in infection block in this camp. And in this infection block were already about twenty prisoners from Mengele with the twins who make these experiments, yes. And my son, he was...he called a "pocket schwartze"--black pockets--you know...
Q: Black lungs.
A: ...this un infection, __________, this cough, it was infection. And he was put on this infection block with some others. And the people, they would not believe. If we knew it, or the underground, or on the seventh of September, or seventh March, we got message from family, from women's camp, there was a secretary, a prisoner, who had some phone call from an officer that they should prepare ___________. Look, it means that they should prepare the killing of this whole camp from, the family camp. And we warned them, they would not believe it, they told it's not possible. Eichmann was there three months ago and they educated children, they had a school for children, they was interested in education. They could not believe it. But why believe and they ask me if we should. I came there only on my occupation as a plumber, to repair these kettles.
Q: So you saw your wife.
A: Yes. So with this they didn't knew it, that I have the wife, the SS men, in the camp. But through this...my profession, I could contact my wife and my son. And I arranged, she asked me, when she believed. Helga believed. And there were so many tricks what the SS men made they shouldn't believe that they believe more the SS men than they did us. Yes, I wrote it all, this. And I suceed, managed with a doctor that he gave to my wife injection and he was as some signs of typhoid fever and they took them one, one night before the liquidation of the camp, to this block, to this infirmary, epidemic block 32. And this they couldn't took. Only this best, there were some _______________ so they didn't took this block. So they survived. Unbelievable, yes. I wrote this many, many times. I just wrote I will, maybe I forgot to give it to you, the first time after fifty years, thirty years, I wrote the story about my escape and survival, my son in a special about seventy pages. I will send it to you. So this is the family camp. It was liquidated in one night. It was under commmando. They tried to make a ________, yes, to burn the blocks, it was straw and wood with some fuel, you know, in this lighters, in this fuel, when you have the lighters for cigarette, there is a fuels, some small fuel, ampules (ph), and this we delivered to them from Kanada, many, much, but they didn't believe and they didn't make it, an uprising. So that much details. So, this was the very strong thing. But now, will this sonderkommando, the uprising of this sonderkommando, maybe, and then the escape.
Q: Talk about you know and your escape from the train and your escape from Auschwitz.
A: Yes. So this sonderkommando, I give you a story. The escape. So now it came to the evacuation. We didn't believe and once it was in January, on the second of November, the gassing was stopped. I remember it very good. There was a transport from Slovakia and they was, there were no, they came all to camp, none came to the selection, none came to the gas chambers. And then, they ordered the dismantling and destroying of the gas chambers. Yes, yes.
Q: This is November 1944.
A: 1944. And before, also, there were a huge transport from Hungary. And it was the top of the destruction, they twenty thousand a day, during this Hungarian transport. And this sonderkommando brought about nine hundred people. And they liquidated two hundred and two hundred and for the liquidation. They other three hundred, these sonderkommando knew it and from the despair they made uprising and they killed three SS men, they wounded twelve, but four hundred and fifty were killed and they burned as the cremetorium number four was put in fire and was put out of operation.
Q: You said four of us. You were part of this?
A: What I told for us. No. Look, I was not in this sonderkommando.
Q: No, I didn't think you were. That's why I . .
A: No. We observed this, and I heard it, how, and I believed in the beginning that it was useless, the powder, this _______ this podwer for this, the crash of this when the roof collapsed, when the roof collapsed was so strong that it looked like explosion. But later it turned out it was not, and it is written, this article which I will give you. But now, this destruction. So the cremetoria, this one cremetorium was put out of operations on the 7th of October 1944, from sonderkommando. They proved that it was possible to destroy with own hands and force the killing facilities. But only the destruct (ph) group at Auschwitz, the fighting group of Auschwitz. They promise them help, and they never get help. In the last moment they refused, the Polish. And they told later, it was in a document, they told that we will dare to make an uprising only in the moment when we are in the such stage, endangered as the Jews. Until that moment, the Polish, the non-Jews were not put to the gas chambers from the transport, only when they were ill and. So later, three times they traited, they didn't keep their vow, they didn't help. So, there was one cremetoria was destroyed by prisoners. The two other cremetorias, the SS men, they exploded them. But there still are traces in Auchwitz, yes, you have the gas chambers, and the dismantling rooms, you can see them exactly. And they make a hugh dismantling commando, mainly for women, and they cleaned the bricks, one brick after another, and they put it on the wagons in a very nice manner. Like the German are accustomed. And we, the schlossers, the plumbers, the artists, the commando, this Steimitz, Oberscharführer who were in charge of commando, he asked that we should dismantle this ventilaters, the pieces of the furnaces (ph) and we dismantled it and it was put in conserve with vaseline and put in tight paper nice and put in the wagons. And I asked this Steimitz, I asked him had Herr Oberscharführer, where did you get it. I was good with him, he asked sometimes what will you bring me, so I asked him, the Jews are alredy anhilated, and war will be finished. What will you do with this equipment? And he told me this. I will tell in German, original. I never forget it. ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________. I will translate it for you. "Look, Jew," he told me, "our Führer has a secret weapon. Now it will come over Europe. And then will come the downfall of the Poles and Czechs, and we will finish them quicker than the Jews." So it was on the 26th of December, 1944. I never will forget this moment. Yes. This Steimitz. I later found him...when I identified an SS man, I found him in the SS hospital in Zelek (ph) in Hamburg. So this is the...now the escape, yes. So it...one day, three or four days, it came ordered that they should burn all the documents which were in the blocks, you know--the cards, the names, the list, it was burned. The officers disappeared, the SS officers. There were only the surgeons, and these law officers. And on the 18th of November it was ordered evacuation. So there were still about in, about 50 or 60,000 prisoners in there all, the Auschwitz camps. There were many...39 camps, 39. And we... So I was Birkenau, was about 16,000, yes. First we tried...we had...we organized a nice uh clothes, civilian clothes. And the prisoners want to only for them, and good boots. And so we tried, we would wait when the Russian came, it was before. So we digged near our workshop a hole, and we tried that we will hide, make a hidden entrance. O.K., we tried; we are three or four. But then when the SS men make these empty...the camps, so they came with bloodhounds there. And if they found somebody they shot him on the spot. So we...we... So it is not possible; so we came to this transport. There was about one thousand, always one thousand prisoners, under the guard of these SS men, and we make three days march 'til we came to the station Loslau (ph). And if somebody couldn't go, and was behind, so behind was a special shooting commando, they shot him. And I think about half of the prisoners, still they came from our bach (ph) to Loslau to the station where they put us in open coal trucks. Open coal trucks. They put about more than one hundred in there. We were like sardines. We can only stand, yes. And during the trip, the train was going to Austria, to Mauthausen, through different uh ways. And uh many...there was snow. It was bitter cold and with high snow. And the Poles, the Polish prisoners, they jumped from the train. Yes, from train. It was an open train, but the SS men had a platform on the back, a platform. They had the two wagons, two person wagons, on the platform from planks; and they had lights, reflectors, and they had machine guns...in curves. . many poles jumped in curves and so we came to Austria. The train came through my native land of Czechoslovakia, in the city Ostrava--which I knew very good, coal mines and so on. I known it's not far from my home. So there was a situation that I, the detail I will give you brochure, there was a situation where it was possible to escape, yes The train stopped there, and they make on the sideline a train, yes, it was not free then. And they make a rumor there, the Germans, that the train is bearing the Germans who were bombed from the Allies, and they are telling them they are putting them to death. They would not tell that they are prisoners. And in Ostrava you have, there are some over-the-train bridges, and uh, the population told that there are Germans and they mobilized some Red _______, you know, Red Cross, the charity. And this charity came with two kettles of coffee or something and would help to their own countrymen as they are told that are bombed out, the Germans. And when the prisoners, so these kettles, so they try to jump, and the SS men make a barrier and would not allow the contact that when these charity men, _______ and this, and so when the guard came nearer and nearer, and we also jumped with my son, he was eleven years old, from this, and once I saw there is no SS men. They shrank (ph) together, but they, they prohibit, should prohibit the contact between these prisoners, they would that the prisoners should go back to the, the tracks and they should not make contact with these charity men with these kettles. And when I saw there is nobody, so I run away. It was midnight. There was shooting and so I, I didn't care. We were going, and running and running with my son and so we put off this prisoners' clothes and underneath we have a good civil organized from Kanada, and so it was night, it was curfew, and we, we saw a pit and in this pit there was this colony of miners. Yes, the miner, the miners. And we saw this small, small...
Q: You saw what? I'm sorry.
A: Uh, we saw some small houses. Yes, family houses of miners, and in so was a very light, a very small light...of light. It was...you know. And I dared to knock on the door. There came, and...a woman, and I asked her if we can get some help. And I spoke with the dialect of this country; and my son was there. So he let us inside, and he was a widow and had two sons. They were preparing for a shift to miner to make. So if they believed or not, I don't know; but they asked, I told we were working in Germany, yes, workers. And also my very dear wife, I told my wife was sealed off and we couldn't take her, and _____ is my child, and I will take him to the grandparents which are not far from here, Zarjwa (ph). I knew the whole vicinity, yes. So they were nice to us. We could wash and so. And they, I asked how the train is going there and there, and they gave me a very good advice. But at the time there was mobilized the, the, men, they were digging anti-tank, uh, anti-tank uh graves for...
Q: Did you see them?
A: Yes. And every manpower is very needed. So, and before on the, in the railway station, they were full of pick axes and shovels, so I took a pick axe and shovel and I am going with this train who is going to the Valasske Mezerici village, yes. And I, this was the city, Valasske Mezerici, where I studied.
Q: What is the name of the town?
A: Valasske Mezerici.
Q: O.K.
A: I studied there my high school. So I thought maybe...maybe I will get there. And I came to this city, to this town, yes, so I saw, I have no even idea if I would make this digging, so I need a proof that I am a citizen, and so I have nothing. So I phoned to my friend, to Vsetín, my native, native uh city, where I was native, and before the war I was in connection as I told you to this, to transmit, to help this crossing of the borders, and this man who was enterprise man, and he was also involved in this. But I didn't knew if he was catched or not catched, but nevertheless I knew him. And I checked in the phone book and still his firm was there, yes. So I phoned. And he answered. I told him the slogan, yavor, yavor (ph), was the slogan, yes.
Q: Slogan. O.K.
A: Yes, but he, yavor (ph), yes, but he recognized me on my voice. And he [said], "Erich, you are here? Where are you?" "So in Mezerici (ph)." "I will come on the next train." And he came. With the next train, he gave us money, he gave us these cards for food, yes, rations, cards and he brought _________ with a hiding place, yes, it was a hiding place in mountains. He had some connections. We must, we changed twice or something, but there we survived, also with my son, and I, on this hiding, I started to write on this book, The Death Factory (ph), which was published in '46 in Prague and later translated in many languages, and so on. This was the first book on Auschwitz, with the plan. I started. But later, my friend, Otto Kraus (ph), who also ...who came with this transport to another camp and survived, so we were returned to Auschwitz, to Birkenau. We'd hidden some documents there, digged in, so we found, we gave it to the court, to the Polish court, to the Narodny Nationale (ph) Tribunal (ph). And we were first witness in this court, _________, against this Höss and against forty others , as witnesses. And so from this, we made The Death Factory. And it was the first book...no, later, later. So we survived. So look, so I can give you some bibliography where I wrote most of this.

A: Yes.
Q: One is, could you tell me about Poland after the war? And the second was the trial itself.

When you must known that in '68 I was in danger, when the Prague Spring. Was, you know, the Prague Spring. So I was involved in the Jewish community to educate some Jewish people. They told it is a Zionish conspiracy; and I was...a warrant was against me. I was in danger to be arrested, so I escaped. To Vienna. And I get help from Wiesenthal, in Vienna, from my friend.
