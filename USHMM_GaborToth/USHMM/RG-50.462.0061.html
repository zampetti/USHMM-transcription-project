'</span> <span id="s56">40, '41, with the Hungari-, with the Hungarian, with the occupance; Jews weren't allowed to travel, Jews, weren't allowed to buy, Jews--was very difficult times.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">DK: Your father had his job in 19-...</span></p> <p><span id="s58">LF: My father had the job till 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">DK: How come he, how did he get, oh, because he was working for the Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">LF: Jewish community.</span> <span id="s61">So he really had the job.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">DK: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">LF: And till the last minute.</span> <span id="s64">But then he, even then he was going like in every house.</span> <span id="s65">Secretly he was teaching the children, going like four weeks was in our, one house the school, four weeks in another house was the school.</span> <span id="s66">So he still kept, we kept going.</span> <span id="s67">Times were very difficult, very hard for us.</span> <span id="s68">And then this, we heard that they gonna take the Jews toge-, first of all, in 1941, they took twenty-two people from our family, from my mother's cousins.</span> <span id="s69">And they sent them to Poland.</span> <span id="s70">And we heard from.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">DK: And you knew this?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">LF: And we knew that they sent them to Poland cause we heard, we knew that, we heard that rumors that they killed them.</span> <span id="s73">But we didn't know noth-, excuse me, just rumors.</span> <span id="s74">We didn't know definitely what it was.</span> <span id="s75">And that's how we heard rumors.</span> <span id="s76">Rumors.</span> <span id="s77">That's all we heard.</span> <span id="s78">Until 1944, when the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s79">They sent out an order to round up all the Jews.</span> <span id="s80">It was on a Saturday.</span> <span id="s81">It was after Pesach.</span> <span id="s82">And they rounded, they started to round us up.</span> <span id="s83">And it, for my father, it was very difficult to go.</span> <span id="s84">For all of us, but my father understood the problems where we're going, for what's gonna be.</span> <span id="s85">And he, they locked up the doors.</span> <span id="s86">They put us on wagons.</span> <span id="s87">And my friends stood outside and they smiled when they took us away.</span> <span id="s88">And we left for Auschwitz, my brothers, my sisters, and my father, my mother died when I was seven.</span> <span id="s89">And three days we traveled by trains.</span> <span id="s90">Everybody knows that those roads to Auschwitz were unbelievable.</span> <span id="s91">We used to look out from the window and we said, "The world is so beautiful and we have no place in it..." It was spring, green, everything beautiful.</span> <span id="s92">Everything was in bloom.</span> <span id="s93">And us, the trains took us to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s94">We arrived to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s95">In the train were my, me and my father, my two sisters, my two brothers, an aunt with five children which nobody survived from her, my aunt, my mother's sister.</span> <span id="s96">And cousins.</span> <span id="s97">And we arrived there and some of the little children were screaming.</span> <span id="s98">They were crying.</span> <span id="s99">And they took the children and they threw them to the, to the baggages.</span> <span id="s100">They started to select us.</span> <span id="s101">One of my younger sisters, she was that time fourteen, fifteen years old.</span> <span id="s102">She took the little baby, my cousin, and she wanted to go.</span> <span id="s103">Because they said, the Germans told us that they send them home.</span> <span id="s104">So she took the baby.</span> <span id="s105">She says, "I'm going with the baby home."</span> <span id="s106">And a Jewish man came that he was working there.</span> <span id="s107">He grabbed the baby.</span> <span id="s108">He says, "You can't go!</span> <span id="s109">Go with your sisters."</span> <span id="s110">But by the time she, by the time he told her to go, we left already, so she was already alone.</span> <span id="s111">And they took the baby, and they threw away the baby from her.</span> <span id="s112">And I constantly hear those cries from those babies.</span> <span id="s113">They threw them not even to the mothers, just to the luggage.</span> <span id="s114">We came to Auschwitz, to the baths.</span> <span id="s115">They started to tell us we should undress.</span> <span id="s116">And we said, I said there to the Jewish, there were Jewish men working, "How can we undress?"</span> <span id="s117">He says, "Look, you're not the first one here.</span> <span id="s118">You're not the last one here.</span> <span id="s119">Please, don't get, get yourself into problems they should hate you."</span> <span id="s120">So we said, "Where are our parents?</span> <span id="s121">What's happening to them?"</span> <span id="s122">He says, "Very bad things happened to your parents, very bad things," he says.</span> <span id="s123">"Don't expect that they ever will come out alive."</span> <span id="s124">But it was so impossible to believe that a thing like that should happen.</span> <span id="s125">How could we believe that a thing that they should take our parents and our children and just throw them in the ovens?</span> <span id="s126">It was impossible to believe, and we didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s127">We didn't even believe the man.</span> <span id="s128">We just thought that he is cruel.</span> <span id="s129">He's unsensitive.</span> <span id="s130">We start to, we took off our clothes.</span> <span id="s131">And they stood, the S.S. start to hit us we should go, we should rush.</span> <span id="s132">And we went and they start to shave us, our head.</span> <span id="s133">They shaved a lot of hair.</span> <span id="s134">And it was such a pathetic thing.</span> <span id="s135">One of, to each other, we didn't recognize each other.</span> <span id="s136">We didn't, were in a such terrible, terrible situation that, they chased us out and they left the showers on us.</span> <span id="s137">And the same guy came in.</span> <span id="s138">He says, "You see?"</span> <span id="s139">he says, "You're the lucky ones.</span> <span id="s140">On you water goes.</span> <span id="s141">And your parents gas goes."</span> <span id="s142">And, it was impossible to believe.</span> <span id="s143">We shivered.</span> <span id="s144">We were cold.</span> <span id="s145">We were hungry.</span> <span id="s146">We were, we were just unbelievable, the way we were treated.</span> <span id="s147">They sent us to barracks, from the showers.</span> <span id="s148">They gave us like one dress.</span> <span id="s149">If you were small or big, one size.</span> <span id="s150">And, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s151">We came to the barracks and they ga-, put us ten, twelve in a, in a bunk.</span> <span id="s152">We were so horrified that we were just huddled together in that bunk together.</span> <span id="s153">And we just looked, where we, are we missing somebody?</span> <span id="s154">Who's missing?</span> <span id="s155">Who is here?</span> <span id="s156">One of my cousins was with us, but my sister still wasn't with us.</span> <span id="s157">So we went to look for her, in another bunk.</span> <span id="s158">And we got hit from the Blockältesters we shouldn't go because they're gonna, the Germans are gonna kill us.</span> <span id="s159">Then finally we found my young sister.</span> <span id="s160">And we took her with us.</span> <span id="s161">And the night went through horribly.</span> <span id="s162">When the morning came they gave us something for soup.</span> <span id="s163">And we looked in the soup, and they said, "That's how you have to have.</span> <span id="s164">Everybody has a sip."</span> <span id="s165">We said, "We don't want your soup."</span> <span id="s166">And we threw the soup, and, but, we didn't realize that outside people were waiting already for the soup.</span> <span id="s167">They knew that newcomers come, they wouldn't eat the first soup.</span> <span id="s168">So they were waiting for our soups already.</span> <span id="s169">We were three days in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s170">The third day, they took us back to the baths.</span> <span id="s171">They put us fifty again in those cattle wagons, in the trains, and they shipped us to Plaszow, Krakow.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">DK: Plow-...</span></p> <p><span id="s173">LF: Plaszow.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">DK: P-L-A-S-H-O-V.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">LF: Krakow.</span> <span id="s176">And then, and there, when we came there, the people from that ghetto, it was a ghetto before, it became a camp.</span> <span id="s177">And the people there were the people from Krakow.</span> <span id="s178">When they realized we're coming, we told them we're coming from Auschwitz, they said, "Did you see our children?"</span> <span id="s179">We couldn't, we couldn't be so cruel to tell them.</span> <span id="s180">We said, "No, we didn't see children, but there are some children there."</span> <span id="s181">They said, "Yesterday they took all our children away.</span> <span id="s182">They make place for us, and put the, the children away."</span> <span id="s183">There were still some fifty children left in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">DK: This was in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">LF: In that.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">DK: In Krakow?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">LF: In Krakow.</span> <span id="s188">And they took those, they started to round up the mothers with the children, and they started to take a little way the, take the children away from the parents, and the mothers.</span> <span id="s189">And the S.S. told us, you ma-, you told them that they go to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s190">And it was, it was impossible.</span> <span id="s191">That horror, to see those mothers part with the children.</span> <span id="s192">It was an impossible thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">DK: Why do you think you were not, why do you think you were taken out of Auschwitz and, to Krakow?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">LF: To work.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">DK: To work?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">LF: They had some factories there, and they sent us there to work.</span> <span id="s197">So we worked the factories there, and they were like bakeries and for a.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">DK: What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">LF: I worked outside.</span> <span id="s200">We used to, the first three weeks we were terrible.</span> <span id="s201">They showed us how in a concer-, how in a concentration camp is.</span> <span id="s202">So they took us from one place we should carry lumber.</span> <span id="s203">And they gave like big, big lumber to two girls, sometimes three girls.</span> <span id="s204">My sister was too small, so we always used to take her in the middle.</span> <span id="s205">And the S.S. used to run after us we should carry faster, with dogs.</span> <span id="s206">Some of them, my friends, the dogs were bitten.</span> <span id="s207">They couldn't run fast enough.</span> <span id="s208">The dogs were, used to bite them.</span> <span id="s209">We never got any first aid.</span> <span id="s210">Some of them they took and were, in the hospitals and we never saw them again.</span> <span id="s211">So we.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">DK: Where did you live during this time?</span> <span id="s213">I mean, how did you live, the same way you lived in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">LF: It was barracks.</span> <span id="s215">Barracks, and we also got four, there was, we was working already, so they gave us like four plopped in a bunk, in a bed.</span> <span id="s216">And we were always the three sisters and we had a cousin.</span> <span id="s217">So we tried very hard to keep together.</span> <span id="s218">Because we knew that's our only, my father told us, this was the last thing, "To survive you must be together always."</span> <span id="s219">And we stayed there for three months.</span> <span id="s220">Things were very bad.</span> <span id="s221">But little by little we start to get used to the rough life.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">DK: And you got your one meal a day and...</span></p> <p><span id="s223">LF: And we got, we got our, the food was there terrible.</span> <span id="s224">It was a few men that they just took from the grass and boiled, and gave us the food.</span> <span id="s225">And, it was impossible to eat.</span> <span id="s226">But it was also there the people from Krakow that, that they knew Krakow, and they used to go out to work.</span> <span id="s227">For some reason they always used to bring in something, hide something, and bring in some food.</span> <span id="s228">But not everybody got it.</span> <span id="s229">If one got it, let's say, out of fifty...</span></p> <p><span id="s230">DK: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">LF: It was very, very difficult.</span> <span id="s232">Then in September, September they took us back again.</span> <span id="s233">They got us back together and back to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s234">That time we were sure that this is it.</span> <span id="s235">To Krakow we came three hours.</span> <span id="s236">To Auschwitz we went around.</span> <span id="s237">They bombed the rails so they couldn't, took us four days to go back.</span> <span id="s238">They put 150 together in one, in one wagon.</span> <span id="s239">We arrived maybe sixty.</span> <span id="s240">The rest of them they just passed out and died.</span> <span id="s241">There was no air.</span> <span id="s242">There was no food.</span> <span id="s243">It was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s244">And when we came out from the, in Auschwitz there was like ditches and the people ran to those ditches for water.</span> <span id="s245">And the S.S. stayed and shoot them down just like--so we came back to that, to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s246">And finally they took us.</span> <span id="s247">Now we were sure we're going to the, they told us to undress, we should.</span> <span id="s248">And we were near the baths, so we knew if, we thought, we're not undressed near the baths then they take us to the crematoriums.</span> <span id="s249">We were sitting all night, and, outside, was September.</span> <span id="s250">Later, they took our clothes away.</span> <span id="s251">We were together, trying to stick together, to warm.</span> <span id="s252">And every time somebody else was on the outside and we were, and they couldn't, they couldn't do nothing because they had two, a few transports arrived from Lodz.</span> <span id="s253">And there was not even a selection.</span> <span id="s254">They took them straight to the crematoriums.</span> <span id="s255">So they...</span></p> <p><span id="s256">DK: When was this about?</span> <span id="s257">What...</span></p> <p><span id="s258">LF: That was in September, September, in '44.</span> <span id="s259">So they arrived, they didn't even select them.</span> <span id="s260">They took them straight, women and children, straight to the crematoriums.</span> <span id="s261">So us they left for another night.</span> <span id="s262">And came in the morning, so they took us to the barracks.</span> <span id="s263">They gave us baths.</span> <span id="s264">They took us again to the barracks.</span> <span id="s265">So we were safe again.</span> <span id="s266">And when we came in the barracks, there was a woman, and she had a mother who went, who went in 1941 away.</span> <span id="s267">She was in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s268">And somebody found out that she is working outside.</span> <span id="s269">And she came and it was a, the reunion that night with the mother and daughter.</span> <span id="s270">They didn't see each other for three years, to '41.</span> <span id="s271">And she told us, "You are really safe this, tonight.</span> <span id="s272">I'm staying here, but you're going all away.</span> <span id="s273">You're gonna be selected to a transport to, you're going to work.</span> <span id="s274">So you are very lucky."</span> <span id="s275">We stayed there three weeks in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s276">And after three weeks, she told us the right thing.</span> <span id="s277">There was a selection.</span> <span id="s278">They selected 400 girls, the healthiest girls, and they send us to a, in a transport to Neustadt.</span> <span id="s279">[pause]</span></p> <p><span id="s280">DK: N-E-[unclear]-A-D-T, S-T-A-D-T...</span></p> <p><span id="s281">LF: N-...</span></p> <p><span id="s282">DK: N-E-U-S-T-A-D-T.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">LF: Then in Neustadt there was a factory when we arrived...</span></p> <p><span id="s284">DK: Was that a camp or was that a ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">LF: It wasn't a camp, it wasn't a, it was in town.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">DK: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">LF: But they put the barber [barbed] wire.</span> <span id="s288">It was, before we came there were soldiers there.</span> <span id="s289">P-W...</span></p> <p><span id="s290">DK: POW [Prisoners of War]?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">LF: POWs.</span> <span id="s292">And when we came, they took out the POWs.</span> <span id="s293">I don't know where, but they made room for us to, we should go to work.</span> <span id="s294">They put barber [barbed] wire around the place, and we started to work there.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">DK: What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">LF: We were Weberei we were weaving.</span> <span id="s297">We were making linen.</span> <span id="s298">We were making, and it was very, very, the bad; this was not a very bad time for us because we, they gave us more food.</span> <span id="s299">We worked with, more between civilian people.</span> <span id="s300">But that was for September through January.</span> <span id="s301">January the 20th, the front came nearer, and they again took us on the road.</span> <span id="s302">They rounded us up and back, back on the road.</span> <span id="s303">And between those 400 girls, two managed to came without hands.</span> <span id="s304">There was a selection.</span> <span id="s305">They selected us naked.</span> <span id="s306">We were naked.</span> <span id="s307">We were, they looked eyes and hands.</span> <span id="s308">How, we never knew how they survi-, how they were s-, how they escaped, the two.</span> <span id="s309">One was missing three fingers and one was missing a whole, the whole wrist.</span> <span id="s310">So they came and they right away told, the survivor was very, very important.</span> <span id="s311">So they told us that those two girls must go back to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s312">But one of them were three sisters.</span> <span id="s313">So she came to me.</span> <span id="s314">She says, "You're in charge here in the 400 girls.</span> <span id="s315">You must go ask the German that my sister should be saved."</span> <span id="s316">I didn't know how to do it.</span> <span id="s317">I wasn't the type I should do it.</span> <span id="s318">I couldn't go, but my, but to see my friend pleads with me so, I said, "I am nothing.</span> <span id="s319">I must try."</span> <span id="s320">When I came, the first thing he did, he beat me up.</span> <span id="s321">I told him, "She could do, clean the barracks.</span> <span id="s322">She could clean the toilets.</span> <span id="s323">Please, let, if she's not gonna be good, then, then I'll help her."</span> <span id="s324">He says, "If she's not gonna be good then you go to Auschwitz."</span> <span id="s325">And she stayed, and she, thank God, survived.</span> <span id="s326">And she is a wonderful mother of three children and she lives in Pittsburgh.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">DK: When you said that you were in charge of the women, what did, what does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">LF: I was in charge that when the girls got up in the morning, I was in charge that before we went to work, they should get ready, they should get themselves cleaned up and get ready to go to work.</span> <span id="s329">And by the way, after we were liberated, this is, I want to say that specially because I think it's important.</span> <span id="s330">Because the Blockältesters didn't have good names.</span> <span id="s331">Those people didn't have very good names, and--because it was very difficult to satisfy so many people.</span> <span id="s332">But, after we were liberated, we came to Bergen-Belsen, and the girls wanted I should continue to be in charge with them, after the liberation.</span> <span id="s333">So, so I tried very hard that they should, I knew that, that we are all victims there.</span> <span id="s334">So we, they took us from Oberschlesien, in Neustadt, and we went through Breslau.</span> <span id="s335">We were bombed.</span> <span id="s336">In Weimar we were bombed on the station.</span> <span id="s337">And it was the most horr-, we always used to say, [pause; mumbling] we always used to say, "They should do something.</span> <span id="s338">They should bomb the camps.</span> <span id="s339">They should bomb."</span> <span id="s340">We didn't care.</span> <span id="s341">But with that, that experience made us see that how the, the bombing, what it did to people.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">DK: Were you all by tra-, how did you get from Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">LF: That time we were on the trains.</span> <span id="s344">From Auschwitz to Neustadt we went by train.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">DK: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">LF: But from Neustadt, we went by foot.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">DK: Foot.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">LF: Till another camp, Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s349">And there they took, put us back on the train, and they, to Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">DK: And this, and you had worked in the camps as, y-, when you were in Mauthausen, did you work?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">LF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">DK: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">LF: We didn't work already, because we were already so sick and so weak that nobody could work anymore and...</span></p> <p><span id="s354">DK: But they didn't extermi-, they just kept moving you...</span></p> <p><span id="s355">LF: They kept moving us.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">DK: This now is the end of the war, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">LF: That was the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">DK: This was now...</span></p> <p><span id="s359">LF: This was already, in January, this was already February.</span> <span id="s360">We marched already to Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">DK: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">LF: But in Weimar they bombed us, and a lot of the girls, the trains just turned over like matchboxes.</span> <span id="s363">Girls were without hands, without feet.</span> <span id="s364">The bombs, and, and the Germans, when they came back, we pleaded with them, "Give, give us some kind of help here."</span> <span id="s365">This is a few friends that were do that.</span> <span id="s366">So girls took the skirts and then we tried to, to help each other.</span> <span id="s367">But most of them didn't even make it the first day, because there was no first aid for them and they just didn't make it.</span> <span id="s368">And we went back.</span> <span id="s369">I got that time very sick.</span> <span id="s370">I had pneumonia.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">DK: Tell that story that you told me about the, the two trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">LF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s373">We were in Weimar two trains, a train with men, and a train with women.</span> <span id="s374">But we didn't know of the men; the men didn't know of us.</span> <span id="s375">Then after the bombing, so many were killed, but even more from the men than from the women.</span> <span id="s376">Then they made one train.</span> <span id="s377">They lunged [she seems to mean "linked"] together the two, from the two trains they made one train.</span> <span id="s378">And in that one train, for some reason, we didn't know how, we don't know how it happened, but we heard that there is a man, a doctor there, and he's helping around for the sick people there.</span> <span id="s379">And they, and between was a nurse.</span> <span id="s380">And the nurse tried also to help.</span> <span id="s381">And they got together, and they were separated three years, man and wife, and in that train they got back together.</span> <span id="s382">Just by, I don't know how, how can, a few things happened that we don't know how, how things, you know, things happen.</span> <span id="s383">So they got back together for that night.</span> <span id="s384">I don't know.</span> <span id="s385">We were separated again.</span> <span id="s386">I don't know if they ever, if they survived, and I don't know if they, if they were brought back together after the war.</span> <span id="s387">But at that night, they got back together.</span> <span id="s388">And until Bergen-Belsen, they traveled together.</span> <span id="s389">And we came to Bergen-Belsen, three sisters, and my cousin.</span> <span id="s390">And my cousin got very sick.</span> <span id="s391">And I, and I ask her, "What's gonna be now?"</span> <span id="s392">She was always a very good student, a bright girl.</span> <span id="s393">She says to me, "From here definitely we're not going no place.</span> <span id="s394">Either we get liberated, or we get killed.</span> <span id="s395">We don't go no place."</span> <span id="s396">And I lost quite a few close friends on the way to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s397">We came there, and there, every day we had to stay with, Ten and seven, sixty to seventy girls in a room.</span> <span id="s398">So there was no place just to sit on the, you just were, was just sitting on the floor.</span> <span id="s399">Mornings they took us out, and at night they gave, took us back.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">DK: What did you...</span></p> <p><span id="s401">LF: And nothing, all day, nothing.</span> <span id="s402">We just heard the bombs and we were just, we were like, felt that we are in the middle of, of everything.</span> <span id="s403">And it was...</span></p> <p><span id="s404">DK: [not sure this is DK:] We have to realize that it was also winter.</span> <span id="s405">It was still winter in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">LF: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">DK: And it was very cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">LF: It was very, very cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">DK: And they were undernourished, and underfed and no coats.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">LF: No coats.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">DK: [unclear] and no [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s412">LF: And we were sitting in there in the rooms.</span> <span id="s413">And every time they took out, they took us out, they counted us, the dead, and always, they counted that they should be able to bring in more, more people.</span> <span id="s414">The dead they didn't even carry out.</span> <span id="s415">It was called a death camp, Bergen-Belsen, where we were.</span> <span id="s416">They didn't even carry them out, just to one, one side they pushed them away.</span> <span id="s417">There was always new stories.</span> <span id="s418">We gonna be liberated.</span> <span id="s419">We're gonna be exchanged.</span> <span id="s420">We gonna be this.</span> <span id="s421">All these new stories.</span> <span id="s422">But at the time, we were already, or, bringing always new girls we were always less, less in the room.</span> <span id="s423">And my cousin was already such in bad shape that she didn't even breathe any, hardly breathed any more.</span> <span id="s424">And then somebody came, they wanted to take her out.</span> <span id="s425">I says, "Until she breathes, nobody takes her out."</span> <span id="s426">And we were hoping every day something will happen, but, and the first time in my life I resigned that, that we're dying, that we're never gonna be liberated.</span> <span id="s427">And one day they came and they took me out to work, they started to scream we should go out to work.</span> <span id="s428">But they knew that we cannot work any more.</span> <span id="s429">So they took me, they took me in a place, to bring clothes, to take clothes from one room to another room.</span> <span id="s430">I came in that room, and when I took clothes, between the clothes were dead babies.</span> <span id="s431">[weeping] And that shook me up more than anything.</span> <span id="s432">I took my head, my head against the wall.</span> <span id="s433">I says, "Dear God, are we the Chosen People from that?"</span> <span id="s434">That never left me.</span> <span id="s435">And that was time--[weeping] that was the time, maybe about a week, or two before the Liberation.</span> <span id="s436">When I came back, and I was so horrified from that experience.</span> <span id="s437">I came to my sisters.</span> <span id="s438">They said, "What happened to you?"</span> <span id="s439">I didn't want to tell them what happened, because I was afraid that, they are so sick themselves, they are so weak, they are, we all had typhus, we were infested with lice, we were, we were just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s440">And about a week later, we couldn't even walk any more, nobody in the room.</span> <span id="s441">We were, remained maybe eight from the girls.</span> <span id="s442">But we walked in and they always had new in the room.</span> <span id="s443">And between the eight we were still the three sisters and a cousin.</span> <span id="s444">And definitely we would have never been if we wouldn't be together.</span> <span id="s445">One struggled for the other.</span> <span id="s446">If one was sick, the other ones watched over.</span> <span id="s447">If one, we were kept together always.</span> <span id="s448">Then, April the 15th we got up in the morning.</span> <span id="s449">It was a beautiful day, I'm always telling my daughter, my children.</span> <span id="s450">It was a beautiful day.</span> <span id="s451">And we got up in the morning.</span> <span id="s452">And it was so quiet.</span> <span id="s453">We didn't hear the bullets.</span> <span id="s454">We didn't hear nothing.</span> <span id="s455">We heard, like once in a while a big bang, but it stopped.</span> <span id="s456">But we heard in the men's camp, was a little further, and we heard the men's camp, they're screaming, they're yelling, they--that camp was already liberated during the night.</span> <span id="s457">But we didn't know why they're screaming.</span> <span id="s458">We didn't know if they kill, we didn’t know what happens to them.</span> <span id="s459">But nine o'clock in the morning a tank rode in, in the camp.</span> <span id="s460">They said, they announced, the English Second Army, "Ladies and Gentlemen, you are liberated."</span> <span id="s461">When he said, "Ladies and Gentlemen," who talks to us like that?</span> <span id="s462">We definitely couldn't go meet our liberators.</span> <span id="s463">We were too sick.</span> <span id="s464">But they came to see us.</span> <span id="s465">[weeping] They didn't see a very pretty scene.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s467">LF: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">DK: What did that mean?</span> <span id="s469">You were so sick, you were so very sick...</span></p> <p><span id="s470">LF: Now we got a, very sick.</span> <span id="s471">We were liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">DK: You had, you still had your cousin and your sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">LF: Still, still, yeah.</span> <span id="s474">We still were together.</span> <span id="s475">And they started to come to tell us, and we still were losing people.</span> <span id="s476">This, they took us, they took a, they start to come and to tell us that the front is still on, and there's nothing they can do for us but bring us some food the best they can.</span> <span id="s477">I was just telling, they brought, used to bring us a, like a, how do you call a, a, something, it's a yellow, like, it's a, like a, oh, I, I don't know.</span> <span id="s478">It's a big yellow thing, you know, like a potato, but it's yellow, big.</span> <span id="s479">It's not a sweet potato.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">DK: Squash?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">LF: It's not even a squash.</span> <span id="s482">Something like a squash.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">DK: Like--yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">LF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">DK: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">LF: But, we couldn't open it.</span> <span id="s487">We didn't know what it is.</span> <span id="s488">We couldn't eat it, so the girls were sitting on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">DK: [laughs]</span></p> <p><span id="s490">LF: Because was, the floor was very cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">DK: It was frozen, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">LF: So, we really did the best we could.</span> <span id="s493">They brought us some broccoli, they brought us some food.</span> <span id="s494">Then, then there was even more problems.</span> <span id="s495">Whatever we ate, didn't agree with us, and we got sick all.</span> <span id="s496">And they start to take us out on, to the Ber-, to the men's camp from Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s497">In that camp where the men are, and they made hospitals, and they start, they start to taking us out little by little from there.</span> <span id="s498">Because they saw that they were losing, they lost about 10,000 girls after the Liberation in a short time.</span> <span id="s499">So, we, they took us out there.</span> <span id="s500">And there little by little they start in the hospitals to feed us.</span> <span id="s501">With, there came doctors from Sweden, from all over, and they start little by little to nourish us back to, to health.</span> <span id="s502">But that was a long, a long way, a long road.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">DK: How long did it take, approximately?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">LF: Oh, about two, three months until we could walk a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">DK: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">LF: Until our hair started a little bit to grow.</span> <span id="s507">We had no hair.</span> <span id="s508">Our hair came out from the typhus.</span> <span id="s509">So our hair started to grow a little bit and we started to, to walk around a little bit.</span> <span id="s510">So a little bit, our skin, our thing was peeling.</span> <span id="s511">It was really, it was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s512">We were, well, they gave us vitamins...</span></p> <p><span id="s513">MR: They also, you told about the bread that they gave you bef-, right before you were liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">LF: Right.</span> <span id="s515">Then they found out.</span> <span id="s516">I mean, that's, when they found out that two days before we were liberated that they started to give us poisoned bread.</span> <span id="s517">Not to kill us.</span> <span id="s518">They couldn't kill us otherwise or before it, it got, we shouldn't get liberated.</span> <span id="s519">So they gave us, they put poison in the, they were feeding us with the, they give us a piece of bread once a day and it was poi-, they found poison in the bread.</span> <span id="s520">And that's, I mean, that's what they found out.</span> <span id="s521">And it was, it took us a quite a while until, it took us, it took me three years to come out of Germany.</span> <span id="s522">Because no country really wanted us, until in 1948 America, thank God, accepted us, and we came.</span> <span id="s523">And we had three children, my husband and I, wonderful children.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">DK: Is your husband, was...</span></p> <p><span id="s525">LF: Also a survivor.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">DK: Oh, a survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">LF: Also a survivor.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">DK: Where did you meet him?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">LF: We met there in the...</span></p> <p><span id="s530">DK: In Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">LF: After the Liberation, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">DK: Where did you live, after you...</span></p> <p><span id="s533">LF: In Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s534">He was in Bergen-Belsen and I was.</span> <span id="s535">So we met there.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">DK: Oh my God.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">LF: And we got liberated.</span> <span id="s538">After the Liberation, and we have wonderful children, thank God, and they are my pride and joys of my future.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">DK: Now...</span></p> <p><span id="s540">LF: Mary was born there.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">DK: Miriam is your daughter who is joining you today on this, doing this with the tape recording.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">LF: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">DK: And you were born in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">MIR: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">DK: Ah, and in 19-...</span></p> <p><span id="s546">MIR: '47.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">LF: '47.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">DK: And what, year c-, and when did you come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">LF: In March '48 we came.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">DK: So you don't remember anything of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">MIR: No, I do not.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">DK: Did, and you, did your mother speak, and your father, speak often of their experiences in the camps or, when was your first knowledge that they were survivors, and their experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">MIR: I don't remember ever not knowing this.</span> <span id="s554">I knew about it, but it was a very cursory kind of knowledge, and, as a child, I was never allowed to read about anything that had to do with the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">DK: Miriam, was that to prote-, I mean, Miriam.</span> <span id="s556">Lilly, was that to protect Miriam, or was that because you could not talk about it yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">LF: Both, I, first of all, maybe to protect her.</span> <span id="s558">Also, I didn't want she should hate as much.</span> <span id="s559">She shouldn't hate what happened to us, and maybe when she gonna be older, she will be able to understand certain things, and to protect her from the evil what I went through.</span> <span id="s560">But also maybe, I thought that maybe the next generation will be in a different position than we, the survivors.</span> <span id="s561">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">DK: You seem very verbal now.</span> <span id="s563">Did you, when.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">MIR: That was, that happened over the years.</span> <span id="s565">I think when things, publications started coming out denying the Holocaust existence, I think my mother and her sisters realized, that, unless they who actually experienced it, were willing to be able to tell this story, and, of course, as my brothers and I went to school and learned more about it, we prompted them to, to speak more about it, and make themselves more open to talking about it, because otherwise we could not tell anybody what happened during the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s566">We were not there.</span> <span id="s567">As they're getting older, there are less and less eye witnesses to the atrocities that occurred.</span> <span id="s568">And up until that time, I think the earlier books that were written about the Holocaust that I had seen, never really depicted quite the severity of the actual living conditions that the people had to exist with.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">DK: Lilly, in your, when your family, when you were in Czechoslovakia, and you were talking about that you were religious, or, you know, and your way of life, are you as religious as your parents were?</span> <span id="s570">Less religious now?</span> <span id="s571">Are you, do you keep kosher?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">LF: I keep a kosher home.</span> <span id="s573">I am religious.</span> <span id="s574">I am Shomer Shabbas.</span> <span id="s575">That means that I observe Shabbas.</span> <span id="s576">My daughter is even more.</span> <span id="s577">Thank God for that.</span> <span id="s578">She's better than I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">MIR: [chuckling] [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s580">LF: She's better than I am.</span> <span id="s581">But I'm Shomer Shabbas.</span> <span id="s582">My boys, my children went to yeshivah.</span> <span id="s583">I wanted they should learn everything.</span> <span id="s584">And, my sons are not observant.</span> <span id="s585">They are wonderful people.</span> <span id="s586">They are educated people.</span> <span id="s587">If they want to be religious, they know how.</span> <span id="s588">I'm not telling them what to do.</span> <span id="s589">I would, they would make me very proud they should be religious.</span> <span id="s590">I would love them, but they're not less.</span> <span id="s591">They're not boys.</span> <span id="s592">They're not religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">DK: If you, there was something that, on this tape that you would like to tell your great grandchildren, is there anything, through your experiences, that you would like to leave them with, that you would like them to learn from your knowledge?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">LF: I would like my great grandchildren should know what a great past they have.</span> <span id="s595">Even it's not present, they don't have it, there is nothing left from my past.</span> <span id="s596">When I was liberated, that's when my life started.</span> <span id="s597">But I would like that they should know their glorious past.</span> <span id="s598">From the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s599">This is what I would like my great grandchildren should have...</span></p> <p><span id="s600">MIR: We, none of us have any tangible roots that we can, we don't have photographs of our grandparents.</span> <span id="s601">Our heritage, our tangible heritage starts, started from when our parents were liberated.</span> <span id="s602">Anything else is, is only from what our parents tell us.</span> <span id="s603">That's why it's so important for us to keep on talking to our parents, to find out, you know, our roots are, are only what we know from our parents, what our parents tell us.</span> <span id="s604">We don't have any, anything tangible.</span> <span id="s605">We never grew up with grandparents.</span> <span id="s606">We never grew up with great grandparents.</span> <span id="s607">We have a difficult time dealing with and accepting deaths, I think, because we don't know what it is to be around old people.</span> <span id="s608">My parents are in their early sixties.</span> <span id="s609">They're the oldest people I know!</span> <span id="s610">Nobody survived that was older.</span> <span id="s611">We never lived with the normal life cycle of great grandparents that might have died when we were younger.</span> <span id="s612">The thought, when I go to a funeral now, is panic, panic, not because of the people who died at the funeral, but just because I can't deal with the fact that people close to me are getting older.</span> <span id="s613">So many things.</span> <span id="s614">All the stories about the starvation, not only when they were in concentration camp, but during their occupation.</span> <span id="s615">I mean you could go I think into any second generation Holocaust survivor's house and find, I know in my house, you could feed 100 people with what I have in my house on any given day!</span> <span id="s616">I don't ever want to starve, like my mother starved, and my father did.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">DK: How do you, let me ask Lilly first, and then I'd be interested...</span></p> <p><span id="s618">MIR: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">DK: How do you feel about non-Jews?</span> <span id="s620">How do you feel tow-, or, do you have a fear because your children live in a world of non-Jews?</span> <span id="s621">Do you trust non-, I mean, is there a..</span> <span id="s622">.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">LF: I, I feel very good in the United States, let's say, with the people that we know.</span> <span id="s624">But in back of my mind, I always have that fear that, and I always tell that my children, that this is very hard for me to accept, to be friendly with non-Jewish people.</span> <span id="s625">And I have wonderful people that I am in business with, and that I'm friends with.</span> <span id="s626">But, for some reason in my back mind, I always say, I had such a wonderful friends before when I was young.</span> <span id="s627">And they deserted me.</span> <span id="s628">And they, it was an unbelievable thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">DK: Nobody offered to help?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">LF: Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">DK: Never that you knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">LF: No, never, not to help.</span> <span id="s633">But we were afraid, because they threaten us that we, they gonna gave us, give us over to the, to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s634">And I, and this, this I al-, I will, I would like to hope that this will never happen again.</span> <span id="s635">But when I was liberated and when I saw what the people of Denmark did, and what other people did, that there were the righteous people who they risked their lives, and I met those people, then I said, "It cannot be that, I have to get rid of that, of that [unclear] to me and to, to trust people again."</span> <span id="s636">But, we have to learn how to trust.</span> <span id="s637">We have to learn how to laugh.</span> <span id="s638">We have to learn how to start to live a life with normal people.</span> <span id="s639">How could one go from a concentration camp to live a normal life?</span> <span id="s640">It was an effort, the courage to bring children to this world, an obligation, because we lost a million children.</span> <span id="s641">And if I am not gonna have a child, the Jewish people are, are finished.</span> <span id="s642">It was, they put on me an obligation.</span> <span id="s643">I have to have children.</span> <span id="s644">And it was that, that, that conscious, that, to live, that to live, that I, that I survived.</span> <span id="s645">And there must be a reason for why I, why I survived.</span> <span id="s646">And I have to learn to live and to laugh, and that was not an easy thing for a survivor to do.</span> <span id="s647">It was very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">DK: Did you share all these things with your, you were lucky that you had to share them with your husband, that the two of you shared experiences.</span> <span id="s649">I don't mean the same experiences...</span></p> <p><span id="s650">LF: I think that I am better in those things than my husband.</span> <span id="s651">My husband cannot watch a movie from the war, especially recently about surgery.</span> <span id="s652">He cannot look at pictures.</span> <span id="s653">He lost his parents and his sist-, five sisters and brothers.</span> <span id="s654">And for him it's very difficult.</span> <span id="s655">He cannot come to this Gathering to tell, it's a very difficult time for him.</span> <span id="s656">So, I'm even better than he is.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">DK: But your sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">LF: My sisters, I, I, we have problems, but my sister what she was here in the United States she...</span></p> <p><span id="s659">MIR: She has a lot of problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">LF: In a way I feel, in a way I feel that she is guilty that she wasn't with us...</span></p> <p><span id="s661">DK: Well wait, where...</span></p> <p><span id="s662">LF: That she left us.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">DK: Where is your sister now?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">LF: She's here.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">DK: Oh, she's here.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">LF: She's here, she's here.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">DK: I mean that's your older one, the one that got out before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">LF: That's my older one, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">DK: What about your other sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">LF: They're here too.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">MIR: They're here.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">LF: They're all four here.</span> <span id="s673">Yeah, they're all four here.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">MIR: I have four, I'm very lucky.</span> <span id="s675">We have four, I have four mommies!</span></p> <p><span id="s676">DK: Oh, that's wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">LF: And I want you to know that we went away this Pesach.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">MIR: We're going every year.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">LF: [unclear] Four sisters and their children and their grandchildren.</span> <span id="s680">And this is our biggest joy, when we see...</span></p> <p><span id="s681">MIR: Sixty people that go away together for a whole week, and we have a wonderful time!</span></p> <p><span id="s682">LF: So we were very...</span></p> <p><span id="s683">DK: You were very lucky.</span> <span id="s684">You really are.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">LF: We are very lucky people.</span> <span id="s686">And we hope that...</span></p> <p><span id="s687">DK: Your sisters are married and they have children also?</span> <span id="s688">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s689">LF: Thank God.</span> <span id="s690">They all have children.</span> <span id="s691">And I want...</span></p> <p><span id="s692">DK: Did their children have children?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">LF: And we raised them, and I want you to know that they are all college graduates, doctors, dentists.</span> <span id="s694">They are really, really unbelievable ken ayn horah psychologists.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">MIR: [chuckling]</span></p> <p><span id="s696">LF: They are really...</span></p> <p><span id="s697">DK: So how did you remain so normal?</span></p> <p><span id="s698">LF: I'm not always normal!</span></p> <p><span id="s699">MIR: [laughing]</span></p> <p><span id="s700">DK: None of us are.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">LF: Thank you.</span> <span id="s702">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">DK: But you're warm, and you're loving.</span> <span id="s704">And this is something that's very, very obvious.</span> <span id="s705">And you've got a loving daughter and a very committed daughter to her Judaism.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">MIR: I think a lot of the credit, from what my mother tells me, for that, goes to my grandfather, who raised a family in a very difficult time, in a very difficult place, as a widower, a young widower who was left with seven children.</span> <span id="s707">And very little foo-, very little with which to give them material things.</span> <span id="s708">But he gave them a wonderful love of life and of people, and of their religion, and it, a very deep belief and commitment to one another.</span> <span id="s709">And I think that that belief and commitment is transferred, hopefully, from our parents to us, and I hope that we can give that same depth of feeling to our children.</span> <span id="s710">The important things in life to my grandfather were not the money that he could earn, but the fact that he knew he had to be home with his children every day.</span> <span id="s711">He used to hold them in his lap and tell them stories.</span> <span id="s712">And he raised them as a father and a mother, because my mother was one of the oldest, and she was only about nine or eleven when her mother died.</span> <span id="s713">And I think a lot of the normalcy comes from him.</span> <span id="s714">Of course, I think they're, all the sisters have some things that are, physically they were all damaged by the war.</span> <span id="s715">Emotionally...</span></p> <p><span id="s716">LF: Not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">MIR: Also, they're very emotional people.</span> <span id="s718">A lot of times they can't cope with it.</span> <span id="s719">Their nerves are shot.</span> <span id="s720">But they love us, and we love them back.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">DK: It's hard, when your daughter can say that, it's hard to follow, it's a hard act to follow.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">MIR: [chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s723">LF: I think they owe their grandfather very much.</span> <span id="s724">One of my nieces, that wrote her thesis, she came home and she said to her mother, "Mommie, do you want to see to whom I..</span> <span id="s725">.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">MIR: Dedicated?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">LF: Dedicated the thesis?"</span> <span id="s728">She thought to a professor, to her, maybe to, she says, "No, to my grandfather.</span> <span id="s729">Because I think, we always heard about my grandfather.</span> <span id="s730">And, and I drew this, the strength, from you, from my grandfather, and that's why I dedicated my thesis to him."</span> <span id="s731">My sister cried.</span> <span id="s732">She says, "You never could give me something better in my life than that."</span> <span id="s733">So we are a very devoted family, and we would love to see a better world for our children.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">DK: Halevai.</span> <span id="s735">Lilly, thank you.</span></p></body></html>
