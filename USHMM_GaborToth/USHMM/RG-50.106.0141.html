Please give us your full name.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Answer: I am Kurt w for Walter Roberg, r-o-b-e-r-g, and I l – am a resident – I’m a citizen of the United States and a resident of Tenafly, New Jersey.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: And where were you born, and when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: I was born in Germany in a town called Celle, which is the German pronunciation, spelled c-e- double l-e, near Hannover in northern Germany, on May 16th, 1924.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Now let’s talk a little bit about your family.</span> <span id="s17">How far back can you trace the generations in this area of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: Well, that’s a very interesting question and I will illustrate it by, well, telling you what happened to me.</span> <span id="s19">I – I went to a German school, as a matter of fact I was the only – during Hitler time already, from 1934 to 1938 to Kristallnacht, I was the only Jewish student in a s – s – student body of about 280 in a high school that was a [indecipherable] gymnasium.</span> <span id="s20">One of the assignments we had – now thas – this was about 1936, and Germany of course was very, a-as we would say, a – a roots – you know, tracing your roots.</span> <span id="s21">They were interested in genealogy.</span> <span id="s22">So one of our assignments in social studies was to trace our ancestry.</span> <span id="s23">How was I gonna trace my ancestry?</span> <span id="s24">My – I – ma – my mother contacted her sister, a maiden sister who lived with my – in my mother’s home village, and contacted my father’s maiden sister, who lived in my father’s home village, and they both yeah, tried to do – trace our history.</span> <span id="s25">And Martha, which was the Roberg side of the family, got as far as great-grandfather, didn’t get very far.</span> <span id="s26">And Aunt Babette(ph) of the Marx family, my mother’s family near – in a village called Byetahl(ph) near Heidelberg was much more successful.</span> <span id="s27">She first traced the history back to 1871, which was written up in the local – what do we call it in German?</span> <span id="s28">Standes amt, the local village registry.</span> <span id="s29">Prior to that, all births and deaths were, even of the Jewish community were inter – entered in the church registry of the Catholic church.</span> <span id="s30">So she went to the priest and he, as a favor, for 10 mark or so, wrote out our whole genealogy and we were able to trace the f – Marx family back to 1741.</span> <span id="s31">So I drew up a family tree based on this information.</span> <span id="s32">This took about oh, a couple of months to get that all written out by hand, turning the pages in the book and it became a matter of fascination for the priest himself.</span> <span id="s33">And I drew a – a family tree, and I turned it in and it turned out that Roberg, the only Jew in the class, could trace his ancestry in Germany back further than my 29 Christian stu – fellow students.</span> <span id="s34">And my teacher, who was very s-supportive, and nya – he was not a Nazi by any means, he made a point of it, to – yeah, tell the class that Roberg could trace his ancestry back further than any of the German boys.</span> <span id="s35">So it’s a longwinded answer to your very brief question.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: But a very interesting answer.</span> <span id="s37">Tell me your father’s name and his occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: My father’s name was Victor and he was a merchant, a m – well, by – by trade in dry goods, soft goods.</span> <span id="s39">We owned a little store, he had learned a trade at age 14, he served an apprenticeship, he learned a business and then he was a – a journeyman, a salesman and then a traveling salesman for a Jewish firm.</span> <span id="s40">There – he was – Jews at that time were employed by other Jews.</span> <span id="s41">It was unusual, I guess, to be employed by a Gentile firm.</span> <span id="s42">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: What was the name of the firm he worked for?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: In Celle, it was Gebrüder Freidberg.</span> <span id="s45">That’s Freidberg Brothers, f-r-e-i-d-b-e-r-g, Freidberg Brothers and they owned a department store in Celle and he came there, I guess, about 1904 or thereabouts, and he worked there through the war.</span> <span id="s46">My father was very nearsighted and was unfit for military duty, so – and – and right after World War I, he went into his own business across the street from Freidberg’s, set up a cint – competition, and ma – then the inflation came, and he strubbled – struggled, he wasn’t a particularly successful businessman, but – and it was a – it was a struggle.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Did your mother work?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Yes, my mother.</span> <span id="s49">My parents got married in 1921 and my mother, of course, came into the business.</span> <span id="s50">She had some sort of a dowry, which in those days was expected.</span> <span id="s51">I think it was a marriage that was arranged.</span> <span id="s52">I’m not sure, but I think it was through the newspaper, which was the customary way, rather than shotgun.</span> <span id="s53">And so that was the then modern way.</span> <span id="s54">There was the – a newspaper, Jewish paper called Jüdische Familienblatt, the Jewish Family paper, and there were marriage proposals or whatever and as we have today in some of the better United States papers, started from “The Village Voice” on.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: My mother’s name was Selma, but she was called Frieda.</span> <span id="s57">That’s another story, but I won’t go into that now, and her maiden name was Marx, m-a-r-x.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Did you have any siblings?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Yes, I have a – an older brother, Harry.</span> <span id="s60">He was Hans, Hans Werner, and I was called Walter.</span> <span id="s61">And he was called Hans and I was called Kurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: And ha – what’s the difference in age?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: He’s two and a half years older.</span> <span id="s64">He was then, and still is.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Did you have a large extended family in the town?</span> <span id="s66">Aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: On my mother’s side there was a large family.</span> <span id="s68">She was one of six surviving siblings, but none in the same town.</span> <span id="s69">They lived all over me – Germany, but they were all in close – in close touch with each other, there were weekly letters to everybody, and – including Grandma in – in Byetahl(ph).</span> <span id="s70">And so it was a very special – my – on my mother’s side was a close knit family.</span> <span id="s71">On my father’s side less so, he and his – my father and his brother were not on particularly good terms, and the maiden aunt, sister, which he was a – a family of three siblings, she lived in her parents’ house in a little village called Lemförde, l-e-m-f-o-umlaut-r-d-e near Osnabrück in northern Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Tell me a little bit about the town itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: How many Jewish families tell a – out of a total population?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Ah, it’s a good question.</span> <span id="s76">We were a small Jewish congregation, but rather distinct.</span> <span id="s77">Celle, as you may or may not know, is of historic significance in that it was a m – the seat of a duke, Herzog, the Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg – Brunswick-Lüneburg, and so it was a white collar community.</span> <span id="s78">Our synagogue in Celle was built in 1741 and is today the on – the only surviving synagogue in northern Germany that was – well, it was vandalized of course, but that survived, it was not burned or destroyed.</span> <span id="s79">It was destroyed from the inside, but the building remains.</span> <span id="s80">It was during my time, had of course gone past its peak, people had started moving away after World War I.</span> <span id="s81">Some families moved to Hannover, which was 40 kilometers.</span> <span id="s82">25 miles away was the nearest large city, some moved to Berlin.</span> <span id="s83">The remaining active members in the community were about a dozen families.</span> <span id="s84">There were some Jewish people who were not active, they didn’t attend services.</span> <span id="s85">They, I guess were Jews by religion only, or th-they – the Germans so nicely put it, Jewish citizens of a Hebrew faith or persuasion.</span> <span id="s86">And that was by – by choice, they really didn't want to be identified with the Jewish community per se, and that was their choice.</span> <span id="s87">Give you an illustration, for – we only had services in our synagogue three times a year, on the high holidays, rush – you know, Passover and Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s88">Well, Simchas Torah was observed, and you know, but we had trouble getting a minyan together, of course, and we were, by German standards Conservative, not Orthodox, but the synagogue of course was built, like m-m-most German synagogues with the women in – in the upper, on the balcony, whatever you call it, and the men downstairs and only men counted for – yeah, for minyan.</span> <span id="s89">However, if you were 12 years old and you were gonna be Bar Mitzvahed the following year, you could already be counted as a minyan man.</span> <span id="s90">So it was that kind of a thing, or if things got very tough and we were nine, as a last resort they would say – we would send one of the boys, sometimes me, over to one of the non-observing Jews, one of them was Solomon – Solomon and say – ask Solomon if he’ll come to minyan, you know, and then reluctantly and grumpily would come and di – um, sit in for minyan.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: How many Jewish families were there in town?</span> <span id="s92">How many Jewish families were in town?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Observing or otherwise, maybe 12 or 14.</span> <span id="s94">I really haven’t counted them, I can – but I have – I have the records at home, I mean, I can make that available if you’re interested.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: So, your family was observant?</span> <span id="s96">How would you describe your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Well, we were traditionally observant.</span> <span id="s98">My mother came from a observant family, meaning my grandmother kept milchig and fleishig separate.</span> <span id="s99">My father came from an Orthodox – well, an observant family.</span> <span id="s100">My father’s family, it’s a family of butchers, kosher butchers, but I guess the scene at the turn of the 20th century was really the – I’m sure I’m not telling you anything new, you know, the German Jewish community had been, well, had the opportunity for the first time to assimil – well, to try and assimilate or at least to practice by choice, and the tendency was away from – from religious observations and to assimilate, to try and assimilate.</span> <span id="s101">So there were many Jews who felt primarily as Germans of Jewish faith.</span> <span id="s102">And I guess we were – my father ate treyf occasionally, because when he traveled he couldn’t observe all th – so as a – as a boy, as a young man already, he stopped eating kosher as he did at home, and my mother the same way when she got out into daily life, modified, and it was called new kosher, neu-kosher.</span> <span id="s103">New kosher meaning you would eat milk and meat mixed but no pork, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s105">Did you observe the Sabbath, Shabbat?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: We were aware of Shabbat, but we were allowed to ride our bicycles, while on Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, we were not.</span> <span id="s107">So Shabbat was – it was a work day for us, we couldn’t afford to keep the store closed and I guess that sort of set the pattern.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Were your parents Zionists?</span> <span id="s109">\</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: We were sympathetic – well, Zionism for us started in 1933 or ’34.</span> <span id="s111">We – the community, our congregation was too small to have a rabbi, but we did have a cantor who was a retired schoolteacher and had a pension and he was the cantor and also our, well, Hebrew teacher and he would officiate at all services, of course.</span> <span id="s112">And that was – but you know, we – we didn’t – we didn’t have a – a rabbi, per se.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: What language did you speak at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: German, what else?</span> <span id="s115">I mean, well, again, as you probably know, German Jews tried to ma – be very low key, be as un-Jewish in appearance, not that we were ashamed or – you know, of being Jews, we were conscious Jews, but we were Jews in religious observance, not, you know, it was not an ethnic group other than by designation by the Germans.</span> <span id="s116">I mean, we were – we were aware of being Jews, and we wanted to be Jews, but I guess we had no choice anyway, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: Did you feel very German as a young child?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: N-No, that’s a tough – I wa – we never really thought about it.</span> <span id="s119">We knew we – we – we knew we were nem – you know, German, we knew we were Jews, and of course, well, consciously, wh-when Hitler came to power, it was in 1933, I was nine years old, I remember distinctly when I came to school.</span> <span id="s120">I started school in 1930.</span> <span id="s121">Before that I went a year to kindergarten, I was four years old.</span> <span id="s122">And we were taught from small child on not to make any, as it was known as rishiss(ph).</span> <span id="s123">Are you familiar with the – with the term rishiss(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: No, could you explain it?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s126">Rishass(ph) I think is a Hebrew word.</span> <span id="s127">It – it is to draw attention to – yeah, don’t make wave, don’t make rishiss(ph) means don’t – you know, don’t draw attention to your Jewishness.</span> <span id="s128">If – so if you did anything that would be disturbing to the Christian community, if you flaunted your Jewishness, you would say that makes rishiss(ph).</span> <span id="s129">Rishass(ph) is, I think – I don’t know what it is in Hebrew, but I – anyway.</span> <span id="s130">So we were – we were taught not to make waves, to conform, not to draw attention to ourselves by being obnoxious or obviously Jewish.</span> <span id="s131">Do the things that were ascribed by the Gentile community as being typically Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Such as?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: Be loud, be boisterous and you know, I mean, if you would see somebody with – with – with – with – with payos, obviously they’re – and that – that was a Jewish trait.</span> <span id="s134">Or to walk straight, to be – Jews were thought of as being non-athletic.</span> <span id="s135">My mother was very proud that we excelled in sports, my brother and I, and it was part of our – well, that we belonged, we were as good as they were.</span> <span id="s136">And well, it was odd that even my brother and I, during you know, Hitler times in high school, were allowed to participate in sporting events which in many other cities, Jews were no longer allowed to participate.</span> <span id="s137">And I remember Harry, my brother, Hans got a gold oak leaf and – with some event we – we had – from – from our school we had the sports event and I got a bronze even – oak leaf.</span> <span id="s138">Now, I must also tell you that on crystal – the night – yeah, Crystal Night, or the day – the morning after Crystal Night, when we found out, you know, what had happened in town, our apartment was not searched or destroyed or what, but we expected that maybe the Gestapo or city police would come and search the house.</span> <span id="s139">And we got rid of – my mother got rid of anything that would be intimidating, like foreign currency wi – my mother had a few British pounds, Palestinian pounds th – that her sister had brought back from Palestine in 1934, and the oak leaves that Harry and I had earned, because if they would come in and say – see that we had oak leaves, maybe the feeling was, what are you trying to prove, you Jew bastards?</span> <span id="s140">You know.</span> <span id="s141">So she got rid of it, not to antagonize the police should they come, and should they find this and question it.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: So you were athletic.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Did you enjoy the athletics?</span> <span id="s145">Is it something you enjoyed doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Of course I did, to this day.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: What sports did you take part in?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Well, I – swimming, but I was best in gymnastics, you know, which was the high bar, parallel bars, rings, that sort of thing, and I always got an A. I got an A in the fall, and – and a B plus in the summer because we are – field and track, I didn't care for that too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: How would you describe yourself?</span> <span id="s150">Were you a very independent young child?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: No.</span> <span id="s152">I wasn’t in – I mean, I was lucky that I had a playmate, my brother Harry and I, we had German friends in the neighborhood, a group, really sort of next door neighbors.</span> <span id="s153">But after 1933 – well, ’34, they started pulling back and also we did not want them to be embarrassed by associating with us because it – you know, some – a third party might – might say the – you know, there was one, his name was Willie Wrobleski(ph), I f – and they were very poor working family.</span> <span id="s154">The father was unemployed during the depression, I remember, but they were really decent people and we played with them.</span> <span id="s155">We had a shack in the back where they had like a little stable in the back where the boys [indecipherable] there were four of us that really sort of stuck together.</span> <span id="s156">But then my mother thought that maybe they would feel uncomfortable associating – having their kid associate with us, so we eased back and –</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: What did that mean to you as a young child?</span> <span id="s158">Were you aware of the ramifications of that, of what it meant?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: Oh yes, of course we were aware.</span> <span id="s160">We were aware of the sensitivities, you know, of other people, of – now, I must say that Celle was considered, not only by us who lived in Celle, but ba – of course we were aware of what happened in other communities where kids were beaten up on the way to school, and – and all that –</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: How – how were you aware of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: You heard, you know, you – you – y-you heard from other Jewish families o – in – in Hessen, in he – yeah, where – where a lot of Jewish families lived in the country and where there was a lot of anti-Semitism, either for business reason or just to go and beat up a Jew.</span> <span id="s163">Were – the kids were intimidated on the way to school, they were called Jew – Jew bastard, Jude itsich(ph), you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: What does that mean to an eight year old or nine year old Jewish child?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Well, it probably – it means the same thing, we are going through that right now, here in our society with the bullying.</span> <span id="s166">It was bullying, okay?</span> <span id="s167">You pick on a Jew kid, and Jew kids were – reputedly couldn’t take care of themselves, they – you know [indecipherable] that – gang up on a Jew and beat him up.</span> <span id="s168">Why?</span> <span id="s169">Because just like in America today, kids gang up on others, on weak, you know, it’s – it had nothing particularly to do with who we were, but what we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Because you were so athletic, did you feel as threatened?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: No, I never felt threatened.</span> <span id="s172">I remember I was still in elementary school, so I was probably either eight or ni – must have been nine years old, my last year in elementary school.</span> <span id="s173">So that would have made it 1933, and Hitler was already in power.</span> <span id="s174">It was after the Macht Übernahme, which you kn – power grab.</span> <span id="s175">Somebody from not my class but another class, called me Jude itsich(ph), which was a Jew – Jew bastard, whatever, during recess in the schoolyard.</span> <span id="s176">And we weren’t allowed to fight in the schoolyard or in school, that – it’s not like – was not like America, it was like in Germany where we still had corporal punishment.</span> <span id="s177">If children misbehaved they were caned in front of the entire class.</span> <span id="s178">Pretty humiliating experience.</span> <span id="s179">So kids toed the line.</span> <span id="s180">But if you m – had a fight to fight, you fought it outside the school.</span> <span id="s181">So he want – he says, you want to fight, I’ll – I’ll – I said, I’ll fight.</span> <span id="s182">I’ll meet you in the park after school.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Kurt Roberg.</span> <span id="s185">This is tape number one, side B and you were talking about this altercation with this young man in your class.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: You can call it altercation, I call it a challenge of a fight.</span> <span id="s187">So after school I went home, or w-went to my – our store, and in the park, which was the – you know, in the – is the – the French park.</span> <span id="s188">This guy was waiting with – of course, the word had spread, he’s going to fight with Roberg, the Jew, whatever they had spread.</span> <span id="s189">And everybody was around, I took off my – my backpack, we had a Tornister it was called, a backpack.</span> <span id="s190">Took off my – my jacket and got into a fight.</span> <span id="s191">I’d never fought in my life, but I knew what to do, I was interested in Schmeling and Sharkey and Joe Louis, I think was around already.</span> <span id="s192">So I knew about fighting.</span> <span id="s193">And we started squaring off and he landed some punches and I landed a lucky Sunday punch and bloodied his nose.</span> <span id="s194">So I was the first – first one to draw blood.</span> <span id="s195">Just then somebody hollered jute(ph), jute(ph), which does not mean Jew, but – although it’s close to it.</span> <span id="s196">A teacher approached too late, now we weren’t allowed to fight even – even in the park.</span> <span id="s197">And he came right to it, he says, what is this fighting, why are you fighting?</span> <span id="s198">I said, well he c – he called me juditsich(ph) and challenged me to a fight, I am fighting.</span> <span id="s199">So the teacher addressed the other boy and says, now that’s not nice.</span> <span id="s200">You shouldn’t say a thing like that.</span> <span id="s201">Now I want you to stop fighting and you both go home and that’s the end of it.</span> <span id="s202">And that’s how it was settled.</span> <span id="s203">So I came out the victor.</span> <span id="s204">The word apparently spread and I never had any problems after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: What was your relationship with your parents?</span> <span id="s206">Di – were you very close to them, were you dependent upon them?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: I was very close to my mother.</span> <span id="s208">My father was a rather – well, distant figure.</span> <span id="s209">He was on the road all week.</span> <span id="s210">He was a quiet man, introspective.</span> <span id="s211">And so we – and nearsighted, so he was limited in anything we did.</span> <span id="s212">Sunday – well, the routine, Sundays we would go for the traditional Sunday afternoon Spaziergang in the woods, whatever.</span> <span id="s213">Sometimes we would go on a boat ride on the river.</span> <span id="s214">But after 19 – let’s say, well, after the Nuremberg laws of 1935, which was the first really restrictive, official restrictive, then I think that stopped.</span> <span id="s215">We could have gone – I mean, we went walking, but we no longer would go, let’s say, using this excursion boat, which one of our neighbors – we lived right on the river, a-and they were a family of fishermen who also owned a little excursion steamer motorboat.</span> <span id="s216">So we no longer went.</span> <span id="s217">That was part of not raising any awareness and we really – and apparently we did it successfully in our town, because there was no open anti-Semitism that I was aware of.</span> <span id="s218">Others in town complained about anti-Semitism, only – you know, somebody would say something, was either as a matter of competition or neighbors who didn’t like the n – the Jews next to them for one reason or another.</span> <span id="s219">But there really was very little and it – we used to almost brag about it, you know, to other Jewish families, that we had no richiss(ph) – there was no anti-Semitism – open anti-Semitism in our town Nobody was ever beaten up, intimidated or you know, I mean – and you could – anything could – could happen.</span> <span id="s220">Like a Hitler youth would see a Jewish man coming down the street and bump into him, you know, why don’t you watch where you’re going, or you know, walk in the gutter, or you know, make anti-Semitic remark and of course you couldn’t do anything about it.</span> <span id="s221">But that never happened.</span> <span id="s222">It happened in other cities that we know.</span> <span id="s223">Whether it would, you know, intimidate or even challenge you or we didn’t have any of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Le-Let’s talk now about 1933 and Hitler coming into power.</span> <span id="s225">What was your first knowledge of him, your first awareness as a child, of Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: Well, I was really aware of parties because in school some kids – this was – this goes back I would think to 1931 – ’32.</span> <span id="s227">Kids I think everywhere, take sides.</span> <span id="s228">You have a favorite – well, sports idol and you have a political party of your choice.</span> <span id="s229">So kids would ask you, so what are you?</span> <span id="s230">And I wa – I would say, I’m SPD – SPD riz – there was this Social Democratic party.</span> <span id="s231">What are you?</span> <span id="s232">I’m NSDRP, it’s a Nazi party, meaning they were what their parents were, right?</span> <span id="s233">I mean it – not hard to figure.</span> <span id="s234">The kids – children don’t have opinions, they have the opinions of their parents.</span> <span id="s235">So that was reflected.</span> <span id="s236">So I went SPD and I remember we had a – what do we call it, Jahrmakt, a – a – a fair, a country fa-fi-fair, twice a year, in the spring and in the fall.</span> <span id="s237">And you go there and you – you know, and you – you had the stands and I bought a – as a matter of identification, the symbol of s – the SPD was three arrows.</span> <span id="s238">So I bought – I spent five cents and bought a pin so that I could have an identity.</span> <span id="s239">And I came home with that, and my mother says, what do you have?</span> <span id="s240">I said, aren’t we SPD?</span> <span id="s241">And my mother said yes, but I think it’s better if you don’t wear that, because you can be something and you don’t have to advertise it, because if somebody who sees and doesn’t like it, you may get into an argument or a fight and you know the Nazis of course – well, the Nazi kids, they would stick together and the SPD kids would stick together.</span> <span id="s242">So these were little clubs.</span> <span id="s243">So I was aware of political things.</span> <span id="s244">I remember well in the – in the paper that there were street fights in Hamburg which was, of course, Hamburg was largely red, predominantly communist, because was a harbor city and of course everybody read about you know, the – what happened – what went on in Munich and in Berlin where the Nazis would ride around in trucks, have a demonstration and the communists would come and break it up and vice-a-versa.</span> <span id="s245">And they would let – and the SA, these storm – the SR then was the predominant power, the brown shirts and brown pants.</span> <span id="s246">The SS was not yet very predominant then.</span> <span id="s247">So SR would go around and these were bruisers.</span> <span id="s248">They were people who liked to fight.</span> <span id="s249">They were, you know, bouncers, they were bru – they would go out – they joined the party so they could get into a good fight just like people here go out on Saturday night, hey, let’s go to a bar where we can have some action.</span> <span id="s250">Same mentality.</span> <span id="s251">So I was aware of that as a child, but there was a – you know, of course, a sobering effect from the home to say don’t get involved and we have to, as Jews, be – lay low and you know, don’t make waves.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: And when were you aware of Hitler himself for the first time?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Oh, before – before 1933 already.</span> <span id="s254">I mean, I was seven, eight years old, I knew Hitler was in the limelight and I remember very distinctly the – about the putsch, the Reichstagsbrand, the torching of the Reichstag right after he was elected and acor – of – of course the power grab on January 30th, 1933, everybody was aware of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Were you very frightened?</span> <span id="s256">Was this something you talked over with your parents?</span> <span id="s257">Was he a frightening figure to you at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: No, no he wasn’t.</span> <span id="s259">He was far away, he was in Berlin, that was – what I do remember is – I mean, parents were careful – not my parents, I think most parents at the time, not to discuss anything upsetting in front of the children.</span> <span id="s260">So there were no political discussions, but we knew that in the Jewish – within the Jewish community – I mean, we had friends, Jewish friends and the families would get together, usually on Saturday night.</span> <span id="s261">There were – well, about four or five or six families that sort of were the nucleus and there were card games, Skat and you need four players.</span> <span id="s262">So there were four families that got together and it alternated at somebody’s house, and that was the highlight of the social life was the card games and the women would sit and talk and the mother would entertain, I mean, with food and coffee and cake and all that and the men played cards and smoked cigars and –</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: A-And if you were around, they wouldn’t talk in front of you all.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: Yes, they did, but we children, we were allowed to say hello and you know, then off to bed, and that’s the way it was, you know.</span> <span id="s265">And that – I mean, I don’t know any – any other way and of course my brother and I – yeah, that – that was – that was about 8:30 – nine o’clock and it was time to go to bed anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: For a young boy to see people in uniforms, what does – what did that mean to you?</span> <span id="s267">Was it a frightening sight or did you think it looked wonderful, with these boots and these uniforms?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: N – it was neither frightening – it wasn’t intimidating.</span> <span id="s269">Well, if you saw a Nazi in the boots, you knew that he was a Nazi, and he was strutting it, but I was never, never afraid of them, because then we didn’t have any reason to be afraid.</span> <span id="s270">I do, of course, remember distinctly April 1st, 1933 was the day of – oh, what was it?</span> <span id="s271">What do we – what do you – what do we call that?</span> <span id="s272">A boycott.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: I was going to say, did you mean the boycott?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: Was a boycott and we had a store, storefront and there were two SA Stormtroopers to the left and right of the entrance, standing, you know, like this, la – not at attention, but at – wi-wi – we’d say in our army, at parade rest, okay?</span> <span id="s277">And if somebody would wa – even if they wo – just walked by, kauft nicht bei Juden.</span> <span id="s278">Don’t buy from the Jews.</span> <span id="s279">And I think they had also, with white paint drawn a swastika on our – on our store windows.</span> <span id="s280">I came from – I went to school as every other day, and I came home at one o’clock, I mean was – school was only til one o’clock, from eight in the morning til one, and I was then in third grade.</span> <span id="s281">I came to the store, cause that’s where my mother was, we already – we no longer had a maid.</span> <span id="s282">Before that we had, you know, when we were smaller we – we had a maid and the maid was al – I think already gone by then.</span> <span id="s283">And I walked in – of course they looked at me and they knew where I belonged.</span> <span id="s284">And then a woman came in to buy – well, a woman came in, a customer, but a woman that we hadn’t seen before.</span> <span id="s285">And in a town of 30,000, your customers were repeat customers, people who came in to buy from us.</span> <span id="s286">And she said, this is terrible, what is going on.</span> <span id="s287">I really don’t want to buy anything, but I just had to come in – into your store, she told my mother, to – you know, because I – this is – this is a terrible thing what they are doing.</span> <span id="s288">Was a demonstration of – you know, of solidarity.</span> <span id="s289">And she didn’t buy anything, which was all right.</span> <span id="s290">And she stayed in the store a few minutes and then she went out again.</span> <span id="s291">So there were people like that.</span> <span id="s292">There was no business that day, but we kept the store open, of course, and after that.</span> <span id="s293">But it was a struggle, you know, the business was getting less and less.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Tell me again, as a nine year old, you see these two people standing there in front of your father’s store.</span> <span id="s295">Do you have any recollection what your thoughts were, your feelings were when you saw this, and the s – the white paint?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: Well, I – no, I b – I knew they were there, they were – they happened to – there were three Jewish stores on that street, a shoe store sort of diagonally across the street and another one, a soft goods store as – as we had up on the corner.</span> <span id="s297">And they were – they were standing there, I knew all the Jewish stores, there were six – seven Jewish businesses in town, and they were standing in front – i-in front of all of them and it didn’t – I had no – I wasn’t frightened, I wasn’t – they were there and I made no more of it, I knew why they were there.</span> <span id="s298">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: And you accepted it?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Yeah, oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: And had you heard about any – the book burning?</span> <span id="s302">Did your parents talk about or had they heard about book burning?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: The book burnings were later.</span> <span id="s304">That was, I would think about 1936 or thereabouts.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: There were some earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: There were some earlier?</span> <span id="s307">Not in our town, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: No, there were no demonstrations of that kind or – as I say, it was pretty low level of open anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: Did you – before kri – we’ll get to Kristallnacht in a moment, but before that, did you talk about what was happening with your other contemporary friends, children your age?</span> <span id="s311">Did – was that something you would talk about when you were together?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: There were only about – well, there were four Jewish families who had children our age.</span> <span id="s313">But the me – s – there was really only one family, the one down the block, the Wolf family, with whom we were friendly, our parents played cards together, and they had three children.</span> <span id="s314">The boy was a year younger than I, the girl was a year younger than Harry and a third, she was two years younger than I, so they were all about our age, and they were sort of our only playmates after ’33 or ’34.</span> <span id="s315">There was another family, Shule(ph) who had a boy and a girl, but we didn’t socialize with them.</span> <span id="s316">Well, again, it was part of the – well, Jewish – German Jewish society.</span> <span id="s317">The man had a – he was a rag dealer.</span> <span id="s318">Well, he – he had the local recycling center.</span> <span id="s319">He dealt in – what do we call that?</span> <span id="s320">You got five minutes.</span> <span id="s321">Used, you know, iron, metals and rags and all that and I’m sure – I’m – he made a living, but it wasn’t on the same level as our – you know, our parents, who were tradesmen and had a – you know, business owned – store owners.</span> <span id="s322">So there was a social level that you didn’t really – they were decent people and we respect them and we were in, of course, in Hebrew school together.</span> <span id="s323">We had Hebrew school, and I’ll tell you about that.</span> <span id="s324">It was part of our social structure.</span> <span id="s325">But the – the s-social intercourse, you know, I mean we – we never played with those kids.</span> <span id="s326">They also lived further away and we just – we just didn’t, because our parents didn’t get together.</span> <span id="s327">But you saw each other during the high holidays in shul and of course we saw the kids during Hebrew school.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Tell me about the Hebrew school.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: Well, th – our teacher, Hal Lotheim was his name, l-o-t-h-e-i-m.</span> <span id="s330">He was a retired schoolteacher, on had – so he had a pension.</span> <span id="s331">And I don’t know what the congregation paid him for being the cantor and – but he had free room and board in the apartment in – above a – in – at the synagogue.</span> <span id="s332">And the building, the congregation’s building were two houses adjoining and the main building was the entrance to the synagogue and right adjacent to that in the f – facing the street was the ca – the one room classroom, and there was a little storage room behind that.</span> <span id="s333">And we went to Hebrew school Sunday mornings and Wednesday afternoon.</span> <span id="s334">Why Wednesday afternoon?</span> <span id="s335">Wednesday was Hitler youth day.</span> <span id="s336">All German children who belonged to the Hitler youth, and there was, of course, a lot of pressure that everybody should join and almost had to join, whether they liked it or not, you had to belong.</span> <span id="s337">And if you didn’t, the parents were pressurized because Hitler wanted the youth.</span> <span id="s338">He didn’t much care about the parents, but there was a lot of pressure, and I know because there were many – were people who really were not Nazis and disagreed with the whole thing, and pressure was put on them for the boys to join the Hitler youth, or the Jungvolk, which is the children from six to 10.</span> <span id="s339">You had to be 10 to go into the Hitler youth, the hiyot(ph) HJ, Hitler youth.</span> <span id="s340">Bel – below that, you were the Jungvolk, that is the young – the young people.</span> <span id="s341">They – and they then had meeting – no, I’m sorry, I guess you had to be 14 for the Hitler youth and up to 14 was the Jungvolk.</span> <span id="s342">So all my classmates, or most of my classmates then would go on Wednesday afternoon, they had to put on their you – Hitler uniform.</span> <span id="s343">When you attended, you had to appear in uniform.</span> <span id="s344">And of course, we didn’t have a uniform.</span> <span id="s345">I would have liked to have a uniform.</span> <span id="s346">That was because we played war games.</span> <span id="s347">You played – well, we played cops and robbers, or you played cowboy and Indians, or you – you know?</span> <span id="s348">Or you played soldiers, you know.</span> <span id="s349">The bad guys were the French and the good guys were the German soldiers.</span> <span id="s350">So these were the war games you played.</span> <span id="s351">I guess all little boys do that.</span> <span id="s352">And so – well, but I had no regrets that I didn’t have a uniform per se.</span> <span id="s353">As a matter of fact, the corduroy short pants and the belt with a belt buckle and all that, which some boys would wear even when – you know, their uniform pants, even when they weren’t in uniform, with the shirt and all that.</span> <span id="s354">We made su – my mother made sure that we never wore anything that would imply that we wanted to, or that we belonged and you know – of course, somebody would say hey, what are you doing with those pants, you know.</span> <span id="s355">You are not entitled to wear these pants.</span> <span id="s356">But well, today I guess it’s Nike’s.</span> <span id="s357">Nothing has changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: Tell me about your Bar Mitzvah, did you have one?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: Yes, I had a Bar Mitzvah, my brother had a Bar Mitzvah and you prepared for oh, a year, year and a half, whatever and Hal Lotheim taught us and w-well, it became my bam – ma-ma – my brother’s Bar Mitzvah in 1935.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: Was there any problem having it?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: No, what should be the problem?</span> <span id="s362">I mean, we had the service, we had some relatives come from out of town and we got a minyan together and everybody was very happy that there was another minyan man now.</span> <span id="s363">So Bar Mitzvahs were looked forward to in the community as a – it was – my Bar Mitzvah was May – on May 1st, 1937.</span> <span id="s364">And our – we had a nice dinner at home after that, and I said the table prayer, you know, tish kabaid(ph) afterwards and made Kiddush, and of course, in – in synagogue, I – I read the Torah and you know, it was very traditional.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Were you proud of being a Jew?</span> <span id="s366">A: Yes, I mean I – well, proud.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Or were you ang –</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: – or – or were you angry that you were a Jew because you had these problems?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: No, we weren’t proud to be Jews.</span> <span id="s371">We were – we were content to be Jews.</span> <span id="s372">I think we were – proud, I think is the wrong thing.</span> <span id="s373">We – I think – no, you’re born into being a Jew, you have no choice, but we didn’t repudiate it as some did.</span> <span id="s374">I mean, obviously, you know, people who didn’t want to be identified as Jews, or who converted to Christianity obviously – and you could do that.</span> <span id="s375">There was one family, a woman with two daughters, I don’t know where the husband was, whether he died or whatever, and she thought it would be easier for her and her daughters and they converted.</span> <span id="s376">They converted to Christianity.</span> <span id="s377">Turned out of course that subsequently didn’t do them any good anyway, right?</span> <span id="s378">But that was not unusual, I mean that – this was part of the assimilation mentality and attempt to become equal.</span> <span id="s379">I mean, look – i-i-if – if you look – you know, in history, you know, there – there were many people who converted and still remained Jews – you know, I mean, in the eyes of the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Kurt Roberg.</span> <span id="s382">This is tape number two, side A. And were you aware of Hitler’s march into Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s384">I’m a history buff and I – since I grew up in Celle with history, which wa – it’s really also the cradle of the present British monarchy, so the – the house of Hanover originated in Celle.</span> <span id="s385">And at an early a – in school from, I guess about six or seven years, we learned about the history of Celle and then the district and then the province and so I – I’ve been interested.</span> <span id="s386">I grew up with history and been interested in history, and of course I was aware of the annexation of Austria, the so-called being invited in, and Hitler’s triumphant march and that v – you know, Vienna.</span> <span id="s387">Of course, Hitler coming from Austria and many Germans didn’t accept him because he was not a German, he was an Austrian.</span> <span id="s388">He tried very hard to be German, but we Germans knew that he wasn’t German.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Seeing pictures of him coming into Austria, again, to a young child, is that frightening?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: No, wasn’t frightening, it was a – you know, w-we – we saw it in the newsreels, there was no other exposure – in the newsreels and we knew it was propaganda and it was – as a matter of fact, well, din – one was – Hitler was everywhere.</span> <span id="s391">Of course it was – there was – by then, every classroom had a picture of Hitler hanging in the front, that was ordained.</span> <span id="s392">There wa – yeah, there was th-th-the – that came from – from the top.</span> <span id="s393">So there was a – there was a systematic indoctrination of the fuehrer being – he wasn’t referred to as Hitler any more, he was der fuehrer, and he –</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Did you – did you have to salute the picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: No, not only I didn’t have to, I wasn’t allowed to.</span> <span id="s396">Jews were not allowed to give the Nazi salute.</span> <span id="s397">They were – as a matter of fact, if there was a – an assembly in the – in the schoolyard, for instance, then everybody, you know, had to sieg heil, Jews were not allowed to.</span> <span id="s398">That was a – they – it was a privilege to give the – the – so Jews were not permitted to, that would have been sacrilegious.</span> <span id="s399">That’s how they made the – the – you know, Hitler salute.</span> <span id="s400">Nor did I want to.</span> <span id="s401">So when the national anthem was sung, I had to attend.</span> <span id="s402">I stood there, I didn’t sing the Horst-Wessel-Lied, you know.</span> <span id="s403">And the only thing that I remember is if they would sing, there were – there were certain – there were certain songs that, you know boys – and that was a form of intimidation, of course.</span> <span id="s404">Like, guys would – would pass by on their bicycle and they’d see a Jew and they’d sing a song, Wenn das Judenblut vom Messer spritzt.</span> <span id="s405">When the Jews blood will – will squirt from the knife, okay, that was – etcetera.</span> <span id="s406">They would, you know, intimid – form of intimidation, of teasing, of intimidating, okay?</span> <span id="s407">But there was never any – any physical intimidation, okay, but [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s408">Young people, primarily boys, they feel their oats and they are together, that’s what they do, right?</span> <span id="s409">They let it out in one form another.</span> <span id="s410">And there was – there were the Jews, the minority that you could let it out on if you wanted to without, you know, without any reprimand.</span> <span id="s411">Au contraire, it was a mitzvah for them, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Would you come home and talk this over with your parents?</span> <span id="s413">A: I don’t remember, but if – if something hap – if something happened that shouldn’t happen, I wou – I would tell my mother, yes.</span> <span id="s414">Oh, of course, and she was good counselor and had a good head, and you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: What kinds of things would she advise you to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: Well, usually to keep cool, but I really can’t think of any – any incident other than the fight that I had, to you know – there was – we didn’t give our parents any reason.</span> <span id="s417">We were – we were cautious, we were careful, we didn’t make waves, we were, by and well – you know, well liked, well respected in the neighborhood, where are – all our neighbors were decent.</span> <span id="s418">Those that were – that we knew were Nazis, we – we didn’t tangle.</span> <span id="s419">W-We – we went out of their way, you know, we didn't – you didn’t make eye contact with them, you didn't give them any reason to – you know, we didn’t give them the opportunity to be nasty to us.</span> <span id="s420">You went out of their way.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: So you felt safe?</span> <span id="s422">You felt safe in your neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: When you saw a swastika, did that elicit any feelings inside of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: Yeah, I didn't like it.</span> <span id="s426">I mean th – I – well, I was more w – of course you grow up with it and you see it and the swastikas everywhere, it was just another – it sort of made your heart go a little faster, but you got used to it.</span> <span id="s427">When I later had to return to Germany from Holland – you know, I went to Holland after, and then I came back, that really hit me like a sledgehammer, that I was back under the heel of the Nazi regime.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: We’ll – we’ll get to that, we’ll get to that.</span> <span id="s429">So you were s – you were able to stay in school until Kristallnacht?</span> <span id="s430">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s431">My brother left school, he was 14 in 1936 and my mother’s brother lived in Holland, he had become a Dutch citizen.</span> <span id="s432">He left Germany right after World War I, he was in procurement in – in grains.</span> <span id="s433">And as you know, ger – Holland was neutral during World War I, and he had built up some very good relations with Dutch grain suppliers for the army.</span> <span id="s434">He was in Berlin, in procurement.</span> <span id="s435">And he had learned the grain trade, grain business, as a young man.</span> <span id="s436">And as soon as the war was over, he left Germany, he went to Holland, never ret – well, he returned to visit his mother, etcetera, but he established his business and residence in Holland, became a Dutch citizen and he ended up saving the family.</span> <span id="s437">In 1936 he took my brother to Holland.</span> <span id="s438">My uncle was not married, bachelor, but he was also the – well, he – there were five sisters and one brother, so he was the matriarch – patriarch.</span> <span id="s439">Sorry, patriarch.</span> <span id="s440">My grandmother, his mother, died in 1931, and that was the last time he was in Germany.</span> <span id="s441">Yeah, but [indecipherable] of course he would come before that, come and visit, but he didn’t think well of Germany, but he also was interesting.</span> <span id="s442">The things that we told him later about what – what was going on in Germany, you know, the Hitler – the me – the mentality of what was going on, what Hitler did with the Jews.</span> <span id="s443">He was assimilated, I mean, he did not we – observe the high holidays, but he was not a practicing Jew, per se.</span> <span id="s444">He thought that we were really overemphasizing, that we were panicky, just like the rest of the world did not really believe that this was happening, and they – me -- said me – ma, he says, Jüdische groil(ph) propaganda, if you understand that.</span> <span id="s445">That’s Jewish prop – you know, he – he didn’t think that this was happening, that people panicked or saw things too Jewish.</span> <span id="s446">And unfortunately he found out after the invasion of Holland that it was real.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Wa-Was it hard for you to say goodbye to your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: It wasn’t hard, it was a fact of life.</span> <span id="s449">Harry left.</span> <span id="s450">I mean, he went, you know, to go to school in Holland and learn – when we – he went to a trade school, learned a trade.</span> <span id="s451">Now at this time, 1936, to go back to what you asked about Zionism, we did have classes twice a week on Wednesdays.</span> <span id="s452">I sort of got away from that, but the Hitler youth – on Wednesday afternoon we had Hebrew school, and in 1933, lot – Lotheim and – sorry, Lotheim and – Mr. and Mrs. Lotheim went to Palestine and came back as ardent Zionists.</span> <span id="s453">They were impressed with what was being done there and from there on he really said, well we have to – we have to support Palestine, Zionism is our solution.</span> <span id="s454">And we listened.</span> <span id="s455">Of course, we all subscribed to a Jewish paper out of Berlin called “Jüdische Rundschau,” which is Jewish – well, was a Jewish weekly.</span> <span id="s456">And they had a children’s section and it was Zionist oriented and told the Jewish community that they had to A, support Palestine and B, prepare for leaving Germany, that it was prudent to learn to – a trade – for young people to learn a trade for HaSharat(ph) rather than what was the trend before, an academic life.</span> <span id="s457">Jews in Germany, by and large wanted to get away being shopkeepers and the trend was to go into academic life, doctors, lawyers, whatever.</span> <span id="s458">And that’s – we were the first ones to go to a school of higher education in my family.</span> <span id="s459">My br – both my brother and I went to the – you know, gymnasium.</span> <span id="s460">And of course that was interrupted by Hitler, so Harry went to Holland to learn a trade and we had no plans of where to go or what to do.</span> <span id="s461">My father was very reluctant to – he was 50, born in 1884, so he was hesitant to go to a country.</span> <span id="s462">Knew some English, learned French in school, but that was it.</span> <span id="s463">Where do you go, what do you do?</span> <span id="s464">He wasn’t too successful in Germany, how successful would he be in a foreign country?</span> <span id="s465">And so that was – you asked me did I find it hard to say goodbye?</span> <span id="s466">Well, I was on my own now, my playmate was gone, you know, my confidant.</span> <span id="s467">Harry and I were very close as, you know, boys.</span> <span id="s468">But I adjusted to that and I knew it was a necessity and I lived with it, I accepted it.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: Okay, let’s move forward to Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s470">How did that begin for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Well, let me – let precede that.</span> <span id="s472">In the summer of ’38, I was 14.</span> <span id="s473">I went to visit my aunt in Byetahl(ph), my mother’s home village, as I did every summer for the big vacation, four weeks vacation.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Her name?</span> <span id="s475">Your aunt’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: My aunt’s name was Babette(ph).</span> <span id="s477">And Aunt Babette was single.</span> <span id="s478">She was – well, physically handicapped.</span> <span id="s479">She had an ac – bad accident as a child and had – one leg was shorter than the other, so she wasn't married, she stayed home with her mother.</span> <span id="s480">When Grandma died in 1931, she of course continued to live in the f – family house that had been there since 1830.</span> <span id="s481">And this was my last – well, visit with her.</span> <span id="s482">During that time, in August, of course, you know that every year the Nazis in August had the Nuremberger(ph) Parteitag, the party convention.</span> <span id="s483">And usually out of that came new laws, new dogmas, new tightening.</span> <span id="s484">And again that was very significant, that things were tightening up and in August, mel – we had already closed our store in 1937.</span> <span id="s485">It n-no longer paid.</span> <span id="s486">We moved – it so happened that our landlord, the owner of our house, it was a three family house, we lived on the – they lived on the ground floor, the first floor was a retired lawyer, he was a person that was working at the – the law – the supreme – there were three Supreme Courts in Germany, one of them was in Celle.</span> <span id="s487">And he was – he had worked for the Supreme Court as a judge, but he was forced to resign in 1933, and I’ll give you that story separately.</span> <span id="s488">They lived on the second floor and we lived on the third floor.</span> <span id="s489">The Zusskinds(ph) had given up their store about in 1928 or thereabouts and moved some of the inventory into one of their rooms made a – yeah, and they permitted us to do the same.</span> <span id="s490">So, whatever inventory we had left, my father thought we could sell.</span> <span id="s491">We moved into what was the living room and that became the office and the business and some of his customers that were loyal to him and hi – prices were right, so rather than selling the inventory at, you know, 10 cents on the dollar as we had to do with the rest of it, we maintained that.</span> <span id="s492">So we no longer had a store since 1937.</span> <span id="s493">And in August ’38, my mother, when things were tightening up further, decided to take a trip to Hamburg and get three waiting numbers from the American consulate, because as you know there was a waiting list and the list was about two years waiting.</span> <span id="s494">She said let – le – I – I want to get the quota numbers in case we need them.</span> <span id="s495">And she also picked up three more for one of the families that we were closest with, the Solomon – the young Solomons.</span> <span id="s496">There was an old family, the parents and the son; this was the son and his wife.</span> <span id="s497">And we – well, then came November, of course, and we were all aware of the incident in Paris.</span> <span id="s498">What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: Heinrich Grynszpan?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: Grynszpan.</span> <span id="s501">Hersh – Herschel –</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: Herschel.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: – Herschel Grynszpan.</span> <span id="s504">It so happens that Herschel Grynszpan was from Hannover, and I can tell you a story about that too, if you want to make a note, let me put that down.</span> <span id="s505">So we knew – and when he shot them, we knew there was going to be trouble.</span> <span id="s506">And of course, the ninth of November was always a v – a day observed in Germany because it was when, in 1923, the first putsch and the whatever, so this was always a solemn, commemorative day of the Nazi party, and that coincided.</span> <span id="s507">And so we were keenly aware of what was happening, but of course, we didn't know what.</span> <span id="s508">Now, on – the ninth of November came and of course everybody kept a low profile, we didn't go out, whatever.</span> <span id="s509">Seven o’clock in the morning our doorbell rang.</span> <span id="s510">We were upstairs, the front door was locked and so we looked out the window, who is it?</span> <span id="s511">Somebody from the Wolf family who had the store down the street from where our store was.</span> <span id="s512">We lived not near the store, we lived somewhere else.</span> <span id="s513">And, how are you?</span> <span id="s514">We are all right, why do you ask?</span> <span id="s515">Don’t you know?</span> <span id="s516">Nothing happened here?</span> <span id="s517">No, what happened?</span> <span id="s518">So they came up and told us that they still had their store and they lived above the store in the – in the house, that the store was smashed, the store across the street, the shoe store, was sm – and they also lived there.</span> <span id="s519">We were the only ones who had a separate – you know, residence because we rented the house and we rented the store.</span> <span id="s520">And they owned the buildings so lived above them.</span> <span id="s521">That – th – you know, they had totally smashed the store, that the goods were lying all over the street.</span> <span id="s522">They went up into the attic and opened the – there was a door because the attics were used also in the olden days – these were half timbered houses from the 17th century – to bring merchandise.</span> <span id="s523">So they opened the attic door and said, if they – if they come up here to get us, we’ll jump.</span> <span id="s524">Well, they didn’t find them in the attic, they were just out to destroy the store.</span> <span id="s525">And so we knew what was going on in town.</span> <span id="s526">And my father was home, and I was home and my mother.</span> <span id="s527">So what to do?</span> <span id="s528">So Mother said – my mother was really running the family, my father was a very passive – and at that point, you know, subdued individual.</span> <span id="s529">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: Was he subdued because of what –</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Ah, the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: – of conditions changing?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: Yes, conditions.</span> <span id="s534">Business was bad.</span> <span id="s535">You – I mean, you felt very inadequate.</span> <span id="s536">And – and really, you know, was a matter of we didn’t want to emigrate, what am I gonna do?</span> <span id="s537">I can’t see, you know, I can’t hear, at least I have – I know my clientele, I have my following.</span> <span id="s538">But we really didn’t know what was gonna – you know, the – the Jewish community said, this can’t last, it has to get better, it can’t get worse.</span> <span id="s539">What else can they do?</span> <span id="s540">But they – you know, it progressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: Did your parents have to take the middle names of Israel and Sarah?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: Not yet.</span> <span id="s543">That came la – that came – yeah, I think that was in 1938 as a matter of fact, when the – yes, I think that was – that came out of the Nuremberger(ph) laws of 1938.</span> <span id="s544">I think there was one of the keys where my mother said, oh, it’s another notch, you know, of tightening – tightening up and of intimidation.</span> <span id="s545">Yes, we did – she became Sarah and we all became Kurt Walter Israel – I became isra – Kurt Walter Israel, my father Victor Israel, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Did that bother you?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Well, it was another significant thing because it was significant for us because Roberg was not considered a Jewish name.</span> <span id="s548">It was never Rosenberg or anything like that.</span> <span id="s549">So Roberg was a German name.</span> <span id="s550">So it – yes, signified that we were Jews, even, you know, wherever you went.</span> <span id="s551">So Mother went to Hamburg and got waiting numbers.</span> <span id="s552">So now it is nov – I’m sorry, it’s November and she s – you know, we decided –</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: This is the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: This is the morning, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: This is the morning after Crystal --</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: And we just – we decide eight o’clock.</span> <span id="s557">Now, I lived across – across from our school.</span> <span id="s558">Our garden backyard and the schoolyard were back to back.</span> <span id="s559">There was a little creek about two yards across or less, in between.</span> <span id="s560">And – but my mother could look into my classroom.</span> <span id="s561">It was maybe a hundred yards, or 120 yards across.</span> <span id="s562">And when we recited class – in class, you know, vocabulary or whatever with the windows open, she could hear us recite.</span> <span id="s563">Okay, what’s that [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s564">So she said, I think you should – better go to school.</span> <span id="s565">Go like any other day.</span> <span id="s566">If there is a problem, we had a whistle, with which we were also summoned home if we were out in the street, I’ll blow the whistle three times.</span> <span id="s567">So I went to sc – class, and I must say my teacher, my homeroom teacher, Studienrat Klem(ph) was a fabulous guy who really supported me all the way.</span> <span id="s568">He was not a Nazi, I mean he was anything but.</span> <span id="s569">I must say the entire schoolyo – teachers’ body, with one or two exceptions, were fabulous to me and very supportive.</span> <span id="s570">So he came into class and of course in those days, you know, ba – when the teacher came into class everybody had to stand up and heil Hitler, you know, they were – and he – he would just go, sit down.</span> <span id="s571">He had to raise his hand, but it was like sit down, you know.</span> <span id="s572">He would never say heil Hitler, i-it was – so he saw me and he called me – and of course when I came into class, my classmates already looked at me like, what do you – what are you doing here?</span> <span id="s573">And I knew what had gone on at least, yeah, from the Wolfs.</span> <span id="s574">And of course there were students who came by train.</span> <span id="s575">They weren’t local, they – they came from surrounding villages and walking through town from the railroad station, they saw that the five remaining Jewish stores were smashed, and the word goes like wildfire.</span> <span id="s576">So everybody in class knew and they looked at me, but nobody said anything.</span> <span id="s577">And he – the – Klem(ph) called me up and said, do you know what is going on in town?</span> <span id="s578">I said yes, I heard.</span> <span id="s579">He says, do you want to stay in school?</span> <span id="s580">I said yes, I’d like to stay in school, school like any other day.</span> <span id="s581">He says okay, any time you want to go home, you can go.</span> <span id="s582">So I went, and the intermission was at 10 o’clock and I looked over to our house and everything was quiet.</span> <span id="s583">I could see our kitchen and bedroom windows from the schoolyard.</span> <span id="s584">And I went back into class and then at about a quarter to 11 or so, I heard my mother blow the whistle.</span> <span id="s585">So I asked Studienrat Klem(ph), I – may I go home?</span> <span id="s586">Yes, of course.</span> <span id="s587">And yeah, I did this very unobtrusive, I left my books there.</span> <span id="s588">I just went out of the classroom like I went to the toilet, but I didn’t come back.</span> <span id="s589">I didn’t want to make waves, you know, picking up my books and – and going out.</span> <span id="s590">I left my books and I just – like I went to the bathroom, but I went home.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: This is tape number two, side B.</span> <span id="s593">You were talking about how you left school after your mother blew the whistle.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: She certainly did.</span> <span id="s595">So I – I went home and my mother told me that the Gestapo was there – well, yeah, every town had a – th-the police, the city police, they was – they also had a couple of Gestapo agents who were whatever, that they – that part of the police were there and took my father into protective custody, that was the term, schutzhaft, protective custody.</span> <span id="s596">And they were at the police station and – and they asked her, don’t you have a son?</span> <span id="s597">And my mother says, my son is in school, where he should be.</span> <span id="s598">Oh.</span> <span id="s599">Okay.</span> <span id="s600">That was that.</span> <span id="s601">They didn’t ask any further.</span> <span id="s602">And of course there were no phones, nobody – we di – yes, we did have a telephone, but we didn’t dare use the phone because we knew it was listened to or whatever.</span> <span id="s603">So one of our – the girl – the family under us, Rusterveld, where the f – man was, you know, forced into retirement, he had a daughter, she was a couple of years older than I, Alsa(ph) and she ran errands for us.</span> <span id="s604">And they were violently anti-Nazi.</span> <span id="s605">She said, I don’t want you to go out, I’ll do some shopping for you and you’re not gonna stay in your apartment, you come and stay with us.</span> <span id="s606">And we did.</span> <span id="s607">And then the word, you know, from other Jewish family, we – we – my – I think we found out from the – through the grapevine that the men were leaving the police station and that they were being sent to Hamburg.</span> <span id="s608">And then the word came down that from Hamburg they were sent to Berlin.</span> <span id="s609">And fr – in ber – from Berlin to concentration camp Oranienburg, which was near Berlin.</span> <span id="s610">So we already were breathing a sigh of relief be – that they didn’t go to Dachau.</span> <span id="s611">Dachau, near Munich had the worst reputation, that Dachau was – was torture.</span> <span id="s612">The others were really just sort of like considered better grade detention facilities, whatever, as far as we knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: How did you, as a 14 year old know about Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: Well you – you heard that people were put into concentration camps and – katset(ph), as it was referred to, for any infraction.</span> <span id="s615">Jews, I mean who – Jews who had sex with – with Gentile – with the Christian women, off into the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s616">For whatever – whatever reason, if you broke any of the laws, and that was the Nuremberger(ph) laws, where th-there was no, you know, wha-whatever.</span> <span id="s617">Cohabitation or – and we knew they were concentration camps, everybody knew.</span> <span id="s618">Everybody knew they were concentration camps, and what went on in them, and men – occasionally you heard of people – well, that’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: What – what was your mother’s emotional state of mind when your father was first taken away, and yours?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: Well, when – we felt helpless, frustrated.</span> <span id="s621">We thought that’s the end, you know, we – we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s622">They said it’s – well, only protective custody, but then they went to – we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s623">You really – and you don’t – you don’t think, you don’t anticipate, you don’t know.</span> <span id="s624">You really don’t know.</span> <span id="s625">I mean, you heard of people who came back, who were released from concentration camps and you also heard from people where the families had been notified they had a heart attack and was called – yeah, in German, heart attack is called herz schlag.</span> <span id="s626">And the – that – that used to – used to be called a schlag aufs herz, which you know, play on words.</span> <span id="s627">I-Instead of a herz schlag you had a – okay.</span> <span id="s628">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: Wer – were you frightened when your father was taken away?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: I wasn’t there.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: No, but when you came home and heard?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: When I – well, I was shocked.</span> <span id="s633">I mean, I was, you know, I was – yes, I mean it was complete upheaval of you know, you felt absolutely helpless.</span> <span id="s634">I guess – you know, you – you feel like no – I tell you, the only – the only thing I can compare it with is, have you ever been in a – either a hurricane or an earthquake, where you feel absolutely helpless?</span> <span id="s635">Okay, you – there’s nothing you can do to try and save yourself or whatever.</span> <span id="s636">It’s that kind of a feeling, that it’s beyond your control.</span> <span id="s637">But we also – I mean, my mother was a very rational individual and I think she kept her cool, and you know, maybe also for my consideration she didn’t go to pieces and she – well, she didn't – wouldn’t serve any purpose, she wasn’t that kind of an individual.</span> <span id="s638">Some people function best under pressure, as I do and which is a blessing.</span> <span id="s639">You know, other people react negatively.</span> <span id="s640">Well, we didn't.</span> <span id="s641">And well then, of course, what – can you do anything?</span> <span id="s642">We couldn’t do anything other than setting things in motion to get me out of the country.</span> <span id="s643">The only solution, of course, was Holland.</span> <span id="s644">And no telephone calls, you would write.</span> <span id="s645">Everything was by mail, you know.</span> <span id="s646">So my uncle agreed to take me in and started things rolling.</span> <span id="s647">Of course it wasn’t that easy in Holland either.</span> <span id="s648">Holland didn’t want any Jews.</span> <span id="s649">Even Holland didn’t – only if – you know, mm – so it took six weeks until I could get out from my –</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: Di-Di-Did you go to school during that time?</span> <span id="s651">Did you go to school after your father was taken away?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: [indecipherable] No, I didn’t, no.</span> <span id="s653">The – November 10th was my last day in school.</span> <span id="s654">After that there was no – no more school for me or anybody else.</span> <span id="s655">I mean, it was a miracle that I went to a non-Jewish school.</span> <span id="s656">See, the law by then had already changed, that wherever there were Jewish schools, that the Jews were no longer allowed to go to Christian schools, but there was nothing in Celle and I was the only Jew.</span> <span id="s657">Now the Wolf children, Herbert was already – he was goi – he was, I think in Hamburg or somewhere, they had put him into a Jewish school in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s658">So their children were already out of their local schools.</span> <span id="s659">I was really the only Jew in the German school system there.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: You were talking about six weeks to get to be able to go to Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: No, my father – my father – this is, I think, significant.</span> <span id="s662">On December 17th, my father came back.</span> <span id="s663">We didn't know, we had no word that I know of, until he walked in.</span> <span id="s664">I don’t know, I don’t remember whether he phoned or whatever.</span> <span id="s665">I doubt it.</span> <span id="s666">We weren’t a telephone oriented and we couldn’t trust the telephone.</span> <span id="s667">My father was released on December 16th from Oranienburg together with Hans Solomon, who was this – the younger man, the family that we were friendly with.</span> <span id="s668">Of course, all the German – th-the Jews from Celle were sent to the same camp, Oranienburg.</span> <span id="s669">And I think Lotheim had already been released a week earlier, but I couldn’t be sure, because he was – he was in his 70’s.</span> <span id="s670">Hans and my father came out, as I say, on the 16th.</span> <span id="s671">They were just discharged and Hans was a – in his early 30’s then, he was very inventive, he’s a sharp guy.</span> <span id="s672">And my father, you know, was nearly blind, so they took the old – the hat that – that they were getting in – giving – all their clothes had been disinfected and just rolled in a ball, they were crumpled and smelled from this disinfectant, I can smell it today.</span> <span id="s673">And they – he went to the railroad station and took his hat and went begging, you know, with a blind man, you know, here’s a blind man, please give the blind – and they got enough money together from Germans to go from Oranienburg to Berlin, and Hans’s sister-in-law lived in Berlin.</span> <span id="s674">They went to the sister-in-law, her husband had of course also been taken but she was at home, and he bought enough money for the railroad fair for the two of them to come back to Celle.</span> <span id="s675">And then they walked in and I remember my father coming in, his – well, he didn’t have much hair, but the head was completely shaved and this horrible smell of the disinfectant.</span> <span id="s676">And his body smelled from – you know, the only food that they got was – apparently the Germans took whale blubber and cooked that into a stew and that’s what they got to eat, that and some potatoes.</span> <span id="s677">And most people couldn’t eat it.</span> <span id="s678">Hans ate it, and whoever didn’t want to, couldn’t stomach this stuff.</span> <span id="s679">It smelled fa – and my father e-exuded this smell of whale blubber oil type.</span> <span id="s680">I mean, incred – I – I – I can smell it just thinking about it.</span> <span id="s681">And Hans was the only guy in the whole Oranienburg camp who gained weight, because he ate everybody el – what everybody else could – he was that kind of a guy.</span> <span id="s682">And then my father sat down and he cried.</span> <span id="s683">I had never seen my father cry, and he related the tortures that they had gone through.</span> <span id="s684">They had to stand at attention, now this was December, to stand at attention for six hours and if somebody dropped they weren’t allowed to help them.</span> <span id="s685">And just, you know, the bunks, that was where they slept over there, wer – where they – and how they were well, humiliated and somebody broke an infraction, everybody – everybody out to witness how they were put aufbuch(ph) that was – it was a – a wooden whatever, gadget, where they were strung up, I guess, spread eagle and whipped 25 lashes in front of everybody.</span> <span id="s686">Or 50, whatever – whatever the leader of – you know, and people were dropping and collapsing and watching that.</span> <span id="s687">And I guess luckily my father couldn’t see too much.</span> <span id="s688">He wa – he – they had taken his glasses away from him, he was like a blind man.</span> <span id="s689">He didn’t see it, but he heard it, of course.</span> <span id="s690">And he would – he would tal – and he never talked about anything, but he was talking about it, and who could listen to that?</span> <span id="s691">And he’d break down and cry.</span> <span id="s692">And I left then, a week later, on the twe – December 24th, I left for Holland.</span> <span id="s693">Now here’s again a little well, incidence of the spirit that we had.</span> <span id="s694">When you left Germany of course, you weren’t allowed to take any valuables with you, anything that was called der wiesen(ph), de wiesen(ph) is what the Germans – what you consider either cash or anything that is of international value that can be translated into money afterwards.</span> <span id="s695">And of course, jewelry was already – I think there was also in August ’38 that Jews had to turn in all their gold, they weren’t allowed to have any jewelry other than their wedding rings.</span> <span id="s696">And well, what do you do with that?</span> <span id="s697">Yeah, how di – ho-how – do you keep your diamonds, do you keep, if you have any, you know, decision.</span> <span id="s698">And then if the house was searched and the – they find anything, you’d be – everything would taken, you – they could do whatever they wanted to.</span> <span id="s699">You were – you had broken an existing law, whatever.</span> <span id="s700">So – but I think my mother kept her – her diamond ring or whatever.</span> <span id="s701">Bril – brilliant ring, that was.</span> <span id="s702">And some family jewels that we didn’t turn in, had it – had been in the family for a couple of generations, we refused to turn in.</span> <span id="s703">See, you took the chances on that, you defied – you defied the orders and you tried to hide it or get it out, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: During the six weeks from the time that your father came home to until you left, did he gain his strength back?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: Well, he – no, he didn’t.</span> <span id="s706">I mean, he was only home a week.</span> <span id="s707">Yeah, I saw him only for a week because he came back on December 16th and I left on the 24th.</span> <span id="s708">But now I had to – I had a stamp collection, which was a – you know, I collected stamps.</span> <span id="s709">Uncle Wilhelm from Holland was in international business, he would send me stamps, I collected, I had a – I had a German album.</span> <span id="s710">I had a nice collection.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: Your – your uncle’s name was what?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: Wil – Wilhelm Marx.</span> <span id="s713">Wilhelm in Dutch.</span> <span id="s714">So I – so that I would not have to open my suitcase at the Dutch border, you could have it examined locally, you would ta – you could take it to the finance amt, the – the – the tax hall, or whatever, tax inspector and they also were responsible for customs, and have it inspected and sealed there, and that seal then, you could take it acro – so my mother didn’t want me to have to unpack my stuff, open it up at two o’clock in the morning when I was at the Dutch border.</span> <span id="s715">So I put my suitcase on my bicycle, took my bicycle over there and I went by myself.</span> <span id="s716">My mother did not go with me.</span> <span id="s717">I went by myself, 14 years old.</span> <span id="s718">We grew up, we had to be independent, we had to be self sufficient and we learned – I mean, we had no childhood, we were – we were young adults.</span> <span id="s719">I mean, we were – there was no time for childhood.</span> <span id="s720">So, they looked at the stuff, everything, your – all the clothes that you took out, nothing could be new, everything had to be washed so that you couldn’t resell it in a foreign country.</span> <span id="s721">Everything had to have a monogram and – or initials in – in it, either sewn on or embroidered.</span> <span id="s722">Everything had to be identified as being your personal whatever.</span> <span id="s723">I took my stamp albums with me, and this a – one agent looked at it and he says, stamps?</span> <span id="s724">I don’t think you can take stamps.</span> <span id="s725">I knew that you couldn’t take stamps, this was – because stamps was a wonderful way of transferring value out and selling it in the – you know, and turn it into money.</span> <span id="s726">I knew that.</span> <span id="s727">I said, what do you mean, I can’t?</span> <span id="s728">And then the o – another agent came.</span> <span id="s729">He says, oh come on, he says, that’s a – that’s a student collection, let him take the stamps.</span> <span id="s730">And inside – of course I didn’t move a muscle, you know, but inside I know, boy I got here – I got one past them.</span> <span id="s731">I – and of course, I took my s – my stamps and I came to the border at one o’clock in the morning and –</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: Y-You said goodbye – so you didn’t go back home?</span> <span id="s733">Did you –</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: Oh no, no – oh yes, I went back home and then I’m – this was a couple of days before.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: And then with the – with the suitcase with the seal on it and the rucksack with the stuff and – you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: What was it like to say goodbye to your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: Well, I really don’t remember.</span> <span id="s739">Tearful, I suppose.</span> <span id="s740">And my parents took me to the train station.</span> <span id="s741">I don’t even remember if my father went along, because he wasn’t good for anything, he was just [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s742">I – I think only my mother went with me.</span> <span id="s743">I think I said goodbye to my father at home and my mother took me to the train station, and I got on the train to Rotterdam and at the border, the, you know, came, pass(ph) kontrolle, you know, koffer auf machen.</span> <span id="s744">And I said ma – it had the – the suitcase has already been inspected and sealed.</span> <span id="s745">They looked at the seal, okay, can put it back up, and that was it, and inside I was laughing.</span> <span id="s746">And – well, then as I rolled through the Dutch countryside, it looked awfully good, seeing the cows and you know, the – came – arrived in Rotterdam.</span> <span id="s747">Of course, my uncle met me at the train station and it was a whole new life.</span> <span id="s748">So now I was safe in Holland and my mother, in the meantime – now, my father had been released from Oranienburg.</span> <span id="s749">He had to sign a waiver that – yeah, he had to sign a paper.</span> <span id="s750">Germans were great at that, I’m sure you know that, that he was not mistreated in any way and that he would leave Germany within 90 days.</span> <span id="s751">At that point, of course, they only wanted to get rid of the Germans – oh, of the Jews, and you could even at that point still take your furniture with you, anything that was personal belongings, so my – my mother had to do everything, she did everything, arranged for a – in Bremen, which was the other port, besides Hamburg, to have a – well, today we would call it a container, was a liftbahn(ph).</span> <span id="s752">There was a huge box, room size was built and your furniture were put into it and everything was packed, so she prepared for that.</span> <span id="s753">And by March, March 15th they had to leave because my father’s 90 days were up, and my uncle managed to get them into Holland because we had the American visa applications, he could prove to the Dutch government that we were only in transit and that he would – he had to guarantee of course, that he – he would vou – that we wouldn’t be a financial burden to the Dutch government.</span> <span id="s754">The Dutch did a lot, more than most, but – they took children, but a-adults?</span> <span id="s755">Nobody wanted the Jews.</span> <span id="s756">So in – you know, in transit we could stay then, and we – my parents rented a room to live in and we ate at my uncles, and it was a – I went to s – of course started going to school in Holland, went to a trade school and learned a trade and on – then the American visa came up and my parents ni – the decision, the family decision was to take – we had three numbers that my mother had gotten for my father, my mother and me.</span> <span id="s757">Harry was already in Holland.</span> <span id="s758">But the decision was made, since he was the older one, he had already completed school, he was already, you know, an apprentice at a electri – electrician’s job, to take him along to America because my father was unfit to work, he was emotionally, physically broken, he really never regained his health.</span> <span id="s759">The American consulate was very kind and looked the other way and – and I mean, they could be tough too, you know.</span> <span id="s760">As a matter of fact, the – when they were called – we were called to the American consulate for the examination, had to be a physical examination interview before you got your American visa stamped into your passport.</span> <span id="s761">And we went already a couple of weeks before and we listened in the – in the anteroom as people were reading the eye chart.</span> <span id="s762">First line, A, E, F, G, K. Line two, etcetera, and we wrote it down and my father memorized it.</span> <span id="s763">And came time for him to examine, sat there and he started reciting it.</span> <span id="s764">I’m sure, yeah, the examiner looked at his glasses, he must have known, yeah.</span> <span id="s765">Now, read this line again, my father – yeah, and he would point at the bottom line, and you know.</span> <span id="s766">Anyway, he passed and they left with my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: Wa – why didn't your mother get four visas?</span> <span id="s768">Why did she just get three?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: Because she was thinking Harry is safe in Holland, you know?</span> <span id="s770">That’s why.</span> <span id="s771">But we could have – the American consul in – in Rotterdam said to my mother, why don’t you take your s – take Kurt with you also?</span> <span id="s772">Said well, we want him to finish school here, and Uncle Wilhelm, who was in an international business, he was in contact with people all over the world, he was a grain merchant and he was convinced that Holland would remain neutral.</span> <span id="s773">I mean, don’t forget, in the meantime the war had started, the Sitzkrieg as it was called.</span> <span id="s774">I don’t know, you familiar with that term?</span> <span id="s775">The sitting war, where French and Germans were staring at each other across their fortification, the Maginot line and the Siegfried line.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: And, I mean, the war had started in August ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: And so we were aware of what was going on, you know, but my uncle was convinced that – that Holland would remain neutral, that the Germans would need Rotterdam as a window to the world, just as they did during World War I and so he convinced my mother to let me stay in Holland and finish school.</span> <span id="s780">And it made business sense, you come to America, I was still of school age, my father couldn’t work, who is gonna support us, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: What were your thoughts about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: Didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s783">My thought – I mean, whatever the – whatever the decision was, children weren’t asked in those days and I was – I was happy to stay with my uncle and finish school and all.</span> <span id="s784">I thought it was best for me to finish school rather than starting to – you know, and I studied English, I was learning English, and to go to America as prepared as I could be rather than coming in there having no trade, not knowing your language, etcetera.</span> <span id="s785">So it was – was a rational decision and we were – we were convinced that Holland would stay neutral.</span> <span id="s786">So anyway – so there was the story.</span> <span id="s787">So they left on April 5th, 1940.</span> <span id="s788">While they were at sea, on April 10th,1940, Germany invaded Norway and overran Denmark, and my mother was in panic.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Kurt Roberg.</span> <span id="s791">This is tape number three, side A. And your parents and brother are on the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: Yes, it is April 5th, 1940, they – my parents have – and Harry have left for America and I guess it’s April 10th now and they have found out about the invasion of – by Germany of Norway and Denmark and my mother is panicked and up in arms and of course she wrote a letter on board which was posted in New York, air mail, via Lisbon to americ – to – to Holland and reached us, I guess, just before the invasion of the Netherlands by the Germans.</span> <span id="s793">And of course on May 10th, 1940, six o’clock in the morning, we woke up and I heard planes, and having lived in Celle, where we had two air bases nearby, I knew by sound all the German planes, and I woke up and I heard and I said to my uncle, Uncle Wilhelm, I said, those sound like Ju-52.</span> <span id="s794">That’s the Junkers 52 transport plane that was used for parachute jumps.</span> <span id="s795">He says, you’re crazy.</span> <span id="s796">Ah, I was right, and he wasn’t.</span> <span id="s797">For once he was not right.</span> <span id="s798">And well, the invasion came.</span> <span id="s799">The Dutch, who thought that if they inundated the – you know, th-the – the land and they could stop the Germans, but the Germans came by parachute.</span> <span id="s800">They – we lived in Rotterdam, they came down and – and the Dutch Marines held the Maas bridges for three days, didn’t surrender them to the Germans, and I as a German citizen, having a German passport, which incidentally was on the – in the – at the American consulate in Rotterdam, we – I was – the Dutch police came, since I was registered as a German citizen living with my uncle in Holland.</span> <span id="s801">The fact that you are Jewish, well, didn’t mean anything to the Dutch.</span> <span id="s802">You were German or you were Dutch or you were whatever.</span> <span id="s803">And politically it didn’t make any difference.</span> <span id="s804">I mean, the individual policeman could have been sympathetic and knew what a – that the German Jews were not – you know, in – were not sympathetic to the German government, but there were also a lot of other Germans living in Holland who might have been, and there was a fifth column in Holland, wa – a Nazi party run by Mussert.</span> <span id="s805">And the Mussert Nazis in Holland were a force and the – so we were interned and my uncle, of course, you can imagine how he felt.</span> <span id="s806">He had convinced my mother to let me stay and, you know, go to school in Holland, and I was being interned, and now we didn't know what was gonna happen.</span> <span id="s807">So they took us to all the other – I knew some of the German refugees, Jewish refugees in Holland and we were all taken to a large meeting hall, which was right next to the police headquarters and we were kept there.</span> <span id="s808">They brought in mattresses, they put them down on the big dance floor in the dance hall and that was our temporary lodgings.</span> <span id="s809">And we were there for four days and then on May 14th at noon – we were kept informed of what was happening, now there was – already there were rumors that the Dutch – the – that the Germans had poisoned the water.</span> <span id="s810">This was all – the fifth column spread these rumors to force the Dutch to surrender, and there were all sorts of rumors spreading and anyway, th – by one o’clock the Germans start – 1:30 the Germans started bombing Rotterdam.</span> <span id="s811">Now Rotterdam had been declared an open city as of noon on Tuesday because the Dutch were ready to surrender and they didn’t want the t-town – it’s not a military target to – to be bombed, but the Germans bombed it anyway, claiming that the order came too late and they couldn’t stop the bombers that were on the way, like they had no radio, or whatever.</span> <span id="s812">And they bombed Rotterdam and of course as soon as the bombs started falling and our building was bombed too, the man standing next to me was hit by a shrapnel.</span> <span id="s813">I had learned in Germany – as part of our preparation for the war, when I was still going to school, we had air raid drills.</span> <span id="s814">Oh, there was a systematic preparation of the German population for war.</span> <span id="s815">That if there’s an air raid and you’re in a building, stand in a doorway.</span> <span id="s816">That’s what I did, and that’s what saved me.</span> <span id="s817">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: So you were in this big dance hall when this bombing started?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: We were – yes, right.</span> <span id="s820">But of course the Dutch guards who were assigned to guard us, they said look, you know, we’re being bombed, run, save yourselves.</span> <span id="s821">They let us go.</span> <span id="s822">They knew it was over, and you know, there was no sense in keeping us.</span> <span id="s823">So I ran home.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: Were you with your uncle at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: No, no, my uncle – I was – I was the – he was a Dutch citizen, he wasn’t touched.</span> <span id="s826">I as a 15 year old was interned by the Dutch.</span> <span id="s827">He was a Dutch citizen, he wasn’t touched.</span> <span id="s828">So he didn't know what happened to me and he tried to find out and they said well, we are safe and we are being well fed, which we were, and – but we were retained.</span> <span id="s829">And they couldn’t put us in jail, they didn’t have enough jail space.</span> <span id="s830">So they interned us in this dance hall.</span> <span id="s831">So I ran home and –</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: Did you have any communication with him while you were in – interned?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: No, nothing, there’s no communication.</span> <span id="s834">There are no telephone call.</span> <span id="s835">You are interned, you’re out of – that’s it.</span> <span id="s836">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: How did you – how did you manage that emotionally, being on your own without him, witho –</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: I managed, I managed, there’s – there wasn’t – there wasn’t a problem, I – I was self sufficient.</span> <span id="s839">You – when you grew up in Nazi Germany, at age 14 I was self sufficient, certainly at age 15, yeah, just was a year later.</span> <span id="s840">So I had no – I had no problems with that.</span> <span id="s841">I – I could fend for myself.</span> <span id="s842">And I ran home.</span> <span id="s843">I went into our house, I had the keys.</span> <span id="s844">And my uncle’s car wasn’t there and a couple of his personal things were gone, so I knew that he had left.</span> <span id="s845">I took my bicycle, took a few things into my rucksack and took my stamp collection that I had saved once, put them the back on my bike and took off with the bike and out of the city.</span> <span id="s846">Now, we only had – we had relatives who lived in a suburb called Hillerhausberg(ph), and I decided to go there, but to go there I had to well, go through a railroad – go through a railroad underpass and of course the road was jammed with cars, but I was on a bicycle, there were a few other people on bicycles, you know, Holland is a – bicycle is a means of transportation and there weren’t that many cars in 1940.</span> <span id="s847">But I got through this traffic jam with my bicycle faster than the cars and I went to Hillerhausberg(ph) and when I got there I saw my uncle’s car standing in front of the house that I was visiting, of course he was very happy to see me.</span> <span id="s848">He didn’t know what had hap – what would happen to me, whether I was alive, or whatever.</span> <span id="s849">And so we had a happy reunion.</span> <span id="s850">Then that night and then the following night we saw Rotterdam burn.</span> <span id="s851">The Germans had thrown a lot of incendiary bombs and Rotterdam went up in smoke, the old Rotterdam.</span> <span id="s852">And then eventually, after I guess about four or five days after the fires were out we returned back to our address on Mauritsweg, and we found that the city was well, burned, the center of the city.</span> <span id="s853">And our house was the second house left standing.</span> <span id="s854">Next to us – these are very much like the brownstones in New York.</span> <span id="s855">They are one room wide and foos – three stories high, but they’re with a stoop.</span> <span id="s856">And our house was standing.</span> <span id="s857">Our neighbor’s next to us was standing and that was the m – consul of Monaco lived there and the flag was still flying.</span> <span id="s858">And I came into our house, nothing was touched.</span> <span id="s859">There was no pilfering, there was no looting, not a window was broken.</span> <span id="s860">It was, yeah, really everything was untouched.</span> <span id="s861">Well, we moved back in, but now the – the Germans of course came – came in that very afternoon.</span> <span id="s862">I saw Germans everywhere and we really felt we were – well, we were occupied.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: What was it like for you to see the Germans again?</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: Terrible.</span> <span id="s865">It was really, I mean like – like a 10 ton weight was put on you.</span> <span id="s866">Before I had felt free, that freedom I felt when I left the German border behind me, this, you know, breathing free, and no – now I don’t have to watch any more what I am saying, I don’t have to be on my guard constantly.</span> <span id="s867">You don’t have to look over your shoulder or try and anticipate what the people around you do, how they act and react and all that.</span> <span id="s868">All that was gone, and – but at least I knew what to expect and what to do.</span> <span id="s869">Now the Germans, at that point they came in and they really tried to befriend, or have the Dutch befriend them.</span> <span id="s870">They were – they did not act as occupiers or so, at least their, well, PR relations, as we would say today, they – they really tried to win the Dutch over to them by, you know, propaganda articles, radio broadcasts.</span> <span id="s871">Of course everything was taken over, we are not here, we – we – this was a tactical move, we had to do that to prevent the British from invading you.</span> <span id="s872">And we are, you know, you – or you are Aryan just as we are, and try to, you know, take that tack to win the Dutch over.</span> <span id="s873">But in the meantime, of course, the Dutch knew what the Germans were like, most Dutch.</span> <span id="s874">And that were there to grab the food and they were exba – sending all the produce – Holland was known for cream and cheese and butter and all the, you know, good things in life that – that was being sent to Germany, and of course that was the case.</span> <span id="s875">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: Speaking about Aryan, did you – was your coloring very dark?</span> <span id="s877">What did you look like, physically?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: My – no, I – as – as they used to say in America, I could pass.</span> <span id="s879">I didn’t look Jewish.</span> <span id="s880">There’s a little anecdote I can tell you that happened in 1936 while I was still in – in Germany, and Harry, my brother was still in class.</span> <span id="s881">Of course the edict had come down, the instructions that race theory had to be taught in school.</span> <span id="s882">And that – our biology teacher ha – also happened to be my brother’s homeroom teacher.</span> <span id="s883">So one day i-in class, says well, today we will talk about the Aryan race.</span> <span id="s884">We know of course that the characteristics of the Aryan race are a long – you know, oval face, high forehead, blue eyes, straight nose, blon – blonde hair.</span> <span id="s885">And he looked around the classroom and he said, like Roberg, for instance.</span> <span id="s886">And he did that very deliberately, to make a point.</span> <span id="s887">I don’t know on – how many got the point that he made in the class, but he did it because he felt good about it.</span> <span id="s888">It turned out – I found out after – I visited this teacher, Dr. Riegerberg(ph) after the war when I came back to Germany, and I visited with him, and I found out then that he had a Jewish grandmother that some of his colleagues knew about, but nobody would tell.</span> <span id="s889">And they protected him until 1944 when the director of the school thought it was best if he would take early retirement, just to protect him.</span> <span id="s890">So those were the games people played, okay, and that was – so you asked me whether I looked Jewish, that’s my answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: Okay, we’re back in Rotterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: We’re back in Rotterdam.</span> <span id="s893">My uncle sold his car.</span> <span id="s894">I taught him how to ride a bike, he hadn’t ridden a bike since he was a boy.</span> <span id="s895">And we – well, we pared down.</span> <span id="s896">His business, of course, was gone.</span> <span id="s897">He was a well-to-do man, but you know, there was no more international grain trade.</span> <span id="s898">And my – I had no papers at this point.</span> <span id="s899">My passport had been at the American consulate, which went up in flames with the rest of the city.</span> <span id="s900">So first I had to get a new German passport, and that took about three months.</span> <span id="s901">By –</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: Were you ever in fear for your life during any of this time?</span> <span id="s903">Direct fear of your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: From the Germans, no.</span> <span id="s905">During the bombing, mm, I ran pretty fast.</span> <span id="s906">But not really.</span> <span id="s907">I can’t say that I was ever afraid because – I think because I was prepared, I was – you know, as a child I think the air raid drills, that’s something to – really that has served me well throughout my life is I believe in preparation because I learned nearly in life that preparation and knowing what your alternatives are, making several choices, having a plan A, B and C is good planning and gets you set, you know, for various eventualities.</span> <span id="s908">So maybe I can, you know, look at that as a positive thing that came out of this.</span> <span id="s909">Anyway, by about July, August, the Germans were, of course, pre-preparing for the invasion of Great Britain.</span> <span id="s910">And whatever was afloat, they requisitioned.</span> <span id="s911">They were requisitioning every barge, every boat, every whatever.</span> <span id="s912">But is also showed to us and the Dutch that they really hadn’t prepared – I think the war went so well for them, both in France and Belgium and in Holland, you know, they wiped out the allies and came to – to the North Sea and the channel, and really weren't prepared to invade – to invade England when the time was right.</span> <span id="s913">Had they prepared a – an invasion fleet to follow up on the ground victory, England would have been mincemeat.</span> <span id="s914">So then they – the – well, the Battle of Britain and the air war started and we followed that, of course, from Holland and we would listen to BBC.</span> <span id="s915">The mul – the Dutch channel, the Orange channel broadcast every night at nine o’clock and all Dutch would listen to that.</span> <span id="s916">And of course you risked whatever, your freedom, your life, if the Germans found out that you listened to – to – and they could arrest you, arrest you, but you took the chance and you did it discreetly, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: Were you permitted to have a radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: At that point in Holland, yes, they couldn't control it.</span> <span id="s919">In Germany, of course, Jews weren’t allowed to have radios any more since 1936, I think.</span> <span id="s920">But yes, you were allowed to have radio because the – also they, at that point still wanted to look like the good Germans so they didn’t come out with the edicts of no radios, or no this or that.</span> <span id="s921">Of course, it was known that – that you weren't allowed to listen to the enemy, but who cared?</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: To – to back up a little bit, do you remember your 16th birthday in May 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: That’s a good question.</span> <span id="s924">I remember my 16th birthday, yes, and we celebrated it in Hillerhausberg(ph) and my uncle was – and I was exceedingly glad to be able to celebrate it.</span> <span id="s925">I don’t know how we celebrated it, but I guess we found a little cake.</span> <span id="s926">You know, the Dutch are very good at finding sweets somewhere, so I’m sure that we did it the right way.</span> <span id="s927">I don’t remember the details, but yes, yeah, it’s – it’s interesting for you to note that it was right there in the thick of it, while Rotterdam burned.</span> <span id="s928">By about August then, when the invasion plans of the Germans became more prominent, all German born Jews were ordered to leave the coastal zone of, I think 25 kilometers.</span> <span id="s929">So I had to move from Rotterdam and an aunt and uncle of mine, who were the parents of a cousin, ma – that’s my uncle’s older sister and her husband, they had also come to Holland because her daughter lived in Holland.</span> <span id="s930">And we then had to move out of the Rotterdam area, further inland and we went to How-da, which to Americans in pronounced Gouda, where the cheese comes from.</span> <span id="s931">And I con – we rented a small apartment in a farmhouse and Aunt Lena kept house for her husband and me and I went to trade school.</span> <span id="s932">I resigned from the Rotterdam trade school that I went to and went to the trade school, continued in trade school in Gouda.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: Stu – studying what?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: Oh, I was studying auto mechanics.</span> <span id="s935">But in order to become an auto mechanic the first year we had to work on bicycles, the second year on motorcycles and the third year on automobiles.</span> <span id="s936">So I was up to working on an old Nash engine.</span> <span id="s937">And while we were there, my uncle, in the meantime or – yeah, I – I had to get a new passport which eventually I – I got from the Germans, of course, you know, with the new photo and a big J stamped into it again, J for Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: Was the name Israel in it?</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s940">Kurt – Kurt Walter Israel.</span> <span id="s941">I still have the passport, so I can check that.</span> <span id="s942">And well, went to school and we heard from America.</span> <span id="s943">Of course, America heard from us via Portugal.</span> <span id="s944">I still have the card, the first card that we sent to America, a postcard.</span> <span id="s945">You were only allowed to send postcards, no letters, because it was easier for the Germans to censor them.</span> <span id="s946">Read a postcard easier than opening up a letter and closing it again.</span> <span id="s947">Where we –</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: What – what kind of things did you say on the postcard?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: Very interesting that you – I have the postcard.</span> <span id="s950">We wrote it, of course, in Dutch, even though my parents didn’t understand Dutch, but Harry was there to translate it, and I wouldn’t have written in German for all the tea in China.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: Why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: Because we hated the Germans.</span> <span id="s953">I felt like a – like a Dutch person, I wanted to have nothing to do with – with Germans and I sort of denied that I – you know, that I certainly would not let them know, or give them the satisfaction or make it easy for them to read my mail.</span> <span id="s954">So this was – this is the only way we could get back.</span> <span id="s955">But there was that, you know, resentment – well, resentment, you’re gonna make it as tough for them as possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: Were you still speaking in German though, to your uncle?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: No, we spoke Dutch only.</span> <span id="s958">Oh no, we – we – at that point we wouldn’t have spoken German for anything, either in public or even in private.</span> <span id="s959">With my uncle and aunt, I mean, Aunt Lena of course, I had to speak German because they didn’t understand any Dutch.</span> <span id="s960">But I was fluent in Dutch and of course, you know, in school.</span> <span id="s961">So – no, but we wouldn't have spoken German for anything, so my corresponding was in – but I wrote everything in – well, we had a – a code.</span> <span id="s962">This interesting point that you make.</span> <span id="s963">This is something that we had already developed while living in Germany.</span> <span id="s964">When – when we wrote from Germany, let’s say to Holland or to relatives, we would write it in such a way that they understood what we were talking about but nobody else could.</span> <span id="s965">For instance, in Celle, the – the captain of the volunteer fire brigade, his name was Schnell, which happens to be quick, okay?</span> <span id="s966">Schnell.</span> <span id="s967">So I wrote on this postcard, we are well.</span> <span id="s968">Our old neighbor Herr Schnell had plenty of work for at least a week.</span> <span id="s969">So they knew how to interpret that, the censor didn’t.</span> <span id="s970">So this is how we got the information across without, you know – anyway, it worked for us and I think all families had that.</span> <span id="s971">Or we would – we would refer to family members who were already somewhere else, you know.</span> <span id="s972">If – if we had a relative, let’s say, in Switzerland, we would say Uncle S-Simon, you know, we were able to get in touch with Uncle Simon and send him something.</span> <span id="s973">Meaning we were able to send something to Switzerland, okay?</span> <span id="s974">So that’s how we disguised information.</span> <span id="s975">I think that was pretty common.</span> <span id="s976">You just had to adapt to conditions, and you did.</span> <span id="s977">And it became actually, a sport to try to outwit the Germans.</span> <span id="s978">That was our mentality and it was also, that’s what kept us going.</span> <span id="s979">Chronologically now I want to move on to – my uncle, of course, was trying desperately at that point to try and get me to America.</span> <span id="s980">Don’t forget, America was still neutral.</span> <span id="s981">Then he found out in oh, about in October, November must have been, sometime in the fall of 1940 that someone in Holland tried to organize a children’s transport to save or to reunite children who were left behind in Holland with parents who were already in America.</span> <span id="s982">I only found out about 10 years ago when I was in – in Amsterdam at the war museum and archives, who this woman was.</span> <span id="s983">And that was Mrs. Wijsmuller.</span> <span id="s984">She was – and my uncle found out about it because her husband was a shipping magnate.</span> <span id="s985">He – he owned steamships.</span> <span id="s986">And my uncle was, you know, dealt with steamship companies, being in the grain business.</span> <span id="s987">And Mrs. vice – Mefrau Wijsmuller, they were not Jewish, of course, had very good relations with the Germans, German officers, in particular.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: – volunteer collection interview with Kurt Roberg, this is tape number three, side B. And you were talking about Frau Wijsmuller.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: Mefrau Wijsmuller, spelled w-i-j-s-m-u-l-l-e-r.</span> <span id="s991">Mefrau Wijsmuller had very good relationships with German officers and other than with the Nazis and the – a lot of the military were not necessarily – the professional military were not necessarily in agreement with what the Nazi party did, or the SS did.</span> <span id="s992">So there was la – she had – she had good connections all the way to the top in Holland, and in Germany.</span> <span id="s993">And she was apparently able to persuade the Germans to let her do humanitarian things, taking – you know, reuniting children after the war who were in Holland and Belgium with the parents who were in southern France, etcetera.</span> <span id="s994">She would make a trip with six or eight children and take them to be reunited.</span> <span id="s995">On the way she would – she – she would also take medicines with her and medical supplies and she was really quite a force, and obviously very persuasive and would tha – now, there was an – there was an incident at the border too, that I understand she arranged fo – where she bribed the border guards with a couple of bottles of whiskey, etcetera.</span> <span id="s996">Here, have a good time, let me bring these children across, you know.</span> <span id="s997">And she was – she was really very good at what she did.</span> <span id="s998">So she tried to get this – this experimental group going and I think she also enlisted or tried to enlist the Red Cross and in America the HIAS, etcetera.</span> <span id="s999">She pushed all buttons, and was able to then arrange for an experimental group.</span> <span id="s1000">There were two groups, one that I was on, which was the first group.</span> <span id="s1001">We left Amsterdam on January 31, 1941.</span> <span id="s1002">I had gotten my – oh, I’m sorry, I’m – cancel that.</span> <span id="s1003">I got my American visa in Amsterdam on January 31, 1941.</span> <span id="s1004">Now that I had the visa, I was eligible for Mefrau Wijsmuller’s group of other youngsters who were also getting their American visas during February, and on March first, we left Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s1005">But, under the German rules we had to go back to Berlin because all trans – all officially sanctioned tr-transports out of greater Germany and occupied lands, originated in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: Was it – was it hard for you leave Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: It was hard for me to leave Holland because even though we were occupied, I was still among friends and now, I mean the feeling when we were on the train and we came back across the German border, I mean, there was still a border between Holland and Germany, but the border didn’t mean anything, but now everything was – and now we were traveling as a group of young Jews and well, we knew how to behave.</span> <span id="s1008">We were all German Jewish – German, yeah, refugees.</span> <span id="s1009">The oldest was 17, I was 15 and the youngest girl was 11.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: Y-You were 16, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: I was 16.</span> <span id="s1012">So we – we went back into Germany and we were told that we would get –</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: What was that like to go in – to go back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: Very oppressive.</span> <span id="s1015">Of course, we only spoke Dutch.</span> <span id="s1016">We did not acknowledge that we could speak German, even though we had German passports.</span> <span id="s1017">We could have been, you know, b-bor – come as children to Holland, we did not acknowledge Germany in any way.</span> <span id="s1018">And among ourselves we spoke Dutch so that not everybody could understand what we were saying.</span> <span id="s1019">We arrived in Berlin and we were taken under the wing – well, we arrived actually in two groups.</span> <span id="s1020">There was our group of, I think eight, and then four more came, or five more came a few days later.</span> <span id="s1021">The plan was that we would stay one week in Berlin.</span> <span id="s1022">There was a transport from Berlin once a week, from Berlin to Lisbon.</span> <span id="s1023">Now, I had received – oh, my uncle had received from my mother in America, a transatlantic cable stating that passage had been booked – passage booked for Kurt, American a – export company, 210 dollars paid, reservation booked from lis – Lisbon, New York, leaving March 15th.</span> <span id="s1024">And I had that telegram – cable.</span> <span id="s1025">I had nothing else.</span> <span id="s1026">I had no ticket or anything, just the acknowledgement.</span> <span id="s1027">When we got to Berlin and we were lodged by the – by the Jewish congregation in Berlin at a place which was home – old age home.</span> <span id="s1028">Altersheim.</span> <span id="s1029">Located at Grosse Hamburger Strasse, number 19.</span> <span id="s1030">It was a home for the aged and was also a school and th – the building – behind the building, behind the school building there was a gymnasi – a gym and that gym had been converted into a makeshift hall where there were about 80 – anywhere between 80 and 120 cots.</span> <span id="s1031">A curtain was drawn in the middle for men on the – on one side, women on the other.</span> <span id="s1032">There was one potbelly stove in the center for what passed as heat.</span> <span id="s1033">It was all, you know, improvised, but it worked and the people that were there knew they were gonna be there only a short time, but it was a transient location.</span> <span id="s1034">We ate there where they had kitchen, we ate three meals a day there and the Jewish community took care of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: So you had direct contact with these Berlin Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: Well, that was – that was arranged by the committee.</span> <span id="s1037">The committee in – in Amsterdam that had arranged for us to, you know, and was in communication with Berlin.</span> <span id="s1038">And there was also a group in Lisbon, the Jewish community, and I think the HIAS was sort of the overriding Jewish organization that coordinated that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: But my question was you ha – you were able to talk directly with these Berlin Jews, could you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: Well, there was one man –</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: – have conversation with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: – thi – well, not at large.</span> <span id="s1043">There was a man who was assigned to us.</span> <span id="s1044">He was – he was the contact, so we didn’t just – you know, he was the contact, and we also in the group, the oldest person – oh, there were two, there was one woman, Judith, she was 17, and there was a fellow with whom I became very friendly, Jerry Cohen(ph) was 17.</span> <span id="s1045">They were the – the senior people and they sort of, you know, took everybody’s passport so that – there had to be an organization.</span> <span id="s1046">They were in charge.</span> <span id="s1047">Anyway, the first day, of course, within 24 hours, within Germany, certainly within Europe, when you move, you know, you have to register.</span> <span id="s1048">When you leave Holland, whe-when I left Gouda, I had to go to the city hall and say, I’m leaving, I’m going to Berlin, I will be in Berlin, okay?</span> <span id="s1049">And then when I – when we got to Berlin we had to say, we are now in Berlin, we come from Gouda, etcetera, records, you know, transfer every – and everything with stamps and so we had to go to the city police in Berlin and s-state that we were there for one week, we were staying at Grosse Hamburger Strasse and we were going – after one week we would go – you know, continue on to Lisbon, we were in transit.</span> <span id="s1050">Fine, got permission to stay for seven days, no problem.</span> <span id="s1051">But after seven days we did not have our transit visas for Spain.</span> <span id="s1052">We needed transit visas for – well, France wasn’t a problem, that was an occupied country.</span> <span id="s1053">It’s – the Germans were in charge, but Spain and Portugal were.</span> <span id="s1054">And our passports were taken to – were taken to the Spanish consulate and they said oh, we will be glad to give you the visa, as soon as you have the Portuguese visa.</span> <span id="s1055">What’s the sense of giving you a Spanish, you don’t even have the Portuguese?</span> <span id="s1056">And unless we can be assured that you have the Portuguese so that you don’t get stuck in Spain, we will give it to you.</span> <span id="s1057">Went to the Portuguese.</span> <span id="s1058">Of course we will give you Portuguese visa, as soon as you have the Spanish visa.</span> <span id="s1059">What’s the sense of giving you a Portuguese, you don’t even have the Spanish?</span> <span id="s1060">Get the Spanish and you will get the Portuguese, okay?</span> <span id="s1061">Catch 22.</span> <span id="s1062">We went back to the Spaniards and told them.</span> <span id="s1063">And oh no, they’re wrong, they – we will give you the – it went back and forth.</span> <span id="s1064">This took, of course, more than a week so after seven days we had to go back to the Berlin police to get an extension of our permit to stay.</span> <span id="s1065">Now they got nasty, and they hollered at us in German.</span> <span id="s1066">You’re eating the bread that the German workers are entitled to.</span> <span id="s1067">The implication was that if we didn’t work, we wouldn't eat.</span> <span id="s1068">Now we also had heard and we knew that once you were assigned as a labor force, if they put you into a factory, you were – became war essential.</span> <span id="s1069">You could take your American visa and whatever, okay?</span> <span id="s1070">You would never get your exit permit.</span> <span id="s1071">So they gave us another one week extension.</span> <span id="s1072">Now within that week we still did not have the papers.</span> <span id="s1073">Now they said well, the – Berlin is not responsible for these papers, the American visa was issued in Holland.</span> <span id="s1074">The – these people came from Holland, they should have gotten their Portuguese and Spanish transit visas in Holland, not in Berlin.</span> <span id="s1075">So they took our passports and sent them back to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s1076">Now we were without identification.</span> <span id="s1077">We got, I guess, a temporary, you know, bu – I – I.D. card, whatever from the – from the – Berlin.</span> <span id="s1078">Now we did not dare to, you know, go out or whatever.</span> <span id="s1079">If we – if we would be caught without that – you know, you have to – you have to expl – well, we did go out, but only – things were very controlled in Berlin already at that time.</span> <span id="s1080">The British would fly over and bomb occasionally.</span> <span id="s1081">It was not – but they would come across, so there were air raids at night.</span> <span id="s1082">The food was rationed, of course.</span> <span id="s1083">And Jews had special ration coupons.</span> <span id="s1084">Everything was by coupons and the Jewish coupons were stamped with a red J. Jews were only allowed to buy after four p.m.</span> <span id="s1085">There was nothing left by four p.m.</span> <span id="s1086">You go into a bakery, you took whatever – if they had anything left you took what, you know, didn’t say well, I want a rye bread, you took whatever they had, right.</span> <span id="s1087">Those were the conditions.</span> <span id="s1088">Anyway, the Jewish congregation – and I’m going to try and find out how they did that, had a – had a gimmick.</span> <span id="s1089">They protected us from being assigned to the workforce, and it worked as follows.</span> <span id="s1090">We were assigned as a workforce in Berlin Wannsee.</span> <span id="s1091">Now, I don’t know whether you know what Wannsee.</span> <span id="s1092">Wannsee was there was a large estate which was – course had been Jewish, that was confiscated and had been made as a R and R retreat for the SS.</span> <span id="s1093">They were still in the process of fixing that up and the Jewish congregation apparently had somehow managed to arrange that they will supply X number of workers every day.</span> <span id="s1094">Let’s say 50 workers for doing ground keeping etcetera.</span> <span id="s1095">So now we were assigned twice a week to go out and work in Wannsee.</span> <span id="s1096">The Gestapo out there didn’t care who came.</span> <span id="s1097">Now we were – we were briefed, we were told, you will see people in striped suits that are guarded by soldiers with guns.</span> <span id="s1098">Don’t even look at them, make no eye contact with anyone.</span> <span id="s1099">Don’t talk to anyone.</span> <span id="s1100">Don’t talk among each other other than necessary, even the people that you know.</span> <span id="s1101">Do your work, keep your head down, mind your own business, don’t make waves, okay?</span> <span id="s1102">So, with those instructions we took the S-Bahn, the subway, the elevated out to Wannsee and we went to work, raking, cleaning up, whatever they told us to do.</span> <span id="s1103">And now we had to go back after two weeks to the city police.</span> <span id="s1104">What are you doing, you have been here – are you – what – we are working for Gestapo Wannsee.</span> <span id="s1105">That’s all they had to hear.</span> <span id="s1106">We got our stamp.</span> <span id="s1107">You can stay.</span> <span id="s1108">We had the extension.</span> <span id="s1109">And that’s how they rotated people who were about to leave to protect them from being entered into the labor force.</span> <span id="s1110">And I’m going to try and find out in Berlin when I am there this spring if they know how they managed to do that.</span> <span id="s1111">In the meantime, political things march on.</span> <span id="s1112">Things in the Balkan weren’t going too well.</span> <span id="s1113">We were watching, of course the political or the – how the war developed.</span> <span id="s1114">So far, for Germany everything went right.</span> <span id="s1115">Italy started to invade Albany, Albany couldn’t be invaded.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: Albania?</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: Alb – right, Albania.</span> <span id="s1118">What did I say, alba – Albania.</span> <span id="s1119">Albany is upstate New York.</span> <span id="s1120">Albania.</span> <span id="s1121">And the Germans had to go and help them out and then the invasion of Greece as a follow up.</span> <span id="s1122">They parachute jumped to Crete.</span> <span id="s1123">By this time it was April and we said oh well, if the war expands, maybe we’ll never get out.</span> <span id="s1124">And we still didn’t have our papers.</span> <span id="s1125">They were still haggling in Amsterdam and Berlin.</span> <span id="s1126">We still didn’t have our passports.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: And you’re still working at Wannsee.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: We’re still working Wannsee.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: Which is the site of the future Wannsee Conference.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1131">Now it was – finally, by the end of April we said well, we are getting our papers, and we did get our papers finally, and now we were preparing, we were told the trip takes five days.</span> <span id="s1132">You will leave on – maybe in two or three weeks you will be able to get on the train.</span> <span id="s1133">And I was telling them my, you know, my visa – my visa expired May 31st.</span> <span id="s1134">I didn’t have all that much time left.</span> <span id="s1135">My American visa was issued January 31st.</span> <span id="s1136">It expired May 31st.</span> <span id="s1137">By that time I had to be on the boat.</span> <span id="s1138">So time was getting short for me, the other kids had maybe a week or two more, but not a lot.</span> <span id="s1139">One day – well – how much time do you – how much time do you have left?</span> <span id="s1140">So one day, it was, I guess end of April or so, and I was walking past a Woolworth and there wa – it is – was a Woolworth, there was a Woolworth in Berlin, and it was like 9:30 in the morning.</span> <span id="s1141">And I saw that they had a big ad in the window, Thermosflaschen(ph), Thermos bottles.</span> <span id="s1142">They had a special.</span> <span id="s1143">So – but Thermos bottles in Germany weren’t that easy to come by during the war.</span> <span id="s1144">So my God, it’s 9:30, I walked into this store.</span> <span id="s1145">I would – and they were pretty cheap too, like four mark or something like that.</span> <span id="s1146">I said yes, I would like some Thermos bottles, yes.</span> <span id="s1147">I need 13.</span> <span id="s1148">13 Thermos bottles?</span> <span id="s1149">Yes.</span> <span id="s1150">He says, why do you need 13?</span> <span id="s1151">I said, we’re going on an excursion from school and you know, we – we all going and I need – of course I said this in perfect German.</span> <span id="s1152">Are you sh – are you Aryan?</span> <span id="s1153">Sind sie arisch?</span> <span id="s1154">I said yes.</span> <span id="s1155">He says, may I see your Ausweis?</span> <span id="s1156">I said, I don’t have an Ausweis, I have a passport.</span> <span id="s1157">Let me see your passport.</span> <span id="s1158">I said my passport is at the – at the German embassy.</span> <span id="s1159">Are you sure you’re Aryan?</span> <span id="s1160">I said look, I am Auslandsdeutsche.</span> <span id="s1161">Now I don’t know whether you know what that it.</span> <span id="s1162">Auslandsdeutsche they – in Germany they had a very special standing because they were the Germans, the Aryan, the good Germans, Aryan Germans who lived in the foreign countries, and Hitler – the system really sort of depended on them that if and when they moved in that they would support the German cause.</span> <span id="s1163">So the Auslandsdeutsche was a status.</span> <span id="s1164">I said, I am Auslandsdeutsche from Holland.</span> <span id="s1165">I said, I’ve lived in Holland most of my life.</span> <span id="s1166">My parents were German, but I lived in Holland and in Holland we don’t know from Aryan or non-Aryan.</span> <span id="s1167">I don’t know what that means.</span> <span id="s1168">Yeah, I don’t think you’re German.</span> <span id="s1169">I’m sorry, I can’t sell you now.</span> <span id="s1170">Now this is called chutzpah.</span> <span id="s1171">I said well, if you don’t want to sell me now, at least will you save me 13 bottles so that when I come back at four ocl – he said, you have to come back after four o’clock – when I come back after four o’clock that I – that I can still get these?</span> <span id="s1172">I really don’t know why you don’t want to sell me those now.</span> <span id="s1173">Come back at four o’clock.</span> <span id="s1174">And I did.</span> <span id="s1175">And she was not waiting with the police.</span> <span id="s1176">She was decent.</span> <span id="s1177">She sold me 13 bottles.</span> <span id="s1178">Now, be – all my co-travelers were very happy because now we were prepared for our trip through France and Spain and Portugal.</span> <span id="s1179">We at least could have hocked something.</span> <span id="s1180">When I came to America and I told my mother that story, she almost died.</span> <span id="s1181">How can you be so stupid?</span> <span id="s1182">Well, that’s – I took the chance and I had to try and get out of it as best I could, and you have to – you lived, or you survived or you didn’t survive by your wits.</span> <span id="s1183">And that’s – that was the point of growing up under these conditions.</span> <span id="s1184">Anyway, we had our Thermos bottles, we were ready to go and we were preparing, and on May 11th, Rudolf Hess decided to fly to England.</span> <span id="s1185">Rudolf Hess of course was Stellvertreter des Führers, and we thought this is the end, we’re no – never going to get out.</span> <span id="s1186">Well luckily, the Germans played it down, they didn’t make a big deal of it, it was in the paper one day and he was out of his mind, it was – well, whatever.</span> <span id="s1187">He tried to – however they explained it and the newspapers will tell you how.</span> <span id="s1188">And it did not change the foreign policy toward America, which was still neutral.</span> <span id="s1189">And on May 19th, we left Berlin.</span> <span id="s1190">We were sealed into a railroad car, third class.</span> <span id="s1191">This was a regular, you know, railroad car.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: Y-You just passed your 17th birthday?</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1194">The doors were sealed, do not open the windows.</span> <span id="s1195">Of course, we weren’t going to get out, but they were afraid that maybe somebody would add – would – would climb in.</span> <span id="s1196">And we were shunted, we were attached to a train that went to Paris.</span> <span id="s1197">Of course in Paris you arrive at Gare du Nord, and for the Spanish border you leave from Gare Austerlitz.</span> <span id="s1198">How do you get from one to the other?</span> <span id="s1199">Well, we were shunted by whatever, like freight.</span> <span id="s1200">It took us about seven hours to get from one railroad station to the other, and then we were eventually attached to the train that went to the f – Spanish border.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q: D-Did you have an adult accompanying you all this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: No.</span> <span id="s1203">No, we were – we were – we were 13 adults ranging from age 18 to age 12.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: Did the older children take care of the younger children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: Yeah, the older – yeah, the two – the two – you know, Judith and Jerry who were by this time, I guess 18, whatever.</span> <span id="s1206">And no, there was – there was nobody.</span> <span id="s1207">We knew what to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: Wer-Were the younger children in good spirits?</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: Yes, they were – well, the younger one – she had an older brother too, he was sixt – 17 also, and you know, there were – there were no problems.</span> <span id="s1210">There were no problems that respect.</span> <span id="s1211">And we arrived at the Spanish border, the name, ba-ba-ba-ba – Ondai(ph).</span> <span id="s1212">In Ondai(ph).</span> <span id="s1213">And in those days – when you do it now, you – you know, the – the different – Spain has different rail gauge than the rest of Europe.</span> <span id="s1214">In those days that was solved by getting out on the French side, you walked across a bridge and then you were in Spain and you boarded the Spanish train and that’s what we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Kurt Roberg.</span> <span id="s1217">This is tape number four, side A, and you’ve just come over to the Spanish border.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: Well, now we were in Spain and while we knew, of course, that Spain, Franco’s Spain was very sympathetic to the Germans, at least we had the feeling that we were not under direct German control any more.</span> <span id="s1219">The people who had organized our trip had arranged for us to be overnight in San Sebastián and we stayed at the finest five star hotel, the Marie Louise, I think it is called, where we spent a glorious night and then went on by train, and as we were riding through the Spanish countryside, we really saw an appalling sight.</span> <span id="s1220">Spain had just come out of the civil war which lasted what, four years, five years?</span> <span id="s1221">And the people were devastated.</span> <span id="s1222">We had hoarded bread for our trip because we had to take along food for five days.</span> <span id="s1223">We were locked into a – into a car and we knew there was no food in – in Spain, so this was our third day.</span> <span id="s1224">And suddenly we had really poor people coming along the railroad car and as we were standing at this station, or if we were on a siding somewhere, begging, begging for bread and offering us oranges.</span> <span id="s1225">I hadn’t seen an orange since I left Holland.</span> <span id="s1226">In Holland we had oranges, but Germany had no oranges.</span> <span id="s1227">So we traded bread for oranges.</span> <span id="s1228">And then while the train then made its way slowly to the Spanish border, to the – to the Spanish-Portuguese border, and there we had to change again into a Portuguese train, which was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: Yeah, I just wanted to ask about how cohesive the group was, these are young teenagers.</span> <span id="s1230">Were – were you a unified group, did you feel intensely close to each other?</span> <span id="s1231">The feeling among the group of children that you were with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">A: Yes, we were.</span> <span id="s1233">There were – there were some kids that felt closer, a couple of the – well, girls especially, sort of kept to themselves.</span> <span id="s1234">I guess some of the guys were, I don’t know, they weren’t coming on to them by today’s standards, but there – you know, they didn’t want any involvement.</span> <span id="s1235">Of course, the leaders wouldn’t tolerate any an – romantic, let’s say, involvement, there was none of that.</span> <span id="s1236">But m – m – well, to each his own, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">Q: Wha-What did you all do inside this car for – for five days?</span> <span id="s1238">What did you talk about?</span> <span id="s1239">A: I really don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1240">Our conversations were very guarded.</span> <span id="s1241">When a – whatever – whatever, even in Spain, you never knew who was listening.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: No, I meant, in the sealed car.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">A: In the sealed car I don’t know what we did, whether we played games, I don’t really recall, but we – maybe we played checkers or something like that, but the – there wasn’t a lot of reading, there wasn’t a – a – I really – you looked outside, you looked out the window and you ate whatever you had at various intervals.</span> <span id="s1244">Now, while I was in – in Berlin still, Uncle Wilhelm had sent me a – packages, food packages.</span> <span id="s1245">When he found out that I was going to be there more than a week he – in Holland you could still get things, in Germany you couldn’t, so I got a couple of food packages with chocolate, which of course I shared with my fellow – you know, travelers.</span> <span id="s1246">And a couple of little Gouda cheeses.</span> <span id="s1247">And I really saved a bar of chocolate and a cheese as a iron ration, I called it, you know, when things really get tough that – that I had something.</span> <span id="s1248">We didn’t know where our next meal was coming from, so I always had that in reserve.</span> <span id="s1249">And – a matter of fact, I brought a cheese to America.</span> <span id="s1250">And – but I don’t remember in particular how we kept busy.</span> <span id="s1251">But, you know, just looking outside, I don’t know whether I did any – I did – I did a lot of drawing then but I didn’t – oh, by the way, I had – I had brought you a couple of pictures, talking about drawing, I almost forgot, they are put into the record, you can have th – I – this is what I – we are going back to May of 1940 in Rotterdam and there was the view of Rotterdam from the roof of my house, and this too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: And what is – could you describe that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1254">Here we have a view, this is a pen and ink drawing, since I – we had no cameras.</span> <span id="s1255">A pen and ink drawing of our view from Mauritsweg toward the city hall, and we see in the background the oude kerk, the old church steeple.</span> <span id="s1256">The old church was heavily damaged during the fire and so was the city hall.</span> <span id="s1257">And next to the city hall is – is the tower, very modern with the carillon on it, which the Dutch are known for.</span> <span id="s1258">And that was the new stock exchange.</span> <span id="s1259">That remained untouched, but everything around it was burned, burned out and devastated.</span> <span id="s1260">The other picture is the street – sa – there was the – the trees in the background, was the zoo.</span> <span id="s1261">And th – this street here there is a trolley with the tender going through there.</span> <span id="s1262">The streets, once they were cleared the trolleys would run again, but they were going through rubble and devastation.</span> <span id="s1263">Everything up to the house on which I was – where I was on the roof, everything was burned out, bombed out and devastated.</span> <span id="s1264">So this is a pencil drawing which I now didn’t complete, but I did sign it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: You made these actual drawings at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: I m – I made these drawings at the time, yes.</span> <span id="s1267">This is –</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: And why did you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: Because I wanted – I wanted to record what – what I – you know, what – what we had seen.</span> <span id="s1270">I was always very conscious of, you know, historic events, this was certainly historic event.</span> <span id="s1271">I had no camera and so – and I was into – into drawing, so I – I drew it and well, this pen and ink, I haven’t done very many pen and ink, but that’s all I had available then, and I think it’s a very respectable little drawing.</span> <span id="s1272">So I’ll leave these with the records.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: Okay, now we’re back in Spain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: Okay, back in Spain.</span> <span id="s1275">Well, actually we’re – we’re crossing over into po – into Portugal, the Portuguese trains were new, aluminum, and very American looking.</span> <span id="s1276">They were, in fact, modern American railroad equipment and we really saw it as the preview of coming attractions.</span> <span id="s1277">We arrived in Lisbon and we were put up by the Jewish community there m – or the organization that was sponsoring our trip, assumably the HIAS.</span> <span id="s1278">We were put up in a pensionne and we had a very interesting experience.</span> <span id="s1279">About the day after we arrived, a man came to our pensionne and said, I am from the free Dutch government in London.</span> <span id="s1280">And he showed us a – an I.D. And you have come from Berlin?</span> <span id="s1281">Yes.</span> <span id="s1282">And you were in Holland before?</span> <span id="s1283">Yes.</span> <span id="s1284">And of course we were very eager to tell our story and also give the allies – don’t forget there was, you know, the Dutch – the queen had escaped to – and the – you know, the royal house was in London.</span> <span id="s1285">There was a Dutch force – air force, and you know, whatever, armed forces and we were very eager to help the allies.</span> <span id="s1286">So he says well, I would like to interview you.</span> <span id="s1287">I will come back tomorrow and I’d like you to – you know, to tell me whatever you can.</span> <span id="s1288">And we were most eager to tell him.</span> <span id="s1289">So we met the following day, it was about six o’clock at night.</span> <span id="s1290">I and two other boys, Jerry Cohen(ph), who was fluent in Dutch and one other boy.</span> <span id="s1291">And first we went to a restaurant, caf – café on the main square in Lisbon and he ordered coffee for us, and oh, we were glad to have real coffee after that bilge water we – we got in Germany.</span> <span id="s1292">And then he said, don’t turn around but I don’t think we can talk here because there is an – an foreign agent sitting at another table, watching us.</span> <span id="s1293">We better leave here.</span> <span id="s1294">And of course we were not aware of – you know, we hadn’t seen any of the movies that – that showed that friend and foe met in Lisbon.</span> <span id="s1295">And he says, I think we better go to my apartment, where we can talk freely.</span> <span id="s1296">And we went, and he took us up some back alleys in the back where the – if you’ve ever been in – in Lisbon, you have a – seven hills just like in Rome, and cobblestone narrow streets and he led us to his apartment.</span> <span id="s1297">All I can say is thank heaven he was legitimate.</span> <span id="s1298">What we found out later, he could have been a German agent who posed as a free Dutch agent.</span> <span id="s1299">Well, we spilled our guts.</span> <span id="s1300">We told him what the Germans had done in Holland.</span> <span id="s1301">We told him where the fortifications were in Berlin in the – in the zoo area, Tiergarten and th-th-they had built high rise bunkers they call them, solid concrete.</span> <span id="s1302">And where the anti-aircraft guns were agains – you know, when the British came o – flying over, we spilled our guts and felt very good about it, that we could finally do something.</span> <span id="s1303">What we didn’t realize was that there were just as many German agents there as there were English and Dutch and whatever else.</span> <span id="s1304">So he could have – very easily it could have been the last of us, that we would have disappeared, never to be seen again.</span> <span id="s1305">Luckily, that didn’t happen.</span> <span id="s1306">Well, so now it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: Ho-How did you know so much about the locations of places in Berlin and so forth?</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">A: It was a –</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: Military.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: Well, tha-tha – that’s militar – this was apparent to anybody who lived in Berlin.</span> <span id="s1311">You know, the Tiergarten, which is the – the zoo or the park area, they had built bunkers there because they were – because it was – they were protected by the trees and were, you know, camouflaged, natural camouflage.</span> <span id="s1312">And well, we just told them what we knew about what they were doing in – in Holland, that they had tried to, you know, build a fleet which – etcetera, etcetera.</span> <span id="s1313">And – and well, there was that and then as time got near I went, of course, speaking for my ow – my own interests, I went to the American export lines and told them that I was here.</span> <span id="s1314">I had my cable showing that my mother had paid.</span> <span id="s1315">I had missed the March 15th, I had not taken advantage of the payment.</span> <span id="s1316">You have a payment, and I’m here now and I’ve got to leave.</span> <span id="s1317">I knew that the next ship was leaving on March 30th.</span> <span id="s1318">The Excambion, one of their lines.</span> <span id="s1319">And yes, I said, well I have to be on that ship, and – okay, don’t worry, I se – so starting on the 27th, I went to the office eight o’clock in the morning and I said I would like to see the passenger list.</span> <span id="s1320">Don’t worry, you’ll be on the – I said, I want to see the passenger list.</span> <span id="s1321">Well, we don’t have it yet.</span> <span id="s1322">So I sat there all day and waited and – and I had no other place to go.</span> <span id="s1323">And on the 29th, it was getting a little closer, don’t worry, you’ll be on the ship, and you know – anyway, they – they gave me a song and a dance, and let me see the – I said, you can see it but you can’t have it.</span> <span id="s1324">It was my only receipt.</span> <span id="s1325">And this went until the 30th, and then on the 30th, said, well, the ship isn’t sailing until tomorrow, which was May 31st.</span> <span id="s1326">I say, you’re sure it’s sai – yes, i – tomorrow.</span> <span id="s1327">Well anyway, they gave me their – you know, delayed me again.</span> <span id="s1328">They never came across with the passenger list.</span> <span id="s1329">And I talked to the guy from the Jewish committee and he said, you’ll be on the list, don’t worry, you’ll be – you’ll make it.</span> <span id="s1330">Then, on the – he said, yet – look, tomorrow morning you go to the pier – and I had to borrow money because we were only allowed 10 mark out of Germany, which was soon gone.</span> <span id="s1331">I borrowed money from one of my fellow travelers and that – luckily the fares in Portugal were very cheap, so I got to the pier and I was standing there waiting.</span> <span id="s1332">I got there about two o’clock in the afternoon with all the other refugees and we were – I was standing in the sun.</span> <span id="s1333">Here it was the end of May and I was wearing my winter clothes that I had left Holland with in March.</span> <span id="s1334">Not good.</span> <span id="s1335">And well, this guy finally – our guy showed up about four, 4:30, climbs up on a crate and starts calling out names of refugees.</span> <span id="s1336">The Americans were going up the gangplank, you know, like Americans do, and the refugees were standing in the sun.</span> <span id="s1337">And this guy starts reading names and reading names and well, the third class –</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">Q: The-These are like American tourists, you’re saying, or – or American visitors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">A: Well [indecipherable] no tourists.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: American visitors, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: American visitors or people who were returning home from – from America, you know?</span> <span id="s1342">And the refugees were standing, waiting for this guy to call their names.</span> <span id="s1343">So finally like the third last name, Roberg, Kurt.</span> <span id="s1344">Well, by this time it was six o’clock.</span> <span id="s1345">I flew up that gangplank and I was on my way, so I thought.</span> <span id="s1346">So, wait til about 10 o’clock, this boat was – it was supposed to leave at six.</span> <span id="s1347">The boat was still in port, so I went to bed, and – my bunk and next morning I got up at seven o’clock, I went to see the sun rise over the ocean, I got up, we’re still in Portugal.</span> <span id="s1348">They’re still loading cork.</span> <span id="s1349">The Excambion was a combination freight and passengers.</span> <span id="s1350">There were 180 passengers and n – thank heaven, one class.</span> <span id="s1351">Da – did not have first and second or third class.</span> <span id="s1352">So there were no übermenschen and untermenschen, which was nice.</span> <span id="s1353">But hey, I’m on board, it’s an American ship, I’m on American territory, right, American grounds, under the American flag.</span> <span id="s1354">I wasn’t worried.</span> <span id="s1355">So we finally left about nine o’clock.</span> <span id="s1356">They weighed anchor and off we went, stopped in Bermuda for six hours and well, 10 days later we arrived in the good old U.S.A., so I guess the customs people got on board out in the bay, Customs and – customs and immigration.</span> <span id="s1357">So the last two hours as the ship steams in, they are processing everybody.</span> <span id="s1358">So li – look at my passport, ah, sit over here.</span> <span id="s1359">A couple of other people sat over there, most people could go again.</span> <span id="s1360">And then finally he calls me back.</span> <span id="s1361">Kurt Roberg?</span> <span id="s1362">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1363">Why are you trying to enter this country with an expired visa?</span> <span id="s1364">I said, my visa was good when I came aboard ship.</span> <span id="s1365">My visa expired at midnight.</span> <span id="s1366">I was aboard ship at six p.m.</span> <span id="s1367">According to the ship’s log, this vessel sailed on June first.</span> <span id="s1368">Your visa expired May 31st.</span> <span id="s1369">You can’t come in.</span> <span id="s1370">What do you mean I can’t come in?</span> <span id="s1371">I didn’t say that, but I – we were taught to be humble, even in America.</span> <span id="s1372">So, well, we docked in Hoboken, as was customary in those days.</span> <span id="s1373">American export line docked in Hoboken, not in New York.</span> <span id="s1374">And of course my mother knew – oh, I had – I had borrowed three dollars from a German speaking steward on board, to send a telegram from aboard ship to my mother that I was coming.</span> <span id="s1375">She hadn’t heard from me since I was in Berlin.</span> <span id="s1376">I didn’t write because every week we were supposed to leave and I was going to be there before the letters, right?</span> <span id="s1377">So I didn’t write.</span> <span id="s1378">I wrote to my uncle, and he wrote to my mother and that’s how she got word about what was happening with me, but I didn’t write, and well, she went crazy – I mean, she understood, but why didn’t you write?</span> <span id="s1379">Anyway, so she was down on the pier and I was up on board.</span> <span id="s1380">All the passengers were leaving the ship except me and one other woman, we stayed on board.</span> <span id="s1381">Do you think they would have let my mother up, or me down?</span> <span id="s1382">No, not in America.</span> <span id="s1383">We waved, she cried.</span> <span id="s1384">I guess I was teary-eyed.</span> <span id="s1385">And I remember I s – I called to my mother, Mother, are you wearing lipstick?</span> <span id="s1386">She says, yes, in America we – in America we wear lipstick.</span> <span id="s1387">Because in Europe women – hussies wore lipstick.</span> <span id="s1388">My mother wearing lipstick, can you believe that?</span> <span id="s1389">I said, before you know it you probably will – will paint your nails red, too.</span> <span id="s1390">So those were the little – and that – that sort of stuck in my mind.</span> <span id="s1391">Now anyway, my mother was told that I could not come down.</span> <span id="s1392">We hollered up and down, you know, across the – and they told me that I’d have to go to Ellis Island for a hearing, just a formality.</span> <span id="s1393">And my mother, of course, went the next day just for this formality and there was a hearing before a judge, and he looked at my papers and decided that well, they couldn’t let me in.</span> <span id="s1394">Now they – the visa was definitely expired.</span> <span id="s1395">As a matter of fact, there was something wrong with the visa.</span> <span id="s1396">The visa was issued on January 31st, it should have only gone to May 30th.</span> <span id="s1397">They gave you an extra day, why?</span> <span id="s1398">Oh, this will have to go to Washington, the State Department will have to handle that.</span> <span id="s1399">And so it happened that Kurt Roberg stayed on Ellis Island for four weeks while they debated in Washington whether they could take a risk, the risk of letting me in, or whether they would send me back.</span> <span id="s1400">And I guess lawyers came cheap in those days.</span> <span id="s1401">American export lines had their lawyers working on it, because they would have had to pay another 210 dollars to take me back to Lisbon and obviously lawyers were paid a lot less than that in those days.</span> <span id="s1402">So after four weeks they finally re – relented and – and they said, you can stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: Did you have any physical contact with your mother during those four weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: Physical only in that she would come – my mother worked, and – but on weekends she could come to Ellis Island, or anybody else during visitors’ hours and in the great hall that you may have gone to, I know it very well, when it wasn’t as tidy as it looks now and I became an expert Ping-Pong player there.</span> <span id="s1405">Did crafts and a lot of drawing and reading papers and spending time, and I’m an expert on Ellis Island.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q: What was it like to be close to your mother again, physically close?</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A: Well, it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s1408">It was – it was great.</span> <span id="s1409">It was wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">Q: Did your father come out to Ellis Island?</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A: I think he came – yeah, one – he was not well, also relations between my parents had gotten, you know, worse.</span> <span id="s1412">And my mother worked in New Rochelle, he lived on the room in Washington Heights.</span> <span id="s1413">My brother had a job in Bridgeport, Connecticut.</span> <span id="s1414">We were all over the map.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: During those four weeks, did you ever really fear that you might be sent back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">A: Definitely.</span> <span id="s1417">And I was very close to being sent back.</span> <span id="s1418">Oh they – State Department gave no quarter, they went by the book.</span> <span id="s1419">They absolutely went by the book, they couldn’t care less about – there was no human consideration, the fact that if I would be sent back that I’d end up in the – you know, would be sent back all the way to Germany and end up in the – wherever, right?</span> <span id="s1420">In a pile of ashes.</span> <span id="s1421">Oh, there was no – was no consideration whatsoever of that, as far as I know.</span> <span id="s1422">Now, my question to you, ca – i – how would I research something like that?</span> <span id="s1423">Is there a file on me in the State Department that is in existence to this day?</span> <span id="s1424">And can I reach that under the whatever act?</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Q: Freedom of Information Act?</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">A: Freedom of Information Act.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: You’ll have to check that out, I can’t answer that.</span> <span id="s1428">What – you were so young, how did you keep your emotional stability during those four weeks thinking you might be sent back?</span> <span id="s1429">What – what gave you your inner strength to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">A: Well, by taking things one day at a time and as long as I was here I felt I had a chance of staying here.</span> <span id="s1431">I was – you know, I was hoping and I mean they were telling me that – you know, they have various Jewish organizations were working on it and they were doing what they could.</span> <span id="s1432">But if they wouldn’t have, if it would have been up to State, they would have sent me back.</span> <span id="s1433">I have no doubt about that today, knowing what we know today.</span> <span id="s1434">At the time, of course, we didn’t know what the inner workings of – of mentality was at the State Department.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">Q: So with all this uncertainty, putting your foot down on American soil was not a joyous occasion?</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">A: Oh, it was a – it was a joyous occasion, I mean, well I – I thought it was sort of symbolic that I only saw the back of the Statue of Liberty.</span> <span id="s1437">You know, she turned her back on me, but I see humor in almost anything.</span> <span id="s1438">But wha-what was also interesting was that we were in the same complex with the Germans, the Bund Germans and Italians who were considered enemy aliens.</span> <span id="s1439">Well, wha – wa – wa – at least these were – the Bund Germans – America was still at peace with Germany, but they were – they were activists who were interned on Ellis Island.</span> <span id="s1440">They walked – we walked from 11 to 12 and they walked from 10 to 11.</span> <span id="s1441">And we were separated by a – a fence, you know, by whatever, a metal fence.</span> <span id="s1442">But they were, and we were – we were treated like – well, counted like prisoners when we walked from the – from the sleeping facilities to the dining hall, there was a guard clicking, counting.</span> <span id="s1443">They – we had bunk beds, men only, you know, in a huge – they were prison conditions, but I mean, it was – it was better than in Berlin, you know, and the food was better, and I mean, we knew that – you know, there were no abuses or whatever.</span> <span id="s1444">But we were – we lived a regimented life, you know.</span> <span id="s1445">One hour a day – End of Tape Four, Side A Beginning Tape Four, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Q: – volunteer collection interview with Kurt Roberg.</span> <span id="s1447">This is tape number four, side B.</span> <span id="s1448">We were talking about the conditions in Ellis Island.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">A: It was a detention center and you know, it was – as I say, the food was good, we were kept occupied.</span> <span id="s1450">The various Jewish organizations came in to, you know, give us material for crafts, leatherwork, which I did.</span> <span id="s1451">Drawing, you know, things you wanted to do.</span> <span id="s1452">So, it was nice, but we had to stay in the great hall, that was our living room.</span> <span id="s1453">That’s where everybody hung out, not by choice.</span> <span id="s1454">And at the gong of the bell you’d go into the dining room and at the gong of the bell you’d go into the sleeping quarters.</span> <span id="s1455">And I – you know, it was a regimented life, but well, look what we came from and what we – what we found here.</span> <span id="s1456">It was heaven, you know.</span> <span id="s1457">And so it was – it was all right.</span> <span id="s1458">Wasn’t very – July – June, July ’41 was a very hot summer so we were – were – there was no air conditioner, of course, but at least out on the water, surrounded by water was cooler than anywhere else.</span> <span id="s1459">My mother would come on Sundays to visit and oh, the subway is so hot and I had no idea what that meant.</span> <span id="s1460">The subway is no [indecipherable] you know, they had fans.</span> <span id="s1461">Had to take the IRT all the way down from – well, she would come from 168th Street.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Q: What was your last day there like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">A: Well, the last – I guess they had an – we had another hearing.</span> <span id="s1464">My – when I could pack up, that was great.</span> <span id="s1465">Now, was – was a – I guess it was a week, that was a Tuesday, so my – my uncle, m – one of my mother’s other sisters who had spent the – well, a year and a half in London during the blitz, they came over here in 1940 and had an apartment in Washington Heights and I stayed – I stayed with them, because we didn’t – my mother wasn’t – had a job in New Rochelle as a sleep in ma – the housekeeper.</span> <span id="s1466">And he picked me up.</span> <span id="s1467">He picked me up and I came into – I – into the subway, down –</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">Q: When you left Ellis Island, then you were truly free from all of this government regulations, was that a special experience, just to walk out onto a sidewalk, knowing that you don’t have any more restrictions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">A: Yes, yes, I think I – well, we – we – we got off the ferry boat at the – at – at the battery and it was a – it was a – well, it was a great new world, I really don’t think that I spent so much on, y-you know, trying to analyze my feelings other than being overwhelmed by, you know, the physicality of New York, and of course New York, the downtown then was the center of business and here was the – you know, the courthouse and – well, 17 Battery Place was a very tall building then, and I don’t know how much you know, but I’m very familiar with that, I spent a lot of time later in that part of New York.</span> <span id="s1470">So it was, you know, Bowling – Bowling Green.</span> <span id="s1471">We walked bif – Bowling Green to the subway and we took the IRT and of course, well –</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">Q: Ho-How was your English then?</span> <span id="s1473">Did you know any English?</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">A: I had – I had learned some English in Holland.</span> <span id="s1475">My English – I could speak some English.</span> <span id="s1476">My problem was in understanding it because I would, at that point, translate it into Dutch.</span> <span id="s1477">So by the time I had translated it, the other person speaking to me was three sentences further.</span> <span id="s1478">You know, I mean, this is the – you know a language when you start thinking in it.</span> <span id="s1479">And so that was really m – that – that took couple of months.</span> <span id="s1480">But I – I remember the first impression of New York is that th – I – I s – seeing black people really dressed up gaudily, you know.</span> <span id="s1481">Big lips with lipstick and you know, make-up, and you know the – I mean, people in Europe didn’t do that.</span> <span id="s1482">My God, is this really ex – an exotic country.</span> <span id="s1483">And d – you know, all the – the noise and then well, then we got into the subway, and of course I had seen movies, American movies in Holland, you know, we – we saw American movies, lot of cowboy movies and – you know, of New York, you knew what the skyline was like and – and Broadway, 42nd Street was Broadway, right?</span> <span id="s1484">So we came – we – we – my uncle and aunt lived on 171st Street, so we took the train to 168th Street, Medical Center, right?</span> <span id="s1485">Took the elevator up, I was impressed, my God, I – we had fun, I took the elevator up.</span> <span id="s1486">And come out and here all these low buildings, except for Medical Center, I see – the first sign I see is Broadway.</span> <span id="s1487">This is Broadway?</span> <span id="s1488">Where are all the tall buildings?</span> <span id="s1489">You know, the only – the first thing I saw, there was in Washington Heights, and I don’t know how well you remember that, was a Johnny Walker – a huge advertising sign with Johnny Walker walking, it was a – it was an animated sign.</span> <span id="s1490">I said, oh, they have this – this great sign, but where the tall buildings?</span> <span id="s1491">If this is Broadway, I couldn’t – I thought all of Broadway was that way.</span> <span id="s1492">So that was my really first impression of Broadway, and its disappointment.</span> <span id="s1493">But I caught up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: And – and then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">A: Well, then I – I settled in with my uncle and aunt.</span> <span id="s1496">I had to get a job, so first I had to get a Social Security card.</span> <span id="s1497">In America you need a Social Security card.</span> <span id="s1498">To get a Social Security card and work full time you have to be 18, otherwise you have to go to school.</span> <span id="s1499">I was done with school.</span> <span id="s1500">I couldn’t afford to go to school any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">Q: Financially, you mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">A: Financially, right.</span> <span id="s1503">So I went to – and on advice of my cousin, my relatives they had – they were already in America for three years, my cousin.</span> <span id="s1504">They came here in 1937 from Palestine.</span> <span id="s1505">You – you have to tell them you’re 18.</span> <span id="s1506">So suddenly I was a year older, I was 18 and I got a Social Security card, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">Q: You didn’t have to show any papers showing your age?</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">A: In America?</span> <span id="s1509">What papers?</span> <span id="s1510">No.</span> <span id="s1511">They took my word for it.</span> <span id="s1512">I li – I learned to lie in America.</span> <span id="s1513">In Germany you didn’t dare lie, everything was on record.</span> <span id="s1514">And I got a job, my cousin who was a salesman, got me a job within a week.</span> <span id="s1515">I had to work.</span> <span id="s1516">I worked – got me a job in a place called Jersey City.</span> <span id="s1517">Jersey City, New Jersey, a job for 12 dollars a week.</span> <span id="s1518">I didn’t know that they were paying – yeah, the minimum wage law had just been passed, which was 35 cents an hour, 40 hours, 14 dollars.</span> <span id="s1519">They were paying me 12.</span> <span id="s1520">You know, I was a greenhorn just off the boat and in order to get the job as an upholsterer, I had to buy a hammer, a magnetic hammer, which you put into your m – you – you’ve never – obviously you have never done any upholstery work.</span> <span id="s1521">You have a box of blue tacks.</span> <span id="s1522">You dip your magnetic hammer into it, it picks up nails.</span> <span id="s1523">You swallow – you put them into your mouth, you don’t swallow them, and then you feed the hammer one at a time with the tack.</span> <span id="s1524">I learned that pretty quick but in order to do that you need your own personal hammer.</span> <span id="s1525">You don’t want to li – lick anybody else’s hammer, right?</span> <span id="s1526">So before I had the job I already had to invest a dollar and a quarter in a hammer, okay?</span> <span id="s1527">But that’s America.</span> <span id="s1528">So, I had this job for a week, I got paid 12 dollars.</span> <span id="s1529">In the meantime my cousin had lined up a better job for me cause I – well, I had l – trained as a – as an auto mechanic but they said can’t get a job in New York as an auto mechanic, pump gas.</span> <span id="s1530">They don’t pay minimum wage for that.</span> <span id="s1531">So he got me a job in the machine shop for 14 dollars and I worked in the machine shop for 14 dollars.</span> <span id="s1532">And I we – stayed there til I went into the army.</span> <span id="s1533">I became foreman, I ran the place.</span> <span id="s1534">I was very good and he got a very good deal, even for whatever he paid me at the time, I mean –</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">Q: Did you feel like an outsider, or were you totally accepted by the other men you were working with?</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">A: No, I – well, I f – I was accepted, but everybody knew that I was Dutch.</span> <span id="s1537">There was a German worker there.</span> <span id="s1538">I had n – I wanted no identity with Germany whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1539">First – I mean, first of all because I wanted to shed all of that and Holland was a lot closer to me emotionally than Germany.</span> <span id="s1540">And people here in amer – in New York, in America didn’t understand the difference between a German Jew and a German.</span> <span id="s1541">You are German, you a German.</span> <span id="s1542">Are you a Jew, or are you a German?</span> <span id="s1543">They didn’t understand.</span> <span id="s1544">There was one fellow there, he worked in the shop who was German, he came here during the 1920’s, a German, you know, Gentile.</span> <span id="s1545">And he spoke German with me and I spoke German with him.</span> <span id="s1546">But I s-sort of – fractured German I spoke with him.</span> <span id="s1547">And he would say, you know, your German is awfully good for being a Dutchman.</span> <span id="s1548">I said, well look, my parents were German, we spoke German at home, that’s how I – and I didn’t lie, we did speak German at home and my parents were German born, right?</span> <span id="s1549">So I didn’t lie.</span> <span id="s1550">Said, but I am Dutch, because inside, I was Dutch.</span> <span id="s1551">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">Q: What happened on December 7th, 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">A: On December 7th, 1941, im – we had gotten our lift to America.</span> <span id="s1554">We had sent our lift van that I told you it was m-made in – in Bremen and we had it sent, my mother had it sent to Rotterdam and then from Rotterdam to America before they left, so our furniture, everything was in America, and then when they got here, my parents, we stored the furniture in the basement of my aunt’s apartment house in Washington Heights, made a deal with the superintendent and for like what, 10 dollars a month or something like that, in one of the storerooms, our furniture.</span> <span id="s1555">So every Sunday, when my mother came from New Rochelle, we spent in the basement seeing to it that – spraying roach stuff and whatever, that we wouldn’t get any roaches into the furniture, into the mattre – into whatever.</span> <span id="s1556">And then they – you know, there were all sorts of bugs, we were told, in America, you know, like – um – s-so anyway, housekeeping.</span> <span id="s1557">On December seventh, which was a Sunday, we were in the basement.</span> <span id="s1558">At this point I had already bought a radio, of course, to ma – so that I would learn English.</span> <span id="s1559">And went to a lot of movies on Saturday morning for 17 cents, to learn English.</span> <span id="s1560">That’s how you learned English.</span> <span id="s1561">And then as – Sunday we were in the basement, when about 2:30 we heard about the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor and then we heard Roosevelt, so I know exactly where I was.</span> <span id="s1562">And we were – well, we were glad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">Q: Glad about what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">A: We were glad that now America was forced to enter the war, on the English side, because Roosevelt was, of course, fighting that battle for a long time.</span> <span id="s1565">And to us it was a step in the right direction.</span> <span id="s1566">And well – my brother tried to volunteer for the service.</span> <span id="s1567">They said, you can’t volunteer, you’re not a citizen.</span> <span id="s1568">But you can be drafted.</span> <span id="s1569">And well, I – so he went into the service in ’43 and I went into the service.</span> <span id="s1570">And he went in May and I went in July of ’43.</span> <span id="s1571">And well, I had gotten several deferments because I worked in a war central plant in the machine shop, we were making parts for aircraft engines and stuff.</span> <span id="s1572">But after three deferments, I – they said you have to go.</span> <span id="s1573">And well, my – I was – I was eager to go.</span> <span id="s1574">I wanted to fight Hitler.</span> <span id="s1575">And now I think I was one of the more motivated people certainly in the ou – in my outfit.</span> <span id="s1576">You know, everybody went because they were drafted.</span> <span id="s1577">I went because I knew what I was fighting for, so it’s – I didn’t mind.</span> <span id="s1578">But then, of course, the outfit that I trained with went to Europe eventually, but our commanding officer said no German born personnel can go.</span> <span id="s1579">So they pulled all the German refugee boys out and they shipped us to the Pacific.</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">Q: Are these German Jewish refugee –</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">Q: When you were with those young men, did you talk about your backgrounds and exchange stories?</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">A: Yes, you knew where – you know, where you from, you know, what’s your hometown, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">Q: Did you feel a special connection to these young men?</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1586">And especially in the army there were a lot of prejudices, you know, so I found out.</span> <span id="s1587">Against Jews.</span> <span id="s1588">And the sergeant major in the outfit I was in, who was an anti-Semite saw to it that my papers – I was – when you are in the service you should – you know, you – you would become a – a citizen.</span> <span id="s1589">I mean, normally it took five years to become a citizen.</span> <span id="s1590">In the service within 90 days you could become a citizen.</span> <span id="s1591">The papers had to be put through, I mean, you n – on the theory you’re good enough to fight for the country, you’re pledging allegiance, etcetera.</span> <span id="s1592">And they couldn’t send you overseas unless you were a citizen.</span> <span id="s1593">Anyway, he held back the papers and screwed it up so when the outfit was alerted to go overseas, my papers weren’t ready.</span> <span id="s1594">And the – whatever excuses he gave, but I mean –</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">Q: Did he do this with all the other German Jewish young men?</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">A: I don’t know, but none of them – he was the one in my – in my battalion.</span> <span id="s1597">They w – you know, the others were not in my battalion, they were in other outfits, but we were in the same [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">Q: So what did you think?</span> <span id="s1599">Here you come to the United States and you’re experiencing anti-Semitism again.</span> <span id="s1600">What – what did you feel about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">A: Well, I think I learned as I came to Holland that there was – even in Holland – but that everywhere in the world there is anti-Semitism, you know?</span> <span id="s1602">When you had a church, a Catholic church which preached until 20 years ago that the Jews killed Christ and this was conveyed directly to the Irish, Italian and other predominantly Catholic societies, there were – there was, you know, anti-Semitism was preached, you know, and look, we certainly knew that in – in Germany, before Hitler there was anti-Semitism and that there was anti-Semitism – I mean, in Holland I joined a Zionist organization because – I mean in – in Celle we couldn’t do much about it, but in principle we were – you know, let’s say zine – Zionist oriented.</span> <span id="s1603">When I came to Holland, of course Harry was there already and he belonged to a Zionist group, youth group and we would go to meetings.</span> <span id="s1604">We’d go on bike outings and we had meetings and speakers and all that.</span> <span id="s1605">And these were young people, and you know, we – we learned, which was the Zionist dogma of the day that you know, there’s anti-Semitism everywhere and Jews cannot truly assimilate because it takes someone who wants to assimilate, which is the Jew, and someone who lets you assimilate, which is the non-Jewish society and they are not about to.</span> <span id="s1606">So, you know, I knew that, and thi – it was true in America, and you know, we – we heard and learned that well, you can – that in certain businesses and banks you can’t – you know, you can’t go into the banking business, you can’t go into the – at the time, that that was – those were businesses or professions where Jews were not welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">Q: At that time, or around that time, did you ever consider going to Palestine, or eventually settling in Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s1609">Well, we had – as I say, my cousin tried – no, they went to Palestine because it was, you know, it was a way out of Germany, but we knew that Palestine was hard work and very physical and we were no – we were in a – we were in America and we really didn’t consider Palestine as a – as a – as a very pliable option.</span> <span id="s1610">We were here.</span> <span id="s1611">And you know, being – as a family, we could have never functioned there, and we were not going to strike out on our own, let’s say, my brother and I, go to Palestine, leave my mother and my father here.</span> <span id="s1612">My father died in October ’42, and may – he really never recovered from the aftereffects of the concentration camp, really.</span> <span id="s1613">So, you know, weren’t going to leave my mother by herself, you know, I mean it’s just never – never entered our mind.</span> <span id="s1614">The same when I came back from the service, you know, I could have done other things, but I – you know, we – we – we were family oriented and you know, there was an obligation, a family loyalty and would have never considered, you know, picking up and going elsewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">Q: So where were you sent when you were in the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">A: Well, first I went from New York, Camp Upton, to Camp Adair Oregon, I trained there.</span> <span id="s1617">From Oregon we went as a – as a unit the whole division moved to Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri.</span> <span id="s1618">And from Fort Leonard Wood, really, the – by this time it was 1944, the division was alerted and went to Europe and they pulled us out and sent us to the Pacific.</span> <span id="s1619">So I went – I went to the Pacific on New Year’s Day, 1945.</span> <span id="s1620">Ended up in New Caledonia, entered a stray artillery battalion.</span> <span id="s1621">If you read, “Tales of the South Pacific,” that was us.</span> <span id="s1622">A stray battalion up in the hills of New Caledonia, away from everything until we got a new commanding officer.</span> <span id="s1623">The worst possible combination you could have.</span> <span id="s1624">The rank that the com – command called for was lieutenant colonel.</span> <span id="s1625">He was a major, so he – he was a Jewish West Pointer, so he had to prove all sorts of things, and was he eager to get that, you know, those colonel – that – that – colonel’s – you know, own – so – well, I’m happy to say that it worked out fine.</span> <span id="s1626">We – we missed the invasion of Okinawa and we missed the invasion of the Philippines.</span> <span id="s1627">We got to the Philippines fairly late in the game.</span> <span id="s1628">And then the war ended on August eighth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">Q: Wa-Was your life ever in danger at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">A: Yeah, yes it was, because of – well, the way the army runs.</span> <span id="s1631">See, since we were in the – for instance, in the Philippines there were a lot of Japanese in the – in the hills.</span> <span id="s1632">They were pretty desperate because they were starving, you know, Americans were – but the island was officially declared secured.</span> <span id="s1633">Therefore, under army regulations, we were not issued any live ammo.</span> <span id="s1634">But we would go out on exercises, we call them.</span> <span id="s1635">And I was in the artillery, so they would send us out as forward observers.</span> <span id="s1636">You go up ahead of the infantry, ahead of everybody.</span> <span id="s1637">Now, since I’m the person that doesn’t like to take chances, I had seen to it that I had a few clips of ammunition that I had forgotten to turn in, just for insurance.</span> <span id="s1638">And now we were – we were out on a – on a mission at night and we had a young lieutenant with us, someone we referred to as a shaved hair, that was second lieutenant just out of boot camp and whatever.</span> <span id="s1639">And well, we camped for the night, strictly tactical and then he – we heard things moving around out there.</span> <span id="s1640">And we were – we didn’t know what it was or who it was, but you have to assume that it is the enemy, right?</span> <span id="s1641">I had passed the word to my two other colleagues that I had ammo, so we felt relatively comfortable.</span> <span id="s1642">But the lieutenant didn’t know, and he also had no ammo.</span> <span id="s1643">So he said, do you think – do you think those are Japs?</span> <span id="s1644">Lieutenant, we don’t know, but when we find out we could probably arm wrestle them.</span> <span id="s1645">So, you know, we found out that they had only raided our supply depot, the Japanese, they – they were hungry, they didn’t want to fight.</span> <span id="s1646">Maybe on a full stomach they would have felt like fighting, but – so you know, it’s these little incidents, but otherwise – End of Tape Four, Side B Beginning Tape Five, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Kurt Roberg.</span> <span id="s1648">This is tape number five, side A, and you were talking about being in the service and – and when did you leave the service?</span> <span id="s1649">Or what happened after you were in the – in the Pacific?</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">A: Well, after – aft-after we – we won the war over there too, I – incidentally I – I was in touch with my original outfit, which was in Europe, in Germany, and I would get letters and I still have the correspondence.</span> <span id="s1651">My mother saved all mine and my brother’s letters.</span> <span id="s1652">And I’ve – you know, they hoped that they wouldn’t have to come to the Pacific after they finished the war in Germany and help fight there and well, they were actually, they were – they were trained to go for the invasion of Japan and all.</span> <span id="s1653">Well, it didn’t come to pass, thank heaven.</span> <span id="s1654">I was in the Philippines until March ’46, and then came home, was discharged on April ninth and re-entered civilian life.</span> <span id="s1655">I went back to my original job, which of course he had to take me back.</span> <span id="s1656">But I couldn’t see being a mish – tool and die maker.</span> <span id="s1657">So I wanted to get into business, I wanted to go to school, I wanted to you know, pick up my life and make up for lost time.</span> <span id="s1658">And – and I did.</span> <span id="s1659">I found myself a new job in the import export business, which was booming then.</span> <span id="s1660">And I went back to school to get my – well, pass the Regents in all the things that you have to do in New York.</span> <span id="s1661">That was very interesting too, I had submitted my records.</span> <span id="s1662">I had all my German and Dutch records and they said, well you have to submit them to Albany, to the department of Regents.</span> <span id="s1663">And then they sent them back, they said, they’re in German.</span> <span id="s1664">Yeah, they’re in German, what do you expect in Germany, they write the records in German.</span> <span id="s1665">But you’re the department of education, you mean you cou – oh no, you have to translate those.</span> <span id="s1666">Well, you’ve been in the educational field and you know what it’s like.</span> <span id="s1667">So that gave me a preview of coming attractions.</span> <span id="s1668">Well, I did get them translated and I – you know, they told me what I needed to complete my American education, and I did, and I passed the Regents and had a like 89 average.</span> <span id="s1669">And I [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">Q: So you a – you attended hi – did you – you attended high school then –</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">A: I can di –</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">Q: – after being in the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">A: Yes, I – I went – I went back to high school, and I went to Stuyvesant High School.</span> <span id="s1674">Not that I knew of the reputation of Stuyvesant High School, but it was closest to where I worked on – I worked on Sixth Avenue and 20th Street and Stuyvesant was on 15th Street, on Second Avenue.</span> <span id="s1675">So I walked over at night and you don’t think I was going to blow a nickel each way to – to – I needed the money.</span> <span id="s1676">And I finished high school and then entered City College, I guess in the spring of ’48, on a – well, you know, I was fully matriculated at that point, so I didn’t need the G.I. bill.</span> <span id="s1677">I could have taken the G.I. bill and gone anywhere.</span> <span id="s1678">I could have gone to the Sorbonne, you know, but I didn’t think that way.</span> <span id="s1679">I wanted to be home near my mother and my family and that’s how we were brought up, you don’t sponge off the government.</span> <span id="s1680">So they – they paid for my books, and I –</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">Q: So you worked during the day and went to school at night?</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">A: Oh, of course, yes.</span> <span id="s1683">I didn’t – I didn’t even know that they had school during the day.</span> <span id="s1684">Well, and yes, I chose – I chose to go to s – to work during the day, make an honest living and went to school at night.</span> <span id="s1685">And I – well, found a new – I got a new job after a year in the export business.</span> <span id="s1686">I knew enough about business that I wanted to change into something else.</span> <span id="s1687">Taught myself how to type and I got into a lot of interesting experience in banking, in letters of credit and dealing with shipping companies.</span> <span id="s1688">I spent a lot of time downtown in the Wall Street area.</span> <span id="s1689">It was very educational.</span> <span id="s1690">When I felt I couldn’t learn anything any more, I quit and I got a job with a friend of mine who had asked me to join his young, growing company.</span> <span id="s1691">And this was the man who came out of the concentration camp with my father, Hans Solomon(ph), who had made it to America via Shanghai with his wife and young daughter.</span> <span id="s1692">Waited for their visas, American visas in Shanghai, came here in 1940.</span> <span id="s1693">And he was too old to go – I guess he was about 38 at the time, too old to go into the service and he built a – started his own business in 1945 and then asked me to come join him and I did in 1948, I guess. ’</span> <span id="s1694">47.</span> <span id="s1695">And I was with him for 10 years and I was credit manager and I majored in accounting at City College for awhile, before I went into marketing and management.</span> <span id="s1696">And I started – went into sales, into marketing, merchandising.</span> <span id="s1697">And after 10 years with him I went – joined another company to set up a photographic division for them, and became vice president of photo products and I was with them for 32 years.</span> <span id="s1698">So I don’t – after that I didn’t move around much any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">Q: And – and personally, your personal life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">A: Personally, I – well, I – I found a very attractive young lady during my travels in South America, in Caracas, Venezuela.</span> <span id="s1701">And she happened to be of German origin and she came to New York and we got married in 1957.</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">Q: G-German Jewish, or German –</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">A: No, German not Jewish, I – and well, that’s an – that’s a separate story that I don’t want to get into now because it’s rather complex.</span> <span id="s1704">But she became Jewish, converted and we have a family, two children, a daughter who was born in 1959, my son in 1962.</span> <span id="s1705">And we had a good life.</span> <span id="s1706">My wife, well, started contract – well, suffered from cancer, and she died in 1989.</span> <span id="s1707">And that’s about the story.</span> <span id="s1708">I retired in 1989, six months after she died.</span> <span id="s1709">I had planned on it anyway, but – unfortunately without her, but well, i-in the meantime of course, we lived in New Y – we lived in New York when we first got married.</span> <span id="s1710">We moved to Riverdale and then in – in Riverdale into a co-op and then when my daughter Inez became of school age, we decided to leave New York and head for the wide open spaces of New Jersey.</span> <span id="s1711">And we ended up in Tenafly because it had a school system we liked, and I’ve lived there ever since.</span> <span id="s1712">I’m now in Tenafly 36 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">Q: Can we talk a little bit now about some of your thoughts and your feelings?</span> <span id="s1714">Do you think you would have been a different person today if you had not gone through the childhood that you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">A: Yes, I would – I would be – my plans – I – I wanted to be an architect.</span> <span id="s1716">I did a lot of drawing, I’m good at drawing, I enjoy drawing.</span> <span id="s1717">I sketched houses, designed houses, I had a m – I’m – well, have good manual dexterity.</span> <span id="s1718">Channeling that as a result of the, what was called in Germany, umschulung.</span> <span id="s1719">That means converting to swi – switching your education, really.</span> <span id="s1720">So literally translated, switching your education into something quote unquote, practical.</span> <span id="s1721">And – oh, well – or – I wanted architecture or interior design, and my expert family in America, of course, interior design, in America nobody uses that.</span> <span id="s1722">Learn something practical.</span> <span id="s1723">So, when I came to Holland, what’s more practical in America than cars, right?</span> <span id="s1724">And I was interested in automobiles too, so that – so I chose what – we were sort of trained or oriented toward a nonacademic life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">Q: What about personally, personality-wise?</span> <span id="s1726">Do you think your personality would have been different if you hadn’t had the challenging childhood that you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">A: No, I think it’s been a m – it has been a good – I – I can only see it as a good affect, whether everybody agrees with me, I m – m – some people think that I’m too – well, I’m a – I’m a product of the 1930’s environment.</span> <span id="s1728">I think we have the same thing in America, you know, people are products of the ba – depression era.</span> <span id="s1729">We are oriented toward practicality, economy, frugality, etcetera, and of course my German background m – of certainly m-me – German Jewish background, the emphasis in Germany is, I think everywhere in Jewish circles was education, you know?</span> <span id="s1730">The saying was always, especially if you move around, as the Jews have for hundreds of years, you – what you c – what you carry in your – you don’t carry heavy in what’s in your head, however that translates, you know.</span> <span id="s1731">And so we were always oriented toward learning and well, I think that is probably the basis of my [indecipherable] and planning ahead, I think.</span> <span id="s1732">Planning, having a structured life rather than living out into the w-wild.</span> <span id="s1733">But I think that’s a matter of personality, I don’t know whether that is any background.</span> <span id="s1734">By the same token my wife, who grew up in wartime Germany, and she was five years younger, so she had to leave eastern Germany when the Russians came, as a small child.</span> <span id="s1735">Her father by that time had disappeared.</span> <span id="s1736">Mother was left with two children, and the stories of, you know, the Russians coming, raping, killing, burning, whatever, they, you know, they took off.</span> <span id="s1737">They left with the last train.</span> <span id="s1738">They were able to save themselves, they lost everything.</span> <span id="s1739">And she, since childhood really never wanted to own anything because she didn’t want to go through what her mother had gone, having to leave everything behind.</span> <span id="s1740">So Connie was really very much oriented toward enjoying things.</span> <span id="s1741">She said, I don’t have to own paintings, I’ll be very happy to see them in a museum.</span> <span id="s1742">I don’t want to own anything.</span> <span id="s1743">I don’t want to – you know.</span> <span id="s1744">So the different people are affected differently by the same set of circumstances.</span> <span id="s1745">And so, if we put the finger on what causes certain developments, or developmental trends, I think you can read a lot into conditions that you want to read into it.</span> <span id="s1746">And you know, psychologists are so busy trying to come up with formulas of what happens why.</span> <span id="s1747">I’m not a great believer in that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">Q: You had said earlier, you – you’ll never forget the smell when your father came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">Q: Any other sounds or smells or sights that remind you of those previous years?</span> <span id="s1751">Any other ones.</span> <span id="s1752">?</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">A: Well, I think that we associate certain things, pleasant or unpleasant with first time experiences.</span> <span id="s1754">I think that’s a common human thing.</span> <span id="s1755">Whether this is sounds, noises, music we hear under certain circumstances for the first time, you know.</span> <span id="s1756">A – a song that we – that we hear for the first time under romantic conditi – it sticks.</span> <span id="s1757">So I think that’s just a human phenomena that ham –mi – I mean, they – the smell, yes, it was – it was very vivid, but I think that is like the question you asked, do you know where you were on Pearl Harbor day or on the day Kennedy was assassinated, okay?</span> <span id="s1758">So the day my father came back from the concentration camp and the smell, and the way he looked is a landmark impression, whether I was a child at the time, or whether it was when Kennedy was assassinated and I was a man, you know, we were – I don’t – I don’t think we should separate that into either childhood or adulthood.</span> <span id="s1759">I think it happens and it’s lasting, or it isn’t, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">Q: What were your thoughts during the Eichmann trial?</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">A: Get the bastard.</span> <span id="s1762">During the Eichmann trial, well, I followed it with much interest.</span> <span id="s1763">Matter of fact, I have the tape at home that I think I saw on PBS had a extensive – I have a whole collection of wartime tapes and this is part of my library, it’s where my interests lie, his – historical.</span> <span id="s1764">Not only war, but of course, World War II was to me a very personal and historic event that I lived through and that I can identify with.</span> <span id="s1765">But the Eichmann trial was very – well, how should I say?</span> <span id="s1766">Whatever goes around comes around, you know, that – well, A, the Israelis did what they did to bring him back and to expose him for what he was.</span> <span id="s1767">And also I’ve seen enough of Nazi Germans, you know, in South America.</span> <span id="s1768">I’ve traveled in South America and I know that they were hiding and are still hiding and have been hiding and that they were hiding in Argentina and Venezuela and Columbia.</span> <span id="s1769">And, you know, ab – everywhere and that they got away – they got away with it and that there is a clique that exists to this day.</span> <span id="s1770">It’s a tight little circle, and he was part of it, but – and that we were able to break that.</span> <span id="s1771">Bal – there’s – the – the – the other one, of course, is the – oh what – what – what was his name, this French couple, Frenchman –</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">A: Ger – German name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">A: Anyway, that story, you know, who unmasked a – you know, in Chile the Nazi – the Frenchman, oh, hold on –</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">Q: Yeah [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">A: I’m terrible on names.</span> <span id="s1778">Dates I remember, names come eventually.</span> <span id="s1779">So, you know, I th – I think that they should be brought to justice.</span> <span id="s1780">Yeah, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">Q: Do you feel very American today, very assimilated into American society?</span> <span id="s1782">Do you feel you really belong here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">A: Oh absolutely.</span> <span id="s1784">I feel it, I belong here.</span> <span id="s1785">I mean, this is – this is my country, I spent most of my life here.</span> <span id="s1786">I think I’ve paid my dues.</span> <span id="s1787">I – and – however, I have not given up on my let’s say, continental upbringing.</span> <span id="s1788">I value – I like to think that I have the best of two societies.</span> <span id="s1789">The European, which I have – I certainly was old enough at age 14, since I had a good schooling, to take the best of that and take the best of the American and when it comes to well, manners, attitudes, child education, child rearing, my wife and I brought up our children the way we were brought up.</span> <span id="s1790">I mean, we didn’t beat them up or anything, but we – there was no great permissiveness either.</span> <span id="s1791">They learned to eat with good table manners.</span> <span id="s1792">There were no different manners at home than when you go to a restaurant.</span> <span id="s1793">So if we went to a restaurant with our children, from a very young age people would comment, oh how well behaved are your children.</span> <span id="s1794">You know, a restaurant was just another place where to eat and there was no differ – what I’m saying is that education starts with the parents, and we felt we sh – we want to give them an education that pleases us and ultimately will please them.</span> <span id="s1795">And so the parts of American society that I plan, that I – that we chose to ignore was, for instance, the lapses in child education that we saw, our view.</span> <span id="s1796">And we’re very happy with the results.</span> <span id="s1797">Yeah, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">Q: Wh-When your children were the age that you were, for instance when herb – Hitler first came into power in the rest of the 1930’s and early 40’s, did that make you think of your childhood, when they were that age that you were at the time, you know, nine, 10 - 11 - 12 - 13, did that remind you of what you were doing at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">A: Not directly, but I will say that, you know, I’m into sports and I – I played with my children in a very active way, which my father never did with us, but he was older.</span> <span id="s1800">My father was 38 when he married and plus that he was physically handicapped in a – by his sight.</span> <span id="s1801">And other than that, I – you know, I – when – I think I always knew how a child feels, whether the child is five years old, or eight, or 14, because I’ve been there, and I remember.</span> <span id="s1802">I remember what a child’s emotions are, feelings, and I could identify with my children at the various levels, my son more than with my daughter.</span> <span id="s1803">I never had a – you know, I never had a sister, so that’s – was a little touchier, but certainly with my son – and – but I never, I n – you know, I never did them, when I was your age, or you know, bit, the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">Q: What I meant was – wha-what I meant was, when they were the age when you were going through difficult times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">Q: And your life was in danger –</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">Q: – you know, as a – did th – did that – did you think about that, at that time.</span> <span id="s1809">I mean, you had to leave one country, go to the next, and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">A: Well, no, I mean, that was – those were the facts, that was, you know, that doesn’t – I don’t think that it influenced me or affected my – my life or my character or my – scarred me in – in any way.</span> <span id="s1811">Of course, you know, people of my generation who went through the camps, who saw unspeakable, you know, brutality, etcetera, that they had to react and that it left scars, is beyond question.</span> <span id="s1812">I was lucky in that the things that, well, I was exposed to were not, by and large, not traumatic enough, or I was able to deal with it because I, at the time, certainly in Berlin, all the things we saw, that I knew it was temporary.</span> <span id="s1813">I have a way out, I have a ticket to America.</span> <span id="s1814">I have a way out, even though that was very questionable, I always felt that I wasn't trapped over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">Q: Are you more religious, less religious than when you – what you were when you were growing up?</span> <span id="s1816">How did it affect you in that sense?</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">A: No, I don’t th – either way.</span> <span id="s1818">I belong to a Reform congregation, by choice.</span> <span id="s1819">I’m considered, probably considered one of the more Conservative, but then the Reform movement is going toward Conservative anyway, you know, it’s not what it was 30 years ago, Reform is no longer Reform.</span> <span id="s1820">So no, I have no – I – I don’t think I’m any more or less religious.</span> <span id="s1821">I mean, the question of whether there is a God, you know, what does it really mean is deeply philosophical, I don’t think we should get into that.</span> <span id="s1822">But my children are not religious.</span> <span id="s1823">I don’t particularly – well, I wish they were more oriented toward being Jewish or feeling Jewish.</span> <span id="s1824">They don’t.</span> <span id="s1825">But then, we gave – you know, those of us who give our children the freedom of decision making, we exposed them to Judaism, Jewish teachings.</span> <span id="s1826">Unfortunately the Hebrew schools that they went to, while we thought they were excellent, turned them off rather than the other way, than inspired them.</span> <span id="s1827">The damage was done, they – they had the choice of, you know, or th – they have the option of choosing and whatever they choose, what’s important is they are good people, they are decent human beings and that is what religion is supposed to do, in my view, is make decent people of everyone; the purpose of religion, one of the purposes of religion.</span> <span id="s1828">And that is the case, so I have no – I have no quarrel or problem with how they achieve their goodness, of being good.</span> <span id="s1829">If they want to find religion, if later in their lives they turn toward religion, as a lot of people do, so be it, you know, but I – I have no – no problem with that.</span> <span id="s1830">I mean, that’s my view.</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">End of Tape Five, Side A Beginning Tape Five, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">Q: – volunteer collection interview with Kurt Roberg.</span> <span id="s1833">This is si – tape five, side B. Because you saw people deprived of their civil rights in – in Germany in the 30’s, do you think that makes you more sensitive, or did it make you more sensitive to the Civil Rights movement here in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">A: More sensitive –</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">Q: Cause you actually saw it with your own eyes in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">A: Yes, I – well, I-I’m certainly more aware of it, but I’m also aware of the abuses and of the limitations and it’s interesting that I’ve gone back to Germany many times and the change I see in Germany today, the change toward democracy is really remarkable.</span> <span id="s1837">I had a very interesting experience.</span> <span id="s1838">As a matter of fact I [indecipherable] I went back to my hometown, Celle on the anniversary of Crystal Night in ’98, 50th anniversary and participated in a – well, I really instigated a memorial service at the synagogue in Celle, and I went over there for that and I was the keynote speaker.</span> <span id="s1839">And I’ll be glad to send you a copy of that speech.</span> <span id="s1840">It was held in German, but I made a fairly accurate English translation for my congregation and for my friends.</span> <span id="s1841">So I’ll send you that, and you can put it into the records.</span> <span id="s1842">But i – I really – and I met with some of my former classmates for whom I would vouch that they were not Nazis then or now.</span> <span id="s1843">And it was a very interesting experience and I think sort of telling.</span> <span id="s1844">The – yeah, what went on under Hitler, how a lot of Germans who were, let’s say scared into following the party line.</span> <span id="s1845">Of course there was a meal ticket too, that they didn’t dare to go across the – against the party line because it meant their livelihood.</span> <span id="s1846">And I think there is really a lot of true democracy, especially in the young people.</span> <span id="s1847">We – we read about the skinheads, the anti-Semitism, etcetera.</span> <span id="s1848">But just like here, the good people don’t make news, it’s the bad people that make the news, and I think in our society too, you hear about the killings of – you know, the teenagers that are shooting up our schools and all that, but you don’t read about the good kids or the kids that are scared.</span> <span id="s1849">I met a little girl in Florida, she’s 11 years old.</span> <span id="s1850">There was a – well, talk about a – an incident in school and she was scared and she asked her mother, I don’t want to go to school today because there’s gonna be trouble.</span> <span id="s1851">You know, there are – so what I’m saying is there’s good and bad everywhere.</span> <span id="s1852">We don’t – we don’t hear about the good kids, we only hear about the bad kids.</span> <span id="s1853">And I think you as a – as an educator, know that that is so.</span> <span id="s1854">To condemn a whole generation or sector of the population because of a few, is unfair.</span> <span id="s1855">Any time you generalize, it’s unfair, or even inaccurate.</span> <span id="s1856">What’s his name, Goldhagen?</span> <span id="s1857">Every German is guilty?</span> <span id="s1858">I haven’t read his book.</span> <span id="s1859">I read the synopsis in the “New York Times” book review and all that.</span> <span id="s1860">I don’t want to read his book.</span> <span id="s1861">He can come with statistics, but I don’t think that every German down – deep down in his heart, felt anti-Semitic or was part – part-participated or wanted to participate.</span> <span id="s1862">So he has a formula; that formula too, is not accurate.</span> <span id="s1863">I think you have to take people as individuals and that’s what I try to do.</span> <span id="s1864">They’re good and they’re not so good and they’re outright bad.</span> <span id="s1865">And n – that has been – I mean, I made my peace with Germany in 19 – in the 1950’s, when I went back the first time on business with Hans Solomon(ph).</span> <span id="s1866">We went back to Germany to try and do business in 1952.</span> <span id="s1867">We went to the photo show in Cologne and we spent two weeks in Celle.</span> <span id="s1868">Now he, being 15 years older than I, was there as an adult.</span> <span id="s1869">He remem – knew a lot more people, and we looked up a lot of them and talked to them.</span> <span id="s1870">Of course, in the 50’s, nobody would know or admit that they knew anything.</span> <span id="s1871">But we talked to people who said yes, we knew that Bergen-Belsen, which was 15 miles away from Celle, that it was there, but we didn’t know what was going on.</span> <span id="s1872">We – the man who was – who supplied meat there, he went in there every couple of weeks, driving a truck in there, sure he saw.</span> <span id="s1873">But he was told these are foreign Zwangsarbeiter, forced labor.</span> <span id="s1874">But that they were systematically starved to death, or whatever, worked to death, he didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s1875">Nobody – nobody knew that other than the guards and the guards didn’t tell, because it was self-incriminating.</span> <span id="s1876">He supplied meats, he supplied food.</span> <span id="s1877">Hey, we’re taking food in there every week, you know.</span> <span id="s1878">Whether – that this was only for the guards or whatever, nobody knew, right?</span> <span id="s1879">So what I am – what I am saying is that we did talk about it.</span> <span id="s1880">Ther-There was a death march where people were marched from the railroad 15 miles to the camp.</span> <span id="s1881">And yes, some of the people saw it and even taunted the prisoners and whatever, you know, on the death – that came out later.</span> <span id="s1882">Yes, but those people aren’t going to talk about it or advertise it or admit it, even.</span> <span id="s1883">They are the ones that say, we don’t want to talk about the past any more, we want to lo – but the young Germans, who now – I mean – I mean the new, young generation, whose grandparents were the perpetrators, participants or silent participants, they are now asking, why did you keep quiet?</span> <span id="s1884">How could you k-keep quiet?</span> <span id="s1885">They don’t understand how they could have – how their parents and grandparents could have kept quiet.</span> <span id="s1886">And it’s very hard in the 1990’s, or 2000, to understand what the mentality was 50 years ago unless, you know the zeitgeist of the era, what the fears were, what the attitudes were and why people kept quiet.</span> <span id="s1887">Why people didn’t speak out.</span> <span id="s1888">They were scared.</span> <span id="s1889">The man I told you about who lived below us, the people who helped us on Crystal Night, he was a high official at the court, the Supreme Court.</span> <span id="s1890">And he had the key for the ar – in – in the building, and up on – on the roof was a flag – you know, f – a – a flagstaff.</span> <span id="s1891">And when the Nazis took over, they went up there to pull down the red, white and blue flag to hoist the Nazi flag.</span> <span id="s1892">And who has the key?</span> <span id="s1893">Rusterfeld(ph) has the key, get Rusterfeld(ph), and they said, we want the key.</span> <span id="s1894">I don’t have the key.</span> <span id="s1895">Well, give us the key or we’ll break down the door.</span> <span id="s1896">So he rummaged and he found the key.</span> <span id="s1897">And as they stormed up there and up there, he was heard to mumble under his breath, I hope they break their neck.</span> <span id="s1898">Somebody heard it and he was indicted and – that he made this remark.</span> <span id="s1899">He had enough friends in the court system that witnesses came up and said oh no, you heard it wrong.</span> <span id="s1900">He said, I hope they don’t break their neck, because it was so dangerous to climb up there.</span> <span id="s1901">They gave him the benefit of the doubt and he was permitted to retire earl – take early retirement, okay?</span> <span id="s1902">Now, there were people like that, okay?</span> <span id="s1903">And he was watched from there on and he couldn’t afford to make a wrong move, but he didn't permit his daughters to ever join the Nazi party, for the girl they have the Jungmädel or whatever, the Hitler youth.</span> <span id="s1904">He could have redeemed himself to prove that he was not against them by saying I want you to join, even if it’s only pro forma.</span> <span id="s1905">No, he stuck to his principles.</span> <span id="s1906">There were people like that.</span> <span id="s1907">So who’s to say who is good and who’s bad?</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">Q: Do you get reparations?</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">A: I don’t, no.</span> <span id="s1910">My mother did, I don’t.</span> <span id="s1911">I got – yeah, I got a one time lump sum pre – reparations because I was deprived of my education, which was, I think 5,000 deutschmark at the time, in 19 – in the early 50’s, I think, under Adenauer.</span> <span id="s1912">Nothing else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">Q: Is there anything else you wanted to –</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">A: No [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">Q: – talk about that we haven’t, or any final comments that you’d like to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">A: No, I really hadn’t thought about any final comments, I just wanted to really put on record a firsthand, you know, witness account of how I came to this country and why I came to this country and what the circumstances were because things are, when they are retold by people who have heard the story, it’s often distorted, not intentionally, but just by repeating.</span> <span id="s1917">And I would like it to go on record.</span> <span id="s1918">I hope I have created a feeling of what the spirit was, both in Holland and in Germany, what the mentality was of the Jews in Celle, certainly.</span> <span id="s1919">Why they did what th – why we did what we did, and you know, like some of them said, why do you stay so long?</span> <span id="s1920">Why – you know, why didn't you leave earlier?</span> <span id="s1921">I’ve also, when we came to America, had people ask, you German Jews, why didn’t you fight back?</span> <span id="s1922">Why k – you know, you should have fought the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1923">It shows a total – comments like that at the time showed a total ignorance of what Nazi Germany was all about.</span> <span id="s1924">How they operated, how they functioned and I mean, there were – there were people who fought back.</span> <span id="s1925">They were hauled off to the concentration camp or shot on the spot, you know.</span> <span id="s1926">Known as öfter(ph) flucht es schussen(ph).</span> <span id="s1927">Shot while – you know, shot while trying to escape.</span> <span id="s1928">Okay, so there – there was no th – they were gangsters.</span> <span id="s1929">They were – they didn’t play by gentlemen’s rules.</span> <span id="s1930">I mean, if you see what – what – what – what – what Hitler did to his own – to his own people whom he saw as threats, as rivals, as – you know, th-the Wurm(ph) affair.</span> <span id="s1931">Anybody that – that was no longer convenient was eliminated.</span> <span id="s1932">How?</span> <span id="s1933">How does the Mafia eliminate people, right?</span> <span id="s1934">Yes.</span> <span id="s1935">So, people who say why didn't you fight back, there were people who fought back, but there was no way of beating a system where the government is the – where there is no government protection, where there is no police that you can go to, where there’s no one to – to – you can appeal to for justice, for the right thing, for protection.</span> <span id="s1936">No way of fighting that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">Q: Do you feel more connection to Holland than you do to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">A: No, I feel – I feel very comfortable with Germany now.</span> <span id="s1939">People ask me – American Jews ask me, how can you go back to Germany after all you – I’ve made my peace with Germany.</span> <span id="s1940">They’ve paid the price.</span> <span id="s1941">They’ve tried very hard to make up for – they recognize today very much what they have done.</span> <span id="s1942">They are, you know, I feel that what we know today about the way the American government acted, the Roosevelt administration acted, of ignoring not only the Saint Louis affair, but the – you know, many other – look how close did I come of being – not being accepted in.</span> <span id="s1943">You know, I’d like to find out.</span> <span id="s1944">But it wasn’t all peaches and cream and not everything that was pretended, that the Jews were a political pawn, that it was inconvenient to the American and British government to admit the to Palestine, that they wanted to s – you know, send them to Madagascar in transit, right?</span> <span id="s1945">The Jewish state of Madagascar and other faraway places where they would be out of the way and not in the way of the Arab situation, the oil situation.</span> <span id="s1946">So when you see all of that, it’s not that one guy wears the black hat and the other guy wears the white hat.</span> <span id="s1947">Everybody wears a gray hat.</span> <span id="s1948">Anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1949">Q: Anything else you wanted to add –</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">A: No, no I –</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">Q: – before we finish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">A: [indecipherable] go on.</span> <span id="s1953">No, I think I’ll say thank you and I’ll look forward to receiving the tape and I hope it is audible and makes – makes some sort of sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">Q: Well, thank you very much for doing the
