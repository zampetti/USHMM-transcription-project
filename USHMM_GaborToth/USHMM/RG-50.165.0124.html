countries.</span> <span id="s5">So, but my husband wants to get to America, it’s a wonderful country, and he loves it, and when I was in Europe, we was thinking the best about this country, but if we wouldn’t have nobody here, it makes no sense, see?</span> <span id="s6">If he didn’t have relatives, what makes sense?</span> <span id="s7">So you go with people, what they left from the concentration camps, everybody went to Israel, so we went to the same people.</span> <span id="s8">But here, it would be strange, we don’t know nobody here.</span> <span id="s9">Since my husband (inaudible) it’s a golden country, I can say it.</span> <span id="s10">I love it.</span> <span id="s11">And it’s always will be here, and I hope, (inaudible) but you want to go after the war, you was looking for

where, because he was a young boy when he went from Europe, before the war.</span> <span id="s15">My husband’s cousin went as a young boy to America, so he know he has in America a cousin, and this cousin, when he came to him, he was like a father to us.</span> <span id="s16">Very, very good people.</span> <span id="s17">Very lovely.</span> <span id="s18">They weren’t rich peoples.</span> <span

taste.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">FU: Because, you don’t come from home, you come from a place where you was waiting, and then they give you a little piece of bread, and a little bit soup.</span> <span id="s46">So you don’t have big aspirations.</span> <span id="s47">So, if you make a living, you glad.</span> <span id="s48">And you know that you can build yourself up, and you have children,

fixed the deli because he worked for him, he saw the customers, he thought that this business is okay.</span> <span id="s59">He didn’t know what he owes and what income, you know he didn’t tell you, you’re not a partner.</span> <span id="s60">So he says to me, (inaudible), for a $1,000, so I say, “You don’t have more than that.</span> <span id="s61">What do you have in the bank?</span> <span
