farm.</span> <span id="s29">And we lived very happy and the kids was growing up nicely and it was a wonderful childhood.</span> <span id="s30">I remember my childhood, a very, very nice childhood.</span> <span id="s31">I don't remember sufferings or anything.</span> <span id="s32">They...my parents loved each other very much, and so love was spread all over our family.</span> <span

America.</span> <span id="s42">We...we lived very peaceful and very, very nicely.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">01:02:10</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: And then?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Then in 41, the...the Russians occupied our country.</span> <span id="s46">Because you know, Latvia belongs to the Baltic States, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania and in all these three countries was the same wonderful life like in America.</span> <span id="s47">But in 41, the Russians occupied the country, and it was war and it was terrible, and when they settled already in the Baltic States, they confiscated everything.</span> <span id="s48">The house and the animals and the gardens.</span> <span id="s49">My father has about l0 apple gardens what he was, you know, collected the fruits and was selling and made good money about that.</span> <span id="s50">They collected, nationalized...they nationalized everything.</span> <span id="s51">So my father was just...we was poor.</span> <span id="s52">We have nothing absolutely.</span> <span id="s53">The children was going to school to...I was going to a Latvian school and my father was working.</span> <span id="s54">I don't remember something very...I can't...I don't know how you say that in English.</span> <span id="s55">He was just watching something in...on a..</span> <span id="s56">.</span> <span id="s57">house.</span> <span id="s58">I don't know how to say that in English.</span> <span id="s59">And the children was going to school, my sister and me.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">I..</span> <span id="s61">.</span> <span id="s62">I attended a Latvian school.</span> <span id="s63">Also there was other schools that my parents sent me to a Latvian school and I learned languages there and it was for one year, we was starving.</span> <span id="s64">It was a terrible time.</span> <span id="s65">Everything was difficult with food and then after a year, the Germans came over.</span> <span id="s66">When the Germans came over, we moved to Riga.</span> <span id="s67">We didn't live from the beginning in Riga.</span> <span id="s68">We...from the beginning we did live, then we moved back to.</span> <span id="s69">.</span> <span id="s70">to the Zamgla.</span> <span id="s71">Then we came back.</span> <span id="s72">When the Germans came, we moved back to Riga because the Germans was collecting all the Jews in one spot because they opened up in...in Riga ghetto where they wanted people to...to settle, the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s73">But from the beginning when we moved to...to Riga, we had a nice apartment.</span> <span id="s74">We had a four room apartment and that was still in the...in the Russian time.</span> <span id="s75">The end of...before the Germans came in, we moved to Riga.</span> <span id="s76">And we settled in that apartment until the...the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s77">And when the Germans came in, they threw us out of this apartment in that ghetto.</span> <span id="s78">A ghetto is a place, a section surrounded by iron Draht [wire], iron.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Fence?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Fence.</span> <span id="s81">Yeah.</span> <span id="s82">By iron fence and all the Jews was put together there, lived together.</span> <span id="s83">And we had one single room in a cellar</span></p> <p><span id="s84">01:05: where we all...not my brother, my mother, my sister, my...my father and me we lived there.</span> <span id="s85">There was no toilet, no water, no electricity.</span> <span id="s86">Nothing!</span> <span id="s87">So there was...they took us there where we...we settled when the Germans til...til my parents was killed.</span> <span id="s88">I mean I..</span> <span id="s89">.</span> <span id="s90">I just escaped because I..</span> <span id="s91">.</span> <span id="s92">I am surviving.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: How did you get your food in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s95">The...the...the Germans gave us some kind of a ration, you know, little piece of bread and...and kind of soup and we did have to stay in long, long lines to get our rations.</span> <span id="s96">I don't...in English you say rations?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Rations.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Rations.</span> <span id="s99">Yeah.</span> <span id="s100">The bread was so small like 3 fingers when you put together that was all what it is.</span> <span id="s101">It was...we was starving.</span> <span id="s102">The people who was going out to work in town, they could get from somebody...from the Latvians some...sometimes give you a little something, a little piece of bread.</span> <span id="s103">Bread was extremely important because bread was the main food and or a candle because we didn't have electricity.</span> <span id="s104">But coming back in the ghetto, that was a big problem because on the gate, the Germans was searching you and you didn't...you was not allowed to bring in the ghetto anything.</span> <span id="s105">Nothing!</span> <span id="s106">Because they themselves needed cigarettes and...and soap.</span> <span id="s107">Soap was a big problem because we had lice.</span> <span id="s108">We had lice all over.</span> <span id="s109">And we want to wash ourselves.</span> <span id="s110">There was difficulties with water and7 o'clock, there was the...the...the time when you had to be in your place.</span> <span id="s111">You cannot go out.</span> <span id="s112">If 8 o'clock, if they find you on the street, you are dead.</span> <span id="s113">They shoot you on the...on the spot.</span> <span id="s114">So my mother didn't work because my mother had a problem with the ulcers.</span> <span id="s115">She had a ulcers problem.</span> <span id="s116">She was sick, but my father was getting out to work and my sister was working and the children...I was then 12 years old...13, 12...I was working in a shoe factory.</span> <span id="s117">Uh...The Russians have bomb...bombarded a shoe factory, so there was a, a old, you know...the whole house...the whole factory was in shambles so we did have to clean up all the...the dirt and the...the stones, to schlepp [drag] the stones away and mostly children was working there.</span> <span id="s118">And then the shoe...the shoe Schmier [polish], the little boxes, we did have to put from the good boxes, the Schmier back in the...from the bad broken boxes in...in...in the good boxes, and then we did have to on a..</span> <span id="s119">.</span> <span id="s120">on a candle, a fire, we did have to turn it around and make it even that it looks like new.</span> <span id="s121">And it was a very a dangerous job because it is...it affect our health.</span> <span id="s122">We was coughing and sneezing.</span> <span id="s123">It is...it is some kind of...I don't know what it is...that all the childrens get sick after that.</span> <span id="s124">But we did have to work there.</span> <span id="s125">That's what they...and in the evening, they took us back to the ghetto and when we was there, sometimes somebody give you a piece of bread or...or a carrot, sometimes beans, you know.</span> <span id="s126">This...it was difficult with...food was extremely difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: What were your feelings as a child then?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: I didn't understand what's going on.</span> <span id="s129">I think if I would be, older, I would commit...commit suicide.</span> <span id="s130">I couldn't go through that.</span> <span id="s131">Then I thought it is not real.</span> <span id="s132">I think because I had my mother, I had my father and you know, I was working.</span> <span id="s133">What's the difference?</span> <span id="s134">I..</span> <span id="s135">.</span> <span id="s136">a child don't understand much.</span> <span id="s137">Also, I was pretty mature I must say for my age.</span> <span id="s138">But we was going from the work back to the ghetto and...and that's the way we lived until the final call.</span> <span id="s139">The final call was November... November.</span> <span id="s140">What does it mean the final call?</span> <span id="s141">I'll explain to you.</span> <span id="s142">There was outside a big, big sign: ALL PEOPLE, ALL JEWS HAVE TO GATHER TOGETHER AND TAKE THEIR BEST THINGS, THEIR BEST THINGS, AND WHATEVER IN SACKS, IN RUCKSACKS, WHATEVER BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO BE TRANSFERRED TO A DIFFERENT, TO A DIFFERENT PLACE.</span> <span id="s143">So we didn't make a deal out of it.</span> <span id="s144">It's supposed to be the next morning, 5 o'clock or 01:09:30 4 o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s145">So I remember overnight, my father took...told us to take a pillow case with towels to make a rucksack.</span> <span id="s146">A rucksack...how do you say in English, a rucksack?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: A rucksack.</span> <span id="s149">Yeah.</span> <span id="s150">And we put all our best things there because we believed that we are going to transferred to Salaspils, what...what was a bigger concentration camp.</span> <span id="s151">So we was peacefully.</span> <span id="s152">We didn't think that we are going to be harmed or anything.</span> <span id="s153">I mean there was plenty of killings all the time in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s154">Because you see some parents lived there in this section and the children live in the other section, and the parents and the children wanted to move together.</span> <span id="s155">So if you are out after 7 o'clock or 8 o'clock, they kill you.</span> <span id="s156">And it was shooting.</span> <span id="s157">I remember...I hear remember the whole night was shooting and shooting and shooting.</span> <span id="s158">People was sounds of...of...of shooting people, and that was people who wanted to run around to my daughter or I will run to my dad or to my brother, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">People...people wanted to get together or to go to that new concentration camp together.</span> <span id="s160">And so we also sewed the whole night.</span> <span id="s161">My mother, my sister and me, we sewed all the time the sacks and put the best things.</span> <span id="s162">Because...not because we...we just wanted to exchange for bread because bread was the biggest thing there.</span> <span id="s163">It's like a house.</span> <span id="s164">Because we was constantly, constantly hungry.</span> <span id="s165">And then 4 o'clock in the morning, the Germans came armed with...with the whips and "Raus, Raus, Raus.”</span> <span id="s166">They screamed all the time, "Raus.”</span> <span id="s167">This</span></p> <p><span id="s168">01:11:00 mean "Get out.</span> <span id="s169">Get out.</span> <span id="s170">Get out.”</span> <span id="s171">And so they...they threw us all out in the garden where we sit together altogether these people to gather together.</span> <span id="s172">There we...we tried to be together because my father had a brother there, Uncle Arthur with his wife and two children, my cousins.</span> <span id="s173">So we was lucky.</span> <span id="s174">We tried to stay together.</span> <span id="s175">We wanted to live all to...because my father was very close to his brother.</span> <span id="s176">That's the only brother he ever had.</span> <span id="s177">And then when all the people was...you know, there was screams and yells and the...the...the tragedy was that the...the men who was capable to work, they couldn't go with their wives or with their mothers or with their children.</span> <span id="s178">They was putting in in a special little ghetto.</span> <span id="s179">They called that the little ghetto.</span> <span id="s180">There was...this was called a man's...man's ghetto, but in my... in my particular line in that thing where we...we was was mostly old people, old women, mothers with children, with little children.</span> <span id="s181">There was a mother who had a baby on her hand and three children on her...holding on on her because her husband was in the other ghetto.</span> <span id="s182">And you know, when we passed by we saw them and they were screaming and calling names and...my wife, my child...you know, by their name, "Frieda, Frieda, Sascha, Manya, you know.</span> <span id="s183">They...they...because we...we was gathered altogether in a..</span> <span id="s184">.</span> <span id="s185">on the Chaussee, on the big Chaussee to go somewhere.</span> <span id="s186">We didn't know where we go.</span> <span id="s187">We thought we are going to Salaspils to a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s188">We...we hoped so.</span> <span id="s189">So we was in that big line.</span> <span id="s190">There was 30,000 people.</span> <span id="s191">30,000 people!</span> <span id="s192">I didn't know that.</span> <span id="s193">They only later somebody told me that there in this particular aktion was 30,000 people.</span> <span id="s194">There was two aktions in...in Latvia.</span> <span id="s195">I was in the first, but then was in December the other one.</span> <span id="s196">Now I am going to just tell you about the first aktion.</span> <span id="s197">This is what happened in the first aktion.</span> <span id="s198">So we was on that Chaussee.</span> <span id="s199">There was blood and snow in November.</span> <span id="s200">You know, it snowed and I remember it was squashing, squish, squish... blood and snow, blood and snow, and there was...you know, on the side was people.</span> <span id="s201">I..</span> <span id="s202">.</span> <span id="s203">I thought it's...it's wood, but this was not wood.</span> <span id="s204">That was dead bodies piled up on each other like a mountain.</span> <span id="s205">I say...from the...because it was 4 o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s206">It was dark.</span> <span id="s207">You couldn't even see real good.</span> <span id="s208">So then I saw these are people.</span> <span id="s209">That was not wood at all.</span> <span id="s210">So we straightened out on that...that Chaussee...I think it was 10 people in...in a row, you know, like...as...as breit [broad] as the Chaussee, I think it was 10 or 9 people or I cannot remember really.</span> <span id="s211">And it was a big, big line.</span> <span id="s212">We was one of the last ones who...who was who was joining that...that line.</span> <span id="s213">And we start walking.</span> <span id="s214">On each side was German, Latvian, so...so Nazis, with their Totenkopf, with the dead skull on their hat, and with a..</span> <span id="s215">.</span> <span id="s216">with a..</span> <span id="s217">.</span> <span id="s218">with a..</span> <span id="s219">.</span> <span id="s220">with revolvers.</span> <span id="s221">How you call that?</span> <span id="s222">With guns.</span> <span id="s223">Yeah.</span> <span id="s224">On each side, you know, and with the...with the whips.</span> <span id="s225">Go.</span> <span id="s226">Go.</span> <span id="s227">Schnell Schnell, you know, because there was old people.</span> <span id="s228">They couldn't walk.</span> <span id="s229">The little children crying.</span> <span id="s230">They...it was cold.</span> <span id="s231">It was freezing.</span> <span id="s232">They wanted Mama, Mama, Mama.</span> <span id="s233">And the Mama has a baby on her...on her...this is...I cannot explain to you what that was.</span> <span id="s234">It is disgusting.</span> <span id="s235">You just looked, and you couldn't understand what...what's going on.</span> <span id="s236">So when we was walking about maybe a half an hour, suddenly from the first line...from the first line, we heard that we are turning in on left.</span> <span id="s237">Turning in, not going straight because I don't know, but people knew where Salaspils is.</span> <span id="s238">This is a different, total different way.</span> <span id="s239">We was turning in...in the left and from the first road the people was screaming, "We are not going to Salaspils.</span> <span id="s240">They are going to kill us.</span> <span id="s241">They are taking us to Rumbula, Rumbula.</span> <span id="s242">I didn't</span></p> <p><span id="s243">01:15:20 even know what Rumbula is then Rumbula is woods, woods.</span> <span id="s244">So the first line, surely the Germans people start screaming and yelling and some people was running, starting running and as they were shoot on the spot, so the...the whole group...the whole 30,000 people left in the woods, in that Rumbula woods till I saw what it was there.</span> <span id="s245">Because we were one of the last ones.</span> <span id="s246">Not...not really, but almost.</span> <span id="s247">There was already a..</span> <span id="s248">.</span> <span id="s249">a Yama...how do you say that?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Pit?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: A pit.</span> <span id="s252">Yeah.</span> <span id="s253">A big pit and the sand was already taken out on both sides.</span> <span id="s254">Yellow sand.</span> <span id="s255">I remember it was in winter, but it was just fresh...fresh, black and...and yellow sand you know.</span> <span id="s256">So make the story shorter, it was a pit.</span> <span id="s257">It was a pit.</span> <span id="s258">And in the other side, I saw Latvians...I'm sorry, Latvians and German Polizei with...with guns like a..</span> <span id="s259">.</span> <span id="s260">with, you know, like tut, tut, tut, tut, tut, like this.</span> <span id="s261">And we did have to undress ourselves.</span> <span id="s262">In one mountain was the...the...the clothes, the...the coats, and one mountain was the shoes, and one mountain was jewelry.</span> <span id="s263">There's a box with jewelry.</span> <span id="s264">Later, the Germans took it back and...and confiscated all this stuff.</span> <span id="s265">They...they used it.</span> <span id="s266">But we did have to make it very neat, you know.</span> <span id="s267">Very neat.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">When...when somebody was making not so accurate, you get with that whip and the...all the time they scream: Schnell, schnell sich ausziehen [Fast fest, get undressed].</span> <span id="s269">The people was hesitating to...some people went over to the Germans, say, "You know, I am married to a Latvian.</span> <span id="s270">I am married to a Latvian.</span> <span id="s271">I am married to a German".</span> <span id="s272">Just to explain, "I am not Jewish.</span> <span id="s273">I am not Jewish.”</span> <span id="s274">And they didn't even listen to this.</span> <span id="s275">I'm not Jewish or Jewish.</span> <span id="s276">"Sich ausziehen, sich ausziehen".</span> <span id="s277">But I will tell you about our line.</span> <span id="s278">So my father, my mother, my Uncle Arthur, his wife and two children, me and my sisters stands there, and I already took off my coat.</span> <span id="s279">I had a beautiful coat my...my father bought me and I loved my coat so very much, but I already took my coat off.</span> <span id="s280">In the same minute when I did that...I..</span> <span id="s281">.</span> <span id="s282">we don't know from where and where, there was German officers, about four German officers on horses.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">And said...they said: "Halt, nicht schiessen, nicht schiessen, Ich brauche Schweiderinnen".</span> <span id="s284">"Don't shoot.</span> <span id="s285">Don't shoot.</span> <span id="s286">I need seamstresses.</span> <span id="s287">I need seamstresses".</span> <span id="s288">Women, if you can sew, come here.”</span> <span id="s289">My Mom grabbed me and my sister because she supposed to understand German.</span> <span id="s290">She speaks Yiddish.</span> <span id="s291">Yiddish is like German.</span> <span id="s292">It is very close.</span> <span id="s293">She said: "Ich bin eine</span></p> <p><span id="s294">01:18: Schneiderin, Ich kann naehen.”</span> <span id="s295">"I am a seamstress.</span> <span id="s296">My children can sew.</span> <span id="s297">Please take us.</span> <span id="s298">Take us.”</span> <span id="s299">So she grabbed me.</span> <span id="s300">You know in such a moment, she wasn't thinking about my father, about the uncle and she just grabbed me and my sister and we run over...I grabbed my...schlepped my coat with me and run over to these Germans.</span> <span id="s301">And there was other women, "Schneiderinnen, Schneiderinnen " it...it was about 200 women.</span> <span id="s302">About 200 woman was the drop with these Germans.</span> <span id="s303">And so we stand also with the group and he turned the...the Germans they was on horses.</span> <span id="s304">This I remember.</span> <span id="s305">On white horses.</span> <span id="s306">White and brown, some kind.</span> <span id="s307">And and they turn us around and they say, "You follow us.”</span> <span id="s308">So we were sure that they need for their factory seamstresses.</span> <span id="s309">And we are going to be saved because at least we are going to be saved on that particular killing you know.</span> <span id="s310">So we followed them, and they took us I don't know where and you know, they took us to a prison.</span> <span id="s311">And the name of the prison is Termina.</span> <span id="s312">Termina prison.</span> <span id="s313">It's still in Latvia.</span> <span id="s314">Stilll is there.</span> <span id="s315">And the Germans went in and they opened up the door and all these two 200 woman went in in that prison and the Germans disappeared.</span> <span id="s316">Until today, I don't know where they are.</span> <span id="s317">And we have never, ever worked as seamstresses.</span> <span id="s318">Never!</span> <span id="s319">Till today, I don't know who they are.</span> <span id="s320">Is this a God's miracle or they was partisans or they was who?</span> <span id="s321">They just saved 200 women.</span> <span id="s322">Now, the story in the prison.</span> <span id="s323">Because we are Jews, we couldn't get a normal room with...with, you know, with a..</span> <span id="s324">.</span> <span id="s325">with a..</span> <span id="s326">.</span> <span id="s327">you call it a commada.</span> <span id="s328">You know, you have a commada where you can lie down.</span> <span id="s329">You have a..</span> <span id="s330">.</span> <span id="s331">a straw sack and you have a straw pillow like...like prisoners usually do.</span> <span id="s332">Now, they took us on top on the attica, and the attica was a open place.</span> <span id="s333">You know, an openly...you know what a attica is.</span> <span id="s334">A open place.</span> <span id="s335">No ceiling.</span> <span id="s336">You...you put up your head and you see the Heaven is there, you know.</span> <span id="s337">And in November, usually, in Latvia is snow and cold and...and freezing.</span> <span id="s338">And we was in that attica about 3 weeks.</span> <span id="s339">We was...lived.</span> <span id="s340">.</span> <span id="s341">lived there.</span> <span id="s342">Like herring in...in.</span> <span id="s343">.</span> <span id="s344">in...in a..</span> <span id="s345">.</span> <span id="s346">in a box, you know.</span> <span id="s347">We was sitting on each other.</span> <span id="s348">We was sleeping together.</span> <span id="s349">And you know all this...I think it's 2 or 3 weeks.</span> <span id="s350">I really don't remember that.</span> <span id="s351">I remember it was before December.</span> <span id="s352">There was not one single snow, not one single rain.</span> <span id="s353">The sun was shining.</span> <span id="s354">It was beautiful and warm.</span> <span id="s355">Nobody froze.</span> <span id="s356">Nothing!</span> <span id="s357">You know, in my later years, I was thinking, "God, did you do that?"</span> <span id="s358">Usually, November, it was...you...you wear a peltz [fur].</span> <span id="s359">It's so freezing cold in Latvia.</span> <span id="s360">It was beautiful.</span> <span id="s361">The sun in the...during the day, the sun was in the...night the...the...the...the...the sky was beautiful, clean with the stars.</span> <span id="s362">I remember I was lying and looking in the stars, counting the stars.</span> <span id="s363">It was like summer.</span> <span id="s364">It was magnificent.</span> <span id="s365">Nobody get even sick.</span> <span id="s366">Nobody.</span> <span id="s367">Only we was lice.</span> <span id="s368">I remember I..</span> <span id="s369">.</span> <span id="s370">I was lying down and saw lice coming over me.</span> <span id="s371">I have never seen so...such big lice, the way I have them on my coat.</span> <span id="s372">And I told my Mom, "Look at these lice.”</span> <span id="s373">She said, "Good.</span> <span id="s374">Good.”</span> <span id="s375">She say, "Don't worry about the lice.</span> <span id="s376">You are alive.</span> <span id="s377">Good.”</span> <span id="s378">My Mom believed in God all the time.</span> <span id="s379">And she was in that prison upstairs in that attica the only one who had two children with her, so she was quiet with her mouth.</span> <span id="s380">She didn't say a word.</span> <span id="s381">She was happy that she has two children with her because the other woman didn't have no children,</span></p> <p><span id="s382">01:21:45 nobody, they were "uno", by themselves there.</span> <span id="s383">And so there was jealous on my mother and say, "You are talking.</span> <span id="s384">What are you talking?</span> <span id="s385">You have two children with you.”</span> <span id="s386">You know, it was such...such a jealousy between the woman and the madness and one beautiful night, you know, a woman gave a birth to a girl, to a baby girl.</span> <span id="s387">Can you imagine?</span> <span id="s388">Oh, I will never tell this will something absolutely dreadful.</span> <span id="s389">That little kid...kid.</span> <span id="s390">A girl!</span> <span id="s391">And you know, that she didn't even cry because the mother was so hungry she barely had milk.</span> <span id="s392">So everybody was around the children.</span> <span id="s393">I remembered my mother gave her underskirt, you know, to...to cuddle in the child and...and somebody was cutting off the...the...the...the, you know, how you call that...I don't know.</span> <span id="s394">A little kid...what...</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: A cord.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: A cord.</span> <span id="s397">Yeah.</span> <span id="s398">A cord.</span> <span id="s399">And we...we...we was hiding that because when the Germans would know that there is a kid...and you know we hide that girl.</span> <span id="s400">Later she came...they killed her</span></p> <p><span id="s401">01:22:50 anyway.</span> <span id="s402">But the...the...the girl's name was Termina.</span> <span id="s403">And she was in the ghetto still till the second aktion.</span> <span id="s404">She was still alive, and then she was also killed with her mother, when it was the second aktion.</span> <span id="s405">So we was here all the time till the ghetto was cleaned out and after the ghetto.</span> <span id="s406">There was a lot of clothes and...and everything, you know, left and...and...and good things and when we...then they took us back...back to the ghetto to prepare for the next killing because there was two aktions.</span> <span id="s407">This was the first.</span> <span id="s408">This is coming the first...the second.</span> <span id="s409">And you know, I was a girl.</span> <span id="s410">I was not going to work.</span> <span id="s411">Women didn't go to work, only men.</span> <span id="s412">So I stay all...all the time by the women's ghetto by the gate and was looking how in the morning, 5 o'clock in the morning, the people...the men...only men's groups...only men's groups was going out to work, going out to work.</span> <span id="s413">And it come to mind I have to run.</span> <span id="s414">What I'm going to stay here?</span> <span id="s415">Because there will be killing.</span> <span id="s416">When I will tell that my mother will never let me do it.</span> <span id="s417">I wanted out.</span> <span id="s418">I wanted out.</span> <span id="s419">I wanted out.</span> <span id="s420">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s421">It was nothing to do the whole day.</span> <span id="s422">Just...just wait...waiting for death you know.</span> <span id="s423">Everybody was when I'm...when I'm going to kill you.</span> <span id="s424">They killed them in December, beginning of December, and I run away.</span> <span id="s425">In meanwhile, they brought from...from Kaunas from Vienna, from Holland, from Muenster, from France other Jews to kill them here because as I later heard the...the...the Holland people say, "You want to kill them.</span> <span id="s426">Take them out.</span> <span id="s427">We are not going to.”</span> <span id="s428">Latvia was the only country who accepted every other country's Jews to be killed.</span> <span id="s429">That is the truth.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">01:24:40</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: So you...you were standing at the gate watching the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: So I was standing by the gate and watching, but you know, only men could go out, not woman.</span> <span id="s433">I am a girl so I did need men's clothes.</span> <span id="s434">I needed men's clothes.</span> <span id="s435">So I went upstairs and was looking.</span> <span id="s436">There was all over the place ghetto was clothes as much as you want.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Killed the people and...and the...the clothes what they bring back from that aktion, you know.</span> <span id="s438">Clothes was was like this.</span> <span id="s439">You can have them.</span> <span id="s440">There...there was a lot of clothes.</span> <span id="s441">And I put on a pair of pants and, uh...a big jacket I remember such a..</span> <span id="s442">.</span> <span id="s443">and in a hat with...with like a dog hat, with...with flaps here, to look like a boy.</span> <span id="s444">And then one morning...that particular morning, I stand on the gate.</span> <span id="s445">Gail, I have to tell you something.</span> <span id="s446">Everybody asks me, "How could you get out of that gate when there was projectors on you?</span> <span id="s447">There was German Polizei with guns walking.</span> <span id="s448">Six people this way and six people this way.</span> <span id="s449">No way could you get out of this.</span> <span id="s450">Not be seeing you.</span> <span id="s451">They have to see you.</span> <span id="s452">You couldn't open up the gate and get out by yourself.</span> <span id="s453">You could not do it because it was light...like a daylight.</span> <span id="s454">It was 5 o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s455">It was very dark.</span> <span id="s456">But the projectors was so loud and you know, light that you...you just couldn't.</span> <span id="s457">They have to see you.</span> <span id="s458">And I opened up the gate and I went...wait...waited where the men's ghetto groups comes out and I ran in in that group and the men surrounded me because they knew what I'm doing.</span> <span id="s459">They surrounded me.</span> <span id="s460">I was not so tall.</span> <span id="s461">I was not so high.</span> <span id="s462">They surrounded me and I went out with the group to town.</span> <span id="s463">I went to town.</span> <span id="s464">And when I was in the town, I did have a Magen David here and a Magen David in the back, so the man in the back took off my Magen David and tells me, "Take off the Magen David on the front.</span> <span id="s465">Take off and don't go in the middle of the street," because Jews was going, you know, in the middle of...of the street.</span> <span id="s466">Only not a Jews can go on the trottoir [sidewalk], you know.</span> <span id="s467">Say, "Take off on the front there the Magen David and go...go on the trottoir.</span> <span id="s468">Don't go in the middle.</span> <span id="s469">Go on the trottoir.”</span> <span id="s470">So I jumped on the trottoir, and the man who was...you know, they have a</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Sidewalk.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Sidewalk?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: I was on the trottoir.</span> <span id="s475">The trottoir, how do you say in English?</span> <span id="s476">Q: Sidewalk.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">01:27:15</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: The sidewalk.</span> <span id="s479">So I went on the sidewalk when the group went away.</span> <span id="s480">So here I was, 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s481">Dark.</span> <span id="s482">I was so scared and I looked, you know, like...like a Schornsteinfeger [chimney sweep] .</span> <span id="s483">You know, what you put in the field and birds are afraid.</span> <span id="s484">How you call that?</span> <span id="s485">You put it you know like this.</span> <span id="s486">It stays like.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: [scarecrow]</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Yeah, you know.</span> <span id="s489">I looked awful.</span> <span id="s490">Everybody was standing around and looking at me.</span> <span id="s491">I looked like really not real.</span> <span id="s492">So I knew I have to hide somewhere.</span> <span id="s493">I have to go somewhere.</span> <span id="s494">I remembered I was going over a station and there was...over a station because I was afraid to meet somebody because everybody was standing around and looking at me.</span> <span id="s495">I was looking not real.</span> <span id="s496">People don't...not dressed like me.</span> <span id="s497">And then I..</span> <span id="s498">.</span> <span id="s499">I was walking, walking and sweating, you know.</span> <span id="s500">I was so scared.</span> <span id="s501">Basically, I wanted to go to our maid.</span> <span id="s502">We had a..</span> <span id="s503">.</span> <span id="s504">a Baptist woman who was working years ago with...with my father, so I wanted to go to her house.</span> <span id="s505">I remember I know where she was living.</span> <span id="s506">And I didn't even mean to...to get in...must be I was walking already couple of hours because it was getting light.</span> <span id="s507">It was getting...and I knew I have to hide.</span> <span id="s508">I have to go.</span> <span id="s509">I cannot go on like this.</span> <span id="s510">So I saw a little gate, and I went on in the gate.</span> <span id="s511">That was a house.</span> <span id="s512">I will show you.</span> <span id="s513">I have the picture of the house andthere was wood wood, so I..</span> <span id="s514">.</span> <span id="s515">at first, I..</span> <span id="s516">.</span> <span id="s517">I hide behind the woods just to catch my breath, you know.</span> <span id="s518">It was just so...I didn't know what to do, where to go and...and I was tired and scared and sweaty.</span> <span id="s519">And then in that house, there was I saw a door.</span> <span id="s520">So I thought, "I'm going to knock on that door because maybe</span></p> <p><span id="s521">01:29: there are good people.</span> <span id="s522">Maybe there are Russian people.</span> <span id="s523">Maybe they will help me.”</span> <span id="s524">So I knocked on the door and suddenly I heard two dogs barking, you know, Shepherd dogs.</span> <span id="s525">And only the Germans did have Shepherd dogs.</span> <span id="s526">Nobody else.</span> <span id="s527">They was going, you know and...and looking with the dogs where there are Jews are hiding or partisans were hiding so I was sure I did something dreadful.</span> <span id="s528">And...and...and the...the dogs was crying terribly, but suddenly I heard a woman's voice in the Russian, to the dogs, like "Stop the barking.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Stop barking," in the Russian language.</span> <span id="s530">I said, "Oh, My God.</span> <span id="s531">This is maybe Russian people.</span> <span id="s532">So I was running back to the woods...to the...the woods.</span> <span id="s533">Then I came there was logs.</span> <span id="s534">You know, logs in English.</span> <span id="s535">Logs.</span> <span id="s536">Yeah.</span> <span id="s537">Behind the logs.</span> <span id="s538">Then I came back and knocked a second time on the door.</span> <span id="s539">And the second time, a man came to the door and...and in...in Russian: Kto tam?</span> <span id="s540">who is there?</span> <span id="s541">And I tell him: Otkrivaetz, otkrivaets.</span> <span id="s542">And I tell him, please, open.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Open," in Russian.</span> <span id="s544">And he opened the door and here stands a man, so about 40 years old, maybe 39.</span> <span id="s545">I don't...I'm not really sure.</span> <span id="s546">So about and...say you know, "I run away from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s547">Can I be in your place for awhile?"</span> <span id="s548">I tell him that in Russian.</span> <span id="s549">And he looked at me for a moment.</span> <span id="s550">He say, "Come in my child.</span> <span id="s551">You will be with me.”</span> <span id="s552">Then he took me in the kitchen, seated me on the table and give me food.</span> <span id="s553">I was starving.</span> <span id="s554">I was so hungry.</span> <span id="s555">He gave he a glass with warm milk.</span> <span id="s556">I will never forget that, and a big piece of black bread.</span> <span id="s557">Latvians bake their breads themselves.</span> <span id="s558">It was so delicious.</span> <span id="s559">Till today, I will never throw out a piece of bread as long as I live.</span> <span id="s560">And he told me, said he had yesterday a vision.</span> <span id="s561">God spoke to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Gail, maybe you don't believe me, but that man is alive and he can tell you the same thing.</span> <span id="s563">And God told him that a humanbeing will knock on your door.</span> <span id="s564">Take...take it in.</span> <span id="s565">Don't be afraid and save that person's life.</span> <span id="s566">I will be with you all the time through.</span> <span id="s567">I swear to God if I lie.</span> <span id="s568">That's what he told me.</span> <span id="s569">But then I believe in a God like you believe in " Ich waiss wos".</span> <span id="s570">I didn't believe him.</span> <span id="s571">I cuckoo, meshuge.</span> <span id="s572">He was a religious person, and he told...and he repeated that all the time, you know.</span> <span id="s573">You can ask him.</span> <span id="s574">He will tell you.</span> <span id="s575">He did have a vision.</span> <span id="s576">He didn't know that I am going to be the one.</span> <span id="s577">He thought maybe a old Jew will come or maybe a..</span> <span id="s578">.</span> <span id="s579">a soldier, a Russian soldier.</span> <span id="s580">The Germans were treating the Russian soldiers dreadful.</span> <span id="s581">They was starving on the streets.</span> <span id="s582">They was absolutely starving, these...these poor Russian soldiers.</span> <span id="s583">But it was me, and he thought that I am the one.</span> <span id="s584">And he told me...I told him, "I don't want to stay in your house.</span> <span id="s585">I will go to my Nanny.”</span> <span id="s586">He said, "No.</span> <span id="s587">No.</span> <span id="s588">You will stay right here and I will save your life.”</span> <span id="s589">I didn't want to do it, but...because he didn't let me go away.</span> <span id="s590">And in that particular farm family was his father, his mother, his sister, and his sister's husband who was...they...they was all beautiful people.</span> <span id="s591">They took me in without any problem.</span> <span id="s592">Only had the sister's...the sister's husband was a alcoholic, and they was afraid that being a alcoholic he can start babbling, you know, and telling.</span> <span id="s593">You know, my...my wife is saving a Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s594">That's all what they was very much afraid.</span> <span id="s595">But he was...he didn't do that so he didn't do that.</span> <span id="s596">So now he was thinking how to save my life.</span> <span id="s597">How to...to be around in the house was not really good.</span> <span id="s598">He needs a ...a cellar or something.</span> <span id="s599">So because the...the house where...where they lived, they had five...five rooms in five room apartment, and a parquet floor.</span> <span id="s600">You know a parquet floor?</span> <span id="s601">Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: Wooden, parquet floor.</span> <span id="s603">01:33:</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: Wooden...wooden parquet floor.</span> <span id="s605">So in that particular bedroom where I was hiding, he made a hole for me.</span> <span id="s606">He broke the...the...the parquet floor not big as my body is that I can myself put in and hide there.</span> <span id="s607">So he...he took a shovel and took the earth out and because the Germans was doing a garage in...in...in out of the house so he couldn't take the sand out and...and put it right there.</span> <span id="s608">You know how he did that.</span> <span id="s609">He put a big coat and put the sand in his pocket.</span> <span id="s610">Can you believe hundred times he was going back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, till he made me a little bunker.</span> <span id="s611">It was as big as I. Know, I was...I don't know how to say, 5 feet or something like this.</span> <span id="s612">Not a big one.</span> <span id="s613">I just did put down my body and sit there like that crumpled, you know, and sit there.</span> <span id="s614">You know, I can sit...I mean stretch my...my feet.</span> <span id="s615">And then if there was.</span> <span id="s616">.</span> <span id="s617">uh.</span> <span id="s618">.</span> <span id="s619">a danger, I took that...that little top myself and it was with little...I..</span> <span id="s620">.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: Handle?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: Handle?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: No, not handles, like like... Q: Hooks?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: Hooks.</span> <span id="s626">I can hook with...with four hooks.</span> <span id="s627">And I was sitting there and then he put on top a table.</span> <span id="s628">You know, a table with a big table cloth because the Germans when they came and they did came, they didn't look for me but they looked for his...something else happened.</span> <span id="s629">It's a different story.</span> <span id="s630">I just want to finish this one.</span> <span id="s631">Uh...So and a vase on top so nobody could know where...that's even somebody is hiding in that place.</span> <span id="s632">Surely if the Germans would be coming with dogs, they would find me with no questions asked.</span> <span id="s633">But God loved me and God wanted to leave me alive, so they came without dogs.</span> <span id="s634">This is other story I will tell you some other time.</span> <span id="s635">So in that particular hole I sat for 3 years.</span> <span id="s636">2 years and 8 months for...for exact till...the...the...the Russians came in and took it over.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: Let's...</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: That's the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s640">Let's talk a little bit more in detail about living like that under those conditions in the hole.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">01:35:30</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Did you come out during the day or what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: During the day because I..</span> <span id="s645">.</span> <span id="s646">you know there is no oxygen in...in...in that hole and it is wet and damp.</span> <span id="s647">Also, he put me a mattress there and he put his mother's fur coat there you know.</span> <span id="s648">He tried to do the best he could you know.</span> <span id="s649">And only when...when somebody was knocking on the door, you know, like the super.</span> <span

everything and I am in the house.</span> <span id="s716">I couldn't do it you know.</span> <span id="s717">It was very complicated.</span> <span id="s718">But the worse thing was that I had toothaches...toothaches.</span> <span id="s719">Such tooth aches I needed a doctor you know.</span> <span id="s720">I had such tooth pain that it...so I colored my hair blonde.</span> <span id="s721">That's what he wanted me to do.</span> <span id="s722">He get me peroxide.</span> <span id="s723">I have dark hair.</span> <span id="s724">My natural hair is dark.</span> <span id="s725">And he gave me, get me a false passport, and my name was Irma Purinya because if they catch me on the street I could...I could show that I am Irma Purinya, a Latvian you know.</span> <span id="s726">And they took me to a dentist.</span> <span id="s727">And the dentist fixed my tooth.</span> <span id="s728">And that's what he did.</span> <span id="s729">He did it.</span> <span id="s730">And he said, "Don't be afraid.”</span> <span id="s731">You know what he did else.</span> <span id="s732">One day he put in a Mogen David, a David Star here and a David Star in the back.</span> <span id="s733">And he went right in the ghetto, pass the German gate, find my mother, find my sister, bring them food regularly.</span> <span id="s734">Regularly the man did it.</span> <span id="s735">The way he came in.</span> <span id="s736">The way he came out.</span> <span id="s737">And you know when the Russians says to me, "How did you do that?"</span> <span id="s738">You know what the answer you say, "In the Bible says such a word if God wants he makes you blind, and you don't see it.</span> <span id="s739">They didn't see me.”</span> <span id="s740">That's what brought...that's what it is.</span> <span id="s741">And the same as when I went out of the ghetto of the gate.</span> <span id="s742">They did not see me.</span> <span id="s743">I went out.</span> <span id="s744">God...God's finger.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: So he brought food to your mother and your sister and then what?</span> <span id="s746">Did he bring anything back?</span></p> <p><span

id="s749">And then we sold that, make some money and...uh.</span> <span id="s750">.</span> <span id="s751">It was a "och und weh" you know.</span> <span id="s752">It was...we just...I surely...I surely thought that this is the end of the world because I will never believe that Hitler because he took Czechoslovakia and Poland and...and every country and nothing will be done.</span> <span id="s753">The country...the whole world was just watching looking what is going on.</span> <span id="s754">And sure he was watching all the time the radio and what's going on the front andI...I thought I'm going to live like that till my...end of my days.</span> <span id="s755">He said, "No."</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: Did he bring any letters?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s758">Yes.</span> <span id="s759">What I..</span> <span id="s760">.</span> <span id="s761">The most important thing was when he went into the ghetto...not always he went through the ghetto you know.</span> <span id="s762">Only once he did that.</span> <span id="s763">The other time he was crawling under the ghetto...under the...the...the...wire...wires, the...how you call these wires?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: Barbed wire.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: Barbed wire.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: Barbed wires.</span> <span id="s768">Exactly.</span> <span id="s769">Barbed wires.</span> <span id="s770">Under the barbed wires, they had a particular place where...where it was Abendon (?)</span> <span id="s771">.</span> <span id="s772">There where my daughter...daughter...my sister was meeting him.</span> <span id="s773">She knows when to meet and also he came to the place where she was working.</span> <span id="s774">That was better.</span> <span id="s775">In the place where she was working, they...they have a signal you know that they was making signals.</span> <span id="s776">He knew when to come.</span> <span id="s777">They met and she was writing letters to me and I was writing letters to her, so she know what I..</span> <span id="s778">.</span> <span id="s779">because she didn't even know that I am alive and I run away.</span> <span id="s780">My mother was sure I was killed.</span> <span id="s781">Because there was shooting, shooting, shooting, and I was run...going around in the ghetto from one end to the other.</span> <span id="s782">I wasn't sitting on one spot, so Mom and sister was sure I'm dead.</span> <span id="s783">I'm dead.</span> <span id="s784">And then when...when my priest came and found them, I told them the address.</span> <span id="s785">And he told them that she's...she's in my cellar.</span> <span id="s786">She is here.</span> <span id="s787">She's alive.</span> <span id="s788">You can imagine my Mom.</span> <span id="s789">She...she couldn't' believe it how happy she was.</span> <span id="s790">So he took out letters from her and I have 10 letters from my sister written to me how they was surviving in ghetto.</span> <span id="s791">That's I'm also going to give to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: Did you life change anywhere in that cellar during those 3 years that you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: Oh, I wanted to go back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s794">I wanted to be with my mother.</span> <span id="s795">And I wanted to be with my sister.</span> <span id="s796">They was writing me such dreadful letters.</span> <span id="s797">I thought that I'm going to come to the ghetto, let my mother come to here.</span> <span id="s798">My mother was sick with ulcers.</span> <span id="s799">She couldn't eat nothing.</span> <span id="s800">She was losing weight and my...my sister and my mother was extremely close.</span> <span id="s801">I was my father's daughter.</span> <span id="s802">I was Dad's girl, but she was very...and she wrote me that Mom is very sick and medicine.</span> <span id="s803">They didn't have any medicine you know.</span> <span id="s804">Aw, she was very ill, my mother.</span> <span id="s805">And the moment she cannot work, my Mom would be...my Mom would be shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">They don't need sick, old people.</span> <span id="s807">They don't need them.</span> <span id="s808">So my...my... my sister's letters was breaking my heart and I wanted to go back.</span> <span id="s809">I thought it's so simple.</span> <span id="s810">I will go back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s811">Mom will come in place of me and the man will save her and I will go to...stupid you know, but that's the way I wanted.</span> <span id="s812">And my sister was sending me terrible letters.</span> <span id="s813">"Don't you be dumb.</span> <span id="s814">You don't do that?</span> <span id="s815">How can you do such a thing?</span> <span id="s816">Mom will never change with you, you know?"</span> <span id="s817">And so you will read the letters.</span> <span id="s818">It's just...I would...I wanted to go back.</span> <span id="s819">I wanted to go back.</span> <span id="s820">I wanted to be with my Mom.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: Did you have any contact in the cellar with anybody besides the family that you were staying with?</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: Uh...I had a contact only with the...No.</span> <span id="s823">There was a family, friends of...of my savior.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">His...his friends and in...in a case if I would be in danger here, I would maybe go to their house.</span> <span id="s825">But they didn't play a big role in my life, but...but I have their names and I'm very thankful because they also bring food and shared sometimes.</span> <span id="s826">I saw them.</span> <span id="s827">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: While you were in the cellar, did the Germans ever come to the house?</span> <span id="s829">A: Yes, they did.</span> <span id="s830">They did.</span> <span id="s831">Not...not looking for me.</span> <span id="s832">Should I tell you that?</span> <span id="s833">Q: Please.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">01:44:00</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: Uh...You see basically, I have two saviors.</span> <span id="s836">That priest and his sister.</span> <span id="s837">These two people basically saved because the parents died and her husband died, so I was left with these just two people who saved my life till the very end.</span> <span id="s838">And.</span> <span id="s839">.</span> <span id="s840">uh...the sister...they are a very intelligent family you know.</span> <span id="s841">Her father was a tea representative in India, and the mother was a painter.</span> <span id="s842">They...they are very intelligent

factory.</span> <span id="s847">Kuznibor is the name of the factory.</span> <span id="s848">She was painting vases and plates and she was a marvelous.</span> <span id="s849">I have some plates home in New York.</span> <span id="s850">And there was working a Russian...a Russian what is Vajena Pleinik (?)</span> <span id="s851">.</span> <span id="s852">How...how do you call that in English?</span> <span id="s853">Oh, God.</span> <span id="s854">I have...I needed that word.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: That's alright.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: No.</span> <span id="s857">No.</span>

prisoners of war in that factory doing dirty jobs.</span> <span id="s865">But because she's Russian, and the people are Russian, so she also bring food to them and...and befriended them you know.</span> <span id="s866">And there was was two guys whom she wanted to help.</span> <span id="s867">So she bring him to the house....to our house.</span> <span id="s868">I saw him through the door.</span> <span id="s869">You know, I opened up the door and I saw a little bit of them.</span> <span id="s870">I remembered how they looked.</span> <span id="s871">They didn't know that I am there.</span> <span id="s872">They didn't tell them that they're hiding a Jewish girl there.</span> <span id="s873">So I..</span> <span id="s874">.</span> <span id="s875">I was...I saw him.</span> <span id="s876">And...My priest get them priest clothes and false documents and we wanted them to go Resikecky you know you took...to bring them over to the Russian area so they could go or to the partisans or somehow closer to the Russians you know, and they wanted to save their life.</span> <span id="s877">Everybody knew.</span> <span id="s878">No, his father and mother were stilll alive.</span> <span id="s879">I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s880">Then when...when they saved these two people, the father and the mother was not dead yet.</span> <span id="s881">Only her husband was dead.</span> <span id="s882">So they bring him in that house.</span> <span id="s883">They clothed him in that priest's clothes, get him the documents, and let him go.</span> <span id="s884">The Gestapo catched him not far from the border and took him back to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s885">And they scalped them.</span> <span id="s886">They scalped them.</span> <span id="s887">So at night at 3 o'clock in the morning...we already had...we didn't know nothing.</span> <span id="s888">Somebody came the day before and told Olga...Olga is the name of the...of the woman who did that...to disappear because there will be definitely a..</span> <span id="s889">.</span> <span id="s890">a blava...how you call that?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: Search.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: A search.</span> <span id="s893">So she disappeared.</span> <span id="s894">We didn't even know where she is.</span> <span id="s895">So they come not to look for me.</span> <span id="s896">They come for</span></p> <p><span id="s897">01:47 particular Olga.</span> <span id="s898">So 3 o'clock in the morning: "Aufmachen" Banged the door.</span> <span id="s899">"Aufmachen" And I'm in bed.</span> <span id="s900">You know, I'm sleeping in the bed.</span> <span id="s901">So they...they have to hold on the door until I'm in the...in the...in the pit till I close the...the top, till they put the table on top, till they table cloth on top, till they put the base on top.</span> <span id="s902">And "Aufmachen, aufmachen, aufmachen".</span></p> <p><span id="s903">So everybody, you know, is out of breath and scared.</span> <span id="s904">Aufmachen!</span> <span id="s905">So they surrounded the whole house.</span> <span id="s906">They surrounded...inside maybe 6...6 police looking, looking, "Where is Olga Katzinova?</span> <span id="s907">Where is Olga Katzinova?"</span> <span id="s908">And his mother speaks fluent German.</span> <span id="s909">She say, "She is not here.</span> <span id="s910">She don't live even here.</span> <span id="s911">She...she went 2 weeks ago.</span> <span id="s912">We saw where she comes and goes we have no idea.”</span> <span id="s913">And and he was touching every bed, every bed and surely you know people just 3 o'clock the beds are warm.</span> <span id="s914">He say, "Who slept in this bed?"</span> <span id="s915">So Elizabeth Irina, the mother, say, "My dog.</span> <span id="s916">My dog.”</span> <span id="s917">She has two dogs.</span> <span id="s918">"My dog slept in that bed.”</span> <span id="s919">And then she...he found a pant...my panties, you know my little panties.”</span> <span id="s920">He said, "Is this the dog's panties.”</span> <span id="s921">"No," she said, "this is my panties.”</span> <span id="s922">Because she was very tiny.</span> <span id="s923">She was a tiny woman.</span> <span id="s924">And they turned the house around, and they arrested my priest, the father and the mother and Valodya, all...all of them.</span> <span id="s925">And I'm in the cellar by myself with the two dogs upstairs.</span> <span id="s926">And how long can I stay there inside.</span> <span id="s927">I have no air.</span> <span id="s928">I have to get out.</span> <span id="s929">And the...the two dogs are "hmm hmm hmm hum," go around.</span> <span id="s930">You see, Gail, what I want to tell you is if they would come with dogs, they would find me because the dogs would smell me out you understand.</span> <span id="s931">That miracles that God send the Germans without the dogs.</span> <span id="s932">Isn't this something?</span> <span id="s933">Tell me.</span> <span id="s934">They never...they always came with dogs.</span> <span id="s935">Always!</span> <span id="s936">But this time they didn't.</span> <span id="s937">So I..</span> <span id="s938">.</span> <span id="s939">I..</span> <span id="s940">.</span> <span id="s941">I count that a God's miracle again, and I can tell you about miracles more and more and more.</span> <span id="s942">And they arrested the whole house and I was by myself in that cellar with the two dogs.</span> <span id="s943">Now I think to myself, "Maybe there is a German upstairs waiting till Olga comes home.</span> <span id="s944">I cannot open up.</span> <span id="s945">They will find me.</span> <span id="s946">What should I do?</span> <span id="s947">How long can I stay?</span> <span id="s948">I was already without breath.”</span> <span id="s949">And then I called, Chippie, Biggie.</span> <span id="s950">This is the names of the dogs.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">And if those dogs come to me, around me, "Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm," because I know when there would be a German that these dogs was trained to bark on Germans.</span> <span id="s952">She trained them to bark mostly on Germans.</span> <span id="s953">They didn't bark.</span> <span id="s954">Nothing!</span> <span id="s955">So I say, "There must be nobody.”</span> <span id="s956">And they was hungry.</span> <span id="s957">I have to give them some food.</span> <span id="s958">So I open up my little top and I went out and there was nobody.</span> <span id="s959">But what not?</span> <span id="s960">Now they are arrested.</span> <span id="s961">And this was I will</span></p> <p><span id="s962">01:50: tell you 6 o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s963">They...they was searching for 2 hours.</span> <span id="s964">They arrested...now follow me.</span> <span id="s965">Six o'clock in the morning, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...nobody!</span> <span id="s966">I was alone.</span> <span id="s967">I didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s968">What should I do?</span> <span id="s969">Now they are dead.</span> <span id="s970">I know the Gestapo will not let them come back.</span> <span id="s971">They are dead.</span> <span id="s972">What I'm going to alone in that big house.</span> <span id="s973">You know...you know I didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s974">I..</span> <span id="s975">.</span> <span id="s976">I was dying.</span> <span id="s977">I..</span> <span id="s978">.</span> <span id="s979">I..</span> <span id="s980">.</span> <span id="s981">I have to go back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s982">Six o'clock in the evening they all came back home.</span> <span id="s983">Aw, he was worrying about me, and I was worrying about them.</span> <span id="s984">You can imagine what a welcome it was to both of us.</span> <span id="s985">We was hysterically crying and...and...and his mother and father kissed me and hugged me and oh, they was such beautiful people.</span> <span id="s986">I'm telling you I have never met in my life that kind of fine people as they was.</span> <span id="s987">So they came back and they told me they was taken to the Gestapo and they saw these two soldiers, these Russian...Russian war prisoners.</span> <span id="s988">They was scalped.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">They was scalped.</span> <span id="s990">They didn't recognize them.</span> <span id="s991">And they asked, "Do you know them?</span> <span id="s992">You know...this is .</span> <span id="s993">This is eye to eye witness.</span> <span id="s994">They say, "We never saw him.”</span> <span id="s995">They...they was hitting them and...and beating them and they say, "No, we have never...we don't know them who they

id="s1035">Life goes on.</span> <span id="s1036">Q: And then what happened after you got married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: I married and I had a..</span> <span id="s1038">.</span> <span id="s1039">you know, in Latvia, I already have Grundschule [elementary school], I finished before my hiding, six...six classes.</span> <span id="s1040">We have to, then it's gymnasium you know, the middle school.</span> <span id="s1041">But I finished the theater what is together with the high school.</span> <span id="s1042">And I wanted to be actress or do something in show business and met my husband and get married and I..</span> <span id="s1043">.</span> <span id="s1044">I was able to have a baby, my baby girl, Aviva.</span> <span id="s1045">And we lived better than ever.</span> <span id="s1046">We had everything.</span> <span id="s1047">We was working.</span> <span id="s1048">My husband was working.</span> <span id="s1049">Then...</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: Then you stayed how long in Riga?</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: We was fighting with the Russians for 15 years.</span> <span id="s1052">Thirty six times they refused us to get out.</span> <span id="s1053">They didn't give us a permission.</span> <span id="s1054">We was one of the very, very first.</span> <span id="s1055">We wanted out.</span> <span id="s1056">My husband wanted out because he was in

survived only that, and he hated them guts.</span> <span id="s1061">He wanted back and out of here.</span> <span id="s1062">So we found his mother.</span> <span id="s1063">What we didn't even know that she is alive.</span> <span id="s1064">We thought that she is also dead.</span> <span id="s1065">Because you know, it was such a chaos during the war.</span> <span id="s1066">When the Russians came in, people was evacuating and and my father didn't want to go to the Russia, because he hated the Communisms, and that's why we went... Maybe if my father would, you know, evacuate together with us, maybe he would be even alive.</span> <span id="s1067">But that happened.</span> <span id="s1068">He didn't love them and he didn't want them.</span> <span id="s1069">And in the first war, the...the Germans was not bad.</span> <span id="s1070">They treated their war...war people very good.</span> <span id="s1071">So my father said,
