Hayes, Ohio.</span> <span id="s14">it was in Columbus, Ohio.</span> <span id="s15">The way I got into the unit was most interesting.</span> <span id="s16">I was called in one day, into an auditorium, there were about 150 or 200 other men in there and we were given a portion of a poem to read.</span> <span id="s17">I read it as I remembered it, remembered it well and that was the end of that interview.</span> <span id="s18">The next morning I was told to be ready to leave on a Triple A-1 shipment, that I was to be in this particular unit.</span> <span id="s19">Not knowing what it was I went home, I did what I had to do to get my wife and youngster set up to go back to our home in Mansfield, Ohio and I left then for our port of embarkation.</span> <span id="s20">We stayed there for a while, the trip across the ocean of course was only interesting to us and we saw submarines all over the place, of course there were none.</span> <span id="s21">We landed at Liverpool, England, from there we went to Manchester where we trained.</span> <span id="s22">We were separated into units, I was in a six man unit.</span> <span id="s23">Each man was German speaking, some of us were good, some of us were not so good, but we could handle ourselves, we could speak all of the dialects so that we could feel almost at home wherever we were.</span> <span id="s24">I must preface this by telling you that all of this happened in one of the most sophisticated periods in the history of the world and you please must believe me when I tell you I do not condemn all Germans because in my opinion the German people are more like Americans than any other peoples of the world.</span> <span id="s25">They’re family conscious, they’re loving, they’re industrious, inventive, patrons of the arts and medicines and most responsible.</span> <span id="s26">This evil time in the world history relates to a satanic thug by name of Adolph Hitler who took advantage of world economic conditions to exploit his own dreams of world domination by systematic cruel and calculating murder and murder is the only word there is for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">As I tell you we were in Manchester, England billeted two men to a private home and our intensive training began.</span> <span id="s28">Training consisted of crash courses in German, all dialects, speaking with people who had toured Germany, had pictures of the area and getting a good education of land, escape routes, what to expect and so forth.</span> <span id="s29">At this point we were assigned to units with many units consisting of 100 or more men to administer to large cities down to “D” teams consisting of six men to administer to small towns.</span> <span id="s30">Each man had a particular specialty.</span> <span id="s31">it could have been hospital administration, security, health and welfare, general administration, finance, handling of displaced persons and so forth.</span> <span id="s32">Each man in an emergency could perform the other man’s job.</span> <span id="s33">In other words, every job was covered.</span> <span id="s34">I happened to be on a “D” team otherwise known as an arrowhead team attached to whatever unit: infantry, artillery, military police, air force or wherever needed as an intelligence unit.</span> <span id="s35">We also were assigned a specific setting and area.</span> <span id="s36">We knew everything about our town which happened to be Fredrickshaupten as well as an escape route in the event we got into trouble.</span> <span id="s37">As per usual in the army we never got to Fredrickshaupten.</span> <span id="s38">While in training we were given a bit of an extra job, we were sent to Scotland to pick up and convoy 4 by 4 trucks to a port of embarkation for transfer to France.</span> <span id="s39">All of this before the invasion we delivered the vehicles to the FFV.</span> <span id="s40">On the beach was found gas bombs and in the invasion all people who participated had gas impregnated clothing.</span> <span id="s41">The vehicles were painted with a special white paint that turned color if gas was present.</span> <span id="s42">After the landing the French came until we crossed the border at the bridge into Germany where we did our thing.</span> <span id="s43">Getting information, infiltering, interrogation, setting up security, taking care of displaced persons, setting curfew and preparing for occupation.</span> <span id="s44">Our usual stay in a location was about three or four days depending upon the problems at hand.</span> <span id="s45">Then we would proceed to another area with another unit.</span> <span id="s46">There were problems, there were good times, there were bad times.</span> <span id="s47">I can tell you something about life under the Nazis, it may be redundant but I think it’s important.</span> <span id="s48">Life under the Nazis was complete subordination, a police state when one did not have the proper papers he would be absolutely immobile.</span> <span id="s49">He could go nowhere, he could not get food stamps, he could not survive.</span> <span id="s50">Children were organized into kinder camps for Hitler Yungen.</span> <span id="s51">They were encouraged to spy on their families and parents, neighbors and everybody.</span> <span id="s52">Life was ersatz, as you know ersatz is a substitute, there was a substitute for everything,m flour meal, tobacco, coffee, gasoline.</span> <span id="s53">Everything was a substitute, it was an unbelievable life, it was a way of life.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">I will try to take you now into the preparation for getting into Dachau, the major camp we participated in the liberation of.</span> <span id="s55">One Sunday afternoon about one o’clock the six of us were having lunch in a small town.</span> <span id="s56">It was a bitter cold day and the name of the town escapes me at the moment.</span> <span id="s57">A courier contacted us and ordered us to a rendezvous point about 70 miles distant.</span> <span id="s58">Being in the branch of the service we were we had been alerted to this day and we knew what it meant but we didn’t know when.</span> <span id="s59">We hurriedly packed our three jeeps and trailers and were on our way.</span> <span id="s60">Upon our arrival at the rendezvous point we saw the largest concentration of Allied troops we had ever seen.</span> <span id="s61">How many people I don’t know but there were English, Canadians, Aussies, Dutch, French, Luxemburgers and of course our own people.</span> <span id="s62">After a briefing and full inspection, we were given a hot meal in preparation to leave.</span> <span id="s63">Just before dark we started on our journey.</span> <span id="s64">it was bitter cold, it was snowing and under General Patton’s orders the windshield were down to prevent reflection.</span> <span id="s65">Complete blackout with only half lights showing when we started out.</span> <span id="s66">Ten minute break every hour and believe me Patton didn’t make any points with the GI’s with opened jeeps.</span> <span id="s67">I must add that at this point in time resistance was at a low ebb.</span> <span id="s68">Everybody knew the war was winding down, everybody in Germany knew it was a lost cause.</span> <span id="s69">Soldiers of the Wehrmacht were surrendering or deserting.</span> <span id="s70">They were tired of war and at the deprivations of the war as were the Canadians and civilians, Canadians as well as everybody else.</span> <span id="s71">Everybody was permissive and control was very easy for us.</span> <span id="s72">Of course there were some that were hardhearted and they wanted to continue the battle.</span> <span id="s73">We got into Munich about 3 o’clock in the morning, kept if for ourselves for approximately an hour, then to our assigned area before daybreak.</span> <span id="s74">Dachau was our baby.</span> <span id="s75">Dachau is a paper mill town approximately 15 to 16 kilometers from Munich.</span> <span id="s76">When we entered Dachau there was no resistance, it was like a ride in the park.</span> <span id="s77">Upon entering the camp chaos was the order of the day.</span> <span id="s78">Prisoners running around uncontrollable but too weak to cause real trouble.</span> <span id="s79">Our team had assignments, each team had assignments.</span> <span id="s80">There were four Allied troops, two Canadians, two Americans and our specific job was to get into Dachau to gather information.</span> <span id="s81">We had to find them which we did.</span> <span id="s82">Medical treatment, food, delousing stations were set up.</span> <span id="s83">Clothing stations were set up, interrogation and release for rehabilitation.</span> <span id="s84">I forgot to mention that prior to entering the camp we were all dusted with DDT and a new product to protect us from typhus and so forth.</span> <span id="s85">My partner and I we worked the buddy system.</span> <span id="s86">Our experience was in the Commandant’s office and I won’t go into that because I don’t like to remember that.</span> <span id="s87">The camp itself upon reflection when things quieted down looked like a walk in the park.</span> <span id="s88">As you entered the camp it looked like a military school, green grass, lots of trees.</span> <span id="s89">A huge sign over the entrance to it “Arbeit Mach Frei” which means work makes freedom and that was true, work did make freedom but the freedom could have been death.</span> <span id="s90">We, at this point had set up, we had set up our stations there, my partner and myself who happened to be a Jewish boy, Ernie Greenwald decided that we would like to go and see the conditions there, where the people were living.</span> <span id="s91">They were almost indescribable, five or six layers of wood slabs, one above the other.</span> <span id="s92">People were living on straw, dirty, filthy straw mattresses.</span> <span id="s93">They had little or anything or covering.</span> <span id="s94">We had prepared ourselves to go into this place, into this barracks but we never dreamed we would see what we saw.</span> <span id="s95">When we told the inmates that we were Jewish, I hesitate to use the word inmate but I don’t know a better word.</span> <span id="s96">Prisoner I guess.</span> <span id="s97">We told them that we were Jewish, they kissed our shoes, they kissed our hands, they cried, we cried.</span> <span id="s98">We had taken everything we had in there with us.</span> <span id="s99">We broke cigarettes in half so they could all get some.</span> <span id="s100">We took candy bars which we distributed, we took fruit in there which we distributed and it was a very, very trying thing for all of us.</span> <span id="s101">I met one man in there who had a very, very low number tattooed on his arm.</span> <span id="s102">This man was not a Jewish man but he was most articulate in his speech and was a political prisoner.</span> <span id="s103">He told me something that I have never forgotten.</span> <span id="s104">He told me that when you entered the camp, you knew your fate was sealed, you just didn’t know what it was going to be other than death but how you were going to meet it.</span> <span id="s105">That was the thing that he didn’t know.</span> <span id="s106">The camp itself had many kinds of torture.</span> <span id="s107">There was a moat, there was an electrified fence, the guards had police dogs with them that could tear a person to pieces.</span> <span id="s108">One particular thing of interrogation and torture we found was a platform about six or eight feet long, at one end of it was a chair that was on a swivel.</span> <span id="s109">At the other end a man stood, a German person stood who was going to be the interrogator.</span> <span id="s110">He had two handles and with those handles he could swivel the chair from left to right.</span> <span id="s111">On either side of the person sitting in the chair nude in freezing cold weather or whatever the weather might have been, he was turned for these people for questioning.</span> <span id="s112">We noticed on the floor a hole about an inch deep.</span> <span id="s113">We couldn’t figure what it was until we went back to the person who was regulating the handles and we found that there was a pedal on the floor and when you stepped on the pedal, a spike came up to this man’s derriere and the hole was made by trying to get away from it and putting his foot down.</span> <span id="s114">This was one form of interrogation.</span> <span id="s115">There were so many forms it’s hard to remember what they did, teeth were knocked out, hair was pulled out, fingernails were pulled out, anything that was terrible, anything you could imagine was terrible was used.</span> <span id="s116">How did they separate, how did they put the people into various groups?</span> <span id="s117">As the cars were unloaded, they would march the people to separation points.</span> <span id="s118">The old people, old and weak people or sickly people were put aside at one point, mothers and babies were set aside at another point.</span> <span id="s119">Strong young people were set aside at another area, young girls were set at another side, another point and used as prostitutes.</span> <span id="s120">It was well regulated, it was like everything the Germans did, it was in order.</span> <span id="s121">An interesting thing that I must tell you, previous to getting into Dachau I had found a Torah in one of the rock houses, one of the court houses.</span> <span id="s122">I was taking it home to give to my grandfather who lived in Cleveland, Ohio, and he had set up one of the first synagogues in Cleveland.</span> <span id="s123">While in Germany I was carrying it with me and sitting around one day waiting for something to happen, a Jewish Chaplain came into our office.</span> <span id="s124">He looked at me, I looked at him, we knew we knew each other but we didn’t where until we established that when I lived in West Virginia, he was the student rabbi who came to our town every two weeks.</span> <span id="s125">It was almost the first of May and the Russians had already celebrated May Day.</span> <span id="s126">I gave him the Torah so he could hold services with the Torah in Dachau.</span> <span id="s127">He was forever grateful and I think it was one of the nicest things I have done in my lifetime.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Let me tell you a little about the city of Dachau.</span> <span id="s129">Dachau itself is a paper making city of I would say and this is merely a guess of 8 or 10,000 population.</span> <span id="s130">The odor in Dachau was terrible.</span> <span id="s131">People in Dachau did not know, they claimed they did not know there was such a thing as an extermination camp within a few kilometers of them.</span> <span id="s132">However the tradesmen, the bakers, the butchers, the candlestick makers were all employed by people, by citizens of Dachau.</span> <span id="s133">To get into Dachau, to go to the camp at Dachau this is what we found.</span> <span id="s134">On a spur, on a railroad spur going in we found fifty, sixty gondola cars still with bodies.</span> <span id="s135">Some were alive and some were dead.</span> <span id="s136">We recruited volunteers and I use the word volunteers with quotation marks.</span> <span id="s137">We told who would separate the living bodies from the dead.</span> <span id="s138">We gave them the best medical treatment we possibly could, we had called in hospital units there and they got the best that could be gotten.</span> <span id="s139">Let me tell you a little bit how, let me expand upon what happened to the people after they were separated into these units.</span> <span id="s140">The old and inform, people they could not use for anything were told to undress that their clothes would be sent some place to a delousing station.</span> <span id="s141">They undressed, they were given a bar of soap and a towel.</span> <span id="s142">They were then taken into a large building, clean as it could possibly be, I shouldn’t say as clean as it possibly could be, it was clean, it was very clean.</span> <span id="s143">It had a large sign over it: Baden which means shower bath.</span> <span id="s144">The method of execution once they were in there was done by people not Germans but by people who were bribed by a piece of bread or a potato and they are the people who turned on the gas.</span> <span id="s145">After the people were gassed, the room was cleaned up because certain things happen to a body after they die.</span> <span id="s146">People were loaded on little carts and it was a methodical preparation for the ovens.</span> <span id="s147">If there were gold teeth they were taken out.</span> <span id="s148">Their hair was cut off because hair can be used in different ways or have some kind of military use.</span> <span id="s149">They examined the body cavities to see if anything had been hidden of value.</span> <span id="s150">They were then stacked; they were ready for the ovens.</span> <span id="s151">They were put on another cart, they were turned into ashes at that point.</span> <span id="s152">The ashes were used for fertilizer.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">What can I tell you.</span> <span id="s154">In spite of the hate groups in the United States like the group in California who claim there was no such thing as a holocaust.</span> <span id="s155">I know the head of this group.</span> <span id="s156">He’s a young man who grew up with my three sons.</span> <span id="s157">I will not tell you his name because I don’t want to get involved in a thing like that.</span> <span id="s158">As I say he comes from my hometown.</span> <span id="s159">There are many Neo-Nazi groups located in many sections of the United States.</span> <span id="s160">I can tell you that there was a holocaust.</span> <span id="s161">There were six million Jews exterminated; there were fourteen billion non-Jews exterminated.</span> <span id="s162">Think of it, Germany, one of the world’s most progressive countries in the world.</span> <span id="s163">A country known for its music, its art, its profession and its many gifts to civilization left in ruins and chaotic conditions.</span> <span id="s164">it was this war caused by Hitler and his cohorts to put this world in a battle for survival.</span> <span id="s165">The time is proving that we are surviving and will continue to do so.</span> <span id="s166">I must tell you people and young people especially if you intend to become a member of our society, you must be on the lookout.</span> <span id="s167">you must recognize the signs of hatred starting out.</span> <span id="s168">You must be alert to other actions of other countries as well.</span> <span id="s169">Please recognize the fact that I am not trying to tell you that democracy is the only way of life.</span> <span id="s170">In my opinion it is the best way of life.</span> <span id="s171">For some perhaps a different form of government is best.</span> <span id="s172">I’ve been to Russia and can with a positive voice say that’s not for me.</span> <span id="s173">I’m sure unless you would like a police state it’s not fore you.</span> <span id="s174">In a word and in capital letters, it is terrible.</span> <span id="s175">It is a dictatorship and again in three stronger words, it is terrible.</span> <span id="s176">Just in case you haven’t recognized it yet, we live in the best country in the world.</span> <span id="s177">if I would say some of the things that I have said today in communist countries I would be exiled, destroyed or have my tongue cut out.</span> <span id="s178">Not only do we live in the best country in the world but being relatively a new resident of this area, I happen to think we live in one of the best areas in the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Good luck and thank you for giving me this time.</span></p></body></html>
