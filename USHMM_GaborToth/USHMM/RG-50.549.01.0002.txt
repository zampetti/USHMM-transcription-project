Interview with Agnes AdachiPRIVATE
October 14, 1995
Q. This is the interview with Agnes Adachi. I wanted to go back during the war a little bit. You mentioned your family and your father losing his business because of the wall street crash. What was your father's business when you were in Budapest?
A. He was a textile manufacturer and he had a big textile store in Budapest, but that was in the 20s. Instead of coming here, he picked up and went all the way to Turkey, with Phillip's Radios and at that time the Turks thought the radio was a spy thing, and you could only listen in the nights. In the day time you couldn't use any radio and we were there six months. I was about seven.
Q. You were in what city?
A. Now, it is Istanbul. It was Constanilopal. It was a very exciting time and I will never forget it, even so I was very little.
Q. When you came back to Budapest, what did your father do?
A. Well, he went back again and he worked in textiles. Not on his own, but it went. I can't even remember it. It was a very tough time, quite a tough time. But honestly we did not feel anti-semitism as other countries because my father himself he had so, so many Christian friends and we never heard "Hey, you're a Jew because your name is Mandle." Nothing, and I was growing up in a Protestant school and I was the only Jewish child for four years, the first four years and the Hebrew and Judaism I learned from my Protestant teacher. It was very interesting.
Q. Was there any anti-semitism going on in the city directed at your friends, anything you heard on the street?
A. Not then, you see this was still before Hitler, in the 30s and I constantly traveled and my last trip -- or my first trip alone was to go to Berlin, the olympic games in 1936 and of course Hitler and Goebles and everybody was there. I was supposed to go the year before because I had dear friends there who thank God I saved, but it's a long story not for you maybe and I was supposed to go as my graduation present and I got scarlet fever so I couldn't go. So, they said then you come over for the olympics and during the olympics Hitler did not do anything to the Jews. They even had still a Jewish tennis club, where my friends belongs. It was interesting, and I saw Jesse Owens, flying by, flying, not just running, you know, he won, and he gave the dirtiest look up to Gerring, to show that me, the black man, I'm going to win, and he sure did.
So, that was my last time over there, but then I started to travel and I was going to England, to Italy, I'm a Montessori teacher and I learned from Mother Montessori herself in 1937, before she died in Rome, so I was a whole year in Rome, which was absolutely wonderful.
Then I went to England and I lived there for a year. Then I went back to Switzerland because I have a big family, and I also wanted to learn French. I was a house -- how do you call them here, too? I was helping in the house with two children in the house, but they were wonderful with me. They became good friends and I lived in Geneva until 1942 when very dear friends of our said, "go home, nothing is going to happen in Hungary and you're the only child and be home." I went home.
Q. Were you hearing anything about what was going on in the rest of Europe even if it wasn't directed --?
A. Well, I tell you, I was not a zionist and I"m still not but there was a zionist congress in Geneva in 1939, in September and to relax most of the people were Polish and they were all out on the bach and one day on the ninth of September, the radio was blaring that Hitler moved into Poland and I will never forget, that was in my book too, you probably read it, it was horrifying to see the faces of these people and whether their family is still alive by the time they go home, whether they can go home at all. I was standing there and I said oh my God if I could just help. I never thought the time will come that I was going to help. I couldn't believe it that this can happen. None of us believed it.
When I came back to Hungary they still showed American films in 1942, and I was teaching English at that time. I spoke the King's English, really without an accent. Everybody thought I was a British lassie, and we were forbidden to talk English on the street, but we could say that we were foreigners. I was teaching Congressmen Lantosh's wife. She was nine years old and she looked like Shirley Temple and I was teaching her English. Then suddenly from Romania, from Czechoslovakia, from Poland people escaped to Hungary and they told us all these stories. We didn't believe either that it was possible.
It's funny that you don't believe. Why don't you believe? We should have and we could have all stood up for it, but we just couldn't imagine. So, our house was really full constantly with Rumanians or Czechoslovakians who somehow we knew from the old times. They came to our house, those who very few of them could go on somewhere else, but most of them got stuck in Hungary.
Q. What were they telling you that you couldn't believe? What were some of the things that you couldn't believe?
A. That they just walked in and took their house away. They killed some of their families and that they had no rights anymore. There were no people anymore and they had to wear the yellow star, what they took off as they came to Hungary. But it was unbelievable that anybody can come to your house and say get out. Something you worked all your life for. In America, too, I think nobody ever believed that Hitler was doing things like that.
Q. Did you talk to your parents about it?
A. Not really. No, we didn't. We didn't have the stars yet, because the Hungarian Nazis weren't yet there, and they came in '43 and then my father was taken to a labor camp and we were frantic but one of his Christian friends went and brought him right back.
Q. Tell me about that? What happened?
A. We don't know. He just walked in and said "You can't take this man. He's helping everybody in Budapest and I am so and so," and they gave him Papa back, and he came home. But he never went out on the street again. He was scared.
Q. When was he taken?
A. In '43, right when the Hungarian Nazis arrived. Their name was the Arrowcross, but he stayed home and we still been in the same house. We had the apartment where we lived and we knew every neighbor. Life sort of went on, except that as I said we had these foreign people living with us and then two Frenchmen arrived, who only after the war we found out that they were French underground. Through some friends they found us and so they stayed with us.
Q. Let me go back and ask you just a little about your dad again. Were you at home when he was taken away?
A. Yes.
Q. Tell me about what happened?
A. Well, they just said you have to come to a labor camp. Papa looked at us with tears in his eyes. We couldn't do anything. What can you do? Shoot the man? Then we would have been shot ourselves. Immediately I picked up the phone and called his friends and he brought him home almost the next day. It was lucky. Oh, the Hungarians were even worse than the Germans.
We didn't have too much money, because if you have, in Hungary, you could pay the police, you could pay them off in many ways. Raoul did that many times. He came with liquor and champagne and money and just paid them off. That's how they helped him.
It was rotten. I worked, at that time I worked in the famous Ritz Hotel where Hilton learned there how to run the hotel. I remember the morning, that was March 1944 already, when a very excited neighbor came to us -- I think you read that in my book, maybe I shouldn't repeat it. He said that he just heard by the BBC, we were not allowed to listen to the BBC but of course everybody did, and I had a big short wave radio, so that's how we knew what was happening in the world because I listened to that radio. That Admiral is coming on the air and he's going to tell the world that he's not with the Germans anymore, he's now with the Allies.
My father ran for the champagne and the glasses and I said, Papa don't believe what you hear. Oh, you're too young. You don't know this. Okay, he pours it in, ____________ comes on the air and he went as far as saying and now we happily tell you that we are now with the Allies. In that moment, a German _____________ comes on the air. His voice is cut off. I drop my champagne glass and suddenly we hear airplanes, and I was sure it was the Americans and the British. I run out. I dropped my drink, and I ran all the way -- it was a gorgeous sunny day, and I looked up and all these black things. I said here the Americans and the British are coming, so I was running all the way to the hotel, and as I walk in the porter says, the manager wants to see you, who was a darling man. He was a Yugoslavian, quite an old gentleman. He spoke 12 languages, perfectly, no accents.
I ran into him and he took me in his arms and he said in English, "Child, these are not the British and not the Americans. These are Germans. I want you to go home. I don't want you to be taken from here." He wished me all the good luck and we kissed and I went.
I made it home, and then we were waiting and we thought what the people told is probably true and maybe tomorrow we have to be out of here. We got the star and we didn't go out very much, because it was frightening.
Q. What was it that made it frightening? Were you hearing about people --?
A. What we heard from the other people. The Rumanians and all, so we knew that at any moment we will be picked up and taken too. But somehow, I don't know why, I can't answer you that because it was a miracle that we were not taken.
Q. If you couldn't get outside, how did you get food?
A. Well, we still had a wonderful maid who was Christian and she wouldn't leave us. She lived not there, but she went shopping. She did everything and she did come all the time. I did dare to go out, you know, because I was always a little _______ kid. I said nobody can tell me what to do, and I go. But not as much then after I met Raoul, then I became much much stronger and I wish that the whole world would understand too that the Jews too shouldn't have just gone up to the people but they should have stood up and fighted, but they didn't.
So, well, we waited and waited.
Q. You met Raoul Wallenberg very soon after you arrived in Budapest, it seems?
A. Yes, if you remember in my book, I was the guest of the Swedish government for three weeks so I knew Pat Unger. He was minister. I was guest up there and I felt very guilty because I left my parents down in the apartment, but they promised they would look after my parents and they will help them, so they keep an eye on them. After three weeks my friend, who took me up there, who was also a Christian and he was in love with my cousin and he said, she has to go home. The parents had to be moved out of the house, so they took them out, because the Hungarians thought if every second house in Budapest is going to be a house with a _____________ then the Americans won't bomb the city. How stupid.
Just as many Jews died as Christians because they didn't see number one, the _____________ on the house, but my parents had to move out but thank God my grandmother's house became a house with a __________ and they moved in there. There was no elevator in the house or anything so there was my mother, my father, my aunt, my cousin, the very best friend with her Christian boyfriend at that time. What was funny he wouldn't move away either. There they were. It wasn't comfortable. It wasn't good. Grandma wasn't, thank God, not alive anymore.
So, Mr. Dan Olsen said she can't go, we are responsible for her, and Is aid I already feel guilty that I had these three weeks of heaven, but my parents can be killed because the Hungarian Nazis came every day with the list of people and they were reading. My name was still on, and Mike, the friend of my cousin said that if she's dead, maybe they'll kill the whole family because they can't find her.
So, I went home with these diplomats because he wanted to see which house I am in and he put down the number and he said every time we were allowed one hour a day to go out to do our shopping and he said when you go out the telephone still works, please call. And I called almost every day and after three weeks suddenly they said come up at once, something happened, and there was Raoul Wallenberg.
Because I ha been there and lived there naturally I was his first helper.
Q. Let me ask you, too, when you would go out to go shopping was there enough to eat, and if you were in the house all the time, what did you do to keep busy?
A. You know what we did, listen to beautiful recordings of Gilli. That was, as you probably remember in the book, too, that there was this wonderful song "Mama" that I still sing many times. I was crying, because after all I left my parents for three weeks by themselves, which was very selfish I think, but I was young and I wanted to live. I think it's sort of a natural thing.
But now we were together and we always listened to this, and then the short wave radio said that Gilli is dead. When I came to Rome I walked into a place because outside it said Gilli is going to play and I walked in and I said Gilli is dead. He said No, no, he was not dead.
Q. Who is Gilli?
A. Gilli was one of the most famous opera singers of Italy.
Q. So, you would listen to music?
A. That's all, and reading and writing because I was always a writer.
Q. And your parents, what would they do?
A. Nothing. Just sitting, nothing. What could they do? Talking to eachother, listening to the BBC. There was nothing we could do. Nobody could do anything, and that was the horrifying thing too. Trying to strengthen each other, that was about all we could do.
So, after I met Raoul and Raoul and Pat Unger looked at me and he said here is a piece of paper -- you read that too, I think, so I shouldn't repeat this.
Q. Let me ask you, sort of on a daily basis, what was your work like? What did you do when you were working with Wallenberg? Not the specific things like the rescue in the river, but on a more day to day basis?
A. Well, it was sort of hostessing because there were thousands of people outside who came with their pictures so that we can put it on the passes. Did you see the passes because I have the real ones here and my passport too. The real ones, not fakes.
That's what I did. I talked to the people, and that too is probably exactly what you want. One afternoon, you now, if you ever worked for a foreign diplomatic place, you know that three o'clock in the afternoon they close, never mind the war or not, and at three o'clock there is this banging on this door outside. I opened it and there is a gentleman standing with four pictures. He said, please just give us four more passes and I said sorry sir, but the minister is leaving. Oh, please, please, please. I said, okay, I'll talk to him, give me the pictures. I walked in and I said, "Minister Dan Olsen,--" they realized that Raoul never, never signed not one. It was his idea, but it's only Dan Olsen who signed them.
I went in and he said I have a date at 3:30 and I said, "Sir, four more people's lives" He said okay okay and he signed these papers. And I gave it back to these gentlemen and he thanked me very much and 50 years pass and who thinks of the war. I had a Hungarian doctor here. I had tonsillectomy and he was up at Riverside. He had a beautiful townhouse there and his living room was his waiting room. One day I'm sitting there waiting and reading a paper and down the steps comes an elderly gentleman and starts screaming. You saved my life, you saved my life. I didn't think he talks to me and I looked around what is this man talking. Suddenly he's down on his knees kissing my hands and right away I said politely I said uncle. In Hungarian I said what are you doing? He said don't you remember, four people, I gave you the pictures, and this was the man and this was his brother in law. It's a small world. It was very embarrassing also because everybody looked at me. That's what happened and somehow he survived with those passes. But if I don't talk to Dan Olsen, just these four more, all four of them survived.
So, that was a nice feeling. Raoul only had one meeting like that. I don't know if you heard about it because everybody said he was just taken, but that's not true. After a week he came back and the only one who saw him was the Swedish Red Cross head, who was a lovely gentleman. Raoul said look behind me, there are two Russian officers on the motor bike and I'm invited to go back to ___________, but I don't know if I'm going as a visitor but I want to give you all the money that I have so that you can help the people that we already helped. I keep $1,000 and I tell you that because when they were finally allowed to go in there five years ago when Gorbachev allowed the sister and the brother to come, they found this $1,000 and they gave it back. They never took it from him.
But in any case he said to Langlett, but I have to tell you a wonderful story. As we come in the car I see a little old lady still wearing a star and she was carrying a basket with bread and I stopped the car and I went out and I said you speak some German and she said yes. Almost all Hungarians did. He said I just want to tell you I'm so terribly happy to see you alive. My name is Raoul Wallenberg, and the old lady pulls out the passes and says, I know Mr. Wallenberg and thank you. So, at least he had one whom he knew that he did save. And Herr Unger had the same thing happening. He was already a consul in Vienna in 1956 and the only ones who escaped then through the Danube were Jews and the big Nazis who were not caught before. So, he decided he will do the same as Raoul. He goes down with lights and food and dry clothes and he goes down to the river side and suddenly a boat comes in and a lady comes off and she runs to him. She said Mr. Unger you saved me from the Nazis, now you're saving me from the Soviets. So, he also had -- because we don't remember these people, but the remember us because we were so few. It was a wonderful feeling, but it's also an embarrassing feeling. I don't know why, it's a funny feeling, but it's wonderful and I wish Raoul would know every one of these people.
Q. That he saved Jews?
A. They don't even call us. Years we advertised in every newspaper that any one who was saved or worked with him, please call. Nobody does.
Q. Why do you think that is?
A. People don't like to remember. But still I think they should, I mean after all this man saved 100,000 human lives. Not just Jews, because especially Budapest was very much intermarriages. He never asked that if you're the Christian I won't save you, and those people wanted to stay together so he saved everybody. 100,000 human lives, most of them of course were Jewish. I remember when we had our very first benefit concert. Did you ever hear the name of Andros Shiv? Well, Andros is our best friend. He's also there. My little Andros. I called up a friend of mine, he's now dead, who was the head of the Hungarian Jewish Congress. Three quarters of those people, doctors and lawyers were all saved by Raoul and I said we have this concert and the tickets are $18. That's not much and he says what is there of Israel in it? I said Tibor, nothing, this is to save Raoul. We need money to get him out somehow. Not one bought a ticket. We were very disappointed. The only two Hungarians who came was my mother's two Christian friends' sons with their two Jewish girlfriends. Would you believe that?
If I would have said the tickets were $150 and they said no, but $18 and all lawyers, doctors, pharmacists, all saved by Raoul. I never get a penny for my committee from them, never. I don't know why people are like. Are people forgetting so fast, or they don't want to think of it, but it's better that he's still 50 years in the _____________ and nobody ever thought to help him. It was a horrifying thing. This was a 32 year old young man who absolutely had no business to do what he did. But he had a heart, and his idea was the young people, like you, like me -- I was only in my 20s then, that we will make peace in the world. But we don't.
Q. How old were you when you were working with him and how long did you work?
A. I think 24 I must have been. I was born in '18 and that was 1944. So what is that?
Q. Twenty-six. How long were you working with him at the embassy?
A. Five months. The whole thing was only six months, but after the Danube, I got pneumonia and I really never saw him and then all the bridges were down and I only spoke on the telephone.
Q. Did it seem much longer? Did the five months seem that it went on for a long time?
A. No, because it went so terribly fast. Don't forget that we were constantly moving. Raoul never slept in the same place for two nights, and constantly moving and moving the office and moving everything and then go back to the embassy. So, the time went very fast because we didn't have time to count days or whatever. I think it went very fast, but of course not fast enough because thousands and thousands of people died.
So mainly I was a hostess and you know this was an enormous work because we had thousands and thousands of people coming. One of us had to put the picture on and then we had to run it to the person who gave it to us to sign and then it's coming back to our ambassador and everything was running around. I was what they call it here the gopher. Actually, that's what I was but they needed a gopher, go here and go there and do this and do that. That was my job. But it was wonderful to see how we could save people. Like you probably read that last little portion there when we were at the __________ mountain and because the radio said that all women between the ages of 15 and 25 have to go to such and such a sports palace and then clean up Hungary. We knew exactly that they're going to Aushwitz so Raoul turned to everybody and said you all must have young sisters and so forth. Go and get the pictures. We sat on the Buddha side that night and of course Dan Olsen was there and he signed every one of them and we had to deliver it by I believe 3:00 in the morning, and it was curfew. No one was allowed out on the street. It was a gorgeous night, very snowy and icy, but the moon was out and I thought why are they not bombing Budapest. This is a gorgeous night to do it. Raoul arrived around midnight and he asked how far are we because we have to go and he also said he wants to tell us something. We have new neighbors in the other house, the villa, and we all looked up and he said don't look up, it's just a German headquarters. He always made a joke out of it, and we didn't care. I was the first who was ready with 500, but there I have to tell you, I don't think I wrote that in the book. He walked in when I was hitting one of the boys there. I hit him so hard. He opened a big mouth right then and said I sold quite a few of these passes and I started to hit him on the head. I could have killed him.
Q. So, you were hitting him and Raoul --?
A. I told him because he sold the passes, and he said you didn't and he said yes I did. He said outrageous but he said Agnes don't hit him. I was so angry.
So, I was the first ready with about 500 on the pass side and I remember myself going out and all I could hear on the ice was my feet and I looked dup and I said what a gorgeous night. It was a curfew and we were not allowed, and I delivered every one of the passes including my two best girlfriends and other places where I rang the bell a friend of mine came out and said what are you doing out on the street. I said never mind, an angel sent you these papers. I hope you will live. When I got home it 4:00 or 3:00 and I sat down on the bed and Danny told me what I had done and I said to myself, oh my God, I could have been killed but then I felt like Raoul is hitting me and I said oh, of course not, the Germans and the Hungarians are cowards, they wouldn't dare to be out on the street.
I fell asleep and at 6:00 in the morning my two best girlfriends arrived. They were kicked out because of the paper.
Q. Kicked out of where?
A. From that sports palace because they had the pass.
Q. Once people got the pass how did that protect them?
A. Well, as I said, Raoul asked the Germans to put it out on the walls of Budapest,and this was made big and was hanging on the walls. On that morning when my girlfriends arrived six o'clock, they were like daughters to my father and papa was starting to cry he was so happy. He put on over his pajamas his overcoat and he said I'm going down to buy bread. A few minute after our super came up. We were back in the Christian house. It's a long story, I got them back, never mind if you have a passport or not you're coming home, back. I got the apartment back, thanks to Raoul. A little note I am at the police station, get me out. So, I called up immediately Raoul, but Raoul was on the way to the railway station on the Austrian border, but he said I'm going to send you two diplomats immediately. So, we went eight hours looking for papa and we couldn't find him.
The next morning they picked me up at six in the morning and finally we come to another sports palace, quite out of Budapest and I see my Swedish diplomat go in and say Hail Hitler, what else can they do and say something and they turn around and run. They said Father is home, do you have a phone. I said yes we do have a phone. I called home and papa was home. Now, he told us the story, and that just shows you how the Hungarians were so much worse.
Papa went down and one of these Nazis kids came up, the Hungarian, and he says, "Hey you bloody Jew, do you have any papers?" And papa pulled out the passes and said that's nothing. There it was hanging on the wall. Took him into the police station. A couple of minutes after, a German Nazi walked in and my father spoke to him in German and he says, look the Hungarian took me. He kicked him out. The other Hungarian brought him in. It happened four times. Finally the Hungarian won and walked my father and another, many many hundred -- it was raining and cold and he still had the pajama on, for about six hours they walked to that place. In the morning, Papa was standing there with the bread and the young man beside him and suddenly again a German officer walks in and my father saw them telling a joke to each other so he figured they are in good mood maybe I can hit them. So, he went up again and said in German, "Look what the Hungarian did to me." He says, out, and the young boy besides him also pulled out the pass and he was kicked out, and Papa quickly gave the bread to the old gentleman who stayed there.
So, how and why it saved some, not everyone, because what the Hungarian Nazis, not the German Nazis, of course it was on Eishman's order, they came in. We had the same houses. We had about 30 houses on the two sides of the Danube, and that too, Raoul didn't buy them. It was given by the aristocrats and by the Jews because they thought it was in better hands with the Swedes, then they would have taken it away. We put these people with the passes into these houses. It was not comfortable, but they had a Raoul who came out every day with medication, with -- he had to be there to see that his people are all right.
But the Hungarian Nazis came in through the basement and took the people out.
Q. You saw them?
A. Oh yes, but then we went to Raoul and Raoul get his help and many times he brought the people back and then we had a couple of wonderful young men already who became little Wallenbergs, and there were already a lot of Germans who died so we had uniforms and one day they took about 60 of these old people through the basement and the boys put on a Nazi uniform and went after them. They both spoke good German and they started to scream on that German. He said how dare you are taking these people. We have to take them to General so and so and this normal German soldier had no idea who the generals are. They faked the name, you know, and they said and besides that you have a fake identity and they took away their real identification paper from the Germans and they told these people turn around and march and then the one young man came up to one old gentleman and said we are the Wellenberg kids, we're taking you home. And they brought them all home.
Raoul went down to the Danube and many times brought people back home from there. So, it was a pure luck the ones who survived and the ones who didn't. It wasn't a security, it was just a better feeling because we also had a hospital, and we had an orphanage. In that hospital too, the doctors always said we don't know how Raoul do it, but when we say we need aspirins, then the next day we have aspirins. If we need blankets, the blankets were there. They were never in want of anything. He was amazing, and yet we didn't have any American or British Red Cross. We only had the Swedish and help we got from the Portuguese.
Q. You mentioned the orphanages? There were two orphanages?
A. Two, and one 79 kids were killed and in one of them this Dr. Goodkin was in. That was the second time she was saved. She had scarlet fever so Raoul had to give her some force papers and put her in a Christian hospital and that's why she survived. The other one was a little boy who was separated from his mother and thought she was dead, but the last words the mother said always hide if you can. When these boys came in and shot, he went under a chair. Of course they didn't look under the chair and the poor little kid came out all dazed and walks out on the street and the first person he meets is his mother who was saved by Raoul in one of the safe houses.
Q. Were you there after that massacre in that orphanage?
A. No.
Q. But you heard about it?
A. Oh, we all heard about it. I met Raoul then and he went down on his feet and he cried. I never saw him crying but for him, to kill children, innocent children, and there was no reason, it was just fun.
Like the hospital, that story I don't think that is in my book. I was delivering that to the gopher, delivering medication and mail to the hospital, but by that time we had people who were hurt on the street who had nothing to do and nobody but we put them in the hospital, they needed help immediately and Raoul suddenly came. It was a very snowy day. Now, you have to know that he as magnificent mind for learning names. I forget in five minutes but he never forgot anybody's name and never made a mistake. He wouldn't call me Elizabeth and the other one Agnes. He would never make a mistake in names. Nothing, he was a magnificent person, what comes once in a life time. So, he learned all the Hungarian officer's name and where they run their offices around Budapest. That was very important for him. And he knew exactly who was where. So, anyhow he arrives a little bit after 12:00 noon, unshaven and evidently hungry too, and he sees all the doctors and me and the patients with their hands up and three little punks, 14, 13 and twelve with a gun. Of course we had the Swedish flag hanging outside on every one of these houses. Raoul, and I never saw that before him doing, he hit these three kids, and they dropped their guns and he kicked them and he said half Hungarian, half German, "Get out of here and bring me your officer. How dare you to come into a Swedish territory." The kids got so frightened they went. Three minutes after a Hungarian officer walks in and Raoul looks at his watches, "Simon, what took you three minutes to get here." The man looks and says, "how do you know my name?" And Raoul says, I know everybody's name and I am very angry that you dare to send the Swedish territory three little punks to frighten all the people here and the sick people. I said now you better go out and help me because I asked for medication and I haven't gotten it yet because you need big help. You killed a German high officer and Simon looks at him and says I never killed anyone, and he said oh yes you did because he died here in our hospital, but before he died, he sent you name up to the headquarters. Simon left, and the doctor -- he found his voice first, and he said, "Raoul, what did you just do?" And Raoul was hysterically laughing. That was him. He said, well, how did you know his name? He said I only knew that office next door, that the head officer was Simon and we were lucky it was Simon and he said all right I understand it, but I never had a German officer who died here, and he says of course not, but he killed so many people one of them could have been a German officer. You see, that was his mind. He had to trick himself. He could have been in trouble but that was the only way to save people. So, he saved the whole hospital.
Q. You were there when those German --?
A. That happened, yes, I was there.
Q. You must have been terribly frightened?
A. We never even knew anymore what is to be frightened, because there were only two choices, either you get killed or you live. I don't even think we were frightened. The only thing we all were frightened and I know that Raoul was the only thing he was frightened, was the bombing, because there you could do nothing. You didn't know where, and I do remember when the sirens were still working and the bomb comes and his car was already by Eishmen, and the other one was stolen, he got on a bicycle and he went to see if the children in the orphanage are all right. He would pick up the children who were crying and start making animal noises and tell them stories to get them out of frightening. That kind of a person we don't find today.
Q. What about your parents, though, weren't they terribly worried about you?
A. Yes, they were constantly worried but also they understood by that time that if you don't do that then all of us will be dead, my parents included. I remember when I finally got all these papers and my working papers from Raoul and they handed me these passes for the parents and also Raoul they gave me a paper there was a house commission. Because what happened in Hungary as soon as you got out of your Christian house, then you made usually the supers daughter took over the apartment and the fur coats and everything.
So, there was a housing commission and Raoul gave me the paper and said go and get your apartment back, and by that time we were so -- I was Raoul Wallenberg and I was strong and I believed that I can do anything. It's funny. It's very hard to explain this because I was an only child and I was always lots of friends but I didn't think I had the strength to do things like that, but who will think. We are not heroes. Raoul would always say I was not a hero to someone stupid he said nobody is born a hero. A hero comes at the moment, the spur of the moment. You don't do these things. I remember I put on my best suit, I thought to myself, what the hell can happen to me and my nose up and there sits this horrible guy, Hungarian Arrowcross and I threw him that paper. I figured either he kills me or I live. He gave me the dirties look, so Raoul must have given them a fortune I'm sure they paid and with this dirty look he gave me the paper back with an okay. So, I walked out on the street and I said "God, why, how come I'm not killed?" I couldn't believe it.
So, I walked to my old home and the super's wife she started to cry, Aggi you're alive, you're alive, and I said yes of course and now I want to have my apartment back. Whereby he says to me, he says my daughter already has that apartment. She says our daughter already has another apartment. I don't know what he had done to her after that, so he said yes, but I have nothing to do with it. You will have to go to the house's lawyers.
So, again I picked myself up and I walked to this lawyer and I told him I want this back. He said well I will give it back to you under one condition and I stood like the Americans with my hands back, like I think Raoul did all the time, I said what is your condition. He says when the Soviets are coming in, you will tell them how much I help people. I said sure I'll tell them. I even forgot his name by the time I went out, but he gave me the papers and I walked back to the super, and he was quite shocked and I didn't know that he speaks Russian and he was living on my father for all those years, my father kept them. He sent the kid to school, I mean it was us who did everything. That's why the wife was so happy, but he was an s.o.b. and he came up with me to the apartment. The apartment was empty and I thought to myself oh my God, they have stolen everything, but we had the maids room and we opened the maids room and everything was in there, even the paintings. So, at the moment, I thought well maybe he isn't that bad until I heard him saying, "I get even with you yet." But he had no choice. He gave me the apartment. Raoul helped me to get our phone back and then I run to the Jewish house and I said to my parents, "Out" But Papa said we are not so and so, I said I don't care. You're coming home. This is our home and you're coming home. And I came home.
Q. Did you tell you parents what you'd been doing?
A. Oh yes, they knew, but a couple of things I didn't tell them. When December came I didn't tell them about my jumping in the Danube. But I got in the morning -- but that was the first time I almost died because there was no doctor available. I was sick and we didn't know it was nerves. Naturally you get a little down, so the super said he has a doctor and the doctor came and I have never seen -- I don't remember either, a needle that big. That's for animals, you know. And he put sulfa in it and he gave me a sulfa injection. But all this -- he just said this is a sulfa injection and I went into a coma. So, this was one of his little jokes on me. He wanted me to die, so my mother was frantic and somehow we called a friend and she had found a Jewish doctor who was hiding, who later on thank God worked for Raoul in the hospital. He came out and he said to my mother, what happened and mommy said well, now I found out she was jumping in the Danube and she probably has pneumonia. But his man came and Mommy showed the needle and he said, my God, that's for animals and sulfa is no good.
So, he gave me something else and my friends found I don't know where, grapes so they brought me back to life somehow. But that was frightening because I didn't want to die yet. It was too early. But then I never saw Raoul again, because in the meantime they bombed everything out.
And the third time this s.o.b. what he did to me as by that time the Soviets were in and our apartment was bombed out and that's why you see these things here.
Q. What is that?
A. All our books -- that was a Russian bomb and the Russian bomb never went all the way down to the basement like the American and British. They only took the top and we were living on the fourth floor and the whole fourth floor went down with all my books. I had a wonderful library in Budapest too, and everything fell down with these pictures. And my father with his life went and he rescued all my books. That is the bombs whatever fell on it and made the scratches.
Q. How old are you in this picture?
A. Here I was seven. I think just seven. So, we didn't have that and then an uncle of mine lived in that house too so we all moved into one place. I gave my aunt and my uncle, my other aunt with her daughter and my parents and me and we slept on the floor. It didn't matter we had the apartment. So, that the old folks can have a little sleep in the afternoon, we went down to the basement where we used to be before when they were bombing.
Now, there was a fantastic general there who ran away from the Hungarians and the Nazis and the son committed suicide because he didn't want to work for the Nazis either, but they saved him and he and his wife and his mother-in-law and his son they all lived in the house and somehow I felt that -- this was new people there of course and we became great great friends and when they found out about them the Russians took them for 24 hour questioning and thank God they came back. The son fall in love with my young cousin. She was the only one who died from our family. She got polio after the war, so it wasn't because of the war.
So, in any case we were down in the basement and I was sitting against the wall and we were playing cards and I never knew how to play cards but there was nothing else to do while the old ones are sleeping. Suddenly a terribly drunk Russian soldier walked in and he started to say gold, gold ____________, and I turned around and I said we don't have gold but my super was there and whatever he answered I don't know. But again, how miracles happen. One card fell down and I just put my head down to pick it up when he shot and my two friends suddenly they didn't know whether I was shot or what but the thing went into the wall. I was down there to pick up the card. In one split second and it happened so fast that really my cousin and the boyfriend they couldn't figure out. They run out, I killed her, but Aggi came out so still my super couldn't get even with me because I did not get killed.
Then they called an officer and he reprimanded the drunken soldier but these things were more frightening than the Nazis. They were terrible, horrible.
Q. Let me take you back just a little bit before the Russians arrived, did you see -- you must have been seeing deportations in Budapest?
A. No, actually. That was only Raoul and the men who went to these stations and brought people back. But what we see was the killing in the Danube and how they carried people out but you couldn't do anything.
Q. How they carried them from the safe houses?
A. Of course, that's what I told you. And we were bombed enough. We should have been bombed by the Americans far more, and of course everything turned out much worse when finally they shot down one of the American bombers and he fell into the Danube and the Hungarian Nazis took him out and they hanged him right there. From then on it was for the Jews even worse.
Q. At one point you ended up leaving for Romania?
A. Yes, I wanted to leave anyway. As I said, there were no bridges, everything was down, so my very best friend whom I saved, she was saved by a wonderful Jewish friend of ours who she eventually married. That's how I found out he came over, but he looked very Christian and he had Christian papers.
Anyhow, he came over first and that was wonderful to see.
Q. When was that?
A. That was right after -- let's see the Russians were not quite in it. It was the end of December.
Q. 1944?
A. Yes. And then January 17, I believe it was on the 15th that the General who was with us in the house said Aggi come with me and look out the street and we went to the big door we had and the German guns were on the ground like this. The Germans went to Buddha. Have you ever been in Budapest? Well, they went to Buddha and they were still shooting over here and they were fighting all the time and that was terribly dangerous because a friend of mine told me that their little daughter they wanted to save and would I take her to the nuns and they were fighting on the streets and I said of course I take the child. I picked up the child and they were shooting on the street. So,she was frightening and I was telling her stories and you had to get your head down because they were shooting. Somehow we managed we went to the nuns and I gave the little girl to the nuns. The next day the parents went and got her back. They couldn't be without her, but it was a dangerous time and we had very little water and I wanted my father to be able to shave and make some tea so the next house had a courtyard. There are in Budapest, they have a courtyard and they have a well and as I told you they were shooting from both sides and I walk to get a pail of water for Papa and an old gentleman comes down from a house and says you're picking up water too, and I said yes and you couldn't see these bullets, only you got hear it. Suddenly I hear and the old gentleman falls dead beside me and I hear the wife screaming up there. I have no idea if he was dead or what happened after because I got terribly frightened but I ran and got the water and ran home and I said an old gentleman but I didn't. Why I didn't you can't answer these things. The bullet could have hit anyone.
We had a wonderful lawyer friend who was in Auschwitz for I don't know how long and he came home. Somehow he escaped Auschwitz or Birkenau, I don't know where he was, and he found his parent's apartment without windows of course and he just sat down suddenly to thank God that he's home and this bullet from the other side came in and killed him right there.
So, I think you have to fight for yourself, but then there is nothing you can do. If it's written to you that you live, then you live, and if it was written to you that you die, then you die. But we try to live and try to help others but it's not easy.
So, in any case, in January there was still the fighting and sort of the fighting stopped and the Germans were still on the Buddha side when suddenly Raoul, one of the lawyers who was a Czechoslovakian he came over and he came to us because he knew where I lived and he said to me I still blame that he never told me that Raoul wasn't with him. He just said that the Swedish ligation has been taken by the Russians and they are in ______________. I said oh my God.
Q. So, these were the people that you had been working with?
A. That's right, Herr Unger, Dan Olsen, Raoul and so forth and he said did you know that Romania is free. I said no I didn't. And he said that is the only ligation in the whole of Europe there. We have a Swedish ligation and the Rumanians are allowed to repatriate. I think you read that in the book and you have to go there and tell ___________ that they are in ________________ and he should bring them out.
Q. Now why did he come to you?
A. Why? Because I was the gopher and I don't even know. Maybe I as the only one unmarried. That's possible too, I don't know why. I was there, because they knew I already had a Swedish passport and I was single and I was a guest of the Swedish government for three weeks. I guess that's why. I don't know why. So my parents of course, no she can't go. She can't be killed. And I turned to my parents and I said Mommy and Daddy I know that but they saved us, how we not. I said by the way how do I get there. He said Rumanians are allowed to repatriate. I said well how do I repatriate. He said I'll get you the false papers, just promise me that you'll carry no Hungarian papers with you and the Swedish ones put in your behind.
End of Tape 1
Tape 2
Q. So you were telling me about getting ready to go --?
A. So anyhow my parents were beside themselves and I was also told that it's a very dangerous trip because we don't know how long it takes and in any moment the Russians can pick us up. I didn't tell that to my parents but they told it to me and they can take me to Siberia or they can bring me back home. But if I can do it, please get to Bucharest because the people have to get out.
Finally the day came and I had knapsack and little food, what Mommy made.
Q. What month are we in now?
A. We are in February because we were completely occupied by February 10, that's when the Russians and I was already March 1 in Bucharest. So, sure enough on the train nobody talked to each other because we didn't dare. Nobody knew who speaks what language and we were first in a real train sort of. And we went and at one point the evening they said so we can't go anymore we have to sleep over. So, you know you're young and tired you can sleep anywhere. We went to a school and on the floor each of us slept. In the morning they woke us up that we have a new train and there it was, the same cattle train what the Jews were taken to Auschwitz. The very sweet Hungarian soldier told us all that when we go to the Rumanian border please don't get under the hay. There was lots of hay in there. He says don't sneeze, don't cough, because the Russians are coming in and they go with a light and if they find you we don't know what happens and they are always drunk.
So, you can imagine how we survived two and a half days already and here we are all on here and we hear these drunken Russians singing at the top of their head and they open the doors and thank God nobody coughed and they went around with a light and they couldn't find anything, banged the door and the train was moving and we were in Rumania.
We arrived there in the night and I had a friend who was at the music academy and she lived with us and she was from Rumania and I knew hopefully they are alive. This is a small time, Arid, have you ever been there?
It's a small town and there was another friend of mine who was a baroness, a real baroness, but she was half Jewish of course, and I didn't know whether she was alive but I had her address because we met in Budapest, we learned cooking in the gas company. She became the big philanthropist and a miserable cook and I became the good cook, but we became friends, Miraka.
So, I thought I have these two friends, let's see what's happening and there is this dark station and you are in a town you don't speak the language. Suddenly a young man came up to me and my stomach went like this right away, he said are you alone and I said me too. Where are you going? I said who are you? He said he was a Hungarian concert pianist and he escaping. So I said walk with me and let's see if my friends are up or alive. So, it must have been around 11:00 at night we come to this house and there is a huge grand piano out in the yard. I said look it's made for you. They have the grand piano there, and I ring the bell and my friend opened it and she screamed. I mean it's not funny that I am alive and they brought out every food they had in the house and I shouldn't have eaten, we all swell up after because we had nothing to eat. We had all our injections thank God from typhoid to whatever, they gave us in Budapest, so it wasn't so dangerous.
The next day she says we have to go to the health department so they gave us this hot bath and all that and we had the papers that we got all the shots. Then I said I'm going to find my other friend. The funny part was we came away and this was the first time I had high heel shoes on and I didn't know how to walk, because for years we had only boots on. Now, suddenly I put high heel shoes on and I can't walk and I'm not a sweet eater, but I went into every store there to eat something that was sweet. You know your body needed all this. It was wonderful to see my friends again.
So, I found the house and I rang the bell and there was my girlfriend and she was screaming too like crazy that I'm alive. I said how about your family. Well, the brothers were taken away but somehow they came back and they were not killed. They are all on the way hopefully they can get to America eventually and what am I doing. So, I said I have to go to Bucharest. She said nobody can go Bucharest. Only officials, why do you want to go there? I said Marika, even for you I cannot tell. She got me the papers.
So I said I am without money and I just met a concert pianist, could we do something and she said of course we could do something. I have a big room here and people are so hungry for music and at that time the boy played beautifully and we gave a concert and we made good money. We halved the money. Half for him and half for me so I could buy myself a pair of stockings or something because we had nothing, and I think we had three or four other concerts and I don't know why suddenly I felt so bad about this man. I said I'm leaving for Bucharest and he said are you going to still be my manager. I said no, it's finished. You got your money now you do it yourself. He was so upset.
But I just somehow felt that's enough. I am not a music manager. We got our money and that was wonderful. So, Marika got me the papers and that you read in my book too, I don't have to tell you.
Q. You can tell me.
A. Anyhow, I go into this one place and there is two Russian officers sitting and I felt awful and frightened and the one said are you Rumanian and I said yes, of course I knew that I don't speak Rumanian and I said I'm just coming home. We talked a long time and they gave me a drink and I tried not to drink it. I was scared stiff, so finally we came to ___________ and they both got off and I got off too. When I came back they weren't there, but the coats were still there, and I said strange. Suddenly they came back and they looked around and quickly closed the door and sat down. I said this is strange. So, the one turned to me in German and he said can you speak German. I said, a little. He said, I am Jewish and we are trying to escape from the Russians. They were Russian officers. The one was Christian from Kiev and he was a Jew and they were friends for many years. He was from Odessa and he was Kiev. So, they told me their whole story that eventually they wanted to get to Israel.
Then I told them the truth too, that I'm not Rumanian. They were the ones who helped me to get a room first and they said if you need us call the Jewish so and so.
So, it was interesting because we ended up on the end they helped my parents. They went back to Hungary and then they helped my parents to get to Czechoslovakia and from there out. But what happened to the two men, I have no idea. The Christian wrote a fantastic book how bad in Russia the communists are and what's happening there, and they asked me if I would take it to Europe and sell it. We were told if we leave Rumania that the Russians will make a big look and I didn't dare to take the book. Now, I'm sorry because I didn't do anything. I could have taken the book, but I didn't.
So, it was interesting, so I got there --
Q. You are where now?
A. In Bucharest.
Q. And it's what month?
A. March 1 or March 2 and I was quite sick too and I needed a doctor's appointment and all that and I was very skinny and Marika came and I had to go to the Swedish embassy. So, whom can I ask a taxi driver. And the taxi driver spoke some German and some English and he told me that he was -- why do I go to the Swedish embassy, it's so dangerous. I said why is that dangerous. He said because it's right besides the Russian headquarters. No wonder that the poor ambassador was like this. He was an elderly man, that ambassador, a wonderful man. I walked in and I didn't want to tell the secretary why I was there, and she says, why are you coming. I said I can't tell you, I want to speak to the ambassador. So, she wouldn't let me in. About three o'clock in the afternoon finally she got tired of me and says all right before he goes now you can go in. I walked in and told him who I am. That poor ambassador, he screamed why didn't you come in before and he goes to the machine and they're looking -- I got a list from this lawyer of the other seven Swedes who were there and they had to be helped.
Q. From the ligation you mean?
A. From the ligation, yes, because those people who got the passports but there was only a few left. I was the eighth Swede so we were eight Swedes. One was a real Swede, two were married to Swedes, two little girls parents, they were Hungarian but they lived in there and me and who else was, oh, yes, one German woman who was married to a Swede, but she was a widow.
So, I had that list that they are all okay, and that they are the ones already at the ____________. And then he said your fiance is looking for you, are you Aggi? Yes, so it was wonderful so right away he said I'm going to give you money so you have something but when you're walking on the street, please never open your mouth. You don't speak Rumanian, you don't speak Hungarian, try not to speak German. All you speak is Swedish. I couldn't not a word of Swedish. That's in my book too, you know, because that's what saved my life.
Q. Why did he not --?
A. Because he knew how dangerous it is because if they have any suspicion of me they can take me to Siberia, back to Hungary. That was a much more dangerous time I think than it was there and I became a freelance writer. I wrote for the newspapers. I needed food and that and one lady told me that I can go down to the river and get frogs and she taught me how to make frogs and I had frogs every night because that was cheap. I had a very nice room, by a very lovely lady and she taught me how to eat frogs. And my Marika came up every Friday from Arid to Bucharest. There was a wonderful hotel, it's still there. The Hotel Palace, and they have, like we have the icecream parlors there, they had caviar parlors and you could chose your caviar and they had everything from beluga to so and so. Then you went down to the basement and they brought you your caviar and the toast and the champagne and Marika did that every week because she knew all week I don't eat, just the frogs. So, she treated me every week and then one day it was tremendous because I went in to buy a soap in the store of the hotel and suddenly I hear a French accent, a man talking and I turned around and we screamed. That was the one underground French boy who was always in my house and I didn't know what happened and he was alive and he told me he's on the way home and that is friend already went.
So, here he was invited by Marika and we had our caviar and champagne together.
Q. How did you catch these frogs?
A. Run into the water and just caught them. It was dreadful, but when you're hungry, what do you care. I was very sorry for the frogs but they were good. Since then I don't really like to eat frog legs or anything, but it was all right then. When you're hungry, you're hungry. That's it, it doesn't matter.
But then, you know I didn't speak any Swedish and the ambassador was quite right because I think one day I walked on the street and he said only carry your Swedish papers, nothing else. That's all I had was my Swedish paper and one I guess he was a Russian or a Rumanian and he started to talk to me and I smiled very nicely and couldn't answer. He tried every language and I just smiled. He tried Hungarian, I could have answered of course, German, English, but I just smiled so he took me into the police station and I scribbled down the phone number of the Swedish embassy. Poor _____________ came with the car and the driver and he walked in. All I spoke in Swedish at that time was thank you, bread, and one more word. I can't remember. But as he walked in I started to scream these same words over and over and I could see him relaxing sort of because he couldn't laugh. I went over and over and so they kicked me out and on the way to car he turns to me he said, how did you come up with this idea? And I looked at him and said, Mr. Ambassador, I'm a Wallenberg child. That's what saved my life, those five words in Swedish. Then he said you are never walk alone and you need more money.
Q. At this point did you think you'd be going back to Budapest?
A. No, never. But I could -- I was very lucky the Red Cross came around there, the Swiss Red Cross and one of my Swiss cousins had been a red cross driver so he delivered mail to my parents to Budapest, but it was very funny. Around the world it goes. So, the parents knew I was all right and I told them that they will be so. But the Swedish embassy in eight days, that's right, in eight days ____________ had them down there mine was Raoul Wallenberg. The twelve employees my was Raoul and then I asked Ambassador Unger how come Raoul isn't here, because I didn't know what happened to him and he said don't worry about Raoul, you know him. We'll get him. Well, we never got him.
And then we were supposed to leave all together, the eight Swedes and the twelve embassy people and ______________ was the big oil place and the railway station is at _____________ and the trains via Russia were where we had to go. And we were all there with all our baggage and said goodbye to our new friends and first I put the embassy on all the people and suddenly the Russians said no for us. I remember Ambassador Dan Olsen looked and said Aggi, Aggi, don't worry. You'll get out. You will all get out. But it took us that was they left at the end of March and we left in June.
Q. So you were there for several more months?
A. Yes.
Q. Working?
A. Working, yes.
Q. What did you do?
A. First of all I got money from the Swedish embassy constantly and I did free lance writing. They asked me for articles and I sent it to Budapest and I don't know. I got very little money but it was money and I eat the frogs.
Q. What did you do with your time? Did you know people there?
A. By that time yes, we had quite a few friends. But there was nothing really, just the waiting time and how when you're young and maybe you too, you believe that 13 is a bad day and black cats are not bringing you luck and we were brought up with this idea and finally we got a phone call from the embassy that we will leave on a British military plane and the one thing I can't remember when the war was over in May we were still in Bucharest and I have no idea if we celebrated or what we did. Absolutely no recollection.
Q. Do you remember how you heard about the war being over?
A. No. Isn't that funny. This is the one thing I don't remember at all. I only remember that I had this beautiful room and I was sleeping because the next morning the embassy car was picking me up to go to the airport and I was sorry that I couldn't take my friends book. I was afraid they were going to not let me on with it or something. In the middle of the night I wake up that something is against my body and I look and it's a black cat. I screamed and the cat jumped out. I had a little terrace and she jumped all the way to the terrace and disappeared. I said oh my God, that's the end. We are not leaving again.
But it was not true. In the morning we were picked up. All eight of us wherever they were and we were taken to the airport and the Russians were quite polite and it turned out it was a South African military plane so there were really no seats, just where the ammunition used to be that's where we were sitting and what we didn't know, we were the eight of us and then there were two Frenchmen and one big fat gentleman whom we didn't know who he was but he spoke only English.
My one friend, the one who was German and was married to a Swede, she couldn't speak very well anything but German so the two of us sort of spoke German. Then we went out and the pilot told us where we are and how we go through the Adriatic what was absolutely fascinating and just the thought that we are going to freedom. That was something I couldn't believe. When we went to Barre, during the war Barre was the airport for the Allied forces and it was the most colorful thing you have ever seen and it was really a British military, American, Greek, whoever was with the Allied forces. It was very colorful and they invited us for sandwiches, the real English sandwiches, very wet, but when you're hungry, you're hungry. You don't mind and then they said we were supposed to go in a hotel because that's what the Swedes were paying for and we went into a big truck and we were driven and I said we are not going into the city. Oh Aggi, you're always thinking the wrong way, of course we're going in. Of course we didn't. We went in a transit camp number one, what was for suspicious people, but it turned out the funny part, the gentleman, the big fat one in the plane was a Scotland Yard man and when the two of us spoke German because the old lady couldn't speak anything else, he was sure that we were two Nazis running away making ourselves out that we are Swedes. But this we didn't know, and we had one young man with us whose father was a very famous parliamentarian in Budapest and I didn't know that he worked for the Scotland Yard and he didn't know nothing much about me either. But in any case we were all there and so we went in and they put us in this camp. The only nice thing in this camp was that there were German war prisoners and other British were walking outside. This was a place where they put the people before they took them to Auschwitz. Now it's the other hand.
But they separated us from all the other people and for a little while the first day that we went in there the British went with his gun all around and I saw a big hole and I wanted to get out. The little Britisher with his wonderful cockney English said to me I'll shoot you if you come out. So, I pulled my foot back and I was hysterically laughing and I thought to myself how funny. I wasn't killed by the Nazis. I wasn't killed by the Soviets, now I'm going to be killed by my own Allies. So, I said I want to speak to your officers, but no they were playing what the English play all the time, but I was mad but I pulled my foot back. I thought it's not worth getting killed right here.
Then we got food and nobody eat but me. I was crazy and then we were interrogated the next morning and that was very funny because they started to ask me questions about this man who was with us and I said I know nothing about him just that he's Hungarian, very famous minister's son and that he's married to a Swede. So they were very pleased that I didn't know that he was a Scotland Yard man.
Then he was questioned about me but with me what I did I was very funny. Suddenly one of the Scotland Yard men says to me in 1938 when you left England you never told the police that you left. And I looked at him and I said may I ask you why you interrogate me if you know everything more than I do that I've done. You know everything about me why are you asking questions. So, we became very good friends. So, they helped us then, my friend who's a Scotland Yard man and he and me were the only ones who spoke English. They picked us up many times and we went into town because finally we could take a bath at the American headquarters and they ask us how the British are handling us and we said not very good. They were constant fight who was giving more, the Americans brought us field beds and we could sleep outside, so the British gave us the blankets. Then the Americans brought us food extra so we became very good friends, all of them.
Then we had to get out and I said well you have to wait, we have to find out the truth about all of you whether it's so finally it took them three weeks before they found out, almost four, here they found out all the truth about all of us.
Q. I want to take you back to Bucharest for one second before we go on. In your book I think you mentioned a friend of yours who was attacked by a Russian soldier. Do you remember what happened there?
A. Yes. She was attacked and she got syphilis and I gave away my fur coat and everything so that she could be healed and she got healed.
Q. What happened?
A. I don't know what happened after.
Q. Did she tell you about the attack itself?
A. Yes.
Q. Will you tell us?
A. It was very frightening. It was more frightening that fighting the Hungarian Nazis and the Germans. It's funny.
Q. Why was that?
A. Because these are all so terribly uneducated people. You see, when the Russian soldier came all the way from Siberia and it was winter time, they came without shoes and they never saw a bathroom in their life. They made their business in the bathtub and washed their face in the toilet and they went to bed with everyone. They had to put us under the heavy beds so they don't find us, because they attacked everybody, except children. They loved children. So, it was very dangerous.
And the officers that came in in American jeeps and wore American boots and whatnot but the soldiers were so that they never saw a watch. They stole everybody's watch and some of them had watches from here to here and they come to you and say _________________. They loved it like kids. They never saw a watch. Soap, they don't know what soap was. All they knew was drinking, so they were more dangerous because there was no way to talk. And many -- do you know how many thousands of people we still don't know what happened. They just picked them up on the street and took them to Siberia, so that at least by the Germans and the Nazis you know it's only the Jews they pick up but now anybody. And they didn't do a thing they just walked, maybe they went down to shop and they disappeared. Nobody knew what happened.
Q. Did that happen to friends of yours, people you knew?
A. Yes, one man and I still don't know what happened to him.
Q. From Bucharest?
A. No, that was in Budapest. But it was nice to get out of Bucharest too, because only the Russians had the big word there and there were British and French there, but they were the only ones. It was a dangerous time, but a game. It was luck. Not everybody was lucky and also something else was terrible. We met a lot of people that were in Auschwitz and they hated me and the other ones too that we probably worked with the Germans and that's why we are alive and that's why we have never been in Auschwitz. It was a terrible thing to be hated from your own people and it's no use. We tried to explain that we worked with this wonderful man -- I worked at least -- and it's just the luck that I am alive, but they didn't believe. It was terrible. And you really couldn't do anything. I didn't have money to give them or nothing.
Q. So these were survivors that had been sent back?
A. Yes. Some of them escaped, some of them sent back, some of them survived, let's say that, and they came back to their own country.
Q. Did they tell you about what had happened to them?
A. No, nobody liked to talk. Only later on in Sweden then I found out. So, you see but then we were still nowhere and my letters still went to my parents so they knew that we were in jail sort of but we had a wonderful time there. They wouldn't allow the other people there, they were so jealous of us because we were all alone in that outside with field beds.
Q. Who else was at this camp?
A. Well, there were lots of misplaced persons who were waiting to go back to their own country. It was very funny that the Scotland Yard man suddenly said to me I don't believe that you are a Jew. I said why don't you believe me and he said look outside and there was a gorgeous girl with dark hair like you, a big behind and she walked and her behind went back and forth and he said that's a Jewish girl. You don't walk like her. I said come on fellows, that doesn't mean a bloody thing how somebody walks. That doesn't make one a Jew or not a Jew. That was in their head.
So, there were Jews, Czechoslovakians and they were waiting to be released and it was a transit camp.
It was a lot of fun in Barre anyhow because we were allowed -- we stood at the road and put up our hands and usually a British or an American truck picked us up and took us into Barre. That was very nice. Finally we got the word that we are allowed to leave. Now they had to find somebody how do we leave. They found for us an American soldier who got they told him he can have three days off if he takes to Rome. This was in 1945, June or July. July, it was a short while after _____________ where we had the most horrible fights and a lot of Japanese Americans died there, and this soldier had a voice the most gorgeous voice. He was a negro and he sang all the way and it was wonderful. When we came to ______________ we still saw the dead animals all over but the mimosa trees were out and the orange trees were blossoming like the nature wanted to give us back something. I have that it in my book, but he didn't sing there. We were all weary with our heads down because it was the most horrible feeling a few weeks before there was big fightings.
Q. Did you stay there at all or did you just drive through?
A. No, we just drive through, but we stopped because it was shocking, but we didn't get out of the bus. None of us, and then we went to ____________ where the Popes usually have their summer vacation and I lived in Rome for a year so I know the place and then we came to Rome and Rome didn't change. Have you ever been in Rome? Isn't that a wonderful city? I think it's the most fascinating place.
But before we went to Rome I think we stopped in Naples and he took out his water bottle to drink and immediately the M.P. came up because he was black naturally. What are you drinking? You are not allowed and he got so angry he threw all the water on the M.P. They found out it was pure water. But I was very angry because then I found out how the Americans are so against their own people there, but he drove us there to Rome and he was wonderful and then in Rome I have lots of friends still and they were beside themselves that I am alive, of course. Then this wonderful the British officer who was at the Barre station who first met us and then this Scotland Yard, they took off a week so that they come and see us in Rome and we went together to the opera to hear Benjamin Gilli and it was wonderful.
I went to all the places I had been in Rome and I was so excited about being in Rome again. It was wonderful. Then we finally we were whole month in Rome but the Swedish government paid for all eight of us. I was supposed to give that money back after and Rome was just Rome. We roomed everywhere and I had this wonderful -- have you been in the place where Moses is? Oh, you have to go back just to see that. There is a sculpture -- what I remember is there is always a siesta in Italy so from 12 to two everything is closed and if you get there at two you are the first. So, I went there at two o'clock when they just opened and I walked into Moses and honest to God Moses talked to me and it was such a fantastic feeling because it looks like a real live man even his veins on his hands, it is a magnificent monument. So, I came out a different person after I talked to Moses.
Q. What did you talk to him about?
A. About the whole thing how we survived and what we did and he should look after Wallenberg if he meets him, but I said Wallenberg isn't there yet. I just talked, it was stupid but it was a marvelous feeling. I felt like a different person because this is the most fantastic monument you ever see. And of course I went to the Vatican and I went to the church there and see -- I walked around everywhere I did before. It was nice.
From Rome already the ambassador's girlfriend was with us. She was a Hungarian countess too, and unfortunately she died in tuberculosis in Stockholm. Would you believe that? She was with us. She was the one who came with us. She and that Swedish lady who was the former Swedish consul's wife then everybody left by airplane except the three of us and that was the German woman, one Hungarian who was married to a Swedish girl and myself. We were the only ones who stayed.
Q. You wanted to stay?
A. No, but that's how they managed. These people were very important. The two girls, the parents were waiting. The other one was with the Scotland Yard. The other one was a girlfriend of -- so they had to go. All right, that doesn't matter because I was not in danger and in Switzerland I have this enormously big family.
So, it was very exciting to see my family because I have a very famous aunt and uncle. She was a concert pianist and my uncle was a conductor and so forth. So, they picked me up and all my cousins and it was a great thing that I am alive.
Q. Where was this?
A. In Zurich. We went on an overnight train to Zurich from _____________ or somewhere. I don't know. It was quite a long way from Rome to the station. Except that maybe we shouldn't put down on there that my family didn't believe a word I told them.
Q. Tell me about that?
A. My uncle turned to my aunt and he said, the war must have done something to her mind. She's lying and every time the phone rang then he said, that's maybe the Swedish ambassador. It was a very bad four weeks and when the phone rang and it was the Norwegian ambassador they couldn't believe that I was told that the three of us will leave a Norwegian Red Cross bus to Denmark and then from there we go to Sweden.
Q. So you tried to explain to them --?
A. Oh, I told them what Wallenberg did but they weren't interested. Not at all, such a man doesn't exist. It's all a lie.
Q. Why do you think they weren't interested?
A. Not interested because that's how the Swiss were. I have a cousin whose parents were killed in the Danube. He was the only one that survived somehow, but then he was taken to either Bergen-Belsun or Auschwitz. I don't know which one was liberated by the Russians and then the Russians wanted to take him to Siberia and he figured he has an uncle and an aunt in Switzerland he's going to jump train, and he did. What they did to him and they could see the number, the Swiss had hit him so badly he still has cuts on his head for three days. It was incredible.
So finally, somehow somebody felt sorry and somebody finally called my uncle and then my uncle brought him home.
Q. Why were the Swiss attacking him?
A. Because that's how they were. They had too good a life all their life. They did that to us too. When we were about to leave the Swiss had everything. They had enough food but even home I wanted a little more butter. My uncle said that's on coupons, you can't have more butter. I hadn't seen butter for the past six years. In Rumania they had not much butter at that time either. But in any case we were standing in a long line together on the bus and had to go through customs and I was the last one, thank God, and I see the custom officers knew that we had to go through the town up Germany, through Nuremberg and all. There was no food, no nothing. They took all the food away from everyone. They took all the money away from every one. So, while there was such a long line I went into the bathroom, I took the money and put it in my shoe. I figured at least I have a few pennies. Could you imagine that the Swiss took everything away and they knew that we're going through a country where there's no food for three days.
Q. Had your family in Switzerland heard anything about the camps, about the deportations?
A. Oh, they probably had but they didn't believe.
Q. None of it?
A. Now of course because suddenly when Lutz, the ambassador from Switzerland I don't know if you know that he was taken with Raoul. They have their name down everywhere and the Swiss government picked up the phone and called the Soviets and said we have three spies of yours here. Do you want them back? We want Lutz back. Lutz was home in a week. We called the Swedish prime minister, we had at that time a Swedish spy for Russia ______________. He was the biggest spy and he was in a Swedish jail and we suggested to give him back to the Russians for Raoul and they said it's not worth it to get into war with the Russians for one man and international law wouldn't allow us. So, Raoul stayed. Lutz was home in a week.
Now, about ten years ago, finally they made a committee for Lutz and the committee mentioned that he helped Raoul and so forth. His wife just died and then they started to believe that these things really happened. But in the mean time my family, my uncle and aunt died and now they're helping me. I'm waiting for that letter maybe it will come eventually that a little boy, who was my cousin teaching, he wrote a wonderful thing about Raoul and they want to send me. So, we will see.
It was amazing. It was hurting me terribly because I needed all the being with us, and the other thing in Geneva -- I went off to Geneva for a couple of days because we had very, very dear friends there. He was an orthodox Jew and she wasn't. She was Swiss. He was Hungarian. They actually lived together. They were not married. And that was what Raoul always said, that he's color blind and religious blind. He only knows two people, the good and the bad.
During the years when Papa knew what's going to happen we took all our jewelry and fur coats out to Switzerland and left it with this friend in Geneva, not with our family in Zurich but in Geneva. Fur coats and money and then because in Hungary when you left you always had to go to the bank and if you're going for two weeks then so much money you can take. So we'd go over there and in three days we'd come home that we spend all the money.
So now I am in Zurich and I call up Aunt Nelli, this is Aggi. You're alive, you're alive. I said I am. Wonderful. I said Poppy said I should ask you to please give me some money because I'm going to get married in Sweden and I need money. Quiet in the phone and he comes to the phone and he said your father wrote us during the war and we have given back all the money. I said Uncle Otto, we couldn't correspond during the war, how could Poppy ask you for the money.
So, suddenly I said I'm coming to Geneva and so he says when and I said I don't know but I'll come. I thought if I tell them -- so the first trip I did in Geneva was a darling friend of ours who was a Swiss whose wife now lived with him too. He left him and now lived with him too. He had a big clothes factory and I walked into Andre and Andre started to cry. In French, too, you're alive, you're alive. I said Andre what happened to our friends. He said you won't believe it, but they stole everybody's money away. They played poker. Now, you see these are Jewish people. Every penny we had. Everything we had. I asked for the fur coat, they looked at each other, oh the fur store burned down. Those girls whom I saved I told you their mother was our best friend and she was very rich and she left her money in Germany with a Christian lawyer and she left. About she was here two years already in '51 or '53 when finally she gets a note from the lawyer that finally I found you. I tripled your money, come and get it. So, you see, it's not because one is a Jew and one is a Christian. There are bad people. Here are our best friends and they steal everything because they're going to die anyhow. They're the ones who sent me home. They said go home, nothing is going to happen.
Funny, heartbreaking and I remember I went then to Sweden, it was already October and I was called and ________________ it means you are very capable and I wrote her a letter and I said could you please send me some money I need a winter coat and the answer was you are so capable you will get it yourself. So, this is life. I guess my uncle and aunt sort of behaved the same way. It wasn't interesting, it's not true. Now it's too late. Now they believe in it, but so what. It was a heart break. It was a heart break because I couldn't believe it that they don't believe me. And of course later on they started to believe but it was too late. So, I was happy when I left Switzerland, but then it took us three days through Germany and we saw the Germans come like this and the Americans are -- they just walk because they were prisoners. The Germans were prisoners. But the funny part was that you read in my book too that the bus drivers for this Norwegian Red Cross were all German war prisoners and they still had the swastika besides it. None of the Norwegians would open their mouth in German. So, they asked everybody who speaks German and I stupidly said I do and I sat with these German war prisoners, the Jewish kid, and everything was written in English. Be careful, no road, be careful no bridge and I had to translate and I thought to myself if you would know that it's a Jewish girl who tells you what to do. But we made it to Denmark and the Danes were absolutely incredible. What they did they built us a camp there, there must have been a thousand showers with the hot water running like crazy and they made us food and they told -- the Norwegians they didn't eat much in the years before, don't give us so much food we'll get sick. But you could not eat when you look at the lox and the cheeses and I mean they were incredible. The Danes were absolutely fantastic. Then the next day they showed us a little bit and then we were put ont he same boat where they get the Jews from Denmark to Sweden and when we got to Sweden these two people were still with me, this one man who was married to a Swede and this German woman, and the three of us when and when we arrived there suddenly the detectives who came said you cannot get into the country. I said I cannot go into Sweden, why no? No, we got the report that you can't get into Sweden. I said to myself, oh my God, what kind of a stupid thing is that and the two people said well if she can't go then we don't leave either. We stay here with her.
So, in any case that too turned what happened. People do things and they still do it. In Geneva one of my friends got married and this guy has written to the Swedish newspapers. He was a newspaper man and he interviewed me. I was the first one, and he was fascinated by the story and I didn't know that these people twisting the words and write what they feel like. So, in any case I told him the whole story about how wonderful and how very thankful we are to the Swedish government for what they done for us because without them we wouldn't be alive and here and so forth.
And so they said okay they let me in and we had to go to a ______________ and all three of us went because they said they won't let me alone, and in the morning very early a knock on the door and it's one of these detectives with a big smile. I'm inviting you for breakfast and I said they changed their mind and sure enough we had a fantastic breakfast with the three of us and then we were invited to the police chief who couldn't speak much English or German but he was crying. He took me in his arm and he kept on showing me from the Swedish newspaper an article and I had no idea that that's the article we made in Switzerland. What I found out where the whole mistake come from is that this idiot instead of saying I'm going to Sweden and get married, he said in government business I'm going first to Oslo. So, they though, oh, she's a communist. She's coming here from the communist government. Can you believe that? We never even talked about Oslo, nothing, but that was in his mind, why not. That was very hard because even when I got to Stockholm that was funny because first they asked me if I want to go to my fiance first or where and I said I want to go to his mother's first and his mother was a darling and we couldn't speak each other language but we fell in love with each other. It was funny, and she showed everybody the newspaper article and she came with me on the train and on the train she showed everybody who am I and everybody gave me a big smile and a handshake and I had no idea what is in that newspaper.
Until I arrived and there was my so called fiance and other gentlemen and they greeted me like this and I don't know if you know this is the communist greeting.
Q. The fist?
A. The fist but I didn't know, and I said what's this? Don't you know this is the communist greeting and I said oh you must be joking. I thought they were just making a joke with me.
Anyway, it turns out in the parliament in Sweden there are communists sitting and the other man was the head of the communist party and my fiance was the second in command, but I didn't know that until sort of a few days. It was a very -- it's in the book so I don't want to tell you.
So anyhow I cried and then the old lady cried because the room they reserved was given away because we came late or something like that and we had to walk for almost half of the night to find a place to sleep, the two of us, the old lady and me and I'd be holding hands and we kissed each other. We were lonely. So, the next day when I called up the Swedish embassy they were all happy and they made me mad. The first question was why did you go to Oslo? Then I found out what was in the newspaper. I said I never said that and then I cried very bitterly. Finally here I am arriving and everything is a misunderstanding. And I said, do me one favor, could you please find out about my fiance. I know I have to marry him and I will, but if he is a communist I am not going to get married.
In one day I find out and they said yes and you don't have to marry him.
Q. So you really had expected to marry?
A. After all he saved my life, but I also found out he was never in love with me. It was just nice that he could save me, and I wasn't in love with him but that's all I could do for my Swedish government to marry the man, and if he wouldn't have been a communist I would have married him.
Q. You would have?
A. Yes, because that was what I had to do. They paid me all those months to be alive and to do things and Raoul saved 100,000 so how can I say no.
Q. So it wasn't just to protect you while you were in Budapest?
A. No, I thought that a decent thing to do if a man goes in all this trouble to do that, but I found out and they found out that he's a communist. Thank God that let me off. For years they wanted the money and then suddenly I got a letter after maybe ten years that I don't have to pay anything back, thank God, because I could never afford it.
But you know life is not easy. So anyhow from Switzerland as I said you went to Denmark and from Denmark to Sweden and finally on October 1945 I was already in Sweden. That's fast. That is in my book too that now I needed a job and of course the former Swedish embassy was looking for a____________ and the first thing they said that the Hungarian embassy wants me to work for them and I looked at them and I says hey, you cannot work for the communist but go find out at least what they want and I said if you're staying downstairs in the car I go. So, they did naturally. It was a very wonderful gentleman there and he spoke to me in Hungarian and he said that the Hungarian government offered me to be the cultural attache and I must have felt like Raoul when he became a so-called diplomat, because he wasn't first in my head he said oh my God, I'm going to be a cultural attache and then the same thought are you crazy to work for the communist government and I turned around and said thank you sir, it's wonderful, but no thank you. So, he shook my hands and I left. Two days after he dissated himself, this ambassador.
So, then I needed a job and then I got this job. There is, maybe you heard about this, a Swedish institute is an exchange for foreign students but what happened is Prince Bernadat went to Auschwitz to Bergen-Belsen to everywhere and he brought these terribly sick people into Sweden. You should have seen the hotels in the country what they made over for rooms for these people. They dressed them four times a season and they were allowed to get well there. They got all the medical and then they could choose whether they want to go home to their home or if they want to stay in Sweden they can stay in Sweden.
So then they turned to me and they said we do need someone who can go out because I spoke at that time, not any more, German I still speak perfect but French, and what language, French, German and Hungarian that I should speak about Swedish literature and culture. I thought to myself, how the hell will I do that? I know nothing. But they said we're giving you a key to the royal library and the books are all translated into German. So, I don't know if you ever did and if not then you should read _______________ books, so I took them and I enjoyed every minute. They were lovely, lovely books and _______________, two very famous Swedish people. Three languages I spoke about these people and their stories and first I thought with sick people they said don't talk long because these people can't stay but they would never let me go. Tell us more, tell us more, so I told them more. I went over all Sweden and here you can read it in English and Swedish what I done.
Q. Do you want to read it to us?
A. Yes, I want to read it to you. It says, "From November 15, 1945 to the expiration of the ___________1945 Miss Agnes Mandel had been commissioned by the Swedish Institute to visit different camps of repatriande and has there given lectures in all 62." That's quite a lot. "At first when Ms. Mandel was newly arrived in Sweden these lectures treated the Swedish rescuer which in Hungary was directed by Attache Raoul Wallenberg --" do you know I had to go down on my knees to be allowed to talk about it. I explained to them that those Hungarians may have some families saved by him and you don't let me talk.
Q. Why?
A. The same reason why they didn't help him for 50 years. "In this work Ms. Mandel took an active part, when it appeared that she acquired a good knowledge of life and condition in Sweden in a very short time she was commissioned to give lectures on Swedish, especially literary subjects. Ms. Mandel has given lectures mainly in Hungarian but in French and German through doing so she has shown great ability to keep people's interest alive and fascinated and often difficult audience." That's true. I will tell you what happened.
"On carrying out her commission Ms. Mandel was shown great care and attention, concienciousness and ingenuity as our lecturing activity in the camp has ceased for the present and consequently we can not any longer employ Ms. Mandel, we are delighted to give her our very recommendations. Stockholm the 5th of June 1946." And he just died shortly. _____________, he was one of my bosses.
End of Tape 2
Tape 3
Q. So tell me about that work, you would travel all over the country?
A. All over the country and that's how I learned Swedish because in one place I missed a train and I had to be there and there was a -- they always transporting wood and they said if I don't mind to sit on the top of all the logs with all the workers then I can go. And I was delighted and these workers were adorable and they were speaking Swedish to me and they were teaching me Swedish songs and we had a wonderful time, me on top of the logs. There was a couple of wonderful things and I went all over. The Hungarians, they always asked me what do I hear from Budapest I said look you are still sick so wait until you're very healthy because right now my parents write there is not enough food, there is no medication. So, the Swedes are looking after you so beautifully so just hold on.
One day I come back from one of the speeches and ___________ calls me and says you can't go anymore and speak and I said why. He said you were speaking anti-communists speeches. The damn Hungarians did that. So, they went around and asked every camp director and they all said she did not. These people were asking her and she just said the truth. There is no food. There is no medication. That's nothing anti-communistic in that. So, they were very gracious, they paid me back. But that month was a horror because I had to eat and I had no money really to speak of so I went to a curtain shop and I had to make the things the things that you're hanging up and I cut all my fingers and I got 25 cents an hour. It was horrifying and then they called me back and they paid me back those months I was out.
Then I got a wonderful partner whose family became my best friends and he was showing Swedish films so the two of us went and one day the boss said that he wants to come with me and hear me and I said okay but I am a person when I start talking I forget the surroundings and the only problem was that my dear partner was outside and he was making faces at me and I didn't know whether I should start laughing or doing my job. He was naughty.
Sure enough I stopped after 20 minutes and my boss looks at me and says can you talk longer. I said sure, sir, I said because they don't move. So, I spoke for an hour and that's how I became -- 62 speeches was not bad. And then it ceased all together and I needed a job.
Q. Let me ask you before you go on, were the people who were in the camps who you were talking to, would they tell you what had happened to them?
A. No, but there were a couple of wonderful surprises for instance there was a German boy, boy, by that time he was 25 or 26, and he lost everybody. Suddenly he comes up to me and says in German, would you like me to quote some ____________ poems to you and I just stood there and I cried because a man who went through what he did, that he still had the heart to tell me _________ poems. So, they never talked what happened there. They didn't want to talk about it. They rather hear what is going to happen to them now, some of them were happy to be able to go home. Some of them had no family to go to and some of them just wanted to give me a beautiful poem for what I have done for them so many times it was a very emotional trip. Also, in one day I had to go in one place and it was heavy snow and we had to go through the woods and when the taxi driver picked me it -- it was actually a big car, not a taxi, and it was snowing and gorgeous moonlit night and yet it was snowing too and he looks at me and he says do you speak a little Swedish. I said by now I do. He said do you like Beethoven. I said yes, he said because the Beethoven ninth symphony is starting and our trip is as long as the Beethoven ninth symphony. I never forget that I cried all the way because it was such an incredible feeling to listen to this and go through those magnificent trees and that quietness that there is no car coming forward or backward. You're just going with Beethoven's ninth and sure enough when the last note came out there we were and I was like that, shaking.
This was all miracles, it was like God wanted to give me something beautiful because he knows I like it. There is a driver, a wonderful man who thought that I would like it. He was lucky because maybe I'd say I only like rock and roll, but no I did like it. It was a wonderful feeling and that gave you the satisfaction of what you're doing that you get a little extra emotional good for it.
Q. What did you think when you were in those camps? Were they mostly men, women?
A. Men and women.
Q. What were you thinking as you met them and saw them. How did they look?
A. How did they look? By now many of them looked satisfied because they lived through it. There was a couple who were married and lived, but most of them didn't know what's going to happen to them because they didn't know if they have a family anywhere. Nothing you could tell them, all you could is hug them and kiss them and they thanked me that these stories I'm telling them it's such a wonderful way that they can live in a dream now. It was incredible in each of them. Even the French, they said they don't know if they'll go home to France if they find anybody. But most of them stayed in Sweden, and it is interesting how you eventually meet people.
How many years have gone since '46. I went back to Sweden with my husband when I took the book with me to the medical meeting and in the hotel downstairs there was an Orefers store, you know the Orefers glassware and I had broken a few. I got that from my Swedish friend as a wedding present. They sent it to me. I walked in and there is a middle age lady who speaks very good Swedish selling me these things and she went out of her way and I also felt something. Sometimes you have these feelings and she said I send everything to you. The next day I came down, I somehow couldn't forget her and I come down again and I saw an ice bucket the same thing and I thought why don't I buy that too. I walk in again and I tell her and I said may I ask you a question. Are you Swedish? She says, no I'm not, I'm German, but I was here in camp and I married a Swede and I have two sons. I looked at her and I said by any chance would you remember me. She said I have the feeling I do. I said I was the one who came and spoke and we found out that I was the one and she was the one and it was also such a magnificent feeling that she would be the one who is there. Then I come back and tell my _________ who are old friends of mine and the woman said, this is my cousin. Small world. Since then she went back to Sweden.
So, they don't forget because after all I had a story and that's why she was so nice to me that she had the feeling that somewhere somehow she met me and I had the same feeling with her so I just had to buy that one more thing.
Q. Now you stayed in Sweden for several years?
A. Three years and what was wonderful when this ceased in '46 I needed a job and I didn't know yet and I was sure that the ligation would come along with something and it was a Sunday afternoon and I will never forget and I was boarding with someone, I had a room. She wasn't home and I was in the bathtub. I enjoyed just to rest and the phone rings and I said should I pick up the phone it won't be for me anyhow. But I figured I put on the towel and I answered the phone and somebody asked me if it's me and I said yes. It turned out it was a director of a Swedish bank. Now, in retrospect I found out it was the Wallenberg bank. They said would I come in on Monday morning, the next day -- oh in the meantime, I forgot, I have been a maid in a big hotel because they paid very well and after a week they wanted to make me a supervisor. Well, that's all I need all my life is to be a maid and a supervisor. I was very tired and Sunday I wasn't in and I thought this has to end somewhere even though I earn very nicely but who wants to stay a maid. When this phone rings, would I come in on Monday morning they have a job for me. So, I called up the hotel and I said I'm sorry I'm sick and I got a job in the foreign check department and I was there almost two years. Fabulous salary and they were absolutely magnificent to me. I taught them English and they taught me Swedish and it was a wonderful bank. We had the restaurant upstairs with white gloved waiters giving us food. It was just wonderful and I got myself a little apartment and one day I came home and I look up and there are curtains. I said that's not my apartment. The whole apartment was furnished. It turned out my colleagues did that. Usually when a VIP comes they can sleep over in an apartment, there's an apartment in the bank, but there is also a vault with all kinds of furniture and they went to the management and they said could we take out some furniture and furnish Aggi's apartment and he said yes. By the time I came home it was completely furnished. They were wonderful.
Q. Now your parents were still in Budapest at this time?
A. Papa came out once and that was when I first came to Sweden and I made the friend, I told you the publisher who tried to help me. They were Protestant and they had sort of a religious thing and I told them about the Protestant churches how much they did for the Jews. In my book, if you remember, that he came to my house and he said I want my seventh daughter here to be baptized and he baptized me. Later on he became the Bishop of Hungary so my father went to him and said Aggi has good connections, maybe we could get some money for the church. If you help me to get a passport I will go out. So, Papa came first and sure enough I took him to __________ and _________ got a magnificent check that Papa took back to Hungary. Just before they closed the curtain, I managed to get them their visas to come to Sweden, and they did. The last minute, and those two Russians helped them and my other friend whose money was in Germany and they got it back, she and her one daughter.
Q. I think it was right around then that you moved from Sweden?
A. Now, then suddenly overnight everyone in Sweden started to learn Russian. It was terribly disturbing, so I thought well maybe we can all go to America. The American quota for Hungarians were closed for 11 years. So, the only place I could go was Australia and I thought Australia would be a wonderful place to go and I can bring my parents up. I'm sure I will make a fortune over there. Nice little dreams. But again, do you know the Swedish government helped me with money although I almost became a Swedish citizen and they helped me so I can get on the boat and get out of there.
I had to leave my parents behind which was terrible, but we had friends in Australia and as I said we were hoping that I will make a fortune. Well, it didn't work. It's the first time in my life in Australia that they almost committed suicide because nothing worked. I couldn't get a good job, I mean it was horrifying. It's also in the book I think. So, then miracles always happen and the miracle was that suddenly after six years the American embassy called and said I get the visa and I said you people said that the visa is closed for 11 years and the ambassador looked at me and said yes but in the mean time we found out about Wallenberg and you. I said thank you, but you have to be there by June and this was April and I had not a penny to my name.
So, I have a cousin here in this country and they helped and I went on a cargo boat, seven weeks from Australia to Boston. I become -- did you ever here the soroptomists. I was working, at one time it was quite a good job, as a hostess in a restaurant in Sydney and these ladies always came in there and they saw me working and how I worked and they knew that I was the head or the supervisor there. One day the one lady said to me, gee I would like you to be a soroptamist. I said what is a soroptimist. I was never very much a woman's woman. So, she explained to me what an international club it is, and it's only 75 years old. The Rotary club did it, and I said no. Would you like to be one? I said well if you take me. So, this is the first time that I suddenly got friends and that also saved me, so I became a soroptomist there. So, then just shortly before I left I had one penny to my name and seven weeks on a boat where we probably have to stop and I said how can I go completely without anything. Suddenly out of the blue this lady says to me one of the soroptomists that she is coming to America and there is a new law -- I don't think that doesn't exist -- if you come as a tourist you have to have $500 in the bank. Would I take the $500 and put it in the bank. So, in the seven weeks I spent $20 out of that $500 and I arrived at Boston and these people who stole all our money, their son lived there with his wife and they knew the whole story and of course they wanted to do everything for me, but he's a darling man. Unfortunately he died a few years ago and there was a lot of ladies there, 8:00 in the morning in Boston. First one officers comes to me and says Aggi, do you smell it? I said smell what? He said Boston beans. So help me God I could smell the Boston beans. When you arrive in the station somehow you are way up with the boat and everything else is all the way down and there is these elegant women with hats and gloves and somebody looks up and says Agnes is that you? I said yes, who are you? We are the soroptimists. They followed the boat for seven weeks the president of Sydney wrote them and for seven weeks they followed it and they were there that morning. June, windy June morning, I think the 10th I arrived 1951 and there they were and there was a British soroptimist who were just going so they turned to my friends and they said would you allow her to come with us tonight as cocktail party we want to make a good bye party for the British and a hello party for Agnes and he said yes. That was the first time I saw t.v. in my life. There was no t.v. and the one I saw was -- what was every Sunday afternoon -- Ed Sullivan. And I always watched him until he died.
Q. Is that the first thing you saw?
A. Yes.
Q. I wonder who was on the show. Do you remember?
A. That I don't remember. I only remember him and the show and the t.v. and what a bash these people put on. My God, the best lox you can have and -- it was gorgeous. Champagne and all that. But the funny part was that I felt like I was the queen of Sheba. You arrive in Kier as an immigrant and besides me was an Australian young woman with her Canadian fiance or opposite. They opened every little bag of theirs they have, and I come out with two of these ladies and the custom officer gives me a big smile. Welcome to our country and he did just like this and I was out. I said what, they didn't even open nothing.
So, it was funny. Then these women said that I should stay in Boston and they will help me to get a job and I have to be the soroptimist there and I called up my best friend and their little daughter was three years old by that time and the little one was six months old and I called up and I said I'm here and I'm going to stay in Boston. They offered me big jobs and the little one comes to the phone and said I washed my teeth and you're not coming to New York. I left next morning for New York because I never disappointed a child. And that's what happened.
Q. Now, I'm wondering during this time did you talk once you were in Sweden, Australia, here in New York, did you talk to anybody about what happened during the war?
A. Only with the speeches, no.
Q. Not to your friends?
A. But my friends all knew. Most of the people don't like to talk about it, would you believe that, actually refused to talk about it. Now about ten years ago I made the speech before the American Jewish Women's Congress and I said you people didn't help us at all. Oh, we sent packages. I said what packages. We didn't have any Red Cross, only the Swiss. We never heard from you people. We never heard that you might want a child out or something so the president got up and I was very surprised and she looked at me and she said I'm embarrassed to tell you we did not help. We were afraid that when those foreigners coming in here they will take our job. I just read a book now from a man who is now in Jerusalem and he wrote about this whole time. Not one Jew helped.
So how can you talk to people. They're not interested and they feel guilty today because I think many, many thousands of people could have been saved. Do you remember the St. Louis, the boat? I have a friend today, he's a professor here and he was on that boat, but he lucky he jumped the boat in France and then he came back another way. Now, those were not right things, so people don't like to talk about it. No Christians or Jews.
Q. Tell me about meeting your husband.
A. This was very funny. When I came here on the way my parents were going to Argentina. So, I came here in '51 and of course I got jobs immediately and that was very funny because when I said Stoffer's is looking for a hostess that my girlfriend said they don't take Jews. I said why? Oh, you will see. So, I went to fifth Avenue and they asked questions, the interview, and this wonderful woman asked me did you ever do this job before and I said yes, in Australia but I also had to do the waitress job besides. He said you're hired. She didn't ask me what religion nothing. She only wanted to know if I know what I'm doing. So, I've been there. Then while I was working at Stoffer's a lot of people came in from the airlines and they were eating there because it was right at grand central and they were at 42nd Street. There's a lovely, the concession people who sold the newspapers and all they always came and we talked and one day I said could I get a job with the airlines? He said sure we'll bring you the papers out and they even brought me a typewriter because the afternoon we always had two hours time and I typed it. Then I came home and said to -- I was already having the apartment I think, I said hey, it looks like I'm getting a job with the airlines. They don't take Jewish people. I said you said that when I went to Stoffer's and nobody every asked me. I said I can try. They never asked me anything. They just said would you like to work for us and I said yes and I worked 12 years for TWA. Nobody every asked me. If you don't work you're kicked out never mind if you're Jewish or Christian. But you can't talk to the people, they don't want to hear it.
Even this friend's sister, who I also call my little sister, she came to my speeches, she said don't talk so long, just cut it down. I said Olivia, they have to hear about everything. Don't tell me to cut it down. So, is it right to speak about it is should we shut up?
Q. You're speaking about it now.
A. Yes, but is it right or should we not?
Q. I think you should
A. See, because everybody took this differently but most of the people who went through it they either take it with a smile and say hey I'm going to work and I make a life out of it, like I did. My cousin here, the ones who helped me to pay, the first thing he said, I came on a Wednesday and Sunday they came to my friend's house and he said he has a big chemical factory and he wants me as a bookkeeper and I looked at him and I said well thank you but may I say no and they all looked at me that I say no to a job. I said I'll tell you why Bobby, because I never made bookkeeping, so if I don't do the right job you can't put me out because I am family. If I don't like it I can't leave you because I'm family. Do me one favor. If I can't get another job may I come back to you? He was shocked, but he said well yes, and I got myself the jobs.
Q. Tell me how you met your husband?
A. So finally the first week that I was at my girlfriend's place the phone rang and somebody said that they needed a mother's help for Fire Island. My friend said I don't know anybody and I kicked her and oh, that's right, Aggi's here. She wants to come. So, they paid $25, that's in 1951 was a lot of money for the week. I went to Fire Island and I was shocked out of my life because I had never seen two men kissing and that was the park they had two little boys. I said how can you bring your boys around here? Oh, nothings going to happen. So, twenty-five dollars it was a fortune so from that $25 the first thing I did was buy the Philadelphia Symphony season ticket for myself and my cousin's son because he liked music. And I bought my first papers because at that time, today when you come you just get the green card, but at that time you have to get the first paper. So, I remember going there and I was here a week and tell the lady that I would like to have my first papers and that $10 and she said when did you come to this country and I said last week. She looks at me and says I am working here 25 years. You are the first one who comes, other people are here two or three years before they asked for it. I said well not me, I want it now, and I got it. So the $25 went, but it was lovely. So, then I got it from my other friend and then the parents arrived in '57 and Daddy didn't really like music but he loved us and he came with us and we all the way up on top because they were cheap.
Q. Where was this?
A. Carnegie. At that time they had ten concerts a year and it was delightful and at that time you could go on the subways or it was okay for us to come home in the night. My parents also had an apartment on Burn Street. I paid that for them.
And in 1958 I think it was, -- '59 or '60 season Papa said don't buy me a ticket dear because it's very hard for me to get on those steps. I said okay, I'll just buy it for Mommy and me. This was a very short -- we were only Mama, Papa, and a lady whom I'd known for many, many years and we were very good friends. It was an old lady.
So, anyhow, my husband he was a big music lover. He himself was playing the flute, he plays quite a good piano. He almost became a pianist but he said if you don't know how to write music then it's no use so he became a doctor. That's his story.
Anyhow he also wanted to ___________ because he liked the Boston Symphony and he wanted the Philadelphia Symphony. He had no idea that he can't just call up and he gets a season ticket. One day he's with a friend in a car and they had to stop for the red light and he says you go to the hospital. I'll go in and try to buy a season ticket and he bought my father's ticket. Papa said it was written in the stars. Isn't that funny?
At that time he had a crew cut, well he was Oriental. There was Mommy and me and there was him and then the old lady. We always went early with Mommy in the evening and so he was always there. He found out we're coming early so he got up and he said good evening. That's all he could speak, almost no other English.
About the second month or the third month the old lady turns to him which is unusual and he said young man are you Chinese? So I listened and he said no, I'm Japanese. So, now I knew two things he's Japanese and he likes the same music I like. The next month again the old lady turns to him and says young man, what are you doing in this country? He said I am a doctor and she says medical? And he says medical. Good, so he knew nothing about me. Now, February came. It was the coldest horrible February. It was snowing, raining, both Mommy and me had a cold. My tongue was swollen, but immigrants can't lose money and I said Mommy I'm going with the subway and sell the tickets and come right home. So, I went in feverish, and I'm standing in -- at that time it wasn't fixed yet, now it's changed, Carnegie Hall, and it was pretty cold and I'm standing with the two tickets and suddenly in my mind I said gee that little Japanese doctor will be so disappointed if I don't come and besides that it was _______________ who played and a young man comes up and says do you have two tickets and I said no only, and I sold him Mommy's and I go to the phone and I said Mommy ______________ is playing, it's just as well I'm here now I'm going to listen. Okay.
So, I go up. The whole place is empty. I couldn't make the steps. I was really sick. He came down and he said, "Are you sick?" I said to myself, good doctor, he can figure out that I can't make it. That was it. After that --it's not there anymore --it's the peacock Alley. It's down in the village now I think. We went in there and we talked until 1:00 in the morning. My tongue disappeared, my fever gone. It was very funny, but we didn't have time to meet because he was working in the Lebanon Hospital in the Bronx and I had to open my office at 7:00 in the morning so our love affair went over two telephones what he paid at that time. Now he wouldn't. We were listening to ______________ on two telephones and two radios. We drove the family crazy.
We went on two dates. One we went to see The Mouse that Roared, and the second number was Can Can and neither of us had much money so we went to the Brass Rail, right on nd Street and after Can Can we went over there. He likes corn beef, a good Jewish boy and I like roast beef and at that time you got a sandwich like this for $1 and that's all we could afford, $2, in the middle of his sandwich he says will you marry me? And I thought to myself, yes. I had no idea if he's going to go away from here, back to Japan, or what, nothing. And he knew nothing about me then. But everybody always said, why don't you get married? I had a wonderful job with TWA and I earned good money and I could travel around. Who needs a husband. But this was fascinating to me. I thought Oriental, it could be fun.
So, we had our engagement in March and then we had a concert and it was awfully funny because the old lady was sitting there and now my husband to be turns around and says excuse me and she was so surprised and he says we are getting married. She says what because his English is awful still, and he said we are getting married thanks to you. And sure enough she came to the wedding. We married in April 27.
Q. Did you talk to him about the war?
A. Oh yes, he cried three weeks. The whole honeymoon I told him the Wallenberg story and he told me about their story, the atom bomb and all that.
Q. He had been in Japan then?
A. Yes, he came here -- he was invited by -- there was a very famous doctor who invited him and he went to England and he got a heart attack in England and then Doctor Goodmacker, you must have heard he's the one who's making the family tree, and he took him over and he came. First he was at Mt. Sinai for many, many years.
Q. Do you think the fact that you both had a history in the war, did that bring you together in some way?
A. No, because we didn't talk about that. We talked about music and this and that. We had an absolutely wonderful time so I don't know how a man can change that completely and wholly. Constantly all he can say is you will find yourself out in the s street. And you should be happy you live under this roof. This man lived on me for four years first because he earned $80 a month in the hospital and I earned $500, so whom do you think paid for everything.
Then we had the children and I still went to work after, not at TWA but something that I could be home when the children come. Everything, I thought that's what a married life should be, to give away, to share. My mother was killed, I told you I think and finally after three years got $45,000 which is nothing, $35,000 I built him a ______________ because he likes to paint, he did. I build a library for him and I kept $10,000. And today, nothing. I will find myself out on the street. He won't give me for buying a pair of socks. It's funny, and yet we had so many beautiful things living. He would never have gone to Europe if it's not for me because we went for TWA courtesy $75 for three weeks on our honeymoon. Then we went to Rome again for $75.
Q. So, he did believe your story?
A. Oh, yes, very much so.
Q. What made you decide to become so active in speaking and talking about your experiences?
A. Because it turned out I was the only one who would come out and say I worked with Wallenberg. They didn't believe me. IT was funny, but after I brought these real papers out, ___________ was the first one who made a Wallenberg committee, and it was a lovely Swedish woman by the name of Lena Kaplan who went with Rabbi Kohl, who was with the Christians and Jews and they made the first Wallenberg committed. Then they were looking and advertising for someone who worked so I said I did and they said do you know how many people came and it turned out it wasn't true. I said well I have some papers to show. Oh, you're the first one with papers to show. So then I showed them and they believed but yet you cannot imagine what they did to me, all of them. It's incredible. The same as with poor Raoul.
Then maybe you heard the name of the Wallenberg Committed of the U.S. That young woman was born after the war. She's a Jewish girl from the south and whose house it was forbidden to talk about the Holocaust. She came to New York with her husband and her children went to the same private school where Lena's kids and Lena came in one day to speak about Wallenberg because her parents and Raoul's parents were friends. So, she thought to herself she can make a lot of money out of that. I would be interested to work with you. So, they make her the president and she sat down with me and we had a two hour talk. She learned everything from me, and then she says, oh Aggi, you're going to be the secretary of the Wallenberg committee and I looked at her and I said what? Secretary? No way. She says oh, the trouble is you don't speak English and you don't know what you're talking about. Do you know what the Secretary of State is? I said, yes, I do and certainly there is a huge big difference between a Secretary of State and a secretary of a committee. So, we fought and fought and they finally made me a vice president. It's a lot of other things, I don't want to get into it.
Q. When you go, you talk a lot to schools, to young people?
A. Yes, I speak to schools, colleges, churches, synagogues, clubs, Rotary, Kiwanis, Lions, whoever invites me I go.
Q. What do the young people say when they hear your story?
A. It depends again where you're going. Most of the time the kids are extremely excited and they all want to be Wallenbergs because you have to learn -- first of all when you go to any school, the kids already have a face like this, oh my God I have to listen to another Holocaust story. Only about ten years ago it struck me that I can do something about this and I would walk into any big class or something and I said are you kids all dreamers and they look at me and say yes. I said, ok then dream that I don't have this grey hair and I was your age. It doesn't matter. They don't have to know that I was already 26. You can't imagine the psychology of this oh we're going to listen to a young person not an old one. Already they listen different. They all sit like that.
Then when you finish telling the story, you don't reach every child, and this is impossible too, but most of the time you do and you're surprised what you get back. Because I spoke out in Long Island in a big high school where two young girls from the senior class called me, somebody heard me speaking and told them and they went to their principal and they said we would like to make a remembrance day. Thank God they had a principal who wasn't stupid and knew what they're talking about and he said good, let's get people together. So, I was the first choice and I was the first speaker in the morning for I don't know how many of the seniors, they have three classes I think, and they invited two wonderful gentlemen who were soldiers who got the people out of these camps so they had the real story because nobody else believes. One was a Christian one was a Jew and there was a lady who came out with the children from Germany and so forth. So, I was the first speaker in the morning and the kids were just marvelous and they gave marvelous questions.
Now, somebody brought me home one teacher and so I said now I would like to listen what they talk and sure enough I went in and these two old gentlemen were wonderful and they explained to these youngsters that you are the last people we're talking now so you have to understand that this did happen and don't ever let it happen again, for no one, because what these people suffered and what they will in the future, just remember we are all the same people. Now, do you have any questions, and this one tall black boy who was in the class where I spoke, he got up and he took this mike and he said, "Sir, I can hardly talk. I listened to Mrs. Adachi, and I hope she's here and he turned around, to these fantastic stories of Mr. Wallenberg, and now I am hearing you telling us the things that the whole United States doesn't believe that it happened. I promise you right here that me and all my friends an I hope also those who are not my friends, from now on we will work together and we will make this country as big as you want it, and thank you for all of you speaking to us." Do you know what a fantastic feeling that is that the kids feel that yes we can do it.
Now, we have the Wallenberg school, you know, the only Wallenberg school in the whole country and today's principal is not that good but the older principal we are now since '82 we are the Wallenberg school and I was always invited to speak to the incoming kids and the outgoing kids. The outgoing kids are already in Junior High and High School. One of the music teachers went with them and one day I got a call already from the Junior High School, Aggi the kids, mostly the Wallenberg kids are going to play Fiddler on the Roof and they want you to come so they can honor you. I said I'd be delighted and I'm sitting there and there is this little boy four feet, blonde blue eyed playing ____________. I haven't heard anybody playing ________ like this kid. He was adlibbing. He talked Hebrew but in my back I'm thinking what I remember about that child. Something I remember, I'm sure that he's not a Jewish kid. And he was wonderful. Two hours they had no intermission.
When it is all over of course they always brought down the house and the teacher comes to me and says Aggi do you remember Johnny. I said yes, but what do I remember? She said Johnny has the worst asthma condition. I said that's right, and besides he's a Christian who has to learn Hebrew and he came up to me and he said Mrs. Shapiro, I want to be Taviar. So, how do you tell a wonderful child that he might not be able to and I tried and I said Honey, first of all you have to learn some Hebrew. Okay, that's easy, you are young. Secondly, what happens if you suddenly get an attack because there will be no intermission. Two hours you will have to be there. He said Aggi, Johnny was Wallenberg. He was not five foot, he was eight foot tall. And this kid was not four but six. He looks at me and he says if Raoul and Agnes could do what they did, I can do it. Do you believe that. And he did it, without ever stopping or coughing because the mind plays enormous tricks and this is a wonderful feeling.
Then Governor King, who is not a governor anymore he's now the president of Drew College in New Jersey, he invited me when he was a governor to come and speak with him together to high school students and he invited three high schools, all the seniors. He was speaking first and then I did and there was always question and answer and I finished my who Raoul story and one boy gets up and says Ms. Adachi, Raoul Wallenberg must have been full of drugs and alcohol to be able to do what he done. I looked at the kids and said boy are you stupid and King gave me a big kick in the foot. He thought I'm going to be killed from one of the kids, but I am a Wallenberg child and nothing can stop me and I look at this boy in the eye and I said Honey, I am sure you are on drugs aren't you. And he did like this and I said then you know what happens to you. You know that you take the drugs and you feel in heaven, wonderful maybe an hour or two and then the drug goes and all you can think of is how can I get more drugs more alcohol to feel like I feel before. Now, if Raoul Wallenberg would have done that, then he would have lost out helping the people. He looks at me for a minute and says I didn't think of that and he sits down and I thought that's the end, but three weeks after I get a phone call from the principal of that school and he laughs but he says oh Agnes what did you do to the boy. I said oh my God, did he commit suicide? He said hell no, he walked into my office that afternoon and he said Sir I am very highly on drugs and alcohol, can you please take me to a withdrawal place. I want to get out of everything. He said not only did he get out in three weeks but now he's going around all the schools in New Jersey teaching other youngsters never to get into anything. That was another, I looked up and said thanks Raoul.
Q. Do you say that a lot?
A. Yes. My friends who are in the committee, there is an international committee who goes into find Raoul because we think he is still alive and she says you are a bad influence because all of us feel that Raoul talks to us and it is true, I have gorgeous pictures all the way up in my bedroom of Raoul and the Wallenberg School had the tenth anniversary and it was a whole day affair, morning and evening and I was naturally supposed to be one of the main speakers and I had the worst cold you can imagine and a fever. I called dup the school I said, I'm sorry I can't come. Aggi, it's impossible we can't do it without you. I said I'm sorry, I have a high fever. I went to sleep, the middle of the night I wake up so help me God that picture was talking to me. It said Aggi get out. We did it when we were sick, we did everything, those kids need you, get up. I got up, I called the phone I said I'm coming. I could hardly speak, but they were very gracious they took a motel around there they took a room for me so after the morning session was over I had three hours sleep and then I went back. The other day, this woman who is with ARK and she already got other Americans out of Russia and she's one of the persons and she calls me from Washington and she laughs. I said what's the matter. She says I'm getting as crazy as you are. I said, why what happened. I'm sitting here in the Washington Library, the FBI library uncensoring papers and I came to a story what is absolutely incredible and I laughed loud, everybody looked at me, and I said that's it, that's it, and suddenly I feel a hand on my shoulder and Raoul says, that's it, Susan, go. That's my story. So help me God he talked to me and they went off to Moscow and they found out that this is all true.
But he was a person -- I have never met anyone like him. He was true. He never lied but yes, he constantly lied, but not lying to us but that I also tell the children that we are grown up to learn that we shouldn't lie, we shouldn't cheat and we shouldn't bribe anyone, but if you can save a person's life, the lie cheat and bribe because that's what Raoul did and that's how he saved the people. And children understand it now and when you reach the kids it's a wonderful thing and I'm sure it will hurt Raoul that every year I'm writing about 500 New York State schools for a senior person and that includes all the Hebrew schools, Jewish schools and catholic schools. In seven years I haven't had even one Jewish school answer.
Q. What are you writing them about?
A. I'm giving every year a Raoul Wallenberg Humanitarian Award to a senior high school student who did outstanding humanitarian work during their four years in school.
Q. So you've never given out the award because no one writes back?
A. The Jewish I never give, and it's hurting me. Here on Main Street we have a big, wonderful Hebrew school and I know the principal who's a lovely woman and I called her up and I said Dr. Blough how come we don't have a child. She says, they don't care. I said then teach them to care. You never invited me to come and speak. The other schools don't even answer. It's a heart break. After all the man saved 100,000 Jews and we don't have a child. I had Indians, I have catholic school kids, quite a lot, Scottish, Irish.
Q. Is it important to your own children?
A. My own children, yes. My own children are following, especially this one over there, the younger one. They were up with his wife as I told you, in Colorado and Easter come and they both love to bicycle. So we couldn't go there, they wouldn't come home for ten days vacation and I said to him sweetheart are you going on a bicycle trip with Amy? He said no Mommy we're going to build a road. I said I beg your pardon. He said a man walked into the university and my son was teaching already, not just taking classes and he said young people I want to build a road from Boulder to the Canyon for people in the wheelchair so they can go and see the canyon. How many of you will come and work. So my two of course right away put up their hands. Ten days they were building a road and the man and his workers supervised it. He fed them like crazy. He got them tents to sleep in and blankets. Then I asked him, were you written up in the newspaper? He said Mommy, we are Wallenberg kids. It's wonderful.
And my older one who is a big doctor now and makes money, he still goes to soup kitchens and places and helps. But they used to lie down beside me and say Mommy, tell us stories, like little dogs, even the two wives. And my older son, they just adopted a little Korean girl. She's gorgeous. She's wonderful.
Both of them married Jewish girls.
Q. So they would ask you to tell them stories about --?
A. My whole life. It's always exciting for them.
Q. I wanted to ask you, all that time during the war, during the time in the camps or when you were going up to Sweden, was there any time for romance?
A. Yes. Actually, romance, I was terribly in love with an Italian who was in Budapest almost until the Germans came in, but he was married and his wife had a lover and what he knew, he died. But we were terribly in love, and for me I knew that I was going to have to marry this Swedish guy, but my dream was always him. That was everything.
When I got to Sweden I tried to find out if I could find him. I didn't know the address and they told me that the aristocrats in Italy was killed by Mussolini and I said my God, my friends might be killed because she was a _____________ girl. Anyhow, that was always in my mind that maybe I might meet him once again, and his children loved me, especially his younger son. He was crazy about me, but it didn't work. Otherwise I had no time, really, for any.
In Australia there was a Polish guy who fell in love with me, but I left very fast to here and a few years after he went to Canada and my best friend's mother whom I told you she got all her money back and her girls are my two little sisters, she said go and see him in Canada and I said Mommy, I don't think I want to see the man again. How do you know, it's about time you get married. I went up there but it didn't work for me. He was a funny guy by that time, but I never forgot my Italian. A year before we got married, before I ever met ___________, I went to Spain and from Spain I went to Italy and in the hotel I asked them if they could tell me if ____________ had a phone and we found my friend's name there and I called up and they both got _______________ and his wife and when I came there he said to me you are like a meteor coming down. All the time he was thinking of me and he died six months ago.
So, I don't have him anymore. He wouldn't like what he hears now about what happened to me because my husband met him.
Q. But you were in touch with him over the years.
A. Oh yes, he congratulated us, to our wedding and we stayed friends, but he was the only big love in my life, I think.
Q. What also strikes me is that music played such a tremendous part in your life. All the stories you tell, music --
A. Music and especially you see because my one aunt was an opera singer but in Hungary I don't know in other countries, when she married her husband wouldn't allow her to be an opera singer anymore because that was official at that time. She gave up, she had a big contract with the Hungarian opera house.
My other aunt was a ___________ student. You like music yourself?
Q. Yes. So it was always part of your family?
A. So much so that if you're interested I'll tell you that that also helps when you have a big problem or trouble, music helps. When I was still a little girl like this or a year older when the first short wave radios came into being and Grandma was very sick, so the family bought her a little radio and on that night when she was really sick they said _____________ that was the daughter, is going to play the Greek piano concerto. So Grandma gave a big smile in bed and she listened to this concerto and then the applause came and Auntie knew that she was sick and she had a microphone and she said Mama I love you and grandma gave a big smile and she closed her eyes and she was dead. And this concert stayed with us all the time.
End of Tape 3
Tape 4
Q. That was the Greek piano concerto.
A. The Greek piano concerto. Now, when Mother was killed my older son was already in pre-med or a senior in high school, and he wanted to make the eulogy for Mommy and he turns to me and he says to me, Mommy what do you think, the last portion of the Greek piano concerto I said yes, and we did play it out at the funeral home.
Then a few weeks ago, I suddenly felt very, very down, I don't get invitations to speak, I can't sell my books, and my marriage is on the rocks and I was really bad and I couldn't turn my neck. When I went to bed I had to hold onto my neck and put it down and I sit there and WQXR is going and I just felt sorry for myself and I said this cannot go on. I am a strong woman. I have to get out of this. I sort of talked to myself and I said Mommy, would you please massage my neck so I can at least turn around and I am feeling miserable. The announcer said and now _________________ is going to play the Greek piano concerto. I sit there and I says thank you and at that moment I could turn my neck. I felt much better and I said I have to go on and be strong. Is that interesting? And there are miracles like that. There are lots of miracles in life. When you think that everything is lost like as I told you I have these books and I just can't sell it and one was six weeks in a place and I said that's good news they didn't send it back. They sent it back, it's not for them.
So I went, there's a wonderful printer in the city and he's redoing one of my books and I didn't know that he's not editing it all himself and two days ago I went to soroptomists meeting and before that I said when I'm coming in and he said yes it's good you should read through what we worked and I walked in and there is a lady sitting and I said hello and he said hello Agnes and she looks up and she says you're Agnes Adachi. I said I am and she says I love your book. I am the one who edited it. But that's not all. So, we go into the little room. It turns out that she's Swedish but she was born here. She speaks less Swedish than I do, but it's wonderful. She's also a clergyman. She's a divorced woman, has two kids also and she's a Protestant. So, naturally she's a clergyman, so we talked and talked and she said I want just little things in your book what you need because my English is no always the best. But she said there is almost nothing I should really do but I love it. So we talked and she said where are you going and she sees this 75 year thing on me and I said did you ever hear of the soroptomists and she said no so I explained and I said by the way you would be just a person we would like to have. I said by any chance would you have a bio. It so happens I have one with me. I said give it to me but I didn't have time to read it. I made a copy and I gave one to my president and I came home and I lied down with this bio. And again, I said oh my God, not a miracle again. When I was a little girl I was dancing ballet and my teacher was Anna Pavlovich, a Russian woman. She was teaching and I was so good that I remember I always heard go after Aggi, everybody went after me and suddenly the doctor said she's going to die in heart failure because I was dancing four and five hours a day. That was all my life.
So, I didn't become a dancer, but in 1951 I wrote a beautiful story to ballet and couldn't sell. You know how everything is so here I'm taking this lady's bio. She's a ballerina. She's also teaching. She's also involved with every big ballet school in America and I'm reading this and I said I don't believe it that God suddenly sends me this woman who want to help me with my book and she's a ballerina. Then it's all her life that she's a clergyman too. So next day I called her and I said I don't believe in my luck and I'm telling her and she says oh, I can sell that and in a hurry we can even make music to it.
It's sometimes interesting that you can do this.
Q. Have you ever run across any of the other Wallenberg people who you worked with?
A. No, they don't want to come along. When we did this, we advertised in every Jewish Christian papers, nobody ever answered. Even we wrote to Israel, nobody comes along and helps us. And those who comes, they -- the very first video the BBC made, have you ever seen that? I told you about that lawyer who came over to tell me to go to Rumania and his name was Haggerdish and I'm telling him the story and suddenly he said Haggerdish, at that time I didn't know where he was or what happened to him and he was quite nasty to me because when we finally met in Sweden and I never contacted Wallenberg's mother because I felt as an immigrant they would think I wanted money and I didn't want it. I'm stupid I know but I never did. Even his sister told me we lost almost 50 years of friendship and I said I'm sorry, but that's how I am.
But in any case, he came to Sweden and he said he's going to contact the mother and by that time I said I'd like to come with you. No, you're not coming with me. It's only me that should go. Okay. Now, we never saw each other again and the BBC man said to me he said Haggerdish, oh we have a lot of contact with him and he always said how he worked with Raoul and what he did. Suddenly the phone rings outside and the secretary come in and says it's Haggerdish from Canada and looks at me laughing. I said tell him that I send my love. He comes back after and says Agnes thank you. I said why. It turned out it's not that Haggerdish. Suddenly he said I'm sorry I fooled you for years, I never worked with Raoul Wallenberg. You see, they just made money on him. People pick up names. It hurts. Like this goddamn Rabbi. He knows everything. He knows how he died, where he died how.
Q. Sounds like you're very protective of his memory?
A. I am because I know what he did and when they come up -- we were all embarrassed, we had one young Christian guy in Riverdale. His name is Tom Byrd and he was an archeologist his father. He spent $2,000 just to make some buttons for Raoul. I mean he's a nut. But me and he and a lady were invited to Brahms, that New York University right on 42nd Street upstairs and there was a Rosenthal who wrote the book of Raoul and it's quite good and he was one of the guest speakers and he just finished and suddenly a man comes in and he jumps up to the podium and he says my name is Dr. Cherry and everything is a lie what you people are saying. And Tom and me, we just sat there. We were almost sick. He said Raoul Wallenberg came to Budapest with 5,000 passports in his pocket and he gave that out and that was it. He didn't do a thing after that. I got up and I said what are you talking about. You sit down, I'm telling you that is the truth. He did nothing. He was just in the way of everybody. So, I sat down and I was really shaking. Tom too, we both looked like we're going to collapse right there. Then he gets off and he comes by me and he says you liar and he walks out. Then a man comes up to me and says well we think too that you don't say the truth. I said who are you? He said I am on the committee of Rachel, that's the woman who runs the Wallenberg committee of U.S. and she told us that nothing is true. How do you fight this? So, there are two of us, really three of us, the photographer too. There is Vera, who is like me. We go out and speak and speak and speak because she was there. She was almost 11 years old so she knows what this man did to her, how he saved the lives. And he was there. And the other day I saw it in another newspaper where they said that he is a professor at Rutgers and he's running the Raoul Wallenberg --- and he dared to write that Raoul was not sent to save the people, he was sent as a helper for the Swedish ligation. Things like that. I wrote a very ugly letter and I said how can you keep a man like this to run a Wallenberg committee, and the Wallenberg committee in New Jersey was so upset. So, it's terribly hard because we saw what the man did. I mean he was incredible. That's why nobody ever helped him. Look at his own country did nothing for him. And Unger almost lost his diplomatic accreditation too because when he went back to Sweden he said he wants to help for Raoul and he was told by his things if you don't shut up you're going to lose your credadation too. Try to explain. It's a heart break because we are talking about one person, not a Schindler, who didn't do it because he has to do it, he did it because that was the only way out. He was a drug addict, an alcoholic, he lived with his girlfriend and his mother, and not only that, a lot of other things disturbing us.
About three years ago I have all those letters you should see, a woman called me. She got my number I don't know from whom. She's a _______________ and she wanted to talk about Wallenberg. I said why are you so interested. Well, my mother is so interested. I said well, why is your mother so interested. It turns out the mother is the daughter of Raoul and when she sends me the mother birth certificate it is an absolute impossible thing because she was born July 1945 and Raoul was already in jail since January and to make this woman then he would have had to leave Hungary in October sometime to go to Hitonia to screw somebody and then, you know. All the money he has it belongs to them and all that. So, I warned the sister and she said oh we got letters from her too, and then she called me again and she said you have to help us. I said I don't want to hear about you people, not even not helping. Raoul didn't have a daughter, no where. So you're a coward too? I said yes, call me a coward, call me anything, but don't call me again. Thank God I never met them. So now, I thought it's over and these people were on welfare yet. They should put them back and that's what I told Nina I said the Swedish government try to get these people back to Histonia. We don't need them on our tax. So, about three months ago I'm getting a letter again from them that they moved out of their house. Now they live in a hotel. Now they found out that definitely Raoul is dead and so they want all that money and jewelry. Poor Raoul, he doesn't even have any money. There's a trust fund for him but jewelry, who had jewelry? Even Nina doesn't have any jewelry. So, I didn't answer. And I promised myself and I was stupid not to do it when the phone rings and somebody said could I speak to Agnes Adachi I should ask who it is and if their name comes up I will put on an English accent and I said they sold the house they left, but I didn't do that, and she called me. Now, she comes up with other things because Raoul was in school here for four years and there was a girl who was in love with him but he wasn't in love so they never married. She's dead too. That he has a child from that woman. It is incredible what people are doing.
Q. But for you the memory is --
A. For us, for Vera too, it is a clear memory of a man who did nothing else but saving other people and try to do his best for everybody, but it was not always possible to do it. Like when __________ he was 15 years old and he was his photographer and he came to him and said Raoul they're taking my parents so Raoul left everything and run with the car, but the time he went to the Danube they killed him. So, you couldn't always, and the same thing with the railway stations when he went all the way. He yelled and he bribed the Hungarians and at least 1,000 people he could and then he went and he heard in the mean time they shot the other ones. It was an impossibility but they could shoot him at any moment but he just didn't care. The main thing was to save innocent people especially children.
I had a good friend of my mother's. She just died in this country she was 103. She told me the story about him too. There was a mason factory outside Budapest and they wanted to make a gas chamber out of it but there wasn't enough time so they made a big hole so people fall in. There was no food, no latrines, nothing, and in one of them I don't know if you heard her name, Susan Tabor. She also died a few years ago. She was there with her husband and her mother. Raoul heard about it suddenly that they have people there so he took the red cross trucks and hot soup and bread and medication and screamed at these people. How dare you, these people are protected by us and so forth. Please get out of here, get out of here and before the Germans could move he took the people out. But Susan came up and said sir, we don't your papers. He said never mind just walk out and she walked out with her mother and husband and that's how they came eventually here. But then he walked into this 300 old people and she told me that story and they were cuddling on the floor there. Cold, it was winter time and suddenly Raoul Wallenberg became a completely different man. He was like a child. He excused himself that he steps on people but there is no way to go. He said please, just be quiet. I'll come back. I bring you medication and I take you and he took all 300 old people out of there and that's why she came here.
So where is another man like this, and he was in constant danger and he had to - there was also another young lady. Where is she living now? I don't know, but she never wants to help either. She was sick and she was lying on the floor and Raoul came with the Red Cross and he said these people are our protected people and I take them out. The guy says you can take 25. So, he looks down at this woman and says do you speak German? She said yes. He said I'm counting very fast and if I come up to 15 can you get up she said maybe. He said I'll help you. He counted so fast he took 30 out instead of 10 and he got these woman out. He had to chance every minute. As I said the only thing he was afraid of was the bombs because there he couldn't do anything.
He was an incredible human being and he didn't have to do all this, but now that I'm reading through all these letters what he wrote to his grandfather, you see did you know that his father died three months before he was born of cancer so he never met his father but on the father's side the grandfather was the ambassador to turkey, before that to Japan and then to Turkey. He adored his grandfather and as I can read these letters, the grandfather manipulated him all the time because all he wanted is being an architect and the grandfather wanted him to get involved in business and in the bank and the other Wallenbergs didn't want him in the bank. So, he had a very, very hard time to please his grandfather but please himself and he came out with flying colors from the college here as an architect. That was his dream. It is terrible when you can take somebody's life like this. He was 32 years old, but that _____________ did you ever hear that name? That was the Japanese consul in Lithuania. He was forbidden by the Lithuanians by the Germans and by his own government to help anybody. And he and his wife gave 10,000 visas to go to Tokyo and to Shanghai and I was with my husband in Shanghai six years ago and I happened to run into people who Mr. _____________ saved and in Tokyo quite a few, whole families. And this man too, his government took away his diplomatic credentials immediately. He didn't get his pension. Eventually he died. Now the family gets everything back. It's a little bit late. 10,000 people.
And the other one was the Portuguese ambassador, who also saved people, also 10,000. He died an old man. But Schindler, 15,000 people and they make a big deal out of him. I didn't see the film and I'm not going to. But Raoul Wallenberg it is terrible.
