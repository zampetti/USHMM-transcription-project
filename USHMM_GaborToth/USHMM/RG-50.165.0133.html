that was denied the victims.</span> <span id="s30">And once more, this is what the killers have done- I would have preferred to believe then, as I believe now, that every Jew who was killed in every ghetto, was a unique immortal Jew.</span> <span id="s31">Every person today is a unique person.</span> <span id="s32">After all, to condemn the person to humiliation, suffering and deprivation to death, is in fact to annihilate the uniqueness of that person.</span> <span id="s33">And in doing so, I would annihilate my own uniqueness and that of everyone else.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Maybe to some extent those who deny the Holocaust are frightened people.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: No.</span> <span id="s36">I think I would not dignify it with such lofty goals.</span> <span id="s37">I really think they are simply vicious.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Just vulgar anti-Semites.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: They are vicious, and vulgar and anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s40">And they hate Jews.</span> <span id="s41">Just that.</span> <span id="s42">I did not give them any other possibility of ideology.</span> <span id="s43">Not at all.</span> <span id="s44">They resent simply the Jewish people because of our history, because of our memory, and even because of our suffering.</span> <span id="s45">They envy us our suffering.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: You made the argument that the survivors who did do well, later, after the war, were people who came out of a childhood environment before they went to the camps.</span> <span id="s47">An environment that was predictable, and they felt they had control over their environment, and that their parents gave them a certain degree of ego.</span> <span id="s48">And yet I found a paradoxical argument in going through the literature of “steeled by adversity.”</span> <span id="s49">That certain people who didn’t come from happier circumstances were steeled by their experiences.</span> <span id="s50">And that they survived the experience in part because of that.</span> <span id="s51">I thought of Rabbi Eliyahu, whom you described in Night.</span> <span id="s52">The man always had a kind word for everyone- I wondered what his life was like before.</span> <span id="s53">And, you know, when I did these interviews, I can’t go back into peoples’ pasts.</span> <span id="s54">I mean, if you ask- sit down and ask a person, ‘Was your childhood happy?</span> <span id="s55">Did your father hit you?’</span> <span id="s56">You can’t do this.</span> <span id="s57">You can’t reinvent it.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: Nor am I. I learned not to generalize.</span> <span id="s59">Whatever you said is true.</span> <span id="s60">And the reverse as well.</span> <span id="s61">Of course Frankl’s theory was about meaning, that people had to be communists or religious or something, to believe in something.</span> <span id="s62">I can prove to you, the opposite as well.</span> <span id="s63">I can prove to you that what he says is right.</span> <span id="s64">I mean, that the rabbis who maintained their humanity survived.</span> <span id="s65">I can also show you rabbis who did not survive.</span> <span id="s66">And they were as great believers.</span> <span id="s67">And they let themselves go, rather than fight, rather than work.</span> <span id="s68">I believe there are no theories.</span> <span id="s69">There are no concepts.</span> <span id="s70">There are no systems.</span> <span id="s71">Therefore, Bettleheim is wrong and Frankl is wrong.</span> <span id="s72">They’re all right, but for every theory, I can prove to you the anti-theory.</span> <span id="s73">Now, childhood.</span> <span id="s74">There were children who came from very good families, strong families, good families, civilized families, and yet...I knew a kapo who came from a non-religious background but he behaved like a religious Jew.</span> <span id="s75">And so, everything really, is part of the story, and the story is part of everything.</span> <span id="s76">Do you understand?</span> <span id="s77">I knew one man in Buchenwald who was there I think, twelve years, and he remained a religious Jew.</span> <span id="s78">I’m not sure, that I would have had the strength to remain human.</span> <span id="s79">Maybe after five years, if I had had the choice between becoming a kapo and dying, maybe I would have chosen to be a kapo.</span> <span id="s80">I hope not.</span> <span id="s81">But how can I know?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: You can’t.</span> <span id="s83">You gave the example yourself.</span> <span id="s84">In Night you describe how this Rabbi Eliyahu said, ‘Where’s my son?’</span> <span id="s85">.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: That’s right- exactly.</span> <span id="s87">So, therefore I cannot generalize.</span> <span id="s88">They are all theories that you’re just evoking.</span> <span id="s89">I don’t see that they work.</span> <span id="s90">But they gained because I would like to believe that, in this case, maybe, we defeated the enemy.</span> <span id="s91">Before, the enemy’s purpose really was to see only one, that all the victims looked alike.</span> <span id="s92">And therefore these victims were ageless, faceless, nameless, and they had no private individuality.</span> <span id="s93">To be an individual there was dangerous.</span> <span id="s94">The best way to survive was to plunge into the mass and become anonymous.</span> <span id="s95">And not to look at the S.S. men, hoping that if you don’t look at him, he won’t look at you.</span> <span id="s96">But it is a childish game of, not to see him, is to be unseen.</span> <span id="s97">And just the opposite happened.</span> <span id="s98">In spite of everything, every person responded uniquely.</span> <span id="s99">That means there was something unique left in every person to survive the war.</span> <span id="s100">And one survived because he prayed, and the other one because he refused to pray.</span> <span id="s101">One survived because he was kind, and the other one because he questioned kindness.</span> <span id="s102">One survived because he had his father there, and one because he did not have his father there.</span> <span id="s103">And, it can go to the infinite.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: They have only one theory in sociology that speaks to what you just said.</span> <span id="s105">They call it ‘symbolic interaction,’ which is that every life by definition is unique in every situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: My philosophy is exactly that.</span> <span id="s107">Every life is unique, and therefore, in every suffering, as we see, it is unique.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: I guess though, that I have to try to explain how people could get up and go to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: You cannot, because look, you yourself know the yeshiva world.</span> <span id="s110">You wrote about it.</span> <span id="s111">You wrote well.</span> <span id="s112">The hasidim, if you ask them these questions, they would look at you as crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Indeed they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: They would say: ‘Are you crazy?</span> <span id="s115">Come on.’</span> <span id="s116">That’s nothing.</span> <span id="s117">There were so many churbans (destructions).</span> <span id="s118">And we are here because God wants us to be here, because we are Jews, and we have to survive, and God said ‘we should have children,’ and so we have children, and God says, ‘they should work,’ so we work.</span> <span id="s119">What are you talking about?</span> <span id="s120">They should talk to the many Jewish communists who became communist after the war, especially those who went back.</span> <span id="s121">If you were to have this question with Romania, or Poland let’s say, in 1946, Jews would have a good answer.</span> <span id="s122">They became communist, because they wanted to change the world, or to change society, and they had a purpose, and the purpose was that since Nazism was destroyed.</span> <span id="s123">They wanted to build a new society and so forth.</span> <span id="s124">In 1989, I’m not so sure that all the survivors you met, still remember what they felt in 1945, ’46.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: This is a problem for me.</span> <span id="s126">I know it when I’m asking the question.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Now they are justifying their behavior.</span> <span id="s128">They rationalize it.</span> <span id="s129">I came here in 1956, but I also went to Israel.</span> <span id="s130">In 1949, when I came for the first time to Israel, I was shocked!</span> <span id="s131">Auschwitz was a bad name.</span> <span id="s132">They were all taken for smugglers.</span> <span id="s133">Even today by the way, you say, ‘survivor,’ except in our context.</span> <span id="s134">It is a very bad thing.</span> <span id="s135">‘He is a survivor!’</span> <span id="s136">Meaning somebody who is so manipulative that he or she is a survivor.</span> <span id="s137">This is somebody in the political field; like, ‘He survived three administrations!’</span> <span id="s138">In 1945 and ’46 and ’47, when survivors came here, they didn’t deal with that.</span> <span id="s139">There were no theories then.</span> <span id="s140">Here in America, they were not liked.</span> <span id="s141">And then in 1972, the American Jewish Committee gave me a medal that they generally only give to Supreme Court justices, people like that.</span> <span id="s142">I invited a few of my survivor friends to be there.</span> <span id="s143">But name me one national organization that has a survivor as it’s president?</span> <span id="s144">In ‘A Jew Today.’</span> <span id="s145">I have written a chapter called, “A plea for the Survivors.”</span> <span id="s146">Read what I say there.</span> <span id="s147">They were treated horribly.</span> <span id="s148">At best, they were treated with pity.</span> <span id="s149">That’s all.</span> <span id="s150">So therefore, all they wanted maybe was not to be in touch with the others.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Can I ask you a question about that?</span> <span id="s152">I had written it down, and you just tempt me because it’s right on the subject.</span> <span id="s153">I wrote that in ‘A Jew Today,’ you wrote as follows: “The liberated men and women lead a private existence.</span> <span id="s154">They do not join in our celebrations.</span> <span id="s155">They do not laugh at our jokes.</span> <span id="s156">Their frame of reference is not ours.”</span> <span id="s157">Now it seems, that you said a moment ago, ‘More and more the survivors come out of their private shells.’</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Oh!</span> <span id="s159">This is because there was a change.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: That’s what I wanted to ask you; was it the “Gatherings?”</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: No.</span> <span id="s162">The real change occurred strangely enough, thanks to Carter.</span> <span id="s163">When Carter appointed the President’s Commission, I came to see him, and I didn’t want to accept it at first.</span> <span id="s164">I didn’t want the position.</span> <span id="s165">I- wrote the books not to be a public figure like a president or chairman.</span> <span id="s166">That was not my goal in life.</span> <span id="s167">And he wasn’t used to this.</span> <span id="s168">So he said, ‘No, to being chairman of the President’s Commission?’</span> <span id="s169">I said, ‘No.’</span> <span id="s170">But then survivors began pushing me...’you must accept, you must accept.’</span> <span id="s171">I’m glad I did because finally, I came to Carter and he said, ‘What do you want?</span> <span id="s172">Name your conditions.’</span> <span id="s173">I said, ‘I want, as the first thing, to have every year- a kind of joint session because then it will give respectability to all the other ceremonies.</span> <span id="s174">If the president comes, the senators will come.</span> <span id="s175">If the senators come, the governor will come.</span> <span id="s176">If the governor comes, the President of the Jewish American Committee will come, or the American Jewish Congress, or whatever organization we have in Jewish life, HIAS and so forth.</span> <span id="s177">But the main thing is the President.</span> <span id="s178">He accepted.</span> <span id="s179">The President’s Commission on the Holocaust changed things.</span> <span id="s180">It became honorable.</span> <span id="s181">But it was also political.</span> <span id="s182">I said to him, ‘Maybe you will be remembered because of that’.</span> <span id="s183">And it gave the survivors respectability.</span> <span id="s184">At one point, you know, I decided that no one could be chairman of any committee unless he or she is a survivor.</span> <span id="s185">I was under pressure from everybody else.</span> <span id="s186">The Poles, the Ukrainians, and the non-survivor Jews.</span> <span id="s187">Who lit candles?</span> <span id="s188">Survivors have to light, nobody else.</span> <span id="s189">Senators?</span> <span id="s190">Can you imagine, a survivor is more important than, a senator.</span> <span id="s191">That’s how I wanted it.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: I thing one thing builds on the others.</span> <span id="s193">When five survivors start speaking to high school groups, another ten say, ‘I can do it too.’</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: That’s how it goes.</span> <span id="s195">Also, look, it has an effect on television.</span> <span id="s196">All of a sudden the Holocaust became a fashionable thing- to my regret, by the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: You mean like Gerald Green?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: Yes, the kitch, sentimental soap operas.</span> <span id="s199">But it’s there!</span> <span id="s200">That means that television is asking.</span> <span id="s201">But to think that I should allow one of my books to become a TV show- I had, you know, offers.</span> <span id="s202">Orson Welles wanted to do Night for the movies.</span> <span id="s203">And since then, who didn’t!</span> <span id="s204">Nothing doing.</span> <span id="s205">NONE of my books on the Holocaust can be touched, should become movies or theatres.</span> <span id="s206">No way!</span> <span id="s207">I don’t believe it can be combined.</span> <span id="s208">It is something pure.</span> <span id="s209">It cannot be treated as, as theatre, OR as a movie or television.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Is there something though, that you think always remains private?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: It remains private, but words are being said and uttered.</span> <span id="s212">And more silence is needed to feel that.</span> <span id="s213">I wrote so little about the Holocaust, because I wanted to preserve that “zone of silence”.</span> <span id="s214">But you know, the problem is that the survivors are human, and because they were deprived they like it, which is their prerogative.</span> <span id="s215">I’ll give you an example.</span> <span id="s216">During the Bitberg affair, I wanted the entire council to resign- the President would not have accepted our resignation, and you cannot lose.</span> <span id="s217">The President CANNOT afford to have an ENTIRE council to resign.</span> <span id="s218">You cannot!</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Yes, it’s not like the Jerusalem Post-.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: Exactly!</span> <span id="s221">You cannot.</span> <span id="s222">I said, ‘Look, let’s resign.</span> <span id="s223">At least, in the future history books, there will be one line that at one point, when the President compared the victims to the executioners ‘Who lay there,’ he said, ‘were as much victims as those who were in the concentration camps, how can we not resign?’</span> <span id="s224">But most survivors refused.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: They like the limelight.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: They like the limelight.</span> <span id="s227">And they had all kinds of arguments saying: ‘We can do more here.’</span> <span id="s228">Nonsense.</span> <span id="s229">Nonsense.</span> <span id="s230">The moral basis is gone.</span> <span id="s231">What do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: In my opinion, the words that will be remembered is ‘Your place is not here!’</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: They liked it!</span> <span id="s234">They liked it!</span> <span id="s235">And that’s bad, but it’s human.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: You know, I’ve come across this in my work, the whole politics of the survivors’ organizations, the societies.</span> <span id="s237">One man spent a good deal of time defending himself to me against charges that he was a kapo.</span> <span id="s238">He was on an opposition slate in one of the societies.</span> <span id="s239">And these people called him a ‘kapo’.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: I hear...and I don’t want to hear.</span> <span id="s241">But, you cannot not hear...the sin of hatred...</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: I know that a lot of the Hungarian Jews are Hasidim, but why is it that in the survivors’ organizations- most of them are Polish.</span> <span id="s243">Where are the secular Hungarian survivors like Alex Gross of Atlanta, people like that.</span> <span id="s244">Where are they?</span> <span id="s245">Why aren’t there just as many of them on the boards, and involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: Hungarian Jews are ultra-hasidic, like the Satmar; they’re not involved.</span> <span id="s247">Or even not Satmar.</span> <span id="s248">Let’s say, Menashe Klein.</span> <span id="s249">And the secular ones, many don’t speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s250">They’re assimilated Hungarian Jews.</span> <span id="s251">They speak Hungarian.</span> <span id="s252">But can you imagine a Hungarian Jew coming to speak Hungarian, in this crowd?</span> <span id="s253">(of Polish survivors).</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: They wouldn’t let him into the card game.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: (laughs).</span> <span id="s256">What is the reason for it?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Many Hungarian Jews stayed behind until ’56.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: It’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: People learned about other destructions before the war, Etruscans, Armenians, and yet the Holocaust happened.</span> <span id="s260">That being the case, I find myself wondering what good will it do to have these museums and monuments.</span> <span id="s261">And if not that, what can you do?</span> <span id="s262">- A” There was a time when I believed that museums were important because it’s the 20th century and image-oriented, museum oriented.</span> <span id="s263">Now the question that you ask is ‘how come we didn’t KNOW what was happening since we read all the books.’</span> <span id="s264">I say this event was a unique event.</span> <span id="s265">And this cannot compare to anything else.</span> <span id="s266">It should relate to everything else, but not be compared to anything else.</span> <span id="s267">The truth is that there is much anger that one day will come out.</span> <span id="s268">I learned a lot about the American Jewish leadership at that time, about solidarity.</span> <span id="s269">What vacation was cancelled then, or simply delayed.</span> <span id="s270">You open up the Jewish press at the time, and you will see, “Come to the Catskills.”</span> <span id="s271">I’ll tell the story of an Israeli officer.</span> <span id="s272">A major or colonel who came here to do his PhD.</span> <span id="s273">On the American Jewish press during the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s274">And he lost his mind.</span> <span id="s275">He had to be institutionalized.</span> <span id="s276">He said, ‘I don’t understand it.</span> <span id="s277">On the front page of the Forwards, you read about the extermination of Jews, and on the second page it says, ‘Come to the Catskills.’</span> <span id="s278">You have a good comedian and so forth.</span> <span id="s279">‘You will enjoy the Catskills.’</span> <span id="s280">He said, ‘How, how is it possible?’</span> <span id="s281">Now he should know that the American press, the non-Jewish press, also reported it: not well, but reported it.</span> <span id="s282">All these Jews, when they read about Bialystok, there must have been Jews reading who had family in Bialystok.</span> <span id="s283">What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">QL: There’s no answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: That’s for right now.</span> <span id="s286">I wrote a piece for Commentary magazine.</span> <span id="s287">Go and judge other people.</span> <span id="s288">But you cannot judge other people, unless you start judging yourself.</span> <span id="s289">There is so much anger.</span> <span id="s290">Which one day will come out.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: It’s very disturbing to me, to hear you say this, because you know when you write, or when you work in anything, that, you know you like to think that you have some kind of purpose, some kind of a goal in mind.</span> <span id="s292">And it sounds like what you could say from this, if you can’t answer the ‘Why’ that it’s like 40 years later, you learned nothing, you forgot everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: Well we won’t let it be forgotten.</span> <span id="s294">But the fact is that the important thing is that you don’t know about it.</span> <span id="s295">And if I didn’t tell you, you wouldn’t know about it.</span> <span id="s296">But that the Jewish people who were in Europe were abandoned by their own brothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Is it possible that this will happen again?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: well, how could it happen?</span> <span id="s299">Who will abandon them?</span> <span id="s300">Now look, the Russian Jews were abandoned, too.</span> <span id="s301">Look, in 1965, when I came back from the Soviet Union, and I went around urging the American Jewish community, the French Jewish community, the British, I went all over the world.</span> <span id="s302">And- and all of those Jewish communities were in the free world.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Well, I read The Jews of Silence and it was very, very clear to me.</span> <span id="s304">But what assurance is it to me today?</span> <span id="s305">People say: ‘Oh we wouldn’t let it happen again.’</span> <span id="s306">When I look at how Jews are acting.</span> <span id="s307">I travel, I’m involved in my own community; I see the same selfishness.</span> <span id="s308">I see the same patterns of human nature.</span> <span id="s309">Can we hope that by educating people we can bring up a generation of people who will reject that approach?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Because you and I are teaching something.</span> <span id="s311">You must believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: I say that to myself, but I mean...</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: That’s what we say.</span> <span id="s314">In spite of it.</span> <span id="s315">And among my favorite words are, ‘and yet.’</span> <span id="s316">And yet, we have no choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: I say, I say to people, ‘If I can reach three people in my class.’</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: One, let’s say one.</span> <span id="s319">Let’s say one is enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: One is enough.</span> <span id="s321">You know, in ‘Night’ you asked a question.</span> <span id="s322">You asked it in the beginning of the book, and you asked it towards the end of it.</span> <span id="s323">How could Jews, you know, the person started saying kaddish, and you said, ‘How can Jews bless God’s name.</span> <span id="s324">What do I have to thank him for.’</span> <span id="s325">How are you going to explain the fact that hundreds of thousands of survivors today still bless God’s name after what happened?</span> <span id="s326">When you talk to Menashe Klein, for example.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s328">But, you know after the Holocaust I had problems because of it.</span> <span id="s329">After the war.</span> <span id="s330">Not during.</span> <span id="s331">Not during.</span> <span id="s332">During the war I went on davening.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: I remember what you wrote about Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s335">But I davened every day.</span> <span id="s336">That was it.</span> <span id="s337">Somehow, how, in Buna, that was Auschwitz 3, a pair of tefilin was smuggled in; and Menashe too, we got up every morning and we stood in line just to say the bracha.</span> <span id="s338">In Auschwitz, which is crazy.</span> <span id="s339">I think about this today and I say, ‘It was crazy!’</span> <span id="s340">According to the Halacha we didn’t have to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: And why did you think you did it?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: Because it was a shelter.</span> <span id="s343">I mean it linked me; it was a link to my home, to my childhood.</span> <span id="s344">I did it since bar mitzvah and I did it again.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: You know, I must tell you something.</span> <span id="s346">It is so interesting to hear this.</span> <span id="s347">Among the group of Orthodox Jews that I interviewed, I find very few of them, and we’re being candid, that really believe in everything, but when I ask them why they do it, they tell me ‘It’s my community.’</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: During the war,- there was no problem.</span> <span id="s349">I had my father there; there was no problem.</span> <span id="s350">My crisis occurred much later, actually, in 1948.</span> <span id="s351">Until then, I went back to a religious life which was as the one that I had left at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: The one from the yeshiva?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: I began studying again Gemorah and Tosafot right away.</span> <span id="s354">And, I went on studying.</span> <span id="s355">And, what kept me, really, is my passion for study.</span> <span id="s356">I NEVER stopped studying.</span> <span id="s357">My passion is to go on studying all the time.</span> <span id="s358">Even when I had my crisis, about belief and emunah, and so forth.</span> <span id="s359">Even then, I always said, ‘okay, I’m studying; why is the Gemorah shuldig (guilty)?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: You know, the idea that you said before, about uniqueness.</span> <span id="s361">I heard on one hand, people say, only the tough ones, those who looked out for number one, survived.</span> <span id="s362">I heard this from the survivors, and I heard it from others.</span> <span id="s363">I also heard that only those who made friends and cooperated survived.</span> <span id="s364">It seems to me that maybe just, from such a broad expanse-.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: All of them are correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Different people have different experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: All of them are correct, and all are wrong.</span> <span id="s368">I surely was not strong.</span> <span id="s369">Logically, you should know, logically, I was the first candidate to die.</span> <span id="s370">I was really sick at home.</span> <span id="s371">When I was a child, I was one boy and three sisters.</span> <span id="s372">One younger, and two older.</span> <span id="s373">And therefore, you know, one boy, a religious family.</span> <span id="s374">I’d go to big cities only because my mother took me to doctors.</span> <span id="s375">I think I learned myself, I was always sick.</span> <span id="s376">Second, I’m always frightened, I never did ANYTHING in those years!</span> <span id="s377">I was afraid.</span> <span id="s378">So, I was the perfect candidate to die- and then there were strong guys, you know, who dared, and who pushed themselves, they didn’t survive and I did.</span> <span id="s379">Strength doesn’t mean anything.</span> <span id="s380">The other thing is I was very close to my father.</span> <span id="s381">As long as my father was with me in Auschwitz, okay, I helped him, he helped me.</span> <span id="s382">In Buchenwald, he was no longer with me.</span> <span id="s383">So, between January, and t’bshevat, the end, I was alone.</span> <span id="s384">I didn’t have a SINGLE friend.</span> <span id="s385">I didn’t speak to anyone.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: You didn’t find anyone that you knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: I didn’t want to find anybody.</span> <span id="s388">I didn’t know anybody.</span> <span id="s389">I didn’t find anybody.</span> <span id="s390">Because of my father.</span> <span id="s391">My father died after that.</span> <span id="s392">I remained an orphan- I was numb.</span> <span id="s393">I had the feeling that I didn’t live.</span> <span id="s394">So, you cannot make any theory out of it.</span> <span id="s395">I think what you are going to find out, in all of your studies here, is that the sociologists sometimes are wrong.</span> <span id="s396">There IS no sociological theory.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Oh, I think I’ve already concluded that.</span> <span id="s398">They’re going to be very unhappy.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: Absolutely nothing then.</span> <span id="s400">That means you couldn’t say “You do this, and then you live.’</span> <span id="s401">You couldn’t.</span> <span id="s402">Because it didn’t work.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: When I interviewed people, I found that many of the people I spoke to told me ‘I survived by luck.’</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s405">Not even through a (miracle) I cannot stand the word ‘miracle.’</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: Because of it’s implications?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Very strong implications.</span> <span id="s408">Because if it’s a miracle for me, why wasn’t there a miracle for the others?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: You know what really bothers me, when people tell me, ‘Oh, we had the diamonds hidden in the tire and it was a miracle that we survived.’</span> <span id="s410">And I’m thinking that people lost their lives and God paid attention to your diamonds?</span> <span id="s411">However, I have to say this, that I qualify the ‘luck’ as taking advantage of circumstances.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: No, I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: Well, I think that this one case where-.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: But you did something.</span> <span id="s416">You didn’t passively exist.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: Because of my father.</span> <span id="s418">My father did something.</span> <span id="s419">Not I. My main thing was not to leave my father.</span> <span id="s420">And then he left me.</span> <span id="s421">There is no way of explaining anything.</span> <span id="s422">Again, for some people it worked.</span> <span id="s423">For some people it was the opposite.</span> <span id="s424">Some people did do something and because they did, they died.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: I’ve gone over it, I can’t tell you, I mean, I spent 80 hours just thinking about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: It defeats all- all systems.</span> <span id="s427">It becomes a burden for me, meaning, you cannot say if you do this, you live.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: No, what I have to say is this: You can’t judge it.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: You cannot judge.</span> <span id="s430">Of course not.</span> <span id="s431">You cannot judge.</span> <span id="s432">Because, what do you mean, ‘those survived,’ Always remember, there were a million and a half children.</span> <span id="s433">What could they do?</span> <span id="s434">And then, tell me, the parents, the parents of children- how about the old people?</span> <span id="s435">And the sick people.</span> <span id="s436">They never had the opportunity.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Let’s say that there’s no pattern.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: No pattern.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: How about after having gone through it, by chance?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: You mean, after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: After the war most people wanted, especially young people, to go back, to what you mentioned.</span> <span id="s443">There was a cobbler, and somehow the son had something to do with shoes, and the father was an industrialist, somehow the son will be a doctor and so forth.</span> <span id="s444">Go in his footsteps.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: A man from Munkatch, his name was Morris Rubin; he lives in Woodmere.</span> <span id="s446">He told me ‘Every time I give money to a yeshiva, I feel that my parents are still living, because I know that’s what they would have wanted me to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Yes, and that makes sense- I don’t even know if I am right.</span> <span id="s448">I know that the others are wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: If we talk about after the war, do you see the children of the survivors as a definite group?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: Afterwards they will continue as their parents when you take on such luggage.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: I have found tremendous variation among the children.</span> <span id="s452">Researchers wanted to research and categorize everybody and say: ‘The Concentration Camp Survivor Syndrome’ carried on to the second generation.’</span> <span id="s453">Doesn’t it turn you off?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s455">Turns me off, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: But I’m hoping-.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: And yet, I speak so much about madness.</span> <span id="s458">But I speak about mystical madness, not about clinical madness.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: You are in touch with many people who are survivors.</span> <span id="s460">Do you find that there’s a coming to terms (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s462">They remember their parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: Now that the children have grown and they’re retired, you find that they tend to think in terms of handing over a legacy.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: First of all, I mentioned, you know, even at the bonds dinner, I said I would like to have a fund to publish all of these books.</span> <span id="s465">I am serious.</span> <span id="s466">I’m going to speak about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Let me just ask you one final question.</span> <span id="s468">There were more that I would ask, but-.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: We’ll continue another time.</span> <span id="s470">You’ll come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: I have to digest it.</span> <span id="s472">There are a couple of things that fly in the face of some of the things I was thinking about and I have to go through it.</span> <span id="s473">I have to mull it over.</span> <span id="s474">You know what I’ve been doing, and you took a look today at some of the things, is there anything that you think I ought to be focusing on, given the nature of my topic?</span> <span id="s475">Because now I am preparing to write, and now I know that I will discard certain things.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: My feeling is, that you should restore the dignity of these people, in their own minds.</span> <span id="s477">They have not spoken, but they were ashamed.</span> <span id="s478">How can a father who is the authority in the eye of a child, the child reads about him and is visualizing, that he is shamed and humiliated living in dirt.</span> <span id="s479">Rather we should say that what you have lived through makes you into princes of this world.</span> <span id="s480">And the world should look at you like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">END OF SIDE ONE.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">END OF INTERVIEW.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s484">PAGE 1</span></p> <p><span id="s485">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s486">PAGE 1</span></p></body></html>
