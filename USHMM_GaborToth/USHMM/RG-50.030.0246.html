Waterford.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: What was your date of birth?</span> <span id="s14">A: April 14th, 1909.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: And where were you born, Helen?</span> <span id="s16">A: In Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: Helen, tell me about your childhood?</span> <span id="s18">Can we talk about that for awhile?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s20">My...I was born in a..</span> <span id="s21">.</span> <span id="s22">in a smaller town across the river from Frankfurt on the Rhine.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">And when I was about 3 or 4 years old, my parents moved to Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s24">It was very unfortunate that, uh, my father was born in Lithuania and had difficulty to get permission to stay in Germany in Offenbach.</span> <span id="s25">I do not know why.</span> <span id="s26">I only know that we had to move to Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s27">1914, the first World War started.</span> <span id="s28">I was 5 years old and the laws in Germany are still the same, that the wife and the offspring takes the, uh, well, is is the same citizen of a country as a father.</span> <span id="s29">So my mother, who was German...her family was there for centuries....and I, we became all of a sudden Russians because Lithuania belonged to Russia at the time.</span> <span id="s30">And as Russians, we were the enemies of Germany, and we would have been interned if we couldn't live with my grandparents who at this time came from a very small town in Germany...in Germany.</span> <span id="s31">They're quite old.</span> <span id="s32">We thought at that time old.</span> <span id="s33">And, uh, my aunt, my mother's sister, had taken them in into their building and so we shared their quarters.</span> <span id="s34">And we were not register...registered at the police which meant like living underground, illegally.</span> <span id="s35">All this naturally was not told to me.</span> <span id="s36">I was much too small to understand that, but I do know that when I was 6 years old, I was supposed to go to school, and it was not possible to go to a public school because my citizenship was Russian.</span> <span id="s37">And, uh, there was a Jewish school, an excellent Jewish school, liberal, and my mother talked to the director and he understood and let me come in without birth certificate or whatever.</span> <span id="s38">That was the school I started when I was 6.</span> <span id="s39">It was absolutely a fantastic school as I found out later in the years.</span> <span id="s40">And, um, it was so broad-minded and we learned so, so...everything so much, uh, so directly, so uh intensively.</span> <span id="s41">The school was in two buildings and were connected.</span> <span id="s42">One were girls and one were boys.</span> <span id="s43">And, uh, it did not happen before we were maybe 13 or 14 that we were brought together with the boys.</span> <span id="s44">Even some of them naturally one had already seen, and, eh, in between the hours, but boys and girls in the same class at the same age were taken by the teachers to outings, which I thought was a very good idea and everybody liked it.</span> <span id="s45">Uh, I was in this school until I was 18 years old.</span> <span id="s46">Because when I was 16 and I thought it was the end, they added the three classes that you could go in there if you wanted to go to the university...you wanted to go on.</span> <span id="s47">That's what I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Helen, what was it like growing up as a Jewish child?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: I couldn't tell you, because I thought everybody was Jewish.</span> <span id="s50">In some way I was not aware that the children I was playing on the streets with were neighbors that they were not Jewish, because all the children I knew were Jewish.</span> <span id="s51">Frankfurt is a big city and, uh, was a big city at that time too.</span> <span id="s52">It...I was...I was thinking I was living in a Jewish world.</span> <span id="s53">We were not that very religious.</span> <span id="s54">We were liberals, as it was called in Germany.</span> <span id="s55">And my parents went to the high holidays to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s56">We didn't live far from synagogue and, uh, there was no Sunday school because most of the things we had in school.</span> <span id="s57">We had very little Hebrew lessons, but we did uh have the Rabbi teaching us the history of the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: I understand you were married in 1933?</span> <span id="s59">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Would you tell me about your husband and the circumstances of your marriage?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Oh, I..</span> <span id="s62">.</span> <span id="s63">In 1933, I got married.</span> <span id="s64">I met...I met him the year before, but I, uh, I had.</span> <span id="s65">.</span> <span id="s66">I had to work uh besides going to school, to finance it.</span> <span id="s67">There were no loans at this time, and my parents were not that happily financially to afford that.</span> <span id="s68">And I, it came out, I made very good money, so I was in a situation to support myself and help my parents.</span> <span id="s69">So I decided I wouldn't get married.</span> <span id="s70">Why should I get married?</span> <span id="s71">I saw no reasons.</span> <span id="s72">And, uh...I had a boyfriend because just everybody had to have a boyfriend.</span> <span id="s73">It was the, uh, style.</span> <span id="s74">But, uh, all of a sudden...I had known him from school as I said in this school where we were.</span> <span id="s75">The school's name is Philanthropin, if somebody would ever hear that.</span> <span id="s76">Phianthropin was unique and, um, it was a shame that it didn't never come back in any shape or form.</span> <span id="s77">Uh...I decided I didn't want to get married.</span> <span id="s78">After he did not want to get married to me, so I was jilted...and the sour grapes, were I don't get married.</span> <span id="s79">And I could travel, and I was traveling to, um, um, to the seashore.</span> <span id="s80">There was an islandwhere most of the people who came there in summer were Jewish because the next island did not allow Jews.</span> <span id="s81">So the Jews had their own places, and so that's where I went.</span> <span id="s82">And on the second day I was there, I met the man I married later.I did not want even to talk to him because he thought...he looked as if he was 18 years old.</span> <span id="s83">I was 23 already.</span> <span id="s84">I was absolutely not interested, but he was very persistent and I found out that he was 28 so that made things a little easier.</span> <span id="s85">(laughs) And he came also from Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s86">So we got married after Hitler took power, which was in January 30th, 1933.</span> <span id="s87">He had lost already his job and we...but I still had my income, and we got married with the intention to leave the country.</span> <span id="s88">We were married by the way by the Orthodox Rabbi who married my parents and his parents.</span> <span id="s89">And, um, we left Germany in 1934 going to Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">1 Norderney, one of the German Frisian islands in the North Sea.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">2 Siegfried Wohlfarth.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: What happened next?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Now, the trip to Holland...the preparations of leaving Germany at that time so very early was a little different than it became later.</span> <span id="s94">We could took take everything with us.</span> <span id="s95">And he had a job there.</span> <span id="s96">He was a CPA.</span> <span id="s97">He had gotten a job there.</span> <span id="s98">I couldn't work there - didn't get any permit, being not Dutch.</span> <span id="s99">And, uh, I tried to learn the language which is um not so easy.</span> <span id="s100">It is more of a throat thickness, it seemed to me, than a language.</span> <span id="s101">I got used to it because I wanted to speak it.</span> <span id="s102">I wanted to make friends, and I had nothing to do.</span> <span id="s103">I started without really, uh, thinking about - it a business.</span> <span id="s104">I . . .Now, at first I have to say I got pregnant, and we found out that we would have a very hard time to live on the salary he had and ...with a child you know.</span> <span id="s105">So I want...I had to think of something...how to make some money to make it easier.</span> <span id="s106">So I was helping the people who moved to Holland from Germany to settle down and I did everything they would need to uh find a place to live, to furnish the place, because they had...mostly couldn't bring much furniture anymore.</span> <span id="s107">I wanted to make it easier for them, and I wanted to make some money on it.</span> <span id="s108">Which I did.</span> <span id="s109">It developed later in a .</span> <span id="s110">.</span> <span id="s111">into.</span> <span id="s112">.</span> <span id="s113">an interior decorator business and the people I had as customers before told it to other people, and it was very successful.</span> <span id="s114">But that was 37, that's when my daughter was born.</span> <span id="s115">Then, in 1938, came the uh the night of the broken glass, on November 9th, and, uh, my mother called from Frankfurt and told me that my father and my brother were arrested and uh, what we could do.</span> <span id="s116">Now my father had been arrested a few months before, and we got him a visa to come to Holland.</span> <span id="s117">It was very difficult, but when he had the visa he did decide not to go.</span> <span id="s118">He was convinced without any...he couldn't yet even say why...that uh it would be over soon, and there was no reason for him to leave Germany.</span> <span id="s119">So he stayed.</span> <span id="s120">My brother was 18 years old and, uh, he was arrested.</span> <span id="s121">And he came to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s122">But when my father was arrested, the man who looked at his passport, the stateless one, and he saw he had a visa to come to Holland and he said to him, "You're an idiot that you stayed here.</span> <span id="s123">I'll take your passport.</span> <span id="s124">I'll meet you tomorrow morning on the train to Amsterdam."</span> <span id="s125">And this my mother told me that he was coming the next day.</span> <span id="s126">My brother and my brother-in-law, my husband's brother, we all got them out to Holland or to England, where we had relatives and we couldn't go.</span> <span id="s127">And the the invasion came to Holland, which was in May of 1940, my parents, all of them, all of this family, was already in the United States.</span> <span id="s128">And we had no chance!</span> <span id="s129">My father, as uh the man from, you know, from Russia, he uh could have...he could come into the United States on a visa from this part because at that time there was nobody using a visa to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s130">If they would have had to wait for a German visa, I mean German bek, they would have never made it because the United States did not give all the visas they legally were obliged and was as possible to give, but they only gave half or less.</span> <span id="s131">So...so I..</span> <span id="s132">.</span> <span id="s133">this way my father, my mother, and my brother got into the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: Where?</span> <span id="s136">What?</span> <span id="s137">What I did do at what time?</span> <span id="s138">Q: When you were in Holland at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: No.</span> <span id="s140">I don't.</span> <span id="s141">.</span> <span id="s142">I never got...I told you I was working as an interior decorator.</span> <span id="s143">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: And that was over the moment Hitler came.</span> <span id="s145">Nothing doing.</span> <span id="s146">Hoping that we would get out, but which was not possible.</span> <span id="s147">So we, uh...we were waiting what the Nazis were doing.</span> <span id="s148">My husband had just lost his job right away, and our child was three years old when the Nazis came and was five years old when we got the order to um appear at the train station in Amsterdam at 1:30 at night to allow us to bring one suitcase a person and the key to the house.</span> <span id="s149">This was a . . .a strange order.</span> <span id="s150">We didn't understand what really would happen to us, and all our friends came and we gathered in the house and talked- "What shall we do?"</span> <span id="s151">All the same age.</span> <span id="s152">We were five couples.</span> <span id="s153">We all had come from Germany, and each of us had a little girl about the same age.</span> <span id="s154">From all those people, all those couples with each one child, the only one who came back...the only ones who were alive was one man, was my daughter and me.</span> <span id="s155">We lost them all.</span> <span id="s156">And, uh, we...my husband and I, we decided we go to the Jewish Council.</span> <span id="s157">I assume you are familiar with what the Jewish Council was in each city.</span> <span id="s158">So in Amsterdam was a very large Jewish Council and we bought our order and asked, "What is this?</span> <span id="s159">Where are we going?</span> <span id="s160">What does it mean?"</span> <span id="s161">And we were...we were not the only ones who came.</span> <span id="s162">Everybody was confused.</span> <span id="s163">And uh we were told that we were going to a family camp to work and that we should take our children.</span> <span id="s164">We hadn't asked about children, but they said, "Take your children because they will be taken care of while you work."</span> <span id="s165">We left this building and I decided to tell my husband that I am not for going on the July 15th to get that train.</span> <span id="s166">And we, being brought up in Germany, which is a little different than other countries um had a hard time to accept that.</span> <span id="s167">My husband said, "We cannot do that.</span> <span id="s168">This is an order, black and white.</span> <span id="s169">Who knows what they will do to us if we don't go?"</span> <span id="s170">I said, "Who knows what they do to us when we are going?</span> <span id="s171">We don't know.</span> <span id="s172">We don't know where we are going.</span> <span id="s173">And why?</span> <span id="s174">Because Jewish, but (cough) what other reason?"</span> <span id="s175">So we decided that my husband should get a surgery to give us some time.</span> <span id="s176">And he found a willing doctor to take out (cough, cough.)</span> <span id="s177">excuse me...to take out his appendix which was very healthy.</span> <span id="s178">So we got two weeks that he could recover and then we would be getting another order.</span> <span id="s179">In those two weeks I've heard that everybody who is working in any capacity for the Jewish Council would get a stamp and a paper that they are at this moment free of deport. . .deportation and so I got a job as a cook in an old people's home.</span> <span id="s180">I worked there from 7 in the morning.</span> <span id="s181">I cooked for everybody.</span> <span id="s182">There were 40 people there.</span> <span id="s183">And I..</span> <span id="s184">.</span> <span id="s185">if...if .</span> <span id="s186">.</span> <span id="s187">they paid me five-something like five dollars a week it was a lot.</span> <span id="s188">Anyway, I worked there.</span> <span id="s189">.</span> <span id="s190">I worked there maybe six weeks.</span> <span id="s191">I.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">.</span> <span id="s193">.</span> <span id="s194">I really can't say.</span> <span id="s195">In the meantime, my husband had recovered and uh still we did need somebody at home that my daughter was not even 5 years old.</span> <span id="s196">Somebody had to be there since I was practically gone all the time, and, uh, the day I came...I came one morning and the doors were open, and the whole place was in a terrible condition and everybody was gone, and most of them were on stretchers.</span> <span id="s197">It was a weary feeling.</span> <span id="s198">The people were all financially in a very good shape.</span> <span id="s199">I don't know what was lying around or so or what they took.</span> <span id="s200">I run out of the house because I thought, "Maybe there's some of those guys left, and then they'll take me."</span> <span id="s201">And they were all gone.</span> <span id="s202">So then I was sure, it was not work we were sent to when they take those old people.</span> <span id="s203">But we had no other way to go any place because we were not allowed to be on the street at night.</span> <span id="s204">We had to wear.</span> <span id="s205">.</span> <span id="s206">wear our star.</span> <span id="s207">We uh could not take public transportation.</span> <span id="s208">We had to walk wherever we were going in this big city.</span> <span id="s209">We, uh, had special hours of purchasing our food.</span> <span id="s210">Everything was very, very difficult so you had no telephone any more.</span> <span id="s211">You had no connection.</span> <span id="s212">You just...that's a feeling...so we stay home and they will probably pick us up.</span> <span id="s213">That's all we can do.</span> <span id="s214">In...</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: Helen, would you like to take some water?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: Ja.</span> <span id="s217">Maybe.</span> <span id="s218">(drinks water) Ja.</span> <span id="s219">Early October, 1942, a very close friend of ours, we knew him for many years and, was a neighbor and, was one of those couples.</span> <span id="s220">This was a man who lived through it.</span> <span id="s221">He came and he said...he was married to a school friend of mine.</span> <span id="s222">I got them together.</span> <span id="s223">It was wonderful.</span> <span id="s224">So he said that he had somebody who was helping them to live underground and their child would be in a different place if we would like to consider that.</span> <span id="s225">Naturally, we said...and though...and the next day this man came to us.</span> <span id="s226">His name was Joe Vis.He is the...the Gentile who is named with all the others who were helping me in my book.</span> <span id="s227">It's really written for them.</span> <span id="s228">He [Jo] came and said that they were all blue collar workers and they belonged to uh a very liberal small church.</span> <span id="s229">They didn't have much money, but they wanted to help as much as they could and they said, "It is easier if you are not together with your child, because she cannot stay inside what you have to do.</span> <span id="s230">We do not know how long the war will be.</span> <span id="s231">We have a place for a child if you want to give her up.</span> <span id="s232">I would suggest you do."</span> <span id="s233">We certainly agreed, and a few days later he came back with a couple.We did not know their name and we did not know where they were living.</span> <span id="s234">We found out after the war that this woman was his sister, but we didn't know.</span> <span id="s235">And they came Sunday afternoon and we walked together to the street car with my daughter and gave it to her...to them.</span> <span id="s236">And, uh, we...this man, Joe Vis, he had the days before already with his wife everyday picked up things for Doris, my daughter, toys, her bed, her doll house...was there waiting for her, and, uh, he said, "Maybe in a few weeks we will have something for you too.</span> <span id="s237">It's more difficult to get two people a home again."</span> <span id="s238">So...he...but he got it.</span> <span id="s239">About three or four weeks later he came and he had a placeand we, uh, he uh...we had two metal beds, so he took those two and brought it where we were going because the people had no beds for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">And some pillow cases and so on.</span> <span id="s241">But I have to say in 1941, one year before, my husband who was very far thinking had said, "You know, we should prepare our child that she's not depending on us.</span> <span id="s242">We don't know - maybe there will be a transport for children to the United States, which never happened because United States did not take the 20,000 children they want to send.</span> <span id="s243">Or to England.</span> <span id="s244">We should be uh less warm with her, that she will never miss us.</span> <span id="s245">No hugging, no kissing.</span> <span id="s246">But she should be...it should be easier for her not to miss us.</span> <span id="s247">And 3 Joe Vis and his wife, Agaat, were instrumental in aiding Helen and Sigfried.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">4 Dirk and Stien DeBoers.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">5 In Zaandam, an industrial town located just outside Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">that's what we started, a year before.</span> <span id="s251">Also, another friendtook from our house things we thought maybe we should put away.</span> <span id="s252">He offered it.</span> <span id="s253">And we gave him all our books.</span> <span id="s254">It was the most important thing.</span> <span id="s255">And the typewriter.</span> <span id="s256">But also silver and clothes and bed sheets and shoes and all those things.</span> <span id="s257">We had no idea what he would do with it.</span> <span id="s258">We did not ask.</span> <span id="s259">And uh so when when we left the house and to go into this illegal place there was furniture and all that was there.</span> <span id="s260">And we very optimistic.</span> <span id="s261">We even paid the rent for this apartment until we found out that the Germans had emptied it completely, which was maybe eight months after that.</span> <span id="s262">And, uh, the, uh...this man who took all our things, we had a contract with him that he had bought our furniture and that he had paid us so much for the furniture that and he got a receipt from the Germans that they had taken out the furniture that belonged to him, and when the war was over, he got the money.He'd give to us, because that wasn't a serious contract.</span> <span id="s263">It wasn't true.</span> <span id="s264">He hadn't bought it.</span> <span id="s265">But the furniture and everything was gone naturally.</span> <span id="s266">And, uh, we were living underground from October 1942 til August 1944 in different homes because people got very scared very often.</span> <span id="s267">Sometimes wanted us to leave the same day.</span> <span id="s268">Some places we were two or three months until they got so scared.</span> <span id="s269">The place where we were last [Haarlem] we were eleven months and we thought for sure this will bring us to the end because by that time the uh Allies already had invaded in France and things looked very good.</span> <span id="s270">Thinking in two, three weeks they must be in Holland and then in August...on August 26, 1944, the day that Paris was liberated by the Allies, that was the day we were arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: What happened after your arrest, Helen?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: The uh the people in whose house we lived...she was uh a woman with three teenage daughters.</span> <span id="s273">Her husband, as she said, had left...left her when the youngest one was born.</span> <span id="s274">She did not have much money, and, uh, the girls were very nice.</span> <span id="s275">She was okay.</span> <span id="s276">She...she prepared our dinner and...cause this is something very important...how one lives.</span> <span id="s277">Two people alone in a room for such a long time.</span> <span id="s278">She prepared our dinner, and we had the, uh, coupons that she could buy food because without the coupons you couldn't live.</span> <span id="s279">Our friends from this church came every second Saturday and brought us coupons.</span> <span id="s280">The coupons were stolen every month in the distribution centers by another person.</span> <span id="s281">All around Holland for the 20,000 people in Holland who were hiding.</span> <span id="s282">When the war was over, it was only 10,000.</span> <span id="s283">The others were found.</span> <span id="s284">And uh they brought us everything we wanted.</span> <span id="s285">Any book and we just had to write it down and they tried to get us the books and they brought it.</span> <span id="s286">And they told us also what, how the war was going because we were cut off from the world because they were listening to the BBC.</span> <span id="s287">If you are caught to listen to the BBC in London, you were executed.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">6 Ab Reusink.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">7 Two years and several months later, when a special department of the occupational forces arrived, Ab Reusink protested that Helen and Seigfried's furniture were his belongings.</span> <span id="s290">Reusink produced the three-year-old contract that he had drawn up originally.</span> <span id="s291">Thus, the Germans paid Reusink the amount of the contract, which he then turned over to Helen and Seigfried.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">They did it, and they told us what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s293">What was going on and how well we were doing, we heard it from them.</span> <span id="s294">They also told us in July of 1944, that there were six extermination camps only in Poland.</span> <span id="s295">Only.</span> <span id="s296">And there was one...it was the largest one.</span> <span id="s297">It was Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s298">And by that time two million Jews already had been gassed.</span> <span id="s299">They were telling that and, uh, it was very upsetting naturally.</span> <span id="s300">And everybody was hopeful, very, very hopeful that the end was coming.</span> <span id="s301">So on this day when we were arrested, we were brought to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s302">Oh, I have to say when those men came- there were four men- two Germans and two Dutch, and two of them were downstairs at the front and back door, and two of them came up to our room.</span> <span id="s303">They knocked on the door, they were very well mannered, and they said that we were arrested.</span> <span id="s304">They looked at the little belongings we had.</span> <span id="s305">They saw a picture of our daughter on the wall, because our friends brought us always picture to show what she was looking because she had gone to...going to school and then she was very happy where she was.</span> <span id="s306">And she looked happy.</span> <span id="s307">Uh, the one man said, "If this is your child, and if you have more children in hiding, we recommend that you take them with you because you are going into a family camp."</span> <span id="s308">Here it comes back, the same what the Jewish Council had said.</span> <span id="s309">And you will be...they will be taken care of while you are working.</span> <span id="s310">And my husband and I, we didn't even have to look at each other, we didn't answer that.</span> <span id="s311">Then, they announ...the other man said, "Why don't you take some warm clothes with you.</span> <span id="s312">Where you are going it is very cold."</span> <span id="s313">That was true.</span> <span id="s314">But we decided that we would take nothing.</span> <span id="s315">We went completely without luggage, knowing that we probably would come to Auschwitz because this was in some way called a punishment that we did not follow the first time...that we had to be punished for that, so it could only have been Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s316">And, uh, the, uh, the, uh...one, one and half day interrogation by the Gestapo was mostly about giving the names of the people who brought us those cards, because they had no idea who was breaking in and getting those tickets, and it must have been a very large circle.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: We have to stop for one minute.</span> <span id="s318">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: We are having some difficulties.</span> <span id="s320">A: How do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">[some technical conversation]</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: ...because they did not come through . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: I know.</span> <span id="s324">I know.</span> <span id="s325">A lot of things didn't come through . . . Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: I wish I had. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: Helen, I would like to go back.</span> <span id="s328">We're back on camera.</span> <span id="s329">You are at the point of being arrested, but as you are standing there, I find that there are a lot of questions.</span> <span id="s330">Uh, one of which is about your daughter.</span> <span id="s331">You're at the point of being sent away, . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s332">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s334">We are on camera.</span> <span id="s335">You're at the point of being arrested and there must have been a lot of things going through your mind, one of which was perhaps most important, your daughter.</span> <span id="s336">Tell me what you knew about her at this point and where she was?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: What I knew about my daughter was this friend, Jo Vis, who was the original helper and he didn't live too far from there.</span> <span id="s338">He was very often there to look himself at children.</span> <span id="s339">But, uh, in.</span> <span id="s340">.</span> <span id="s341">at that time before...oh, maybe a year before we were arrested, Jo Vis had in his house always people until he found for them another place.</span> <span id="s342">So one day there was a man staying with them who had been on the black list because he was in the war in Spain.</span> <span id="s343">And uh he was on the black list and he was hiding there waiting for a better place, and they were all arrested.</span> <span id="s344">He and his wife and there were two friends of ours who came through us to him were there.</span> <span id="s345">They all got arrested.</span> <span id="s346">His wife was pregnant at the time.</span> <span id="s347">They let her go home to three children.</span> <span id="s348">Uh .</span> <span id="s349">.</span> <span id="s350">.</span> <span id="s351">Everybody else was, uh, sent out.</span> <span id="s352">He went to Dachau.</span> <span id="s353">He went...he lived through the war.</span> <span id="s354">He happened to become a cook and he came home very well looking.</span> <span id="s355">(laugh) So, uh...but the two women were deported to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s356">And this was the next man in line, his name was Rinus,a wonderful man.</span> <span id="s357">Um, he was a gardener of the town, but he was very, very well-informed about everything.</span> <span id="s358">He was self taught man.</span> <span id="s359">And he brought all the books my husband wrote down he wanted, because my husband was writing how the world should be after the war.</span> <span id="s360">And in every way, in financial, in religious, in ethical, in any kind of way how the world should be.</span> <span id="s361">So he got the books he wanted every time when Rinus came.</span> <span id="s362">And, uh, he also visited where my daughter was, because this is the district where all the people who helped us were living, and he told us how happy she was, how wonderful she was doing in school.</span> <span id="s363">She was well.</span> <span id="s364">There was really no reason to worry about her.</span> <span id="s365">The...the woman...her foster mother, or whatever you would call it, was sick...I think for three weeks in the hospital.</span> <span id="s366">Another couple took over and took her in.</span> <span id="s367">They told us that afterwards.</span> <span id="s368">But she was in the best of hands.</span> <span id="s369">And though I didn't worry about her.</span> <span id="s370">Since we did not see her.</span> <span id="s371">We didn't...we didn't know ourselves where she was.</span> <span id="s372">It would have been very easy to get to her through all the others, but we never said, we never gave a name about the people who were visiting us.</span> <span id="s373">We just didn't answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: So when they came to take you, this was running through your mind.</span> <span id="s375">You knew your daughter was safe.</span> <span id="s376">Um, what what, uh...where did you go at that point?</span> <span id="s377">They took you and where did they take you?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: To the.</span> <span id="s379">.</span> <span id="s380">head.</span> <span id="s381">.</span> <span id="s382">headquarters of the Gestapo in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s383">We were in Haarlem.</span> <span id="s384">And 8 Rinus Hille, a man who had been very active in efforts to save the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">everybody said, "such a beautiful city."</span> <span id="s386">And I said, "I've never seen it."</span> <span id="s387">They took us to.</span> <span id="s388">.</span> <span id="s389">to Amsterdam, to the headquarters, and, uh, questioned separate, always.</span> <span id="s390">Questioned and questioned and questioned.</span> <span id="s391">Sometimes they got very impatient.</span> <span id="s392">They did not hit us.</span> <span id="s393">They did not touch us.</span> <span id="s394">They were very angry.</span> <span id="s395">It's very difficult to fight against somebody who doesn't react.</span> <span id="s396">It's very difficult, and, uh...in some way, we had uh given up that... that we would ever be living.</span> <span id="s397">In some way, we were already on the way to die.</span> <span id="s398">And we accepted that this is it.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">There was nothing you can do, and we didn't want to get anybody else in.</span> <span id="s400">We had no interest.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Did they ask you about connections to the underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Yes, that's that's what they wanted.</span> <span id="s403">That's the people who brought there, the people who visited, maybe... We didn't even answer.</span> <span id="s404">There was nothing there which would have shown that we were in any contact, but on the wall there was a map of Europe and what we heard from them where the uh Allies were, we put pins.</span> <span id="s405">That was there.</span> <span id="s406">But I think those guys were so ignorant that we didn't even see that.</span> <span id="s407">We were never asked, "How do you know?"</span> <span id="s408">Because it was not in the paper, but you got it from, from London.</span> <span id="s409">Never asked.</span> <span id="s410">Uh, uh.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Coming...ja...in this house was also a lady living...a seamstresswith her mother, older mother, and this was a spinster who was making dresses.</span> <span id="s412">And I got very close to her.</span> <span id="s413">She lived, she and her mother lived on the second floor and I sat down very often- we talked.</span> <span id="s414">She was about my age and I still correspond with her.</span> <span id="s415">So when we left going down the steps, she was at the steps and I had in my hand a coral pin I had gotten from my mother-in-law.</span> <span id="s416">I had a very wonderful relationship to my mother-in-law...very.</span> <span id="s417">And, uh, I put it in her hands when I said goodbye, and, uh, that was that.</span> <span id="s418">We never saw the woman, her so called hostess or her three daughters.</span> <span id="s419">Nobody was there.</span> <span id="s420">And, uh, they brought us . . .after this time at the headquarters, they brought us for two days to the Amsterdam jail which was very nice.</span> <span id="s421">I would have always liked to (laugh) stay there and wait for the end of the war.</span> <span id="s422">It was clean and, uh, it was very nice.</span> <span id="s423">But there were only two days and then they brought us, always in the night, in street cars to the station and we were brought to Westerbork which was the transit camp in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Ya.</span> <span id="s425">Hold it a minute.</span> <span id="s426">What I'd like you to do...Can you describe the trip to Westerbork for me please?</span> <span id="s427">How did they take you and who went with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: I've never thought about that any more.</span> <span id="s429">I've never thought.</span> <span id="s430">.</span> <span id="s431">that .</span> <span id="s432">.</span> <span id="s433">they were German soldiers.</span> <span id="s434">It was a regular train.</span> <span id="s435">It was a regular train and German soldiers.</span> <span id="s436">We had no luggage.</span> <span id="s437">There was no problem with us.</span> <span id="s438">We didn't talk.</span> <span id="s439">That's all.</span> <span id="s440">It's very...uh.</span> <span id="s441">.</span> <span id="s442">There was a big surprise to me when we came to Westerbork, about seeing all those people...so many friends we hadn't seen in years.</span> <span id="s443">They were there.</span> <span id="s444">And the green uniforms.</span> <span id="s445">Especially some women in those uniform.</span> <span id="s446">They looked chic, sexy.</span> <span id="s447">I..</span> <span id="s448">.</span> <span id="s449">I didn't know...I said, "Who is that?"</span> <span id="s450">(laughs) They were all prisoners and they had some kind of work to do.</span> <span id="s451">I don't know...I was not long enough in</span></p> <p><span id="s452">9 Gre Orlessen.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Westerbork to find out how really those relations were.</span> <span id="s454">I have read some books afterwards about Westerbork, and, uh.</span> <span id="s455">.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: But for you?</span> <span id="s457">What was Westerbork like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: It was a foreign world.</span> <span id="s459">Completely!</span> <span id="s460">The people who had been there for years, they took for granted that this was the right thing, where they would be.</span> <span id="s461">And as I said, we met good friends.</span> <span id="s462">We met a man there who lived...who had rented a room at the Frank's house, at their apartment, and we knew him very well because we introduced him to the one daughter of friends of ours and they got married.</span> <span id="s463">Now his wife was at that time when Jo Vis was arrested...was there.</span> <span id="s464">They had no place for her, and so she came to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s465">Where he went, I don't know, because the train where we...were leaving was about two days later and was the last train to Auschwitz because then the strike came in Holland.</span> <span id="s466">The announcement that the uh Allies would come to Holland, and the Germans knew that too, and they emptied Westerbork.</span> <span id="s467">There were only 300 people left . . .I didn't want- wish to be there to fight out who would be the 300.</span> <span id="s468">And, uh, our. . .our train...our cattle train went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s469">We were sure...we didn't know when we were came there that it was Auschwitz but in our mind since we had heard that this camp existed, that we were punished...punished for our hiding and whatever, that that was the place where we were going.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: What was the transport like?</span> <span id="s471">What was the trip like to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: A nightmare.</span> <span id="s473">A real nightmare.</span> <span id="s474">Um, the train was overloaded with people, and, uh, we were, I would judge maybe a hundred and fifty people.</span> <span id="s475">There was no room to sit.</span> <span id="s476">We had to stand.</span> <span id="s477">I don't know how it was in others because I..</span> <span id="s478">I always didn't want to talk to people and ask in camp how was it.</span> <span id="s479">We...uh...we were standing and, uh, a lot of people died...old people...babies.</span> <span id="s480">No water.</span> <span id="s481">No food.</span> <span id="s482">No light.</span> <span id="s483">No air.</span> <span id="s484">And no toilet facilities.</span> <span id="s485">And next to me was a woman who had a little child with her, a little girl, and she uh told me that the people who came to arrest them from in the hiding places said the same thing with the same words as the Jewish Council said...as those guys said who arrested us, "Take your children with you."</span> <span id="s486">And she did.</span> <span id="s487">So I thought maybe I did something wrong.</span> <span id="s488">Maybe I did not really believe that there maybe would be a chance to have the child with you.</span> <span id="s489">So they took us...was a three and a half day trip, and, uh, (long pause) twice the car stopped and the soldiers came in and they took our watches one time, and then they wanted our money telling us that the money wasn't worth anything.</span> <span id="s490">Where we were going we should give our money, and my husband decided...we had our money in belt, money belt.</span> <span id="s491">We had that on, it on all those years.</span> <span id="s492">And he didn't give anything.</span> <span id="s493">So when they closed again, we started to rip up this money...thousands of guilders.</span> <span id="s494">Wasn't easy to do.</span> <span id="s495">It's a physical step, also to rip it in little pieces.</span> <span id="s496">But we did.</span> <span id="s497">I don't know- it was stupid probably, but we did it.</span> <span id="s498">And, uh, we arrived in the middle of the night, the fourth night and was...you know, bright lights, and the doors opened, and the blue and white striped prisoners which were the prisoners from Kanada which we did not know Kanada existed.</span> <span id="s499">They looked very clean, starched uniforms.</span> <span id="s500">They'd never answer any questions.</span> <span id="s501">We said, "Where are we?"</span> <span id="s502">No questions.</span> <span id="s503">Just getting the luggage out.</span> <span id="s504">And all the people had brought with them, half households.</span> <span id="s505">It was all gone and people, I'm sure it was at every train the same were very upset, and they always got promised, "We bring it to you where you are.</span> <span id="s506">We know where you will be."</span> <span id="s507">And, uh, at least we didn't have to go through that.</span> <span id="s508">The woman and the child and I were together when we started to move in rows after we were separated from the men.</span> <span id="s509">And we walked...the ramp was endless.</span> <span id="s510">I don't know how long, how many cars there were, but it seemed endless and there was the man standing who made the decision who shall live or who shall die, but we did not know that.</span> <span id="s511">He looked at the three of us and he asked me if that was my child, and I said no, and he made the movement with the thumb for one side to go for me and to the other side for this woman and her child, and I assumed that she had that privilege because they were taking care of the children.</span> <span id="s512">And, uh, this man was very good looking.</span> <span id="s513">I have never forgotten the look of Dr. Mengele because I found out the next day it was Mengele.</span> <span id="s514">There were more doctors than Mengele to do that since it was 24 hours going, train after train.</span> <span id="s515">But this was Mengele, and, uh, he was very good looking, and, uh, his uniform and his boots.</span> <span id="s516">He was just a perfect specimen of a man.</span> <span id="s517">And, uh, somebody had said, you know, when...a few months.</span> <span id="s518">.</span> <span id="s519">few years ago when there was so much about Mengele, "Would you recognize him?"</span> <span id="s520">I said, "No, I'm sure not."</span> <span id="s521">The way he looked then at his height and, how can you?</span> <span id="s522">So he to the aside, he sent me, it was the side of life, and the other was the side of death, as I heard the next day also.</span> <span id="s523">And, uh, there were no Jewish children in Auschwitz, just a few Dr. Mengele wanted.</span> <span id="s524">Otherwise, there were no Jewish children.</span> <span id="s525">And the mothers were killed with them when they had the mother.</span> <span id="s526">Uh, I have met...before I forget that and I come to it, I met a woman who was with us in the barrack.</span> <span id="s527">A young woman.</span> <span id="s528">A very beautiful looking woman.</span> <span id="s529">She was very depressed.</span> <span id="s530">And after.</span> <span id="s531">.</span> <span id="s532">I had very .</span> <span id="s533">.</span> <span id="s534">I had hardly any contact with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">All of a sudden she said to me, "You know what I did?</span> <span id="s536">I knew they would kill the children, and I let my children go," and uh she said, "I couldn't help him them because I would be killed too."</span> <span id="s537">She knew all that.</span> <span id="s538">She said, "I heard it maybe two days before I was on the train and I let my children go."</span> <span id="s539">I don't know what happened to her.</span> <span id="s540">I don't know how she lived through it.</span> <span id="s541">I wish she would be living and that she could have children again.</span> <span id="s542">I don't know.</span> <span id="s543">But that...went with me for many, many years.</span> <span id="s544">How do you live with that?</span> <span id="s545">The, uh, the side where we were, we were told to wait, and then came my husband who was also sent to this good side, and we talked for a long time until the women were called into a large, a very large room.</span> <span id="s546">And I must say when we were walking to this place in the woods I heard voices.</span> <span id="s547">I heard women speak.</span> <span id="s548">I heard dogs and I heard music.</span> <span id="s549">And I said to the other women I said, "I thought we would come to Auschwitz where they kill everybody.</span> <span id="s550">This is life.</span> <span id="s551">We are coming into life.</span> <span id="s552">You hear the noises?</span> <span id="s553">You don't have to worry."</span> <span id="s554">So, uh, we were called into that room and we got first our tatoo, and the girls who gave that were sitting at a long table on a wall and they all were wearing black satin dresses.</span> <span id="s555">Not the same dress, but the same material, and their hair was beautiful, long.</span> <span id="s556">Young women, very, very attractive women.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">And they had a book, and they put our name in and then they gave our tatoo and then we were with them going into a circle of soldiers with big dogs and then we had to take off our clothes, strip.</span> <span id="s558">The one who stripped me, helped me stripping, took at the same time my wedding band off my finger.</span> <span id="s559">I had forgotten I had it.</span> <span id="s560">Maybe I would have tried to put it in my mouth or whatever.</span> <span id="s561">I didn't know.</span> <span id="s562">So she took it and, uh, I still thought they were Germans.</span> <span id="s563">I did not understand that they were Jewish prisoners.</span> <span id="s564">So they helped us and they found out...tried to find if we had jewelry hidden some other places and, uh, they shaved us, our head hair and our body hair.</span> <span id="s565">They left our shoes because that day no wooden shoes had come.</span> <span id="s566">I heard, um, Anne Frank's mother who was with us.</span> <span id="s567">And I knew the Franks.</span> <span id="s568">And I did not know that they had been arrested shortly before us, so I didn't know that.</span> <span id="s569">So I heard her discussing with one of those women...the woman.</span> <span id="s570">.</span> <span id="s571">and she was with one daughter...no...she was with two daughters.</span> <span id="s572">There she was with two daughters... And ,uh, the woman said she should give her her shoes, and...and Mrs. Frank hesitated, and the girl said, "I bring you every day soup for your two daughters if you give me your shoes and I give you mine."</span> <span id="s573">And she was very naive and she did this.</span> <span id="s574">She never got a drop of soup.</span> <span id="s575">The woman who was handling me also said that...that must have been before or the same time...I don't know anymore.</span> <span id="s576">She said, "You have good shoes on."</span> <span id="s577">I said, "Yes, I am very glad I have good shoes on."</span> <span id="s578">She said, "Would you like to change with me?"</span> <span id="s579">I said, "No."</span> <span id="s580">That's it.</span> <span id="s581">And then we came under the cold shower and then we were outside the house and we got a dress, uh a .</span> <span id="s582">.</span> <span id="s583">dress.</span> <span id="s584">It could have been chiffon or it could have been wool.</span> <span id="s585">It could have been a size 10 or it could have been a size 25.</span> <span id="s586">It made no difference.</span> <span id="s587">I got a dress and we went to the barrack for the night.</span> <span id="s588">That was all happening in the morning when we arrived during the night.</span> <span id="s589">.</span> <span id="s590">all that took the to the other night.</span> <span id="s591">We still didn't get to eat.</span> <span id="s592">We still couldn't go to the latrine.</span> <span id="s593">In the meantime it was a latrine.</span> <span id="s594">And we were, uh brought to the barrack and we were exhausted.</span> <span id="s595">Absolutely exhausted.</span> <span id="s596">And I had a dream which was with me for many years and, uh, I dreamt that I was coming home and I was telling my family and my friends the strange things that had happened to me this day, this weeks, I don't know anymore.</span> <span id="s597">Probably the most upsetting was this being changed into a different person with losing your hair, losing everything you had, just as you are born.</span> <span id="s598">I think that was the greatest shock.</span> <span id="s599">You couldn't see yourself, but you saw the others, so you knew what you were looking like.</span> <span id="s600">I think it was the greatest shock for all of us, because nobody menstruated anymore.</span> <span id="s601">That was over.</span> <span id="s602">And our young girls, we had a lot of young girls, we had the whole uh orphanage of Jewish girls from Paris, girls of 15 years old, and they came from Morocco, and they were brought to Paris, and they were all taken, and we had them all.</span> <span id="s603">Beautiful girls.</span> <span id="s604">Fifteen years old.</span> <span id="s605">All they could speak was their own language.</span> <span id="s606">They had nothing else.</span> <span id="s607">They couldn't talk to anybody else.</span> <span id="s608">They were very upset when they were not menstruating.</span> <span id="s609">Everybody very young was uh concerned, but then it was a blessing.</span> <span id="s610">What would we have done?</span> <span id="s611">We had nothing.</span> <span id="s612">We had no underwear.</span> <span id="s613">We had nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: Can we .</span> <span id="s615">.</span> <span id="s616">we need to hold it for a minute.</span> <span id="s617">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: We need to change tapes.</span> <span id="s619">Bonnie, let's break here.</span> <span id="s620">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s621">TAPE #2</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s623">We're back.</span> <span id="s624">We're back at the camp . . . A: Ja.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: And you're describing just the loss of menstruation . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: Ja, and the dream.</span> <span id="s627">The dream that I came home and are telling my experiences- with the tatoo, and with the losing the hair, and uh losing everything we had and everybody said, "This is impossible.</span> <span id="s628">You are dreaming, just a heavy dream-- that cannot happen to anybody."</span> <span id="s629">The strange thing is, I read many years later the book Night and he talks about people who came back and the people said he must have lost his mind.</span> <span id="s630">That was years later and so I'm not the only one who had such dreams.</span> <span id="s631">I think there are more people who have dreams on this kind, but I didn't have a..</span> <span id="s632">.</span> <span id="s633">for a certain time and then it was over, that dream.</span> <span id="s634">Um...</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: You're in the barrack . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: Yes, I am in the barrack.</span> <span id="s637">We had 10 or 12 people in a bunk, and it was in the middle of the night when we came, so it was very short time that we could sleep.</span> <span id="s638">When the morning came and the first day in Auschwitz started, was a roll call.</span> <span id="s639">Roll call in Auschwitz I'm sure that everybody had about the same experience...that's uh the barrack elder was counting everybody, we were standing with five in...and I always, always...I don't know why... tried to stand exactly in the middle.</span> <span id="s640">Not in front, not in the back, and not on the side.</span> <span id="s641">I wanted to be little and short and not being seen.</span> <span id="s642">I don't know why.</span> <span id="s643">Later on, I found that the women who were tall were always picked to special things.</span> <span id="s644">They were not always good.</span> <span id="s645">So I didn't want to be picked for anything.</span> <span id="s646">I didn't want to be there.</span> <span id="s647">So, uh, we were counted but every roll call, every roll call was wrong.</span> <span id="s648">It never came out that we were as many people as they had had on their books.</span> <span id="s649">And the women got very...those women, those barrack elder, were very upset about it.</span> <span id="s650">They were also very beautiful dressed, with black dresses.</span> <span id="s651">Uh, I still didn't know that they were prison, Jewish prisoners.</span> <span id="s652">It didn't dawn on me that they would be prisoners.</span> <span id="s653">Look at us and look at them.</span> <span id="s654">And, uh, then came the SS men to check it, and that didn't work out.</span> <span id="s655">So he was very angry, and they were worried and they looked through the barrack and they found people who were hiding under the mattresses and they were found people who had died, and though they put them all there on the floor and counted them, and I think then maybe they were then, uh, accepting the numbers.</span> <span id="s656">I don't know.</span> <span id="s657">Even they mostly spoke German and I tried always to understand what they were saying, it was difficult.</span> <span id="s658">When this roll call was over, then volunteers had to go to the kitchen to get the coffee.</span> <span id="s659">And it was in big barrels and you had to carry them with uh sticks, and uh I felt so strong and so healthy, I always volunteered.</span> <span id="s660">I don't know why.</span> <span id="s661">I guess I was curious to see what the kitchen looked like.</span> <span id="s662">I think that was it.</span> <span id="s663">You didn't see much because you never had...got into the kitchen and most of the people who worked in the kitchen were born in Poland and spoke Polish and, uh, for long times before all that happened, there was always uh, uh, another world in between the Germans and the Eastern Jews and that was in Auschwitz also.</span> <span id="s664">Maybe even stronger, that didn't dawn on me first either.</span> <span id="s665">Eh . . . Maybe stronger because there were so many Polish women who had been there or some other camp and ghettos for a long time already.</span> <span id="s666">This was '44.</span> <span id="s667">They started in 39.</span> <span id="s668">So, uh, they had so called jobs, and when somebody came, new in, who had been hiding or so, they always had a job for them.</span> <span id="s669">Always.</span> <span id="s670">They got...we never saw them again.</span> <span id="s671">They got help.</span> <span id="s672">We didn't...I didn't...I didn't know anybody.</span> <span id="s673">I came with a Dutch group, and I was considered to be Dutch because I spoke Dutch with them.</span> <span id="s674">The Dutch women were uh very unfortunate because they could never adjust, practically.</span> <span id="s675">They, uh, died like the flies, especially in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s676">And, uh, I didn't understand that.</span> <span id="s677">I met the Hungarian women who had come a few months before us.</span> <span id="s678">Very intelligent, very...also attractive women.</span> <span id="s679">They were at that...in this camp I was...it was uh, Birkenau B-2, uh, they were the keepers of the latrines, and the washrooms, and I uh washing...I don't know for some reason I thought I just have to wash every day and they were not always open, but I got friendly with them and I could come in.</span> <span id="s680">Now washing is a big work because we had high, uh, uh, wash stands on high heels and you had to climb in there and then there was come cold water.</span> <span id="s681">That was all.</span> <span id="s682">And then you put your dress on again.</span> <span id="s683">But it gave me a very good feeling that I had done that.</span> <span id="s684">I felt...I felt I needed that.</span> <span id="s685">And, uh, the Dutch women said to me, "You are crazy.</span> <span id="s686">The next thing is you get pneumonia.</span> <span id="s687">How can you go under that cold water?</span> <span id="s688">You get pneumonia."</span> <span id="s689">I said, "Maybe there is some loose dirt because it's already you know some...a whole day, but whatever there is, I feel good."</span> <span id="s690">They didn't go.</span> <span id="s691">It was not very comfortable climbing, but also the friendship I had with the...with the women from Hungary helped me to get in and have some time to talk to them.</span> <span id="s692">The same with uh the latrine was closed at many hours.</span> <span id="s693">I could always get in.</span> <span id="s694">And, uh, we...we became good friends.</span> <span id="s695">They were much younger than I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: What did you do on a day to day basis?</span> <span id="s697">A: In. . .in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: Nothing regular.</span> <span id="s700">Nothing regular.</span> <span id="s701">We were going sometimes with carts, with two wheel carts to .</span> <span id="s702">.</span> <span id="s703">into the woods and cut out some grass, squares, and brought them to a place where the soldiers were living and then they put that cut grass.</span> <span id="s704">We, uh, moved sometimes bricks on those things back and forth from one corner to the other- the it was not regular, and, uh, I do remember that we...when we were carrying those bricks back and forth... Oh no, that was . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s705">.</span> <span id="s706">that was later.</span> <span id="s707">That was not in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s708">That was in the camp I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: Stay with Auschwitz for a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: Ja.</span> <span id="s711">You know it came to me that we had those carts there too.</span> <span id="s712">That's how it brought it together.</span> <span id="s713">No, we didn't, uh, we didn't have regular things to do.</span> <span id="s714">We went to the station sometimes and moved stones.</span> <span id="s715">Nothing special.</span> <span id="s716">We had two more selections with Dr. Mengele, only that was in the barrack.</span> <span id="s717">Many times during the day, there was all of a sudden a signal that everybody had to go back to the barrack, close the door, couldn't be out.</span> <span id="s718">So we found out that this was the day when one of the doctors came because one day we had it.</span> <span id="s719">We were going out, but with us it, it was Mengele again and we took off our dress and in the nude we marched in front of him and he makes the same signs, to the right or to the left.</span> <span id="s720">In that case there was in the uh barrack a small room where the ones who were to be killed were settled and we could go.</span> <span id="s721">But by that time we knew what it meant because I had met a man walking through the camp.</span> <span id="s722">I walked around a lot to look.</span> <span id="s723">I was always a curious person.</span> <span id="s724">I wanted to see what's going on here.</span> <span id="s725">And I saw a man, the only man I saw in the camp, and he was Polish also.</span> <span id="s726">He had a triangle.</span> <span id="s727">And he was a criminal as I found out later, a black triangle, and, uh, I asked him.</span> <span id="s728">I spoke German, I tried Dutch.</span> <span id="s729">He spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s730">We talked together.</span> <span id="s731">And, uh, I asked him where we were.</span> <span id="s732">And he said, "You are not in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">You're in Birkenau."</span> <span id="s734">And Birkenau, he said, "You see that chimney there, its smoking.</span> <span id="s735">Don't ever think that you come out alive here.</span> <span id="s736">This is the way we are going to heaven, through the chimney.</span> <span id="s737">And that little house next to it is where the gas is."</span> <span id="s738">It was a few days there-- very short time.</span> <span id="s739">And, uh, I was always wondering what is this man walk around in this camp?</span> <span id="s740">The books I have read, the many, many books of people who had been in Auschwitz...I assume now that this man was looking for a woman...because we had women who uh had some boy- friends coming into and bring...bringing them gifts, food, clothes.</span> <span id="s741">I don't know what.</span> <span id="s742">But I do remember that very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: Who could they have boy friends?</span> <span id="s744">Where did the boy friends come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: From the other camp.</span> <span id="s746">From a work camp.</span> <span id="s747">Those were people who were already in camp for years.</span> <span id="s748">They were maybe kapos.</span> <span id="s749">I don't know.</span> <span id="s750">They could go.</span> <span id="s751">Whatever they were.</span> <span id="s752">They were not Jewish, but uh they looked for, you know, for the . . .the new women because they were still nice and, uh, we had one woman from, who was from Berlin.</span> <span id="s753">She was a prostitute.</span> <span id="s754">She had told me when we were in jail.</span> <span id="s755">She had told me that she was a prostitute.</span> <span id="s756">And that she's Jewish, and, uh, I never saw her there anyway.</span> <span id="s757">But there were women who were ready for whatever they could get to be with men where and how I don't know.</span> <span id="s758">But this came...not at that moment...I was thinking of that, of that guy who was there.</span> <span id="s759">He was clean dressed, well-dressed, and good boots which was the most important thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: Can you take it...I'd like to go back to a minute to the Mengele selection in the barrack.</span> <span id="s761">A: Ja.</span> <span id="s762">Outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: Uh, he...was this outside or inside?</span> <span id="s764">A: No.</span> <span id="s765">Outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: Outside?</span> <span id="s767">He took all of you outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: We were all outside.</span> <span id="s769">Yes.</span> <span id="s770">And we walked by.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: Uh, did you see what happened to the women he chose?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: No.</span> <span id="s773">I only know that they had to go into the barrack to the a little side room.</span> <span id="s774">Maybe it was a room where the elder was sleeping.</span> <span id="s775">You know she had a separate room.</span> <span id="s776">It could be.</span> <span id="s777">I don't know.</span> <span id="s778">What.</span> <span id="s779">.</span> <span id="s780">ja, that was the second time.</span> <span id="s781">There were a mother and a daughter with us.</span> <span id="s782">The daughter was 15.</span> <span id="s783">You know, you...when you are under 16, you should have gone to the other side...so she was 15, and the mother was taken.</span> <span id="s784">So this girl was with us to the end.</span> <span id="s785">And everybody was trying to replace the mother.</span> <span id="s786">It was a Dutch girl, but I don't know what happened to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: There was, you said, a third selection.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: A third selection started in the same way, with Mengele also.</span> <span id="s789">And then.</span> <span id="s790">.</span> <span id="s791">there he...they counted 300 women.</span> <span id="s792">And to me it was clear that this would go to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: This was to where?</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: To work.</span> <span id="s795">That meant...and because we had no other job.</span> <span id="s796">It was already two months that we had no.</span> <span id="s797">.</span> <span id="s798">nothing to do, just wait from one meal to another.</span> <span id="s799">And it wasn't bad, the food there in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s800">It wasn't enough, but it was not bad.</span> <span id="s801">Ja.</span> <span id="s802">The bread was excellent.</span> <span id="s803">They baked very good bread, and, uh, ja...the . . .the bread soldiers get.</span> <span id="s804">Brown, blackish bread.</span> <span id="s805">Very good.</span> <span id="s806">It was never enough, naturally.</span> <span id="s807">And there was always something under that big piece of bread.</span> <span id="s808">It, uh, was a wedge.</span> <span id="s809">And there was uh on there uh sometimes cottage cheese, sometimes uh some uh jelly, marmalade, a piece of sausage.</span> <span id="s810">Not all together.</span> <span id="s811">That was one meal, and uh we got that so-called coffee which only looked like a black mess, and, uh, then the second meal we go, probably ja, mostly soup.</span> <span id="s812">But we had nothing to eat with so we had to share a bowl of soup with, with four people.</span> <span id="s813">And, uh,</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: The third selection then .</span> <span id="s815">.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: Ja.</span> <span id="s817">We were counted 300 people, and as I said, I assumed we're going to work.</span> <span id="s818">Mrs. Frank was in those 300 with Anna, but her daughter...was other daughterwas not there.</span> <span id="s819">She was in quarantine.</span> <span id="s820">She had some skin eruptions.</span> <span id="s821">Germans were very much afraid of skin get contagious or so.</span> <span id="s822">So she was in quarantine and Mrs. Frank said, "I'm not going with you wherever you're going if you're going uh because I wait until Margot comes back."</span> <span id="s823">That's what she did.</span> <span id="s824">She disappeared during the night...went into another barrack and, uh, came to Bergen-Bel.</span> <span id="s825">She didn't come...she died before she came to Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: Can you tell me?</span> <span id="s827">This seems as good a time as any to tell us a little about Mrs. Frank and Anna.</span> <span id="s828">What were they like as people?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: Now uh, I knew them before and, uh, uh, Mr. Frank was a typical German officer in his</span></p> <p><span id="s830">10 Margot Frank.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">stand.</span> <span id="s832">A very correct, very bright man.</span> <span id="s833">Had an excellent relationship with Anna.</span> <span id="s834">She had a much better relationship with him than with her mother.</span> <span id="s835">And, uh, Anna was a very quiet girl...liked to write as everybody knows and, uh, Mrs. Frank was, as she did the dealing with her shoes, which is, you know, a small thing, when we came that she...that she changed the shoes.</span> <span id="s836">It showed in some way that it was very difficult for her to see the real place where we were.</span> <span id="s837">The reality, what, what could happen, what, what is happening.</span> <span id="s838">And, uh, Margaret was a very attractive girl.</span> <span id="s839">More attractive than Anne.</span> <span id="s840">But Anne was a lovely girl but she never talked much.</span> <span id="s841">They were...he was a very successful businessman, and everybody liked him.</span> <span id="s842">I don't know why he took all those people into that house, which was really too much.</span> <span id="s843">Made it very difficult, because to be even with two in one room hiding is a great stress.</span> <span id="s844">To be with the same person with your husband or with your wife for two years in one room is great stress and many marriages broke up afterwards.</span> <span id="s845">Uh, the 300 women were in another barrack and the next morning we were brought to the original Auschwitz camp which we hadn't seen, and we got some food for the day and we were in another cattle train.</span> <span id="s846">That was the 28th of October.</span> <span id="s847">My daughter was 7 years old that day.</span> <span id="s848">It was a gorgeous day.</span> <span id="s849">The leaves they were all changing.</span> <span id="s850">We were going west, what I thought was just the most wonderful thing.</span> <span id="s851">Could only be good, and, uh, the doors were kept open while we were going and we came to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s852">They didn't tell us it was Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s853">It was high up in mountains...was nice, and, uh, it was a good feeling to be away from those killing places and from the chimney.</span> <span id="s854">It felt good.</span> <span id="s855">The commandant of this camp...the place was Kratzau.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Kratzau was a factory...had a factory which originally came from Berlin.</span> <span id="s857">Hard, hard to find out those things because nobody told you really.</span> <span id="s858">A Berlin factory probably...was probably all destroyed.</span> <span id="s859">They came and took over this factory, which was originally a linen or something.</span> <span id="s860">So they made...they had all electric benches, and we got boxes of little cylinders, maybe three or four inches long, and maybe an inch hollow, light material, and we had to put the knife of the machine inside the opening.</span> <span id="s861">That means we did not do it, but the foreman did it.</span> <span id="s862">The foreman turned on the machine and we changed constantly when that shaved inside made the opening a little bigger.</span> <span id="s863">That was a factory.</span> <span id="s864">She said we have a very good factory here and she addressed us as girls, "Hi, girls."</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: Who is she?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: The commandant.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: The commandant.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: The commandant with a white sweater and a turtle neck.</span> <span id="s869">She looked cute.</span> <span id="s870">She was about 22 years old, and uh she called us girls and she said, "You will have a good life here.</span> <span id="s871">You work hard, we treat you well."</span> <span id="s872">It's in the factory where you are living, not in the same factory, but about 15 minutes to walk, and we clean it all up and we are 300 women in each room.</span> <span id="s873">So 1200...we were the last 300....1200 women.</span> <span id="s874">Sounded very nice.</span> <span id="s875">And, uh, but we changed commandant.</span> <span id="s876">It was always a change.</span> <span id="s877">Always another woman came.</span> <span id="s878">All women.</span> <span id="s879">Our caretakers were four soldiers and four women, SS women, young, who were very unhappy that they were in this kind of a village where there was nothing.</span> <span id="s880">There was absolutely nothing to do, and the winter was very harsh, very cold, lots of snow and ice, and uh the places where they were sleeping were very primitive.</span> <span id="s881">Not much more than we had.</span> <span id="s882">They had the same bunks, and, uh, the same toilet.</span> <span id="s883">Uh, we were not allowed to use that toilet, but we did anyway.</span> <span id="s884">Outside, between the stairs, like in old European places, there was a toilet in between the stairs, the in between the first and second floor in a corner.</span> <span id="s885">That was like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">That was their toilet.</span> <span id="s887">I don't know if they had a bathroom.</span> <span id="s888">But they built a shower, a large shower when we came there.</span> <span id="s889">They started to build it.</span> <span id="s890">We were never allowed to use it.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Never.</span> <span id="s892">And, uh, we had no water.</span> <span id="s893">We had uh a little sink in the hallway which dribbled.</span> <span id="s894">We had no water.</span> <span id="s895">We could never wash ourselves, and after a very short time we were full of lice.</span> <span id="s896">Then they...they deloused us, which took a whole day to get deloused.</span> <span id="s897">They deloused us in Auschwitz already, and the lice came back after a few hours.</span> <span id="s898">And they had big drums where they put our clothes in and we got hot water to wash ourselves in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s899">Didn't kill the uh (pause) didn't kill the...we, uh.</span> <span id="s900">.</span> <span id="s901">.</span> <span id="s902">the factory was working 12 hours from 6 to 6, and we could choose, have a choice of day or night shift, and I selected night shift because they said we would get on Sunday an extra portion of food.</span> <span id="s903">That was very important.</span> <span id="s904">Food is still important to me.</span> <span id="s905">So it was very important to take the night shift.</span> <span id="s906">So the day shift went, and when the day shift came home, the other ones were already on their way there, but, um as I said, the winter was bad.</span> <span id="s907">We had no heat in our rooms.</span> <span id="s908">We lost all our blankets.</span> <span id="s909">A lot of women made underwear from the blankets which when we found that out, we were just besides ourselves, because there were no blankets anymore.</span> <span id="s910">And, uh, the International Red Cross came.</span> <span id="s911">A great surprise.</span> <span id="s912">Somebody...you know...there are a lot of rumors in those places.</span> <span id="s913">Somebody said they...a cattle car came with boxes in there, and came from Switzerland and we thought that's ridiculous.</span> <span id="s914">But a few days later, we got each a handful of sugar.</span> <span id="s915">Since we had nothing where we could carry it in, everybody got a handful of sugar, and you had to lick it right away because there was no other way and our hands were so filthy.</span> <span id="s916">We were smelling so much because a foreman in the factory didn't want to come close to us, we were smelling so badly, and they didn't want those lice.</span> <span id="s917">They can jump.</span> <span id="s918">(laugh) And, uh, we got there in the morning and we came home.</span> <span id="s919">We got bread.</span> <span id="s920">Sometimes with something on them.</span> <span id="s921">The portions got smaller, cause Germany didn't have much food themselves.</span> <span id="s922">And, uh, in the evening we got the so-called dinner which was soup, mostly soup where potatoes or rutabaga was cooked in, but the potatoes and the rutabaga were out, and that was all.</span> <span id="s923">Or, potatoes in the pan cooked we got sometime three or four potatoes as dinner.</span> <span id="s924">Christmas we had a very fancy dinner because they had slaughtered a horse and that tasted very good.</span> <span id="s925">And potatoes.</span> <span id="s926">Cooked.</span> <span id="s927">That was...but we were already on our way down physically, but when the International Red Cross came actually into the camp...there were four women coming in green uniforms, and we were standing in our five lines, and I heard the commandant in German tell them, "You just saw our beautiful shower installations.</span> <span id="s928">Look at those filthy Jews.</span> <span id="s929">They do not want to wash themselves.</span> <span id="s930">Those pigs."</span> <span id="s931">And, uh, none of those women asked the question why we didn't want to wash.</span> <span id="s932">There was no...if if they would have washed...or asked, I would have said whatever would have happened.</span> <span id="s933">But it was not possible.</span> <span id="s934">They had brought also sardines, and we got two women one can of sardines.</span> <span id="s935">Most of us got sick- we didn't have any fat for so long.</span> <span id="s936">They must have maybe brought also more potatoes or something because...and, oh, ja, green peas...because we had that on Christmas.</span> <span id="s937">No soap.</span> <span id="s938">(laughs) Nothing like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: Was there anyplace at all where you were allowed to wash ever?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: No.</span> <span id="s941">In the factory, there was a toilet and they had a little sink this size and there was water.</span> <span id="s942">You couldn't wash yourself.</span> <span id="s943">Maybe you could drink little bit, but the half hour in between the...you know, to, uh, the hours, the twelve hours, was a half an hour time, but we had nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s944">We had eaten our bread.</span> <span id="s945">We had no pockets to put it in.</span> <span id="s946">So, uh, you couldn't...you couldn't leave it on your bed or so, because it would be stolen in one minute.</span> <span id="s947">So we ate it.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: What happened after the Red Cross came?</span> <span id="s949">A: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: How much longer were you in this condition before things changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: Things never changed.</span> <span id="s954">Things got just bad uh when the war got bad.</span> <span id="s955">You see, I was always, when we marched to the factory, always in the last row because there were two soldiers with us and they spoke German.</span> <span id="s956">I could hear what they were saying to each other.</span> <span id="s957">And it was just uh music in my ears, because they said they were terribly upset.</span> <span id="s958">They hadn't heard for weeks from their families, and they said that Germany is bombed and then all of a sudden I heard that the Allies are in Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s959">And I thought, "In Nuremberg...in the middle of the country."</span> <span id="s960">And I told my friends and I said, "Oh, that cannot take long at all anymore.</span> <span id="s961">That must be over soon.</span> <span id="s962">They are already in Nurenberg."</span> <span id="s963">But we were the ones who really suffered so much because it was so cold and we had so little strength left.</span> <span id="s964">We buried our women that died.</span> <span id="s965">We didn't know the names.</span> <span id="s966">We maybe knew sometimes of their first name.</span> <span id="s967">We got very much in going into shells.</span> <span id="s968">We...we had no strength anymore to discuss, to talk, which we did in the beginning.</span> <span id="s969">We were playing word games, the ones who knew some and could do it, but that was over.</span> <span id="s970">You, you couldn't do that anymore.</span> <span id="s971">And, uh, then there must have gotten notice that if.</span> <span id="s972">.</span> <span id="s973">if. . . the Russians would be coming to us, if they come, then would should be physically in the most perfect condition so they took us on a train to the next town where there was a prisoner camp- prisoner of war camp.</span> <span id="s974">We didn't know.</span> <span id="s975">They were French soldiers, and they were so upset when they saw us the way we looked, and they went with us into the uh sauna and they brought the hot water to us and they helped us.</span> <span id="s976">But that's all they- they could do.</span> <span id="s977">They wished they would have food, because we...we were full of edemas and we were in bad shape, and that took two days, this transport...all those people to that town, into, into this camp and getting home again.</span> <span id="s978">And, uh, I was sick.</span> <span id="s979">I was sick before that.</span> <span id="s980">I got, uh, you know...with the...where you get eye- the eye white.</span> <span id="s981">.</span> <span id="s982">get the white of the eye get yellow...</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: Jaundice?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: Uh, ja, it's not jaundice, it was....</span> <span id="s985">Q: Hepatitis?</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: Yes, ja, I got contagious hepatitis.</span> <span id="s987">I was terribly sick, and so that week because I couldn't eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">I couldn't eat, I only wanted to drink.</span> <span id="s989">And we had a so-called hospital in there and uh there was one Polish doctor.</span> <span id="s990">She was...she was Jewish.</span> <span id="s991">Uh, she was a lung specialist.</span> <span id="s992">And she had nothing to work with.</span> <span id="s993">Absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s994">The only thing she had was hot water, and maybe some pain killer.</span> <span id="s995">I had no pain.</span> <span id="s996">I was just very, very weak.</span> <span id="s997">And uh, I guess she said I had more temperature than I really had.</span> <span id="s998">Otherwise, I would have to be out.</span> <span id="s999">I'm sure because I could hardly walk.</span> <span id="s1000">I uh, also had an inflamed thumb.</span> <span id="s1001">And that was throbbing and that was...got red up here and I had no water.</span> <span id="s1002">I had nothing to...but in the factory where I was working on that machine, there was a file with a point and with that file I opened...filth.</span> <span id="s1003">I opened it.</span> <span id="s1004">The pus came out.</span> <span id="s1005">Nothing happened.</span> <span id="s1006">(laughs) Nothing happened.</span> <span id="s1007">I had scarlet fever and nothing happened.</span> <span id="s1008">I..</span> <span id="s1009">.</span> <span id="s1010">That scarlet fever was still in Auschwitz because I brought it with me from the camp in uh Holland.</span> <span id="s1011">There was an epidemic of scarlet fever.</span> <span id="s1012">But uh I lived through all that and, uh, after we were cleaned.</span> <span id="s1013">After we so-called cleaned, uh the rooms were very cold because they opened them.</span> <span id="s1014">I don't know where they had the idea when the opened the window everything is clean you know.</span> <span id="s1015">We had no mattresses anymore, we had just the plain wood.</span> <span id="s1016">We did have some...the blankets were gone.</span> <span id="s1017">The mattresses disappeared, and, uh, I have one uh experience which upset me afterwards very much.</span> <span id="s1018">What I did.</span> <span id="s1019">One time I..</span> <span id="s1020">.</span> <span id="s1021">when we came...when I came home from work, I found a mattress in a bed nobody was in and took the mattress and covered myself and then when the others came, somebody was pulling on the mattress...wanted this mattress.</span> <span id="s1022">So we were sleeping on, on loose boards, you know the...and I took one of...I got. . .I jumped out of bed.</span> <span id="s1023">I took the board and lifting it up over her head, I thought I wanted to kill her.</span> <span id="s1024">Taking my mattress.</span> <span id="s1025">I mean that was just the most important thing.</span> <span id="s1026">This protected me from this horrible cold.</span> <span id="s1027">And that I really wanted to kill somebody.</span> <span id="s1028">She dropped the mattress.</span> <span id="s1029">She got (laugh) got scared.</span> <span id="s1030">And I really probably would have.</span> <span id="s1031">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1032">Uh, in...also, there's another experience in this...in uh Kratzau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">That's what I had started, and I thought it was in Auschwitz uh the factory had no material anymore, but the...those women from the SS had to do something, so they made us bringing coal from one corner to the other in the court, in those...you call those things with two wheels.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: The carts or the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: The cart, ja.</span> <span id="s1036">So we always marched by...with a full one and there with an empty one.</span> <span id="s1037">One time I when I came by I thought, "She's a nice looking young woman."</span> <span id="s1038">She speaks German.</span> <span id="s1039">I said uh, "I'm glad that I learn a job for after the war."</span> <span id="s1040">So she looked at me and she stopped and I stopped.</span> <span id="s1041">She said, "What do you mean."</span> <span id="s1042">I said, "I can always go as a mover."</span> <span id="s1043">She said, "That's a wonderful idea."</span> <span id="s1044">So then I went on and I came back.</span> <span id="s1045">She was surprised that I spoke fluently German.</span> <span id="s1046">She said uh, "You come from Germany?"</span> <span id="s1047">And I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s1048">She said uh, "Why are you here?"</span> <span id="s1049">I said, "What a question."</span> <span id="s1050">"What did you do that you are here?"</span> <span id="s1051">I said, "I didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s1052">I'm Jewish."</span> <span id="s1053">"No," she said, "You are all criminals.</span> <span id="s1054">You all have done something.</span> <span id="s1055">Look what you look like.</span> <span id="s1056">The kind of clothes you are wearing."</span> <span id="s1057">I said, "You really think those are our clothes?"</span> <span id="s1058">She got, uh, a little...she said was a little funny because I spoke very good German, not like one who maybe was a criminal in any shape or form.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">There was another woman going by.</span> <span id="s1060">I said, "Look at that woman with her cart.</span> <span id="s1061">She has a Ph.D.</span> <span id="s1062">Her father had one of the largest wine cellars in Amsterdam."</span> <span id="s1063">She said, "You are, you're out of your mind."</span> <span id="s1064">So I went on.</span> <span id="s1065">When I came back, then she looked me over again, she didn't talk to me anymore.</span> <span id="s1066">I asked her what she was doing.</span> <span id="s1067">I know.</span> <span id="s1068">I said, "What are you doing or what did you do?"</span> <span id="s1069">She said, "I was a teacher in Hamburg."</span> <span id="s1070">She...they were told that we were criminals.</span> <span id="s1071">I said, "Our clothes were all taken from us.</span> <span id="s1072">Those are clothes from other people, what you see, and they were never washed."</span> <span id="s1073">Yet was a very interesting (laugh) conversation.</span> <span id="s1074">I hope that it sticks in her mind.</span> <span id="s1075">(laugh) That's all I can say to that.</span> <span id="s1076">When we came closer to the end of the war, I think that's what you want to know.</span> <span id="s1077">The, uh, ...and we were so-called clean, ready for the Russians...we were all very sick...because of the food and of diarrhea and the whole place was messy...24 hours.</span> <span id="s1078">And, uh, we were one time again taken to another place where we were examined by a group of doctors and, uh, the German doctors, they talked German to each other.</span> <span id="s1079">And so, they uh...when they saw...when I was...it was my turn, so they, uh, tried the nipple . . .to press my nipple and I pushed back and so one said to the other I had such an edema- my stomach was so swollen.</span> <span id="s1080">He said I could have bet that she's pregnant.</span> <span id="s1081">And, uh, I I said, "That would be a medical miracle."</span> <span id="s1082">They pushed each other.</span> <span id="s1083">They couldn't understand that somebody would say that at that...at that moment.</span> <span id="s1084">But uh, that was about all they did.</span> <span id="s1085">They saw the edemas.</span> <span id="s1086">But, uh, we were walking still on our legs.</span> <span id="s1087">But then one morning when we came out into the cold, the Germans were gone.</span> <span id="s1088">The war was over.</span> <span id="s1089">It was May 9th- that's very late.</span> <span id="s1090">And, uh, the gates were open, and I marched out of the gate.</span> <span id="s1091">I wanted to see it.</span> <span id="s1092">I saw the lilies of the valley right in front, and I went into town.</span> <span id="s1093">The town we had walked through every day and I always admired the butcher shop because he had a lot of sausages hanging there.</span> <span id="s1094">And, uh, one day there was as I saw on the street, a little dog, such a round dog, and I said to the girl, "Wouldn't that be good roasted?"</span> <span id="s1095">(laugh) And later, many later years when I told that to my husband, he couldn't believe that, that somebody would eat a roasted dog.</span> <span id="s1096">I said, "Sure, I would have eaten anything."</span> <span id="s1097">He could never understand that.</span> <span id="s1098">So I saw the butcher shop when the war was over, and I went in.</span> <span id="s1099">And I said if he would have some sausage for me.</span> <span id="s1100">He said, "No."</span> <span id="s1101">And I walked the street, and there was a Russian standing there, a soldier.</span> <span id="s1102">He had a piece of black bread in one hand and a chicken leg in the other, and I walked up to him and I don't know Russian.</span> <span id="s1103">I pointed to my stomach and to my mouth, and he give me both.</span> <span id="s1104">Made me so sick.</span> <span id="s1105">(laugh) It was much too rich.</span> <span id="s1106">But that was the first day, and the third day I decided I was going home.</span> <span id="s1107">I did not want to wait for what the uh, the owner...not . . .the man in charge of the factory, what he said to us, we should wait until the American or the International Red Cross would come and pick us all up, bring us to the countries where we belonged.</span> <span id="s1108">I didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s1109">I wanted to go home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: Tell me a moment about the owner of the factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: Was not owner.</span> <span id="s1112">It was...must have been a, as I said before, a trustee.</span> <span id="s1113">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: The owner of the factory, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1115">There were Germans who worked there, and they must have left uh when the Russians came so close and came there.</span> <span id="s1116">And, uh, the, uh, the Russians came on the second day with the soup kitchen.</span> <span id="s1117">And it was filthy, and the place was not clean because I left on the 12th and I didn't want to stay there and wait.</span> <span id="s1118">I just had to go.</span> <span id="s1119">Did not know where Kratzau was.</span> <span id="s1120">I only know I had to go west.</span> <span id="s1121">That's all I knew.</span> <span id="s1122">And a 16 year old girl who was with the group from Amsterdam, she wanted to come with me.</span> <span id="s1123">And I didn't want her.</span> <span id="s1124">And I said it a few times.</span> <span id="s1125">I said, "I don't want to take the responsibility.</span> <span id="s1126">I'm going to places where I don't know myself."</span> <span id="s1127">And, uh, "Oh," she said, "I want to go home.</span> <span id="s1128">I want to find my mother.</span> <span id="s1129">And you speak German.</span> <span id="s1130">You can do it."</span> <span id="s1131">So, she went with me, and uh come to the next station walking...train station, and there were not no trains anymore at all.</span> <span id="s1132">So she said, "What are we going to do now?"</span> <span id="s1133">And uh, I said, "I really don't know what we are going to do now.</span> <span id="s1134">I suggest we go to the next town.</span> <span id="s1135">Sit in the center of the town.</span> <span id="s1136">They always have something green there.</span> <span id="s1137">And the way we look women will come.</span> <span id="s1138">They are curious.</span> <span id="s1139">They will ask us who we are?"</span> <span id="s1140">So the women came!</span> <span id="s1141">And they said, uh, they could do something for us.</span> <span id="s1142">They spoke German--in Sudaten.</span> <span id="s1143">And uh, I said we would like to get hot water to wash ourselves.</span> <span id="s1144">We would like to get a bed, and we also would like something to eat.</span> <span id="s1145">She said you can have all that to eat.</span> <span id="s1146">She said, "A chicken died today."</span> <span id="s1147">If you want me, I'll prepare it for you.</span> <span id="s1148">I said, "Why not?</span> <span id="s1149">I have always have eaten dead chickens."</span> <span id="s1150">(laughter) They were never alive.</span> <span id="s1151">I was so happy with that chicken.</span> <span id="s1152">She boiled it and it was very good and we could clean ourselves.</span> <span id="s1153">And uh, the next day we went on and found another town where they told us that probably that day a train would come, probably.</span> <span id="s1154">And a train did come and we just went on.</span> <span id="s1155">There was nobody to talk to and, uh, during the night the train stopped and the Russians came on to the train.</span> <span id="s1156">They had flashlights and they looked...had the flashlights on us and then they touched our...touched us here [points to stomach] and then they wanted to go and then I said again my stomach that we are hungry.</span> <span id="s1157">So they gave us sardines.</span> <span id="s1158">(laughs) Sardines.</span> <span id="s1159">So I I said, they would have to open it.</span> <span id="s1160">We had nothing.</span> <span id="s1161">And they did.</span> <span id="s1162">I found out not too much later that they were looking for Germans to take them back and then feeling here and the rest they felt we were women, because you, you know, the way we looked and the hair and all that, they didn't know what it was.</span> <span id="s1163">But, uh, that's how they found out we were women and left us alone and gave us the sardines.</span> <span id="s1164">So uh we took a lot of trains.</span> <span id="s1165">We took one train that was...uh a train with all beds.</span> <span id="s1166">German train with all beds, white, clean...was wonderful...just wonderful.</span> <span id="s1167">There was no food there, but there was a good bed.</span> <span id="s1168">And when the train stopped and we went into town, we begged.</span> <span id="s1169">I begged for bread.</span> <span id="s1170">I only wanted bread.</span> <span id="s1171">Because I was used to that bread takes away the hunger.</span> <span id="s1172">Bread and water was fine.</span> <span id="s1173">In some place, they had nothing.</span> <span id="s1174">They give us an umbrella.</span> <span id="s1175">(laugh) That was the...the, the .</span> <span id="s1176">.</span> <span id="s1177">.</span> <span id="s1178">uh, the mayor's office we went in...we didn't know, and they gave us an umbrella.</span> <span id="s1179">And I said, "Thank you."</span> <span id="s1180">And they had no food.</span> <span id="s1181">So I took the umbrella and I put it throw away.</span> <span id="s1182">Was dumb, probably I could have changed it for some bread.</span> <span id="s1183">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: How long did it take you to get to where you were going at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: Home?</span> <span id="s1186">Six and one half weeks.</span> <span id="s1187">But, uh, we came to the first American DP camp built.</span> <span id="s1188">It was just finished in Plzen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q: How long were you in Plzen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: In Plzen, we were told that the DP camp was being built, that we should look for it.</span> <span id="s1191">And we found it.</span> <span id="s1192">And there were about 400 people there already all lying in the big gymnasium, something like it, on the floor.</span> <span id="s1193">Men and women who had been uh workers, who had been picked up in different countries, and everybody wanted to go a different place.</span> <span id="s1194">They were there and had blankets and we were all lying on the floor.</span> <span id="s1195">There were no Jews.</span> <span id="s1196">We were the only Jews.</span> <span id="s1197">And that was a strange thing.</span> <span id="s1198">We couldn't...I couldn't understand that.</span> <span id="s1199">So then we were a little bit examined, and we became uh double rations and that started anti-Semitism in those four or five hundred people.</span> <span id="s1200">That the Jews here, look what they give those women.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Was difficult, very difficult, until then the Americans had trucks, open trucks and brought us farther west because that's where we wanted to go.</span> <span id="s1202">Also, there was a lists going from this place all over the world who was there surviving, and that came to Chicago and they found out to Chicago... sorry...to Amsterdam to find out that I was alive, but they didn't know where.</span> <span id="s1203">They only knew the name was there.</span> <span id="s1204">That was all those lists were...Chicago.</span> <span id="s1205">(laughs) And, uh, we were in an open truck to Leipzig where there was a very large DP camp, about 25,000, and there were maybe 25 Jews.</span> <span id="s1206">That was all.</span> <span id="s1207">Uh, there I went to...I asked I wanted to go to a gynecologist.</span> <span id="s1208">I wanted to find out if they would do something to me that I was not...uh, had not, all that time, uh, no ...what's the word?</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Q: 'Cause you were not menstruating?</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s1211">Ja.</span> <span id="s1212">So, uh, and this was a German gynecologist, and he looked at me and I looked a little funny.</span> <span id="s1213">By that time I was clean.</span> <span id="s1214">By that time I had no lice anymore because there was a medical tent in this camp and I walked in with my little friend and I said, "Listen, we have so much lice.</span> <span id="s1215">Can you help us?</span> <span id="s1216">The Germans have tried to delouse us so many times, they never could."</span> <span id="s1217">"That's nothing," they said.</span> <span id="s1218">We wanted to take our dress off and they said, "Don't do that."</span> <span id="s1219">They had a large spray machine which was used to discharge white powder under the arms and under the skirt, and two hours later all those lice were dead and I thought the Americans they really know it.</span> <span id="s1220">They had DDT and they didn't know at that time, they had killed more than lice.</span> <span id="s1221">So I went to this doctor, because I was clean and he looked at me and he looked at all the edemas, and he said uh, "Where were you?</span> <span id="s1222">Where do you come from?"</span> <span id="s1223">I said, "I was in uh extermination camp."</span> <span id="s1224">He called his nurse in.</span> <span id="s1225">.</span> <span id="s1226">and he said, "Listen what that woman says.</span> <span id="s1227">Look what she looks like.</span> <span id="s1228">70 pounds and swollen."</span> <span id="s1229">He said, "Tell me."</span> <span id="s1230">So he and she, they listened.</span> <span id="s1231">He did not know those details.</span> <span id="s1232">He had no idea.</span> <span id="s1233">He surely knew that the Jews had been gone, but he did not know what they had done to them.</span> <span id="s1234">That was in the city of Leipzig.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: We have relatively little time I would like to move us to what happened when you came back to Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">A: Ja.</span> <span id="s1237">That is.</span> <span id="s1238">.</span> <span id="s1239">Ja.</span> <span id="s1240">The, uh...when I came to the border.</span> <span id="s1241">We came to the border with an American train.</span> <span id="s1242">Took six days because we had to built pontoon bridges.</span> <span id="s1243">The American soldiers did not give us anything to eat or to drink.</span> <span id="s1244">They didn't understand what I meant when I said that we had nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s1245">They didn't understand.</span> <span id="s1246">Six days.</span> <span id="s1247">We were very sick.</span> <span id="s1248">We came to the border.</span> <span id="s1249">We had to walk over the border because the train only stopped there and we got into an office.</span> <span id="s1250">We only could get on the train if you said you were uh, a Dutch citizen, which I said and I was not, and uh, the bureaucracy came and I, as a good German, said right away, "I am not a Dutch citizen.</span> <span id="s1251">I am stateless."</span> <span id="s1252">And the man had never heard what stateless is, but that young girl with me who was very happy to be home said, "Be careful with that woman.</span> <span id="s1253">She is a German, and she is an enemy of our country."</span> <span id="s1254">She confused that man completely and he put me in jail.</span> <span id="s1255">And, uh, I've never seen her again.</span> <span id="s1256">I didn't want to see her.</span> <span id="s1257">She was in Holland.</span> <span id="s1258">She was saved.</span> <span id="s1259">We were together for six and a half weeks.</span> <span id="s1260">I was a mother and she was a child, in a way.</span> <span id="s1261">And that's what happened.</span> <span id="s1262">Though uh, two days later the Rabbi of Eindoven that was the town where it happened, got me out of jail.</span> <span id="s1263">I don't know...I forgot his name, but he found out.</span> <span id="s1264">I don't know how, and I got with another lie and big screaming, uh,...permission to go to Amsterdam because there were no trains...there was no...and I wanted to go to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s1265">So I came there, and I found the people who had helped us and, uh, they told me that my daughter was fine, which was the most important thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q: Describe two things please.</span> <span id="s1267">The meeting with your daughter please, and then how you found your husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: I didn't find my husband.</span> <span id="s1269">He never came back.</span> <span id="s1270">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1271">Tell me what happened to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: I'm sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: Ja.</span> <span id="s1275">I don't know what happened.</span> <span id="s1276">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1277">I saw him the last time before I was going in to this place where the women were in the black dresses.</span> <span id="s1278">I never have seen him again and there is no...there is no record for the dead.</span> <span id="s1279">There's a record of the trains...the numbers of the trains and how many people were in the trains, all the trains deporting the Jews, you know that?</span> <span id="s1280">So I have it.</span> <span id="s1281">And, uh, all the trains I have been in are there, but they have no record of who died.</span> <span id="s1282">Uh, they told me that Doris was fine and the next day one of the friends had a jeep because there was nothing else and he brought me to that town where she was.</span> <span id="s1283">They had told her already that I had been sick and that I was better and I would come, but nobody knew when.</span> <span id="s1284">In that little village where she was, all the girls who had had relationships with German soldiers, when the war was over were brought into the center of the city and their heads were shaved.</span> <span id="s1285">And she thought it was so funny.</span> <span id="s1286">Kids, you know, you know, they didn't understand.</span> <span id="s1287">And so here I was with a shaved head and she looked at me and she said, "Are you my mother?"</span> <span id="s1288">I said, "Yes, I'm your mother."</span> <span id="s1289">I didn't come close to her.</span> <span id="s1290">I didn't touch her.</span> <span id="s1291">And she was eating lunch because afternoon school starts she said, "I would like to go to school that...she said to our friend, Rinus, she said, "Rinus, If you could bring me with your jeep to the school, I would like the kids to see the jeep.</span> <span id="s1292">So that's what they did.</span> <span id="s1293">Not me.</span> <span id="s1294">And, uh, I did something very wrong.</span> <span id="s1295">I asked the lady where she was if I could take her with me that day.</span> <span id="s1296">Leave everything there.</span> <span id="s1297">Anyway probably thinking I bring her back, but I didn't.</span> <span id="s1298">I took her with me.</span> <span id="s1299">And we had nothing.</span> <span id="s1300">We had no bed.</span> <span id="s1301">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1302">I uh, felt I needed her.</span> <span id="s1303">I needed her very much.</span> <span id="s1304">We need our children more than they need us.</span> <span id="s1305">That's something I have learned.</span> <span id="s1306">I needed her and I did it.</span> <span id="s1307">So uh, some of the friends gave us a room with one bed and we slept there.</span> <span id="s1308">We, uh...we made it.</span> <span id="s1309">We got rooms and we could rent because there was no place and, uh, since my husband didn't come back.</span> <span id="s1310">A year and a half later we went to the United States where my parents were.</span> <span id="s1311">And she was very happy to have grandparents, to have uh, cousins, uncles...we didn't have.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">Q: Did the two of you...Did she adjust to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">A: It must have taken her a long time.</span> <span id="s1314">I don't think that I was aware of what I had done to take her out of this secure home in this life with a woman who wasn't completely normal.</span> <span id="s1315">I'm convinced.</span> <span id="s1316">I was the only one who didn't know.</span> <span id="s1317">But I'm convinced.</span> <span id="s1318">And she, uh...I was only looking for a place for us to live that we were just like a family and that she would...she would be home and I'm the mother.</span> <span id="s1319">But we never discussed it, practically all our lives.</span> <span id="s1320">Uh, it was sometimes when she was maybe...that time when I picked her up she was seven-and-a- half.</span> <span id="s1321">Maybe when she was...when she was still in Amsterdam, one day she did something which I said she shouldn't.</span> <span id="s1322">She said, "I wish you wouldn't have come."</span> <span id="s1323">And that was the only time as a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1325">I think we are about done, and I thank you.</span> <span id="s1326">A: You're welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">Q: Very much.</span> <span id="s1328">Thank .</span> <span id="s1329">.</span> <span id="s1330">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">A: But my daughter had learned.</span> <span id="s1332">Ja, and we never discussed it.</span> <span id="s1333">Q: Did she know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">A: We never discussed it.</span> <span id="s1335">Uh, there is a book out about I Never Said Goodbye.</span> <span id="s1336">Q: Ya.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">A: You know it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">Q: Ya.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">A: And I..</span> <span id="s1340">.</span> <span id="s1341">when it came out, there was a write up in the paper, and she happened to be visiting from Israel, and I said, "That's a very interesting book.</span> <span id="s1342">I would like to read it."</span> <span id="s1343">And she looked at it.</span> <span id="s1344">I said, I'm only very much upset that all those people who say they were abandoned, say that still after they have children themselves.</span> <span id="s1345">Don't they want to protect their children?"</span> <span id="s1346">"No," she said, "I can understand."</span> <span id="s1347">I wasn't abandoned.</span> <span id="s1348">It was the first time, and, uh, "I said I will never learn that, never and never accept it."</span> <span id="s1349">She uh, went to New York then, and then she found the book and she send it to me and she put in there, "Thank you for giving me life twice."</span> <span id="s1350">It wasn't necessary to discuss it.</span> <span id="s1351">Really.</span> <span id="s1352">It would have made our relationship painful if we would have discussed it.</span> <span id="s1353">If I would have constantly heard that I see it from the wrong way then I never could.</span> <span id="s1354">So that...um that she has understood after all those years.</span> <span id="s1355">We have a very good relationship now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: That is good.</span> <span id="s1357">When did she first know...that, when did you first tell her that you had not just been sick?</span> <span id="s1358">How old was she when you picked her up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">A: When I picked her up she was seven-and-a-half.</span> <span id="s1360">Oh, I talked about the camp to anybody.</span> <span id="s1361">Q: Oh, you did?</span> <span id="s1362">Okay.</span> <span id="s1363">So she knew then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: Ja, but it was . . .it didn't really sink in that . . .No, no really not at that time- much later.</span> <span id="s1365">And when I started to study all the books, much later, when I started to speak, she, in some way I</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">End of Tape #2 Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
