Side 1 – Jan. 24, 1979.</span></p> <p><span id="s3">Q: Ready to start.</span> <span id="s4">Mr. Feenstra, I guess I wasn’t given your first name</span></p> <p><span id="s5">A: Joe.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Q: Joe.</span> <span id="s7">Joseph?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: No, it is not Joseph.</span> <span id="s9">It is Johannes.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">Q: Johannes.</span> <span id="s11">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: Johannes Hendricas.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: Hendricas Feenstra?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: And you were born in the Netherlands?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: Yes, in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s17">On January 30, 1916.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: And you lived there until?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: We lived in Amsterdam until 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: All through the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s22">In 1948 we moved to Indonesia.</span> <span id="s23">We lived in Indonesia for about eight years and, in the meantime, we went once with Golfoloph Uloph to Holland in 1950 and, in the meantime, Indonesia became independent in 1950 and the Indonesian government asked us if we would come back and we did and in 1955 we left Indonesia and went back to Holland and we lived for a short time in Holland.</span> <span id="s24">We emigrated to the United States in 1956.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: You’ve been in Dayton since then?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s27">We came directly to Dayton.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: So you’ve been here 20 years or more.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Twenty-two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: Had your father’s family lived in Amsterdam?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: My father was born in Friesland, the northern province of Holland, and he moved as a young man to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s32">My mother was born in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s33">I just looked it up yesterday.</span> <span id="s34">My father would have been, if he was alive, 105 years old today.</span> <span id="s35">He was here in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: He visited you here in Dayton?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: Yes, when he was 92 years old.</span> <span id="s38">He came for the first time in an airplane and came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: The Dutch are a hardy stock.</span> <span id="s40">What was his occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: My father was in diamond design.</span> <span id="s42">See what you can get out of the rough diamond to get the most beauty out of the stone by cutting and grinding it on different tables.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: He learned that after he came to Amsterdam?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: Yes, he learned that in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s45">During that time, there were three cities in the world for the diamond industry.</span> <span id="s46">The largest industry was in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s47">Later a part went to Antwerp, Belgium but it is still a quite important diamond center.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Were you a religious family?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: No, my father was really what you can call an atheist and my mother was Roman Catholic.</span> <span id="s50">And so, I was really nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: Nothing in that sense.</span> <span id="s52">Was your family politically interested?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: My father was.</span> <span id="s54">My father was a Socialist, what you call Social Democrat.</span> <span id="s55">I think I caught a little bit of that from my father, the social democratic way of living.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Were there brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: I have one brother who is still alive.</span> <span id="s58">He’s 77.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: Still in Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: He still lives in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: So political questions and political issues were talked about at home quite a bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Quite a bit, yes.</span> <span id="s63">My brother was, in the war years, even more towards the Socialism, more to the left, but became over the years more conservative by having his own business and, you know, people can change their minds.</span> <span id="s64">That happened to him real strongly, from being a social thinking man he became a more conservative thinking man.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Were you and he together in political involvement?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: No, no, our ages were too different.</span> <span id="s67">He is 14 years older than I am so there was not much going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: What was your education?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: My education was I went first to elementary school and then to high school and from there I went to the dental school and from dental school I opened my own office in Amsterdam in 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: In 1938 you opened an office as a dentist?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Until 1948 and in 1948 we moved to Indonesia.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Did you practice dentistry there?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: Yes, I practiced in the hospital in Indonesia.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Are you still working as a dentist?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: No, I can’t.</span> <span id="s76">You see, you have to go back to dental school here in the United States and when we came to the United States I was already 40 years old.</span> <span id="s77">My oldest daughter -- I have two daughters -- my oldest daughter was already close to going to college and so, we were talking about what to do, who should go to college.</span> <span id="s78">And since I was already, let’s say, over the hill……</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: It would have taken several years, I suppose.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Yes, about three years.</span> <span id="s81">So we said that our daughter is of the age and she has her whole life ahead of her.</span> <span id="s82">So we thought it was better to let her go to college instead of me.</span> <span id="s83">And secondly, we couldn’t afford it for me to go to Columbus or Cleveland where the dental school is, and the family -- we couldn’t make it financially.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Was all of your education in Amsterdam?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: No, part of my education was in Germany and so, my dental education was mostly in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Mostly in Germany?</span> <span id="s87">In Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: No, in Cologne.</span> <span id="s89">And from there I came back to Amsterdam and opened my office.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: What sort of practice?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: General dentistry.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: You started from scratch?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: You could say so.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Just by yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: My wife is in the same profession and so, we worked together.</span> <span id="s96">So, when I was arrested in 1942 -- this is something that comes later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: You were married in 1938?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: We got married in 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: You came back and married a hometown girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: No, it was not a hometown girl.</span> <span id="s101">My wife was from Cologne.</span> <span id="s102">But she lived in Holland and we went together to dental school.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: She came back home with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: She came back to my home but, let’s see, this is not correct.</span> <span id="s105">My wife lived in Holland since 1933 with her mother and went to dental school in Cologne.</span> <span id="s106">From there we came back together, so she had lived in Holland before we met.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Being born in the Netherlands and going to school in Germany, you must have spoken at least German and Dutch then, and perhaps other languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: The language, I think, is not such a problem.</span> <span id="s109">If you have to speak the language it comes a little easier.</span> <span id="s110">That way, you just go to school and learn a little bit about it.</span> <span id="s111">It was the same way when we came to the United States.</span> <span id="s112">Our English which we picked up in high school many years ago and, you know, if you don’t use it you forget so much about it.</span> <span id="s113">What we called in high school was really English English (spoken in the U.K).</span> <span id="s114">You know, something like: “We will have tea in the car.”</span> <span id="s115">And so, it was kind of strange for use and we had to start from scratch.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: I’m envious of European people who are born and raised in Europe because it’s much more comfortable for you to speak a number of languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: The country is small.</span> <span id="s118">Holland is 155 miles long by about 90 miles wide and then you are in another country.</span> <span id="s119">If you go to the east, you are in Germany.</span> <span id="s120">If you go to the south, you are in Belgium and you have to speak Flemish and a little further, you speak French.</span> <span id="s121">I mean, the distance is so small that is the reason you have to (speak other languages).</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Most anyone who is a professional person would speak a number of languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Quite a few people who speak three or four languages besides their mother language speak mostly French and German and English.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: I wonder if maybe Europeans, on that account, have an adaptability that Americans may not have.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: The chances for an American to speak a foreign language is not so available as it is for people living in Europe.</span> <span id="s126">But, on the other side, I always see here there is not much interest in learning a foreign language.</span> <span id="s127">My daughter is a teacher, and, at the moment, she is teaching German in Sinclair College.</span> <span id="s128">And she teaches French and German and she has her Masters degree from Indiana University.</span> <span id="s129">But she could not find a job here in the high school for the simple reason she had too much education.</span> <span id="s130">She had a Masters degree.</span> <span id="s131">If she didn’t have a Master’s degree, she would have a job here in the school.</span> <span id="s132">But while she had a Master’s degree, she came into high class or, what you call it, and no job.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: We are missing out, I think.</span> <span id="s134">American young people miss out because of that.</span> <span id="s135">I admire that quality.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Besides that, I think there are people here in the United States who are quite dumb with languages.</span> <span id="s137">I can remember so well, we were in 1950 in Indonesia and Indonesia became independent.</span> <span id="s138">And all the ambassadorial staff and cultural centers had to be changed when it became independent.</span> <span id="s139">So a whole new group of people from all different countries came.</span> <span id="s140">The United States installed about 120 people in the Embassy in Jakarta and not a single one spoke the Malaysian or Indonesian languages.</span> <span id="s141">The Russians came, with 85 people; from the top, the Ambassador, to the bottom, the chauffeur, all spoke fluently both languages.</span> <span id="s142">This is where we went wrong.</span> <span id="s143">They could speak with anybody on the street in his own language.</span> <span id="s144">When we came, we spoke English but they didn’t understand.</span> <span id="s145">We always think that everybody has to speak English and I don’t think it is any different.</span> <span id="s146">I wish it was true that we could speak over the whole world the same language.</span> <span id="s147">It would be a beautiful thing and I think we would have much fewer conflicts and wars going on if we could speak to each other in the same language.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: The Americans need to learn not only more languages but also to have first-hand access to the tragedies of Europe, too.</span> <span id="s149">That’s part of the purpose of listening to you and hearing what you have to say.</span> <span id="s150">So, let’s see, the Germans came into the Netherlands -- wasn’t it 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: May, 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Were you politically involved ever before that?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: I was not politically involved.</span> <span id="s154">I was only, well let me see, in 1940 I was 24 years old.</span> <span id="s155">So, really, I was not politically active.</span> <span id="s156">I didn’t belong to a party.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: How was it, then, that you were the one who the Germans would want to put into a camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: That happened in 1942.</span> <span id="s159">It was two years later.</span> <span id="s160">The war was already going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Two years of German occupation had taken place by that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Yes, and that is, I think, where Hitler went wrong, in my opinion.</span> <span id="s163">See, the first two years I can say that they weren’t too bad.</span> <span id="s164">Your life was going on pretty smoothly as it was before.</span> <span id="s165">There were some restrictions.</span> <span id="s166">Let’s say you weren’t allowed to listen to the radio, to the English radio or any foreign radio, only to the German radio and to the Dutch radio.</span> <span id="s167">And things like that, you know.</span> <span id="s168">But for the rest of life, things were going on pretty normally.</span> <span id="s169">And then Hitler went wrong.</span> <span id="s170">He started with the Jews.</span> <span id="s171">Now there was one thing in all Holland and that is freedom for everybody, whether you were Catholic or Jew or Reformed or whatever you were, it didn’t make any difference.</span> <span id="s172">This feeling of the Dutch people, and I think this was one of the reasons why so many Dutch people went and emigrated to the United States, for the religious freedom.</span> <span id="s173">Anyway, Hitler started to get after the Jews and arrested them and pogroms followed.</span> <span id="s174">That was something that the Dutch people didn’t like, so they had strikes and the streetcars didn’t run and all the things more to bring things to a standstill.</span> <span id="s175">This was something the Germans didn’t like; that something gets disturbed.</span> <span id="s176">If they wouldn’t have started with the Jews, I don’t think that there would have been much of an Underground.</span> <span id="s177">You know, formal action.</span> <span id="s178">That came more in 1942, really.</span> <span id="s179">There was kind of an underground (from the beginning), but it wasn’t that strong.</span> <span id="s180">The Queen was in England; the entire government was in England, and they gave us instructions over the radio, real secretly.</span> <span id="s181">You could listen once in a while, if someone watched.</span> <span id="s182">Then the Germans took all of the radios.</span> <span id="s183">However some people kept them, you know.</span> <span id="s184">People came together in the evening and secretly listened to the radio.</span> <span id="s185">But I think that if that would not have happened, there would not have been such a strong underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Do you remember the date when the anti-Jewish policy began?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: That was about, I think, in February, 1942.</span> <span id="s188">I mean, when it started really.</span> <span id="s189">I can look it up for you if you are interested in the correct date but that is in my mind that it really started then.</span> <span id="s190">We had in our house every evening -- the radio programs are always in the evening -- during the night.</span> <span id="s191">We had quite a few friends of ours, Jewish people, who came to our house and stayed the night with us.</span> <span id="s192">Then, in the morning you went home again or to work, whatever they were doing.</span> <span id="s193">That was really the beginning of the strong underground work.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: The beginning of your involvement?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: My involvement with the underground, also.</span> <span id="s196">Everyone needed kind of an identification card with a fingerprint on it and a picture.</span> <span id="s197">And the Jewish people had a big “J” for Jew stamped on it.</span> <span id="s198">Now, what we did was to do the falsification of the identification cards for the Jewish people and we tried to push as much as possible to get the Jewish people out of Holland to Belgium and from Belgium to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s199">And from there we tried for Portugal and the United States or England.</span> <span id="s200">That was what we tried, you know, but many people don’t want to go so easily.</span> <span id="s201">You know, if you have your house and family, you know, you just don’t pack up and say, “Up, let’s go!”</span> <span id="s202">I don’t think the Jewish people did see, at that time, how dangerous it would be, you know, in the near future.</span> <span id="s203">I think the Jewish people still had the hope that it wouldn’t be that bad, not knowing what really was coming up.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: There were people who didn’t think that it would be as serious as it came to be?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: I think that there were some people who had seen it in Germany.</span> <span id="s206">They always say in Germany, “We didn’t know!”</span> <span id="s207">Well, that is a whole lot of baloney.</span> <span id="s208">We knew in Holland in 1938 and 1939 that there were concentration camps in Germany, so the German people can never say: “We didn’t know!”</span> <span id="s209">We knew it in Holland, you know.</span> <span id="s210">That was one of the real reasons why the Dutch people got really aggravated and upset that things like that could happen.</span> <span id="s211">You know that Jewish people were picked up in the street and just sent to Germany.</span> <span id="s212">You know, we didn’t know where in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: I wondered.</span> <span id="s214">Kristallnacht has come to be a special word.</span> <span id="s215">That is November 10, 1938 when Jewish shops and businesses were looted and burned and broken into, all over Germany.</span> <span id="s216">Did that Kristallnacht make an impression?</span> <span id="s217">You must have heard about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Oh, yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Was that something much different than what had been happening in Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: Well, it became the same in Holland after 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: Yes, that they burned up the Jewish stores.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: I was just wondering if, when the actual Kristallnacht took place, that people began to have their own eyes opened for the first time, or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: You see, we in Holland, we knew about it, but there wasn’t much you could do.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: It wasn’t that they began to see Hitler and the Nazi party in a new way after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: Oh yes, they really saw that, but, I mean, nobody did anything.</span> <span id="s227">England, with all its military possibility, didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s228">The U.S. didn’t interfere.</span> <span id="s229">Nobody interfered with it, so it went like a big oil spot, you know, bigger and bigger.</span> <span id="s230">There is one thing.</span> <span id="s231">I don’t know if I’m right or if I think just that way, in Germany there was a real Jewish proletariat.</span> <span id="s232">Is that the correct term, do you pronounce it proletariat?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: There was a proletariat in Poland and in Lithuania, in Czechoslovakia and in Holland; you know, a Jewish proletariat, a strong Jewish proletariat.</span> <span id="s235">But in Germany there were mostly big business people.</span> <span id="s236">Oh, you know, factories and stores and things like that.</span> <span id="s237">They didn’t have a real Jewish proletariat.</span> <span id="s238">That had something to do with it.</span> <span id="s239">They always said the Jews had all the money.</span> <span id="s240">You know, we are poor and the Jews have all the money, all the big stores, and the banks.</span> <span id="s241">They have everything.</span> <span id="s242">You know, that is a possibility but I always had a feeling that it started this thing much more than it was in the other countries.</span> <span id="s243">Well, that is my personal feeling, maybe I am wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: Well, that is an insight.</span> <span id="s245">I was not aware of it.</span> <span id="s246">Well, the Germans, then came in June or summer of 1940, wasn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: In May.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: May of 1940.</span> <span id="s249">And in rapid order invaded the various Low Countries?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: Yes, they went into Holland, Belgium, down to France and it went so fast.</span> <span id="s251">We had only four days of war.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: And the Blitzkrieg over to England, in June of 1940, wasn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: If Hitler would have gone on from France right then, England never could have stopped him.</span> <span id="s254">But he stopped at that time at the ocean, at the coast of France.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Maybe he thought that the English were Aryans and would wake up to his type of thinking.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: If he would have gone there, there was no way for England to stop him.</span> <span id="s257">Germany was so strong.</span> <span id="s258">Oh, they were so strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Oh, it must have been that people never thought that it would get as bad as it did and then each year, it got a little worse and worse.</span> <span id="s260">That is, in 1942 and ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: That is like a frog in water, maybe, that you warm it up and finally the frog is boiled, before you know it.</span> <span id="s263">Maybe that would explain why there wasn’t a massive resistance.</span> <span id="s264">But what really made the difference, do you think, as far as the formation of an underground….</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: There was an underground before that, but not strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Was there sabotage going on before that?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Not much!</span> <span id="s268">Here and there, you know, some small groups, not in a large one.</span> <span id="s269">See, there was a four-day war and the Germans came in so fast.</span> <span id="s270">When they saw that they couldn’t get through as fast as they wanted to, they just threw so many bombs against Rotterdam.</span> <span id="s271">And they ruined that city.</span> <span id="s272">The city of Rotterdam is gone!</span> <span id="s273">That was the end of this government.</span> <span id="s274">The government went to England and that was the end of it!</span> <span id="s275">Then life took over and everyone started working and there really wasn’t that much.</span> <span id="s276">In the beginning, they were quite, let’s say, friendly.</span> <span id="s277">There were certain laws which, in the opinion of the Dutch, were not bad.</span> <span id="s278">Let’s say we got the socialized medicine.</span> <span id="s279">That was pretty good and all the people would be taken care of.</span> <span id="s280">There were certain laws which were not so bad.</span> <span id="s281">I am really saying that if he would not have started in 1942 with this Jewish people, it would never have (been) an underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: That was just too much?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: That was the end of it, that was it.</span> <span id="s284">That we don’t accept.</span> <span id="s285">These are people and keep your hands off them!</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: There must have been an organization which formed to try to get Jews out of the country and to falsify identification cards and so on.</span> <span id="s287">Was that the same organization which had been there before, or was it a new organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: No, in that time, it was more individual groups.</span> <span id="s289">Small little groups who tried it.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: Little groups here and there?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: Who tried it in their own way.</span> <span id="s292">That was the reason why there were so many people arrested.</span> <span id="s293">You know, they didn’t know; there were not real underground troops.</span> <span id="s294">There were just people like I was, not knowing what you get into, to help your friends.</span> <span id="s295">And then, the whole thing fell apart.</span> <span id="s296">Somebody was arrested and they started talking and the whole group folded up.</span> <span id="s297">Now, later on, that was getting much more organized.</span> <span id="s298">In 1943 it was quite well organized.</span> <span id="s299">Not that many people got arrested anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: They were more skillful at it.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: Yes, more skillful.</span> <span id="s302">They went under different names, you know, moved to other cities and so on.</span> <span id="s303">The identification cards -- so many people had false identification cards, you know, with different names and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Were there Jewish people involved in the underground?</span> <span id="s305">Before?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: I don’t think that there were too many.</span> <span id="s307">If there were any, they were (operating under other names).</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: It would be riskier for them, anyhow!</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: That may be one of the reasons why they did it.</span> <span id="s310">If they got caught that was the end for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Even afterwards, the underground was not staffed with Jewish people/</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s313">Well, there were hardly any Jewish people left.</span> <span id="s314">By 1943 more than half of the Jewish population of Amsterdam was gone.</span> <span id="s315">And in 1944 there was hardly any left.</span> <span id="s316">Well, a few people who lived with Christian people, but they were hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: The question of Anne Frank was a case in point.</span> <span id="s318">Did you know the story about the Frank family at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: I don’t know about the Frank family, not personally.</span> <span id="s320">I didn’t know them.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: That has gotten to be so famous that now….</span> <span id="s322">.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: I didn’t.</span> <span id="s324">It was a beautiful play.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: The Diary of Anne Frank.</span> <span id="s327">They did it here in Dayton at the Kettering-Oakwood Theater.</span> <span id="s328">I directed the play!</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q; Oh, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: It had a really beautiful write-up in the Dayton Daily News.</span> <span id="s331">It is in the paper.</span> <span id="s332">A whole page.</span> <span id="s333">They described the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: Have you been interested in drama?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s336">I am a member of the K-O Theater.</span> <span id="s337">I mean, one of the founders of the K-O Theater.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: K-O Theater?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: K-O Theater is the Kettering-Oakwood Community Theater.</span> <span id="s340">We have a little theater in a little park.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: It is something like the Dayton Theater Guild, something similar.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s344">Okay, had you been involved in dramatics before?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s346">I did it already in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q; So you know a lot of people through that, as well as through your profession.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s349">I always loved it, even when I was a little boy, I was interested in theater.</span> <span id="s350">I always kept up with it, read quite a few plays.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: So, you were involved then from January ’42, when the anti-Jewish policy began.</span> <span id="s352">As I remember, you said January.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: Yes, January or February.</span> <span id="s354">I can look it up, the exact date, if you want to know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: I can ask you next time.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s358">So, you were involved in one of these informal groups to help one another.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: Informal groups.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: For how long could you keep that going?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Well we were working on that for about three or four months and we had quite a few identification cards printed and reprinted and so on.</span> <span id="s362">And then, one day, our oldest daughter, Melu, when she was born.</span> <span id="s363">My wife was still in the hospital, in the early morning they came and arrested me.</span> <span id="s364">First I tried to get out of it by playing dumb, that I didn’t know anything about it.</span> <span id="s365">But then they came up with names, you know, of people whom I worked together.</span> <span id="s366">So one of them, when they arrested him, must have told the whole story about all of us who were in that little group together, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q; That must have been May 0f ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A; No, that was in July of ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: So they took you right off?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: From your office?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: That was the end of it!</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: To a police station or to a Gestapo place?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: First they send me to what is called the SS, oh, kind of a polizei, that is wrong, police headquarters for the SS.</span> <span id="s375">And now they started, you know, the questioning.</span> <span id="s376">They told me most of what happened which they knew already from the other people who were arrested before me; of what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: That consisted of making ID cards and providing people with food and shelter and a hiding place.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s379">That was not even interesting to them, that we did that; it was mainly identification cards.</span> <span id="s380">That is what they arrested us for, mainly.</span> <span id="s381">And from there they send us, in the evening after a whole day of interrogation, to a jail in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s382">They kept me there for maybe six weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: That was a jail under the SS?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: Yes, completely under the SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Was it a new building or one that had taken over?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: No, one of the old jails.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: For six weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: Yes, about six weeks.</span> <span id="s389">And then from there they sent me to Amersfoort.</span> <span id="s390">That is a city in central Holland.</span> <span id="s391">That is what they called in German a Durchgangslager.</span> <span id="s392">That means that it is a step between jail and concentration camp.</span> <span id="s393">That is where they drill you into a concentration camp prisoner.</span> <span id="s394">How to stand in a row, how to take off your cap and that you work at things to which you were not used.</span> <span id="s395">They ask you right away what is your profession, what is your occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: That did not come out yet in the jail in Amsterdam?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: No, in jail we were just let sit.</span> <span id="s398">And I came together with four and I left together with nine in one little cell.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q; You had known each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: No, I didn’t know anybody!</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: They were all in for the same reason?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Oh, for all different reasons.</span> <span id="s403">Oh, there was a lawyer who was in contact with England and people who had put out a pamphlet and a kind of small newspaper.</span> <span id="s404">Oh, all kind of little things which they did.</span> <span id="s405">In a small little cell, you know, where all these people were together.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: Like the end of this room?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: It wasn’t much bigger, you know, a one person cell.</span> <span id="s408">You know, at first, but then nine, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: You slept on the floor?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: Yes, on the floor</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: This was in the summer time?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: Yes, it was so hot!</span> <span id="s413">No ventilation.</span> <span id="s414">And there was no toilet.</span> <span id="s415">It was just a typical dump, you know, buckets in the corner.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Buckets, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: Buckets in the corner.</span> <span id="s418">No privacy or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: Yes, for six weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: You couldn’t even get a bath!</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: Was the food….</span> <span id="s422">.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: It was terrible, awfully bad.</span> <span id="s424">In the morning, we got a cup of lukewarm, of what they called erstatz coffee.</span> <span id="s425">It was not coffee, it was something which they made.</span> <span id="s426">In the name, it was coffee but really it was kind of a brew.</span> <span id="s427">It was rotten, it tasted like barley.</span> <span id="s428">Well, for lunch you got a little bit of soup, you know, with potatoes and cold stuff and in the evening, you got a small piece of bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: And everything was a little worse at the second prison, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Well, when we went to what they call the Durchangslager, you know.</span> <span id="s431">I don’t know what to call it: the beginning of concentration camp to drill, you know.</span> <span id="s432">The first day when we came in they cut all our hair off.</span> <span id="s433">You know, they shaved our hair off.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Then you knew that you were on your way to the concentration camp by then already/</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: No, we didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: They didn’t tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: No, we didn’t know what was going to happen to us.</span> <span id="s438">No idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: I see, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: But the moment you came in, they cut your hair.</span> <span id="s441">And then you sat in the chair, they cut your hair and then they showed you.</span> <span id="s442">They had big round mirrors and you could see how you looked.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: They tried to shame you?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: It was kind of a funny sight to see yourself and, all of a sudden, no hair.</span> <span id="s445">That is to bring you down, just to get you down.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Were they still trying to get information from you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: No, that was already done, the interrogation was over.</span> <span id="s448">It was already set.</span> <span id="s449">You know, there was no court hearing or anything.</span> <span id="s450">It was just so -- he goes to the death camp and he goes to that camp, and so on.</span> <span id="s451">They had people executed.</span> <span id="s452">One of my cellmates, he was executed, a little bit after I went to Amersfoort.</span> <span id="s453">Later on, when I came back, I heard from my wife that he was executed.</span> <span id="s454">So, I mean, they were all different, depending on what you had done.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: Were there Jews in that?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: No, there were no Jews in my camp.</span> <span id="s457">They went, most of the time, to Westerbork, a little city in the northern part of Holland.</span> <span id="s458">They transported them from there to Westerbork.</span> <span id="s459">That was the same as what we had, you know, a drill camp.</span> <span id="s460">From there, they transported them to Augsburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: You, I imagine, were political prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Yes, we were political prisoners.</span> <span id="s463">We had, I don’t know what you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: A badge or a patch?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: That’s it, a three-cornered one.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: A triangle.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: Yes, a triangle -- red, that means political.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: The black triangle was for black market.</span> <span id="s470">You know, people who worked with the black market.</span> <span id="s471">Then you had the green -- those were the professional, what do you call it, burglars.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Criminals.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Criminals, yes, criminals, professional criminals, the green ones.</span> <span id="s474">The pink ones were for the homosexuals and the purple ones was for the Jehovah’s witnesses,</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Did you have all these kinds in the Durchgangslager?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: Oh, yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: All were there except the Jews, perhaps?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: No Jews, there were no Jews there.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Jews had the yellow?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: Yes, Jews had yellow.</span> <span id="s481">The Star of David, it said “Jew.”</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Were all the different kinds of colors of badges mixed together?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: Yes, they were all mixed together.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: At random?</span> <span id="s485">You could be in the same cell with all of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: Yes, but as I said, the cells were all barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: All barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: They were all barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q; Did people tend to get together on the basis of what color badge they wore?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: That didn’t enter.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: No, no, I can’t say that.</span> <span id="s493">That was no consideration.</span> <span id="s494">The only thing I can say is that the criminals were always put at the head of a room, you know, of a commando, work commanders.</span> <span id="s495">These were always the criminals which they used for that.</span> <span id="s496">In Germany, also, in the camps.</span> <span id="s497">It was one of the things they did to bring you down.</span> <span id="s498">To kick you down, as it were.</span> <span id="s499">That you were directed by a criminal, that you are just nothing.</span> <span id="s500">That was the whole principle of the thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: That was a deliberate policy, that they tried to persuade people in many different ways that they were nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Yes, you were less than a number.</span> <span id="s503">You were not even a name since you had a number on your jacket.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: How long were you in that second place?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: In November 1942 they sent me to Germany and we were three weeks in a place worse than a jail.</span> <span id="s506">Where really bad criminals are.</span> <span id="s507">How do you call it here?</span> <span id="s508">Is there a name for it?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: Incorrigibles?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: No.</span> <span id="s511">Well, this is a special jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: Maximum security?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Maximum security prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: Oh yes, we stayed there for a couple of weeks.</span> <span id="s516">Then they sent us to Berlin, to the well-known Alexanderplatz.</span> <span id="s517">That was the police headquarters in Berlin.</span> <span id="s518">From there you were transported to the different camps around Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: Did you get to know people that you stayed with during these various moves?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: I didn’t know anybody!</span> <span id="s521">No, I never met friends or such.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: Maybe there was a policy to mix people up so that they wouldn’t know each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: I don’t know if there was such a policy or if it was just an accident that I never met anybody.</span> <span id="s524">I know in Amersfoort I knew a couple of fellows from my neighborhood -- and in Amsterdam, but that is all.</span> <span id="s525">I never really met anyone.</span> <span id="s526">But you made friends in the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s528">I want to get at this process of humiliation and shaming people.</span> <span id="s529">What other ways were there?</span> <span id="s530">Having to stand for a long time in drill would be another way you mentioned and having to take off your cap.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Oh, that was something that had to be done all the time.</span> <span id="s532">You cannot believe that if thousands of people standing, you know, in a big field and if the commander, you know, the head officer of the SS.</span> <span id="s533">Thousands of people had to do that and it had to be “click” like that, ONE.</span> <span id="s534">If it was “clack, clack, clack” then we had to do it all over again.</span> <span id="s535">Well, later on I will tell you in Oranienburg what happens there, that was really a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s536">But in Amersfoot that was a drilling kind of thing, you know, lines, long straight lines so that you could count.</span> <span id="s537">You had to keep straight behind the man in front of you, like in the military.</span> <span id="s538">Then one of the commanders came by, counted us.</span> <span id="s539">If all the prisoners were there still, then they lead us to work.</span> <span id="s540">Burn cartons or dig trenches, things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: So, a combination of work like that and building the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: Well, to build the camp and also to cut you down.</span> <span id="s543">The first thing they asked you was, what was your profession.</span> <span id="s544">Then: Oh, we will teach you to work, yes, we will teach you to work.</span> <span id="s545">Things like that, you know.</span> <span id="s546">And then they put you to digging trenches or so and the fellows who, in real life, would dig trenches were working in hospitals as orderlies, or things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Nobody could do what they knew how to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: No, there was no way that you could go back into your kind of work, or what you did before.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Was the food cut down?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: Oh yes, the food was horrible!</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: So you were hungry?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: I was always hungry, that is one of the things they get you down with mostly.</span> <span id="s553">And then we had to walk with wooden shoes and we got old army uniforms from the Dutch army which had been used.</span> <span id="s554">We got to use them.</span> <span id="s555">But that was not enough, it was awfully cold.</span> <span id="s556">Just a little shirt with a jacket over it.</span> <span id="s557">It was always damp, always raining.</span> <span id="s558">No raincoats or anything.</span> <span id="s559">We came in the evening, all of us came in, and awfully smelly mess of people, we came in damp and wet into the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: Very little change for cleanliness, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: No, there was hardly any way.</span> <span id="s562">The toilets were old, just awful, little holes in the wall.</span> <span id="s563">And they just put holes in there, and that was for the toilets.</span> <span id="s564">There was no privacy, or so.</span> <span id="s565">I cannot remember taking a bath in Amersfoort.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: Well was there disease?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: Dysentery was terrible.</span> <span id="s568">There were many open wounds, you know, from shortage of protein.</span> <span id="s569">Due to shortage of protein, people got wounds, open wounds, all over their legs and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: Was there also deprivation of sleep?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: Depending on what was going on.</span> <span id="s572">If the Americans or English, let’s say, dropped some bombs close by, then they led us -- you know, getting out of the beds and we couldn’t go to sleep.</span> <span id="s573">You know, what difference, it wouldn’t have done much good anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: What was the spirit of the people whom you knew?</span> <span id="s575">Were they feeling discouraged?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: That depended completely on the individual.</span> <span id="s577">I can remember so well that we had a day where it was raining and raining and we were so cold and they let us, with what you call it, little carts?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Wheelbarrows?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Wheelbarrows bringing clay from one point to another.</span> <span id="s580">It was just ridiculous.</span> <span id="s581">There is no reason but just to get us to work.</span> <span id="s582">Heavy, wet clay and I felt that the whole bunch of boys and men around me were all getting down, you know, morally, mentally.</span> <span id="s583">Then one of the guys said, “Come on, let’s not let them get us.</span> <span id="s584">Let’s whistle, just let’s whistle, they maybe get upset.</span> <span id="s585">Let’s try it, maybe it will help us a little bit.”</span> <span id="s586">So we started whistling and they didn’t say anything about it.</span> <span id="s587">That brought us up to feeling we are still here, you know, we are still alive, we don’t get so easily down.</span> <span id="s588">Well that happened once in awhile, that you get depressed and let yourself go.</span> <span id="s589">But usually that is about the end of it.</span> <span id="s590">Well, people with not too strong a will and character, you know, they slowly die.</span> <span id="s591">They didn’t see any use for life anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: There were people even in that one period, in that second prison who gave up?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s594">Just faded out.</span> <span id="s595">you know it was so typical.</span> <span id="s596">These were mostly the intellectuals: doctors, attorneys, priests, preachers, people who never had done any hard work, labor, hard labor.</span> <span id="s597">They were the first ones who went “whoot” (gave in, conked out, etc.).</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: They couldn’t accept it?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: No, they were not used to the life, to the hard life.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: But you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: Right, I was lucky!</span> <span id="s602">I was mentally OK.</span> <span id="s603">I was young and mentally maybe strong enough to accept it.</span> <span id="s604">Besides that I had my wife who, I told you, was in the hospital when I was arrested so I had never seen her after that.</span> <span id="s605">And I had never, yes once, I had seen the little baby.</span> <span id="s606">So I was living in order to maybe see them again.</span> <span id="s607">That maybe gave me the strength to go on.</span> <span id="s608">It wouldn’t say that I was such a big shot to go on, but I think that it was just the will to stay alive.</span> <span id="s609">You see the baby was little.</span> <span id="s610">But there were an awful lot of intellectuals who, just in the beginning who gave up.</span> <span id="s611">If you went through a certain period and you got used to the way of life, you had more of the will to go on.</span> <span id="s612">But the first, let’s say the first month or six weeks, whatever it was, that was the worst!</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Do you know the work of Victor Frankel?</span> <span id="s614">He is a man who was in the camps and he wrote about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: I just wondered if you knew about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: Well, it looked pretty serious and people probably did not know whether they would ever see their families again.</span> <span id="s619">For sure!</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: No, you didn’t know what was going on, what was happening and what would happen to you.</span> <span id="s621">No idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: No communication, perhaps?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: We were allowed to write once a month a letter which was censored by the SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Were they actually delivered?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: Yes, they were delivered.</span> <span id="s626">Yes.</span> <span id="s627">But the only thing you could write that you were all right, that you were OK, that you were healthy and in good shape.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: But at least they were delivered, so they knew that you were still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s630">Then came the period where you were transported from one camp to the other that they didn’t hear.</span> <span id="s631">There were about six weeks I think when my wife didn’t hear from me, that she did not know if I was still alive or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: Did you get letters from her at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Once a month, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: Once a month again?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: But that same thing; only we are OK and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: That is not as much as you want to hear but at least…</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: At least they are alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Enough to keep your hopes alive, hopes going.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: But there were no pictures or anything allowed.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Was there any sort of an organization among the men you were in that camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: No association, just the way they were thrown together, that is the way they were together, only?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: No, there was no organization.</span> <span id="s644">It was not possible, you know, you never knew who was your friend or your enemy.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: What about the SS men, they were the staff of your camp?</span> <span id="s646">Were they the guards and the administrators and so on?</span> <span id="s647">Were they all SS men?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: All SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: I heard about them in some of the other camps.</span> <span id="s650">Was there a Blockfuhrer?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: Blockfuhrer, Stubeneldester.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: Were those prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: Stubeneldester were prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: Aha!</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: And then you had the Block officer, also a prisoner.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: They kept the records?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: Well as far as the records, you know, he kept them.</span> <span id="s658">And then the Block Altester, that was the highest of the prisoners.</span> <span id="s659">And then came the SS.</span> <span id="s660">The lowest soldier who was over a barrack and then the hierarchy.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: In that camp were they, like the kitchen staff or any of the guards, ever known to be willing to take a bribe in order to do you a small favor of some kind?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: Well, if you were low enough in camp there were little things you could do if you were working in part of the camp where you could change something for food, then you were in good shape.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Yes, that kind of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: Insofar, then, you could stay alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: You had no valuables with you, or money?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: Nothing at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: No, let’s say there was someone working where they make the uniforms and he made little caps.</span> <span id="s669">We had striped caps.</span> <span id="s670">Now the fellows who worked, they made little black caps.</span> <span id="s671">That meant that you are a little bit higher.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: Higher?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Yes, one of the older ones in the camp, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: I see, seniority!</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: And the little he could make a present to one of the guys in the kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: Yes, things like that happened.</span> <span id="s678">Other than that you were just working in the commando and there was no way in which you could get extra food.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: So the word is “commando?”</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: Commando were the work groups where you were.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: Did you work with the same group of men each time or did they switch the membership around?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: One week you were in that commando and another, in another.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: So they switched you around?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: Or you were a specialist in certain things.</span> <span id="s685">You know, they had in certain parts of the camp, they had the older guns which had been used and there was something wrong with them.</span> <span id="s686">They were sent back and they were repaired and cleaned and so on.</span> <span id="s687">These were special workers who knew how to work with guns and such.</span> <span id="s688">They stayed in their own commando.</span> <span id="s689">If they didn’t have that kind of work like that, they transferred you from one to another.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: To take your chances?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s693">Life must have been pretty grim!</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s695">The beginning of Oranienburg that was, I think, the worst time I had.</span> <span id="s696">You had to get up at 4 a.m.</span> <span id="s697">Then you had to go and wash yourself and they checked that you washed yourself properly, and it was in the meantime already winter, you know.</span> <span id="s698">If you were not washed then…… Second interview -- 1/29/79 -- begins.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">[This is probably where the 2nd interview, the one of 1/29/79, started.]</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: There is a space on a tape talking to Mr. Feenstra, on Jan 29, 1979 at Mr. Feenstra’s house.</span> <span id="s701">Our first tape ended in the middle of a sentence, having just gotten to Oranienburg.</span> <span id="s702">There was one date we were not clear on last time.</span> <span id="s703">I asked about the time when the arresting and the harassing of Jews in Holland began.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: In Feb. 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: 1941.</span> <span id="s706">Not 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: Not 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: All right, so that you were active then for over a year rather than for just a number of weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: Yes, that was when my work with underground started, that was early 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s711">Yes!</span> <span id="s712">It was beginning to get worse and worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: When it started to get worse and worse and the situation for the Jews was getting so bad, they really needed help one way or the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: What was it that decided you and your friends to really start in earnest with the ID cards and such?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: For the simple reason that we wanted as many Jews as possible to get out of Holland.</span> <span id="s716">There was a possibility to go via Belgium, France, to Switzerland, and from Switzerland to Portugal, and from Portugal they would go to England or to the U.S. or wherever.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: Did any of these actually get out?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s719">Oh yes!</span> <span id="s720">I wouldn’t say quite a few but there were some.</span> <span id="s721">I don’t know how many.</span> <span id="s722">I really couldn’t tell you how many.</span> <span id="s723">I would lie if I gave you a number -- but quite a few made it and quite a few didn’t make it.</span> <span id="s724">They just made it to the border and there they were (caught).</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: Well some satisfaction at least to help some.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: We know of one couple who made it.</span> <span id="s727">One couple for sure, they made it to the U.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: Already in the 40th to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: No, they went first to Switzerland, from there they made it to Portugal, then first to England and the U.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: But was there some one thing which the Germans did then, early in ’42, when people said, “No, that’s too much” and started helping?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: That is when it really, you know, when the underground started to grow.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: We had the lowlands to protect.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: So the underground started to be more effective.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: Effective.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: That gave you then the chance to do things for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: And then in ’42, after I was arrested, it really was getting big.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: You could see it on the number I had when I went to the concentration camp, the Durchgangslager at Amersfoort.</span> <span id="s740">I was in the 249 number.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: That is a low number.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: It is a low number.</span> <span id="s743">That means that, really, the underground was not working that hard yet, otherwise there would have been many more people who had been arrested.</span> <span id="s744">Later on it really got bad, many many more people got arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Well, now I would guess from what you were saying last time on the tape, that the people, the Jewish people that you were helping, the first people that were friends of yours, that you knew, who were visiting in your home or that you knew through the theater groups maybe, or…?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A; Oh, just friends, you know.</span> <span id="s747">There was in our circle of friends, there was no difference whether you were a Jew.</span> <span id="s748">There were Jewish friends, you know, they were already friends before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: There was no separation like there was in some European, in some eastern European countries?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s751">Amsterdam was a city for the Jews.</span> <span id="s752">They were a part, they belonged to the city.</span> <span id="s753">Our language is so interwoven with the Yiddish language.</span> <span id="s754">Amsterdam’s dialect had so many Jewish words in it.</span> <span id="s755">Yes, you just don’t realize how many words you find in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s756">Hebrew or Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: Is that true of other Dutch cities?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: No, no!</span> <span id="s759">Specially Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s760">That means that a large, large part of the city was specially Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: Do you know whether the Jews that you were friendly with were closely observant Jews?</span> <span id="s762">Did they keep the dietary laws, those whom you knew?</span> <span id="s763">Were they strictly orthodox Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: More liberal?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: More liberal, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: More assimilated into the wider society?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: I see, well, it’s natural.</span> <span id="s770">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: The Orthodox, the Orthodox Jews had a closed together life.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: They stayed more to themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: They didn’t frequent the Christian people or so.</span> <span id="s774">The more liberal Jews there, there is no difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: I was trying to understand what the Jewish community in Amsterdam must have been like, before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: I wouldn’t say that it was a ghetto.</span> <span id="s777">There was a special part of the city where the Jewish people were living.</span> <span id="s778">Another part of the city where the richer Jewish people lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: Did the group to which you belonged; I guess that pretty much went out of operation after you were arrested.</span> <span id="s780">Was everyone arrested?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: Just our trouble is that we were not organized at that time.</span> <span id="s782">Everybody did it on his own and everybody made the same mistakes, that is the reason why so many people got arrested.</span> <span id="s783">We didn’t have any help from the outside, let’s say from England, with weapons or whatever.</span> <span id="s784">That came all later.</span> <span id="s785">In that time we were just on our own.</span> <span id="s786">What can you do if you don’t know exactly what the green Polizei and the SS -- you know they had such information about everybody that it was easy for them to figure out that somebody was doing something against them.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: They were all professionals and you were amateurs.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: Yes, we were just amateurs.</span> <span id="s789">We did our best, that is all we did.</span> <span id="s790">But we did so many things wrong, absolutely wrong, you know.</span> <span id="s791">So we found out the hard way that we have to organize in groups.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: I am just guessing that of the few Jews who got away, most of them must have been people who had gentile friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: I think that must have been the case.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: So that out of those 120,000, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s795">I have seen the figure of 120 thousand Jews who lost their lives under Hitler from Holland, a much greater proportion of Orthodox than liberal Jews probably died.</span> <span id="s796">Would you say so?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: Well, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s798">I wouldn’t say that that is true.</span> <span id="s799">There weren’t from our friends.</span> <span id="s800">We have not seen too many coming back, not too many.</span> <span id="s801">We had, let us say, a group of Jewish friends that was maybe, let’s say 20, and there were about three or four who came back.</span> <span id="s802">The rest were never seen.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Of the 20 that you helped leave Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: Well that was our group of friends; we went around with.</span> <span id="s805">And I would say there were maybe three or four at the most who came back, in 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: A very high percentage was…?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: Was killed in the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s809">Okay.</span> <span id="s810">Well, is there anything else about the situation where you were trying in every way you could to work with the Jewish situation that you think is worth telling about now, which we have not yet talked about?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: It has been told so many times already that I don’t think it is much new.</span> <span id="s812">If you read the diary of Anne Frank, it is the whole situation of what happened at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: But it was very interesting to hear it from the point of view of an insider in one of those groups.</span> <span id="s814">I had never heard that before.</span> <span id="s815">I think that it is an important addition to our information.</span> <span id="s816">So that’s good.</span> <span id="s817">Well, so then they took you off to prison for around six weeks in Amsterdam, then off to Amersfoort [WS spelled it here], the Durchgangslager.</span> <span id="s818">We talked quite a bit about the conditions there.</span> <span id="s819">Yes, from hindsight you would really say that they were educating everyone about how to act in Oranienburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: In any camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: So they were breaking them in.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: They were breaking them in to stand in line so that they can count them every morning and every afternoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: So it was part of a continuous policy?</span> <span id="s824">It was pretty well planned from the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: Oh yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: What happened at Amersfoort?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: It was a former military camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: A training camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: Yes, a training camp for the military and they renovated it completely, for mass transportation to the different camps in Germany and Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: They put you on a train then?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: Yes, they put us on a train to Oberhausen, that is a little bit past the border into Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: Was that in a boxcar, or in a regular train?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: No, we were in a regular train, but in each compartment there was an SS.</span> <span id="s834">There was no way of escaping during the ride.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: You were pretty well guarded and everything?</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: So Oberhausen, then to Alexanderplatz?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: Alexanderplatz in Berlin.</span> <span id="s839">That is the headquarters of the “Green Police” in Berlin.</span> <span id="s840">And we stayed there to get organized and the next day they transported us to Oranienburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: That was the SS, the “Schutz Staffel,” doing that?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: The transporting was always with the SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: Not the SD, or something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: The SD is a social “Sicherheit Dienst”.</span> <span id="s845">The SS were the troops, the soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s847">And Alexanderplatz was the place where all the people were gathered?</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: They came from all over, from Belgium, from France, and wherever Germany had its troops and they had prisoners.</span> <span id="s849">They were all sent there, whoever came into camps around Berlin and then [distributed].</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: Do you have any idea how, there was a number of camps, Oranienburg was one of them.</span> <span id="s851">There were a number of camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: How they decided to send one person one place rather than to another?</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: I have never found out how they figured it out, where you had to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: They must have had some system.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: They must have had some kind of system.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: In Oranienburg there were no, just Dutch, but also Belges…</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: From all over: Russians, Ukrainians, Lithuanians, you name them.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: No Jews, though?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: Some Jews, some Jews, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: German Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s863">The Jews in Oranienburg were used to make the money that was thrown out in England, English money, they printed counterfeit money and dropped it by the millions over England.</span> <span id="s864">They tried to bring the whole money market in disorder.</span> <span id="s865">That was done in a secret part of the camp and only by Jews.</span> <span id="s866">They must have been perfect…</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: Printing people?</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: Printing people.</span> <span id="s869">They must have been the best of the best, they used for that.</span> <span id="s870">The counterfeit money must have been so perfect that it was hard to discover.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">They sent the Luftwaffe with the planes over London and over the larger cities and dropped the money.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: I’m not sure I’ve heard of that before.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: That’s true.</span> <span id="s874">That happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: Was there always a Jewish group in Oranienburg, and when they were done with that they went to do something?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: We knew that they were there.</span> <span id="s877">There was always some people who know a little bit what is going on.</span> <span id="s878">We know that they were there.</span> <span id="s879">As far as I understand it there was about 50 to 60 who were working there, but I have never heard of whether they escaped or that they were taken prisoner by the Russians or whatever.</span> <span id="s880">I don’t know!</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: As far as you know, that was the only group of Jews there, in Oranienburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: Yes, as far as I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: A special program?</span> <span id="s884">Let’s see if your recollections of Oranienburg, see if we can get those together in an overall kind of systematic way.</span> <span id="s885">Maybe if I asked first of all about how the camp was arranged, how big it was, and mentioned as we were talking the other time before the tape that there was a central watch place where they could look into all the buildings.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: Yes, I don’t know if I explained it on tape or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: I think before the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: It was before the tape.</span> <span id="s889">OK.</span> <span id="s890">The concentration camp of Oranienburg was built in kind of a circle and the circle was divided in two, and one part of the camp was a training camp for the SS and the other part was the concentration camp which was divided by a street.</span> <span id="s891">The SS who were used in the training camp at the same time were the kind of police in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: The staff?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: The staff of the camp.</span> <span id="s894">And let’s say, how do we put it, what you call it .</span> <span id="s895">We cut the circle in two.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: A semi-circle, or the diameter.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: The diameter of the circle?</span> <span id="s898">There was the head building where the Commandant, the highest officer of the camp, had his living quarters and his offices, and above that was a big tower, and he could oversee the whole concentration camp how it was built.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: In the radius of the circle?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: In radius from the center.</span> <span id="s901">So they looked down all the streets between the barracks and in the center of this was what they called the “Appelplatz,” where all the prisoners at six o’clock in the morning had to be and at six o’clock in the evening, and they were counted there.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: Twice a day counted?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: Twice a day counted and there were 70 when I came, that is 70,000 prisoners, and when I left there were 72,000 prisoners.</span> <span id="s904">So it took quite a time to count all these people.</span> <span id="s905">That was the reason that you had to stay in absolute straight rows, so they could count 10 rows deep and 70 long, that is 10 times 70, or 700.</span> <span id="s906">And so every SS had a group of so many hundred people he had to count to see that they were there, dead or alive.</span> <span id="s907">Even if people who died, they had to be laid down there and had to be counted in the amount of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: If they died during the previous 12 hours then they would use the bodies to be counted.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: They used the bodies to put down there and then they were counted in.</span> <span id="s910">Otherwise there would not be enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: It must have been a large Appelplatz.</span> <span id="s912">The Appelplatz must have been very large.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: It was large, enormous, enormous place.</span> <span id="s914">Oranienburg was a tremendous large place.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: Like a half circle several acres large?</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s917">Enormous.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: A quarter of a mile, or…?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: You asked me.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: Street side might be as much as a half- mile long?</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: How big was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: A very large place?</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: Let’s see.</span> <span id="s924">I really have no idea to explain how big.</span> <span id="s925">I have no idea to describe.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: From here to Smithville Road, maybe like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: At least.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: A half mile?</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: At least.</span> <span id="s930">I would say that it’s more than that.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: I’ll measure it in the car when I drive home after awhile.</span> <span id="s932">To get some sense of dimension.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: It is enormous, enormous place1</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: Huge, and the whole thing flat and nothing on it at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: Only barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: But this open place had nothing on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: The open place that had the open places where they were talking about last week was in the half circle of the camp, there was a street and it went around this half circle and ended.</span> <span id="s938">It was divided in old pieces of street material, such as asphalt, sand, gravel, rocks, whatever is used on streets and roads, etc.</span> <span id="s939">And in that part the newcomers into the camp had to walk every day from early in the morning until late in the evening and on all kinds of shoes who were thrown out early in the morning and were men’s shoes, ladies shoes with high heels and you would have to walk on that a whole day.</span> <span id="s940">They told us that this was done to try out what were the best kind of material to make shoes during the war, that is all what you call ersatz.</span> <span id="s941">What is ersatz?</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: Synthetic.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: Synthetic material that was used.</span> <span id="s944">There was no real leather, of course, so they used wood, and you name it, what they used for material.</span> <span id="s945">It was a bad explanation.</span> <span id="s946">This was just to make you real real small.</span> <span id="s947">You were not allowed to talk, just walk!</span> <span id="s948">And at midday you got a bowl of kind of…[fades out, probably made a gesture].</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: OK!</span> <span id="s950">So we have a bit of interruption, but let’s get started again.</span> <span id="s951">You just told me about the shoes and how it was with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: You walked the whole day and about midday you got a bowl of you call potato soup, well there was hardly any potatoes in it but they called it potato soup, and that was the meal for lunch, and then you walked on again until evening, and well, you were about crippled from walking over all the different kind of material of stones and gravel and rocks with shoes which didn’t fit you.</span> <span id="s953">That was the worst thing.</span> <span id="s954">So you had blisters on your feet that were enormous and there was nobody to take care of you and then you have to stand a couple of hours again in the Appelplatz for the counting.</span> <span id="s955">And you could be happy if it was over by seven or seven thirty in the evening.</span> <span id="s956">I remember so well that we have to stand once 72 hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: In the Appelplatz?</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A; 72 hours long!</span> <span id="s959">And there were more than 800 people that died during the 72 hours from exhaustion but they had to stay later and they would have to be counted.</span> <span id="s960">The reason was there were three Russian prisoners who had tried to escape and for that reason we had to stand until they were found, and they were somewhere in the forest around Oranienburg.</span> <span id="s961">They were on the outside commando.</span> <span id="s962">There were some commandos who went outside the camp during the day and worked on projects outside the camp and the three Russians had escaped then.</span> <span id="s963">Until they found them we stood there.</span> <span id="s964">They were hanged right away and then we were relieved from our standing.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: They were hanged in your sight.</span> <span id="s966">Did you see it?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s968">That was all part of the comedy there.</span> <span id="s969">And I will tell you this, maybe you won’t believe it but it is true as I am here.</span> <span id="s970">It was Christmas 1942 and the Germans had put up a real large beautiful Christmas tree, the biggest I had ever seen, and there were a couple of prisoners who were just in at Christmas time, everybody was thinking about home and something to eat.</span> <span id="s971">And a couple tried to escape and they caught them right away.</span> <span id="s972">The Christmas tree was taken away.</span> <span id="s973">The gallows were put on the place of the Christmas tree.</span> <span id="s974">Three people were hanged.</span> <span id="s975">After it was over the gallows was taken away and the Christmas tree was put back in its place.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: The huge, big tree.</span> <span id="s977">Enormous effort went into it!</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: Not only the effort.</span> <span id="s979">That was not the worst thing, the effort.</span> <span id="s980">There were thousands of people to help work on it.</span> <span id="s981">No, the work was terrible, what a low way of sinking.</span> <span id="s982">I can’t express myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: There would have been plenty of room to put the gallows somewhere else!</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: Think about it!</span> <span id="s985">Just a Christmas tree and take the tree away and put the gallows up and hang people and put the Christmas tree back.</span> <span id="s986">I mean, I can’t express how low, how dirty, how filthy their thinking must have been to do things like that!</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: Everyone must have felt angry about it at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A; Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: Everyone must have felt very angry at the Germans at the time.</span> <span id="s990">How did people feel about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A; I think that we were all so depressed, I think that we were not even angry.</span> <span id="s992">We were more depressed about seeing that the festivity of Christianity was handled in such a filthy way.</span> <span id="s993">That you would say, how is it possible, how is it possible that somebody can think only about doing a thing like that?</span> <span id="s994">That’s one of the things that happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: It would have had to be the Commandant of the whole camp who would have made that decision to do it that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: Yes, or somebody came up with that and thought it was real funny.</span> <span id="s997">It was a real funny idea to do this.</span> <span id="s998">Anyway, to come back to the first two weeks or three weeks which were the hardest.</span> <span id="s999">We had to do all these things that I told you, walk around, etc.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: The shoe trick?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: That went on for weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: Each individual would have to do that for several weeks on coming in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: Yes, when you came in, everybody who was new to the camp had to go through this ceremony of “Schuhlaufen” they called it.</span> <span id="s1004">And then the experiments in the washrooms and in the morning there was one large, really enormously large room in each barrack where you had to wash yourself and there were around this wash places were all the toilets -- open.</span> <span id="s1005">There was no privacy.</span> <span id="s1006">And if they thought you didn’t wash yourself good enough they came with the big spray hose and sprayed ice cold water over you, midwinter, and it was cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: People were naked, no clothes on!</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: No, you had to take everything off.</span> <span id="s1009">It was in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: Leave your clothes in the bunk?</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A; On the side were benches, wooden benches, and you put your clothes on there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: Did they do that every day?</span> <span id="s1013">Spray people?</span> <span id="s1014">Not every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: No.</span> <span id="s1016">Whenever it came up to them, to have some fun, then they did things like that.</span> <span id="s1017">And we could shower once a month, we could take showers ,and in the winter it was exactly the same.</span> <span id="s1018">The whole barrack had to go to the shower.</span> <span id="s1019">It was a special barrack with showers in them, and then you all went in there and you got a shower.</span> <span id="s1020">It was pretty hot, nice and warm, and you get one towel for three people, and then let you dry outside.</span> <span id="s1021">You go outside naked and you have to dry yourself -- if you are number three you get a wet towel.</span> <span id="s1022">In the winter it was not too nice.</span> <span id="s1023">But it was one of the things to make you feel real small, to bring you down.</span> <span id="s1024">It was the whole principle of the idea, of course, to make people feel so small.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: Where was the road?</span> <span id="s1026">There were barracks, then, all the men lived and stayed in barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: There must have been a great number of these buildings and arranged in an orderly way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: I was in Barrack 54 and I was about in the middle, so I was over 100 barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">[Next tape will be Side three, second Cassette] [Tape two, Side one, conclusion of second interview, that of 1/29/79]</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: I don’t know how many people lived in each barrack, we had four bunk beds above each other and there were two sets in each group.</span> <span id="s1032">So one group of beds had eight beds and that was on a wooden floor, and on that was a mattress filled with straw.</span> <span id="s1033">Did you ever lay in straw?</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: Not for very long.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: Not for very long?</span> <span id="s1036">Try it for a couple of days.</span> <span id="s1037">It is hard!</span> <span id="s1038">You kept losing it, that is the trouble with it, it becomes hard like a board after a while.</span> <span id="s1039">You turn it around and it’s just as hard on one side as it is on the other side.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: So there must have been about 700 men in each building?</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: Oh yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: So for 100 buildings -- 70,000 men.</span> <span id="s1043">And then nothing else in these buildings but these bunks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: No, that is what they called the sleeping quarters, then you had what they called the living quarters that had some wooden tables and wooden benches.</span> <span id="s1045">You could sit down there, in the evening until it was time to go to bed.</span> <span id="s1046">That was all regulated, you know; that time you come in, and that time you eat, and that time you go to bed, and that time you get up.</span> <span id="s1047">That was all set times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: What were those times?</span> <span id="s1049">You got up at?</span> <span id="s1050">early in the morning?</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: Real early in the morning, depending on -- sometimes they got us out of bed at three A.M; and other times we got out of bed at five A.M. five o’clock, that was the time to get up.</span> <span id="s1052">And if there was an air raid alarm, then we had to lay the whole night under the beds, on the wooden floors.</span> <span id="s1053">We had once, I can’t remember whether they were American or Canadian planes, they dropped bombs over the SS half of the camp.</span> <span id="s1054">Not one single bomb fell in the concentration camp half!</span> <span id="s1055">But the SS got it!</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: They must have had accurate information.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: They did such a beautiful job on that thing.</span> <span id="s1058">It was just like a piece of cake.</span> <span id="s1059">Right in the middle!</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: When was that approximately, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: That must have been the Springtime of 1943.</span> <span id="s1062">It was right in the Spring.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: So the air force, whoever they were, must have had accurate information as to how the camp was laid out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A; The camps, I believe, were well known by the Americans.</span> <span id="s1065">Their whereabouts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q; The barracks themselves were not very comfortable.</span> <span id="s1067">Well, plain boards and straw?</span> <span id="s1068">Did you have blankets?</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: Yes, we had a really thin blanket.</span> <span id="s1070">It got quite cold during the night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: Not heated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: No, the sleeping quarters were not heated, the living quarters they had one stove for the whole quarter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: Was the so-called living quarter big enough that all the men in that building could get into it at one time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: We ate most of the time in groups.</span> <span id="s1075">One group, then when you were finished another group went there to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: So, the food was served there also?</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s1078">Well, the food was so little quantities that there really was not much to eat; you had to be satisfied with whatever you got.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: Did you have plates and cutlery?</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: Oh, we had a bowl.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: A bowl only.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: Yes, one bowl and that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: You carried it with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: No, the bowl was in a kind of cupboard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: In a cupboard or a shelf?</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A: Yes, in kind of a cupboard.</span> <span id="s1087">That is what you drank your soup and what you drank your coffee out of in the morning, what you called coffee -- the mixture.</span> <span id="s1088">You know that it was black, but it didn’t taste like coffee.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: Was there food prepared there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: No that was in a central kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: So someone came with it then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: Yes, it was in big kettles.</span> <span id="s1093">Well, like it is in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: Would prisoners be bringing the food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1096">The kitchen was in the camp.</span> <span id="s1097">It was every day the same, the only when we had something special that was on Christmas and one big day for the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1098">I can’t even remember which it was: May 1st or another.</span> <span id="s1099">One big holy day for the Nazis!</span> <span id="s1100">And that, twice a year, we got some kind of a bean soup.</span> <span id="s1101">That was great.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: Always the same food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">A: Yes, every day the same, and never anything different, every day the same kind of, I don’t know what you call it here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Q: Turnips?</span> <span id="s1105">Rutabagas?</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: Turnips, cooked, and you were lucky if you got a piece of turnip in there!</span> <span id="s1107">Well, that was water.</span> <span id="s1108">Well, when I, in springtime in 1943, I weighed 92 lbs., and dysentery was one of the worst things that was getting around so terribly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: No protein in the diet?</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: No, no protein at all!</span> <span id="s1111">No protein at all.</span> <span id="s1112">And that was one of the worst things which killed people down there.</span> <span id="s1113">And pneumonia -- most people died of pneumonia.</span> <span id="s1114">We didn’t have enough clothes, you know.</span> <span id="s1115">The only thing we had was shorts -- real thin, you know, cotton -- and trousers were real thin cotton too.</span> <span id="s1116">And then you had, if you were lucky, you found a shirt, a cotton shirt; and then your jacket.</span> <span id="s1117">Then there was the cap, the little cap.</span> <span id="s1118">And that was what you got in the summer and winter.</span> <span id="s1119">That was all, always the same!</span> <span id="s1120">So in the winter, it was quite cold, quite cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: How was the camp guarded?</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: The camp was guarded by SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Q: Guards patrolling the streets, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">A: Well, there were not that many inside the camp.</span> <span id="s1125">There were mostly at the outside, in the watchtowers, and around the camp.</span> <span id="s1126">Around the camp were, at least ten feet high fences.</span> <span id="s1127">The same thing which I tried to tell you the last time!</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: I think that you mentioned the triple perimeter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: Three!</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: High fence?</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: First the high fence.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: You could walk up to the high fence, if you wanted to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: That far!</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: That far, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: That’s it, and then you get a stretch with sand.</span> <span id="s1136">That was guarded with watch dogs.</span> <span id="s1137">Always with watchdogs.</span> <span id="s1138">Then you got another fence.</span> <span id="s1139">Then you had another street and that was taken care of by the watchtowers, with their machine guns in it.</span> <span id="s1140">And then you had another street with electrical wires.</span> <span id="s1141">So if you could make it through the machine guns you still had to make it through the electrical wires.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: Did anyone get out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: No!</span> <span id="s1144">As long as I was in there, never.</span> <span id="s1145">The only thing was when you were in an outside commando.</span> <span id="s1146">When you left the camp and worked on the outside, then some tried to escape.</span> <span id="s1147">They never escaped!</span> <span id="s1148">They always caught them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: And this triple track guarded the concentration camp half of the circle, then?</span> <span id="s1150">The half the prisoners were in, not the other side, the training side?</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">A: No, no, not on the training side.</span> <span id="s1152">There, there were just plain barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: So that the team with the dogs worked around this half circle?</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: Well, the half circle goes like this, you know; the straight part of the half circle was guarded too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: Oh, I see.</span> <span id="s1156">So you could not escape into the training part of the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: Oh no!</span> <span id="s1158">No way!</span> <span id="s1159">No, it went all the way around, I mean the street which was dividing the camp -- that was just as well protected by the three safety (fences).</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: Oh, yes, complete security?</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: Yes, there was no way that you could escape.</span> <span id="s1162">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1163">If someone tells you that he could escape you can tell him straight away that he is a liar.</span> <span id="s1164">You could never escape from this concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1165">It was an impossibility.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q: And how did you spend your time?</span> <span id="s1167">In the morning and in the evening?</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: After the three weeks of, let us say, training, were over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: That was just the shoes.</span> <span id="s1170">Did they have other things than the shoes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A: No, that was the only thing which we did for these three weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: So you ended up after two or three weeks with blistered feet?</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: Oh yes, crippled, crippled.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: Did anybody believe that the purpose of it was to test the shoes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1176">That was nonsense, that was just a story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: I wonder if there was anyone who escaped these three weeks without any blisters -- that they were always able to find boots.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: Oh, there were always big bullies.</span> <span id="s1179">Oh, you can’t deny the fact that there were big bullies, you know they were strong and they picked out the best shoes.</span> <span id="s1180">And they saw to it that in the evening when they pulled them off they put them some place.</span> <span id="s1181">And the next morning they went right away to that spot where they had put them down.</span> <span id="s1182">You know.</span> <span id="s1183">There are the bullies who knew how to put things over (on people).</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: There must have been several thousand shoes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: Oh yes, that was just the trouble.</span> <span id="s1186">Sometimes you didn’t have matching shoes or boots and gym shoes.</span> <span id="s1187">If you came up with a pair you were very happy, but sometimes you had two different shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: So that people were competing against each other already then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: Yes, they were already fighting, starting early in the morning, to get a decent pair of shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q; And then feeling resentful all day long that someone got the shoes that they wanted to have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: No, I don’t think that they were resentful.</span> <span id="s1192">You were happy if you could make it to the evening.</span> <span id="s1193">With this forced marching you were happy if you could keep up.</span> <span id="s1194">The trouble was that, if you fell down, you know, you couldn’t go any more, they beat you up and said, “Up you -- start walking.”</span> <span id="s1195">They beat you so hard.</span> <span id="s1196">So everybody tried so hard his very best to make it to the evening to see what the next day would bring again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: All right!</span> <span id="s1198">After that was over then where would the new prisoners go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: Then you got on what you call “dividing commandos.”</span> <span id="s1200">There were the different places where you could work.</span> <span id="s1201">If you could work inside, that was the best to get, you were safe from cold and rain and wind and snow.</span> <span id="s1202">But the newcomers, they never made that, they always were first put in outside commandos, digging holes and digging ditches and cutting down trees and digging up trees and all that kind of work, like making railroads, putting down rail for the train which went around the camp and all that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s1203">I was, at that time, pretty stupid.</span> <span id="s1204">They asked me, you know the guy who was the commander of that part of work assignment, what my profession was, and I, stupidly, said “dentist.”</span> <span id="s1205">So he said: “We will teach you to work.”</span> <span id="s1206">I should never have done that, I now know, I should have just said, “I am a ditch worker” or something like that.</span> <span id="s1207">That was so stupid, but I found it out later.</span> <span id="s1208">I still had hope, you know, that they would need me in the hospital and that is what I was looking for, but it didn’t work out that way.</span> <span id="s1209">So I was sent right away to another camp where the next, shall we say part of the main camp; was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: Inside the boundaries.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A: No, outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: A satellite camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: Yes, a satellite camp is the right word.</span> <span id="s1214">They said that they were working there and building a brick factory.</span> <span id="s1215">Well, we had to lay the rails for the railroad and get the clay up for the stones and break the stones.</span> <span id="s1216">That is just about the hardest thing I ever did there.</span> <span id="s1217">Later we found out that it was not a brick factory but that was going to be where they burned the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">Q: Crematorium?</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">A: Yes, crematorium.</span> <span id="s1220">They build a big crematorium, a real big one.</span> <span id="s1221">I think that we had close to twenty crematorium ovens that were built there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: In that one place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: In that place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: What was the name of the place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">A; Klinker, Klinker.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: That was built then in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: That was built in 1942, no ’43.</span> <span id="s1228">Let me see, it must have been 1943 because I was working there then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Q; Early ’43?</span> <span id="s1230">Spring?</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A; That was quite a hard time.</span> <span id="s1232">I got real sick and lost weight to dysentery.</span> <span id="s1233">Oh, that dysentery was just formidable.</span> <span id="s1234">I never had such a case of dysentery in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: Did you go back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">A: They send me, after two months or so, back to the main camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">Q: You used to stay the night at Klinker?</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">A: Yes, you lived there.</span> <span id="s1239">You lived there all the time.</span> <span id="s1240">It was a small concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1241">It was the same thing, you couldn’t escape, or whatever, there was no way.</span> <span id="s1242">And two months of that you were taken back to the main camp, if they thought that you wouldn’t make it.</span> <span id="s1243">Well Klinker was not the crematorium; the crematorium was in the main camp.</span> <span id="s1244">So, as you died, they had to transport all these dead people.</span> <span id="s1245">They transported you alive back to the main camp, you could easily die there.</span> <span id="s1246">They had much less trouble to get rid of you.</span> <span id="s1247">It had to do with paperwork also.</span> <span id="s1248">So that was really one of the worst times I had in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1249">It was awfully hard work and no food, no clothing, in the middle of winter, snowstorms and so on.</span> <span id="s1250">It is awfully cold climate around Berlin.</span> <span id="s1251">I never thought that it was so cold there, but it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: if you don’t have any clothes on -- thin clothes only.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: And no food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q; And no food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A: And no food.</span> <span id="s1256">From there, I had a friend in the main camp, and he said, “Tomorrow morning they will bring some new guys in and we get the work information again -- tell them that you are a “Schlosser” (a locksmith).</span> <span id="s1257">So when they came on that commando they asked me what I am and I told them “I am a locksmith.”</span> <span id="s1258">He wrote it down and I came in that department where my friend was working.</span> <span id="s1259">I think that I told you that last week, where they used the guns which came back from the front which had to be repaired and cleaned.</span> <span id="s1260">I worked in that for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: That was inside work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A; That was inside work and it was heaven!</span> <span id="s1263">But that didn’t take too long, they found out pretty soon that I was not a locksmith.</span> <span id="s1264">I tried my best to imitate it, but!</span> <span id="s1265">So they went by what they said right away: “Oh, one of them again!”</span> <span id="s1266">so they send me back to my old commando and I had to go back to dig ditches, etc.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: Did they send you back to Klinker again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: No, they did not send me to Klinker, but they send me to one of the outside commandos.</span> <span id="s1269">I still had quite a bit of dysentery, and one day they decided to put me in a commando that was to take out the bombs which had not exploded.</span> <span id="s1270">You know that the Americans dropped bombs and they were time bombs which exploded after 24 hours, or after 12 hours or three days -- you know, time bombs which were set to explode after a certain time.</span> <span id="s1271">And they put me in that commando and that worked in the city of Berlin itself.</span> <span id="s1272">So early in the morning you went with the whole commando out there and in the evening they brought you back to camp if you had not been blown up.</span> <span id="s1273">And they called this commando in German: “der Himmelfahrt Commando (it actually means “travel up to the sky.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: Yes, ascension.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: I don’t know exactly how to translate it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: Well, Himmelfahrt is the Feast of Ascension!</span> <span id="s1277">That is when Jesus ascended to heaven, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1279">Well, the Himmelfahrt Commando.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: Did the prisoners call it that, or did the SS?</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: We called it that ourselves -- well so many didn’t come back.</span> <span id="s1282">They went out in the morning and they were blown up.</span> <span id="s1283">And one day I was so lucky, really the good luck must have been with me that day.</span> <span id="s1284">I just -- I had to go to what you might call the restroom -- had to ask “Darf ich austreten?”</span> <span id="s1285">And he said, “Yes, that is OK, go.”</span> <span id="s1286">So I had just left when the whole thing blew up.</span> <span id="s1287">24 fellows, they were gone, and two of us came back in the evening.</span> <span id="s1288">And that happened so many times.</span> <span id="s1289">I dug out 18 bombs in that time and that, for the feelings of the Germans, seemed enough.</span> <span id="s1290">They then took me out of the commando.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: You would be digging earth from underneath them and pick them up with machinery.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: What we did, the damn things went in there and you never knew how they were laying, some of them were horizontal, some of them sticking in the ground.</span> <span id="s1293">They lay like this.</span> <span id="s1294">I don’t know the mechanism exactly of the thing.</span> <span id="s1295">They tell me that there is mercury in some of the things, and the moment you start moving the thing they exploded.</span> <span id="s1296">So the head of the thing is to be dismantled.</span> <span id="s1297">That was always by, what you call a fireworker, that was an SS man who knew exactly how the American bombs were -- and the English bombs -- put together.</span> <span id="s1298">We had to see that that thing was lying so that he could reach it -- you know, so that he could get to it.</span> <span id="s1299">We did an awful lot with our hands, you know we couldn’t use metal spades or so.</span> <span id="s1300">We had to stay away from it, you know if you touched the darn thing it would go up.</span> <span id="s1301">So we did an awful lot of work in trying to get the earth away from the thing with our hands.</span> <span id="s1302">After I had helped dig out 18 of them they then send me back to the main camp again, and I could work in the main camp then.</span> <span id="s1303">This was a pretty good time besides the Angst (fear), being afraid that something should happen, it was a pretty good time.</span> <span id="s1304">We got extra food.</span> <span id="s1305">that outside work was under the command of the “Green Polizei,” that was the civilian police.</span> <span id="s1306">They gave us always extra food.</span> <span id="s1307">So we had enough.</span> <span id="s1308">If a commando blew up there was so much food -- the ones who came back always tried to bring a couple of cans back to the barracks and you could give some of your friends.</span> <span id="s1309">You know the people who were dying, or sick or something, and give them something.</span> <span id="s1310">So that was a pretty good time, except for the whole day the tension, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q: Was it far?</span> <span id="s1312">Oranienburg is what, 20 miles from Berlin?</span> <span id="s1313">It is outside of Berlin some distance, isn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">A: Well, I really couldn’t tell you how far Oranienburg is from Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: It didn’t take very long to get into the city, though?</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: No, it was!</span> <span id="s1317">Sometimes we were put on trucks, and brought to some places, depending where things had come down during the night, and what was important.</span> <span id="s1318">One neighborhood was maybe not important and another neighborhood was more important.</span> <span id="s1319">So, depending on that I think [they dispatched us].</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: So you were maybe two to three weeks with the “Himmelfahrt Commando?”</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: Yes, at least.</span> <span id="s1322">At least three weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: That would have been the summer of ’43 already?</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">A: I think that was in the springtime, yes.</span> <span id="s1325">It was in the springtime.</span> <span id="s1326">And then, after that, they put me back to work in the main camps.</span> <span id="s1327">And I got into a kind of a metal worker.</span> <span id="s1328">We had to design something for mounting on a gun.</span> <span id="s1329">A couple of engineers were in charge and they put me in that commando – I don’t know why they put me in that since I didn’t know a thing about it -- maybe kind of a thank you note for the Himmelfahrt Commando.</span> <span id="s1330">I worked there until I was set free.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">Q: When did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">A: In July of 1943.</span> <span id="s1333">1943, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: So you were in the same camp for about one year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">A: About one year altogether.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">Q: That last bit of work was then like two months?</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1338">I really can’t remember exactly how long it was.</span> <span id="s1339">The last part was not too long.</span> <span id="s1340">I think it was maybe four or six weeks or something like that.</span> <span id="s1341">I can’t remember that well you know dates and times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q: Tell me more about the dehumanization.</span> <span id="s1343">You mentioned that there were several kinds of dehumanization.</span> <span id="s1344">Lack of food, not enough clothing, heavy work, everyone was initiated with this shoe business.</span> <span id="s1345">Did the guards go out of their way to put people down?</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">A: That depended on the kind of guard.</span> <span id="s1347">You had guys who were so-so, they were just standing there, bossing you.</span> <span id="s1348">And there were guys who always called you names or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q: So, depending on the individual guard?</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">A: Yes, on the guard who was in your neighborhood.</span> <span id="s1351">But everything was so degrading.</span> <span id="s1352">Well, let’s say in an open way, the way it was.</span> <span id="s1353">If you had dysentery, there was no way in which you could make it to the restroom.</span> <span id="s1354">So your pants were full of excrements, and you had to run around in it all day, until it was evening you came back to the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q: This is our third session and it is Jan. 31.</span> <span id="s1356">When the tape ran out the other day, you were just talking about how smelly it was and how many people had dysentery.</span> <span id="s1357">How many people had dysentery actually?</span> <span id="s1358">Almost everyone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">A: I would not say all, but quite a lot.</span> <span id="s1360">It had to do with the food, you know, not enough [protein].</span> <span id="s1361">No solid food, it was always kind of a soup.</span> <span id="s1362">So there were no vitamins in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: That would be interesting to have a medical doctor’s insight as to whether there is a certain kind of person in prison who is more likely to get dysentery than another kind of person.</span> <span id="s1364">But I don’t know of it is possible to generalize about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">A: Well, you saw it in most camps.</span> <span id="s1366">The same thing happened in the Far East with the Japanese prisoners who were interned.</span> <span id="s1367">The Japanese had the same trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">Q: And who gets dysentery and who doesn’t?</span> <span id="s1369">No way of predicting?</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">A: No, I don’t think that you can predict it, I really don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1371">I don’t think that it even has to do with the hygiene in the camps.</span> <span id="s1372">I don’t think that it has.</span> <span id="s1373">I think that it was plainly the food, the intake of food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q: It is not the matter of someone being more optimistic or less despondent than another and therefore less likely to get dysentery?</span> <span id="s1375">You did not observe anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: I don’t think so, I don’t think so really.</span> <span id="s1377">But it isn’t outside the realm of possibility that it has something to do with the nervous system.</span> <span id="s1378">But my feeling was that it bothers the system to get people down, to get as many as they could.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Q: People who were sick died mostly of dysentery and pneumonia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1381">Sometimes what happened was that, let’s say, some high official got killed in one of the countries.</span> <span id="s1382">You know the high commissioner, a general or some big shot, and he was killed by the underground -- then they just took, you know, out of the group, 100 or 50 or as many as they thought it was worth, you know, they were shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q: They were executed!</span> <span id="s1384">At random?</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">A: So you didn’t know from one day to the next whether you would be alive the next day.</span> <span id="s1386">It was always possible that you were in a group that was selected.</span> <span id="s1387">You know, it was possible that in Holland, or in Amsterdam, or something else, something had happened and just at random, they took people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">Q: So many of the things which you mentioned bring out the idea that the Germans really were trying to “bring the prisoners down,” dehumanize them, is that a fair term to use?</span> <span id="s1389">Was that systematic?</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1391">I think that was started in the beginning, before the war started.</span> <span id="s1392">I think the concentration camps were started as an institution for [people] to learn the Nazi ways.</span> <span id="s1393">Then, if you don’t follow them, then you end up in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1394">And if you had been in a concentration camp, you never, never wanted to get back in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1395">So, the penalty for little things people did, you know, against the Nazi regime, were so terrible that, if you came out all right, you never did something against them again!</span> <span id="s1396">You knew what would happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: So, it was kind of an education effort on the part of the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: In the eyes of the Nazis, that was an education.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">A: In their eyes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">Q: When you entered the camps, there was a big sign above the entrance, “Arbeit macht frei.”</span> <span id="s1401">That means, “Work will set you free.”</span> <span id="s1402">That was not true, that had nothing to do with work or not work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">A: Was that over every camp that you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: Yes, most of the camps had that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">Q: I wonder if they really meant that, or was that just what they said?</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">A: That is just what they said, they never meant anything about setting free.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">Q: OK, so what about that, yes!</span> <span id="s1408">So that even in their eyes, the educational effort was minimal?</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">A: It was only for a small group of people.</span> <span id="s1410">You have here, I suppose, the “Aryans” -- I don’t know how to explain it, they are the people of Northern blood, you know, they came from the Northern part of Europe, down to Germany and Denmark and such, they were called the “Aryans,” people with blond hair and blue eyes, fair skin.</span> <span id="s1411">They, this kind of people, had always a little chance to be set free; but if you were a Jew or a gypsy, or someone with a little darker skin, even if you came from the southern part of France or so, you were not an “Aryan,” so you never had a chance.</span> <span id="s1412">But if you were lucky enough to be blond, blue-eyed, light-skinned -- then there was always a little chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Q: So that those who were regarded as “Aryan” by the Germans, they had a chance to be rehabilitated to live in the Nazi society?</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">A: That was in comparison; when it started out before the war it was only one large group, that was the German people who were put in the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1417">There were the communists, and the socialists, not the national socialists, but everybody who was against the national socialists (they were the Nazis), there were a lot of people who were, at that time, arrested and put in a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">Q: So there was some concept, at least, that they were trying to re-educate people, according to their ideas.</span> <span id="s1419">Then would that also lead to not giving people very much food and depriving them of enough clothing for warmth and so on, would that be part of it?</span> <span id="s1420">Was it so regarded that that was what they intended?</span> <span id="s1421">I have a feeling that, maybe it got out of hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">A: It was so!</span> <span id="s1423">After WWII broke out, they came to so many countries and there were so many more people arrested, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">Q: The system broke down?</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1426">And then there was, I don’t think, any more a question of education; it was the question of killing off as many people as possible who were against them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: It became part of the war effort?</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1429">I had the feeling that there were several kinds of degrees in concentration camps, and the worst camps as far as I found out after the war, was Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s1430">That was, I think, an 80 to 90% Jewish camp.</span> <span id="s1431">The people were killed off there by the thousands, by the thousands, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s1432">Mauthausen was really one of the extermination camps, like Dachau and Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1433">Bergen-Belsen, that was quite a large Jewish concentration camp too.</span> <span id="s1434">There were so many like Buchenwald and, I don’t know how many there were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">Q: But Oranienburg, you were saying, was not basically an extermination camp?</span> <span id="s1436">It basically was a labor camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">A: No, you couldn’t really say that it was a labor camp.</span> <span id="s1438">I can say that a large percentage of people were killed there.</span> <span id="s1439">I really couldn’t say how many or the amount of people, but there were lots and lots, a large amount.</span> <span id="s1440">I think that that was all in the camps.</span> <span id="s1441">Only, but that was not a concentration camp in Thereienstadt -- that was a Jewish kind of a camp -- and from there, quite a few people came back.</span> <span id="s1442">Now what the reason was, whether they were half Jews, who had one Christian parent and the other was Jewish, or who had done something for the Nazis before the war or something.</span> <span id="s1443">Anyway, however it was, quite a few people came back.</span> <span id="s1444">Jewish people!</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: Came back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">A: Came back; and from other camps, no, I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">Q: At the time you were in Oranienburg, did you know about the other camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A: Yes, we knew that there were other camps, we knew.</span> <span id="s1449">But we didn’t know the situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">Q: Was there no information?</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">A: No, there wasn’t any.</span> <span id="s1452">Even if you came back, you kept your mouth shut.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">A: When I came out in 1943, you know how people are?</span> <span id="s1455">They wanted to know, “Were you beaten up or so?”</span> <span id="s1456">You made it always so that there was no way they could tell that you said something wrong about it.</span> <span id="s1457">You didn’t want to go back.</span> <span id="s1458">That was the first thing they told you when they set you free: “No words about what happened here!</span> <span id="s1459">You just worked here and that was it.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">Q: So your information about the other camps is something you learned later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">A: After the war!</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Q: After the war?</span> <span id="s1463">Well, OK, let’s see.</span> <span id="s1464">There is so much that dehumanized then, whether they intended it, or whether it just happened for various reasons.</span> <span id="s1465">There is so much dehumanizing which made people discouraged!</span> <span id="s1466">I noticed though that you were talking about Amersfoort and you talked about whistling, just whistling to keep up the spirits that one day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">Q: And you mentioned the name of the work detail that was to dig out the bombs, called the Himmelfahrt commando.</span> <span id="s1469">That is a kind of joke, in a way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: That they called it the Himmelfahrt commando?</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: Well, that was the Fahrt by the Christians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">Q: Yes, I know!</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">A: Well, that was the way, you know, you left in the morning and you didn’t know if you came back in the evening, whether you would be blown up or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">Q: Sure, but there were other examples, can you think of other examples of people keeping their spirits up?</span> <span id="s1476">What were the other ways that people (did that)?</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">A: There were certain ways that people tried.</span> <span id="s1478">First of all, I don’t think that I have ever seen such an enormous amount of people praying, then just in the camps, or in the fields, or in groups.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">Q: At night or in the evenings?</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1481">It was prohibited.</span> <span id="s1482">It was prohibited to have meetings.</span> <span id="s1483">But in secret, you know, a few people came together and prayed together.</span> <span id="s1484">There were not always just Christians, there were people, Jewish people and Moslems, and whatever religious group they belonged to.</span> <span id="s1485">There was one group which was really, really strong, they were the Jehovah’s Witnesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">Q: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">A: And I had the most respect for the Jehovah’s Witnesses, since in that time when I saw what these kind of people did for other people, to help other people, to keep them alive.</span> <span id="s1488">Everybody had nothing to eat, so it did not make any difference which it was, and even from the little piece of bread they had, they gave away something to someone who was really sick.</span> <span id="s1489">It was a marvelous group of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: Did they stay together in the same barracks, generally?</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: No, they were spread out, just like any [others], but they stayed together quite strongly.</span> <span id="s1492">They prayed together in their small little service, you know, secretly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">Q: The Germans must have known that they were doing that,</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">A: Well, yes, they were pretty much watched, that they wouldn’t spread out.</span> <span id="s1495">They knew that their mentality was so strong, I think through prayer they had such inner feeling of “we have to go through this, and we have to help other prisoners.”</span> <span id="s1496">It means that if someone was sick, they were always there to help out, in one way or the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">Q: Did they get sick in the same proportion as others?</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">Q: They didn’t get sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">Q: No dysentery or nothing else, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">A: No, not in that proportion; well, they got it also, but it seems that they were not affected by it, they were not so easy to bring down.</span> <span id="s1503">You know dysentery is an illness which you can stop.</span> <span id="s1504">It is a whole -- what do you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">Q: There are some bacteria or amoeba.</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">A: That is not what I mean.</span> <span id="s1507">If you had to go, normally you can control it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">A: But with dysentery you can’t.</span> <span id="s1510">it is just a watery mass which escapes your body as Durchfall, that is what they call it in the camps.</span> <span id="s1511">So there is no way that you could do anything to it.</span> <span id="s1512">And that makes you so weak, so tremendously weak, and you feel so miserable -- you try to stay away from everybody because you know you smell pretty bad, so mentally you go down.</span> <span id="s1513">So, it seems to me that these Jehovah’s Witnesses didn’t have that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">Q: Illness?</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">A; Yes, they had the illness, but they didn’t come mentally down so fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">Q: Oh, I see.</span> <span id="s1517">They were not affected mentally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">A: They were not affected mentally by it.</span> <span id="s1519">It seemed to me that they, you know, had such a strong feeling of wanting to stay alive.</span> <span id="s1520">That is as though through their prayer they had the power to overcome the weakness and the mental breakdown.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">Q: So, then people turned to prayer and religion as far as they could then?</span> <span id="s1522">To keep their spirits up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">Q: Have you ever run across, I would be interested to know if people who did that in the camps stayed that way after they got out of the camps, if they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1526">I think that it was just so funny -- this has nothing to do with the camp directly, but it is maybe interesting to know.</span> <span id="s1527">In Holland, the political group -- you know, the Communists, the Socialists, the Catholics, the Social Democrats, well name them – that was, during the war one large group of Dutch people against the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1528">And the day the war was over, they split up -- they became all again Communists and all, whatever it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: It was the need which brought out the unison.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">A: Yes, the will to stay together, and the moment it was not necessary anymore, it broke in a thousand pieces again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">Q: Well were people generous to each other in the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">A: I wouldn’t say that they were generous together, I think that they were more in small little groups; people who became friends and took care of each other.</span> <span id="s1533">But the larger groups, no.</span> <span id="s1534">I don’t think that they were all that concerned.</span> <span id="s1535">If the fellow next to you dies; “that’s too bad,” and you went on.</span> <span id="s1536">There was no concern about, except if it was one of your buddies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">Q: Someone you were working alongside, maybe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">A: Yes, or with whom you became friends, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">Q: Were bunks assigned, or could you choose or change bunks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">A: No, no, they were assigned.</span> <span id="s1541">Then we had Sunday afternoon, after two o’clock, that was the only time which was free time.</span> <span id="s1542">Then you had quite a large group of Russians and Ukrainians who were singing and dancing.</span> <span id="s1543">It was just unbelievable that these people, who were so down, really degraded by the Germans, you know the Russians and the Ukrainians, they could bring up the spirit on Sunday afternoon to entertain a whole barrack by their dancing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">Q: That helped them maybe to keep up their spirits?</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">A: Oh yes, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">Q: You mentioned that in Amersfoort that there tended to be professional people and intellectuals who weakened earlier, was that true in Oranienburg also?</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">A: Yes, mentally down fast.</span> <span id="s1548">What you had in Oranienburg was there were quite a few already gone, you know.</span> <span id="s1549">They had already died in the Durchgangslager.</span> <span id="s1550">In other camps it was the same thing.</span> <span id="s1551">The Durchgangslager were not only in Holland, they were in Belgium, in France and wherever.</span> <span id="s1552">So a large part was already taken care of in the Durchgangslagers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">Q: Those who were going to drop out that way had done it already?</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1555">I am not saying that in the larger camps there was not a more systematic way for the Germans to kill off people, as much as they could.</span> <span id="s1556">They had certain ways to keep you always on your toes.</span> <span id="s1557">Since something could happen, Once when we were in the Arbeits-commando outside the camp, you know, and working in the forest or so, all of a sudden one day we came as one of these big SS officers came, we had to take all our clothes off -- we stood there, a couple of hundred people all naked -- and we had to dig a ditch.</span> <span id="s1558">So we thought right away: “well, there we go!”</span> <span id="s1559">For we knew that it happened, that you had to dig a ditch and then they came with the machine guns, “Brrrt!”</span> <span id="s1560">and they all fall in the ditch, and they closed the ditch and that was it.</span> <span id="s1561">So, when we had to dig the ditch, standing there naked, and we thought, “well, that is the end of us.”</span> <span id="s1562">I never saw so many people stand there and pray, hoping that something would happen.</span> <span id="s1563">And it really happened.</span> <span id="s1564">For some reason, I don’t know what it was; anyway, all of a sudden we could put our clothes back on and we went back to camp.</span> <span id="s1565">So that was something to make you really small.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">Q: Another thing to make you small?</span> <span id="s1567">You don’t know if they used the ditch for some purpose later on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">A; Well, maybe they used it the next day or so.</span> <span id="s1569">But our group was lucky that nothing happened to us.</span> <span id="s1570">But we were really so sure, you know, that was the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">Q: This was in Oranienburg, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">A: Yes, that was in Oranienburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">Q: Well, I think that Oranienburg would be kind of a model camp in the system.</span> <span id="s1574">If they had their training camp, the training grounds in the same general area?</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">A: Well, I think that that was not only in Oranienburg, I think that there were more of these [training] camps.</span> <span id="s1576">But that was a good training ground for SS and what they used it also was for the SS who came from the front and were wounded.</span> <span id="s1577">Let’s say they lost an arm or a leg, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1578">That was a very good way to learn how to take care of the prisoners.</span> <span id="s1579">And they went through all the miseries of war and so.</span> <span id="s1580">So they thought that they had been there, but it wasn’t really all that bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1582">They’d rather be there than at the front.</span> <span id="s1583">There seemed to be a senior officer telling them: “So this is how you scare the prisoners, get their clothes off and have them dig a ditch.”</span> <span id="s1584">They were teaching the younger ones how to do that, like an internship for the younger officers.</span> <span id="s1585">Did you notice anything like that?</span> <span id="s1586">That question, if many of the officers who were in charge of the prisoner side of the Oranienburg camp had returned from the front, then that must have affected their attitude toward the prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">Q: They took it out on the prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">A: Hm!</span> <span id="s1590">That is the only reason why they took this kind of people.</span> <span id="s1591">They were hardened and some of them were missing part of their bodies, and blamed the misfortune on the people who were prisoners in camp.</span> <span id="s1592">They were against them, they were against them!</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">Q: It was bad enough already without being hit for something you didn’t do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">Q: Well, one of the questions I always had about the way that the guards in the camp dealt with the prisoners was the extent to which what an individual guard would do was done on purpose, because it was their orders to do it, or to what extent they just did it because they enjoyed hurting and harming other people.</span> <span id="s1596">Maybe a mix?</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">A: I think that there were quite a few sadists who were used for this purpose.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">Q: They were purposely picked for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">A: They picked them for that.</span> <span id="s1600">It might be an accident, but I think that it was quite a large group of SS men who were used for that.</span> <span id="s1601">They went out of their way to find out, “what can we do to make them feel like a hole [in the ground]?</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q: So, a good bit of the, maybe half of the guards, or a third of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">A: I wouldn’t know, I wouldn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">Q: But some proportion, less than half?</span> <span id="s1605">Or maybe a bigger proportion?</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">A: I couldn’t tell, really, I couldn’t tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">Q: Well, anyway, some of them would go out of their way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">A: We really didn’t have that much to do with them.</span> <span id="s1609">But inside in the camp, they had to do it.</span> <span id="s1610">There you had to do it, where most of the people who were Stubeneldester, you know, in charge of the rooms in the barracks, and then the Barrackeldester were chief, or however, you want to call them, of the barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">Q: Blockeldester?</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">A: Yes, Blockeldester and that were all were prisoners, they were all prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">Q: What exactly would a, let us say the Stubeneldester would be lowest of the hierarchy, do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">A: Yes, that was the lowest, but that was a prisoner.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">Q: Now, what would be that prisoner’s responsibility?</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">A; To take care of the barracks room, that would be kept clean.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">Q: Kept clean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">Q: To get people up in the morning?</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">A: That you get out of bed and that we get washed.</span> <span id="s1621">That the food was divided.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">Q: To report any breakage of the rules?</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">A: To reserve for himself a large portion and a large portion for his friends, and what was left for the rest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">Q: So he had his favorites?</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">A: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s1626">Favoritism was a great thing!</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">Q: You got more food, if you were close to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">A: Well, that’s very much as it was in regular prisons too.</span> <span id="s1629">There was quite a bit of homosexuality.</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">Q: Oh yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">A: You know, by this kind of characters who had the possibilities to get to food or divide food.</span> <span id="s1632">Food was the important thing.</span> <span id="s1633">Clothing you couldn’t, but if they found out that you used more clothing, then you were allowed to -- that was really a hard thing, you know.</span> <span id="s1634">You really got beaten up.</span> <span id="s1635">If they found out that you got an extra jacket stolen someplace, or a piece of blanket.</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">Q: Were there many of the Stubeneldesters , they were all criminals?</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">A: Mostly criminals.</span> <span id="s1638">They were mostly criminals who were used for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">Q: The green badges?</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">Q: And many were also homosexuals?</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">A: Yes, yes!</span> <span id="s1643">Quite a few of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">Q: But then you got a pink badge on that account?</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">A: No, not on that account, that was the people who were taken, arrested outside, you know, the camps, and brought into the camps as homosexuals.</span> <span id="s1646">And they wore the pink badges.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">Q: It is amazing the amount of homosexuality other than just amongst men which you observed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">A: There was some, some going on, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">Q: It is a wonder that the people had the energy for any of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">A: Well, there were always people who got a way to get some extra food and such.</span> <span id="s1651">They were the ones who mostly belonged to this little group.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">Q: Small groups who hang around together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">A: Yes, small groups.</span> <span id="s1654">The other people, most of the people are not interested in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">Q: I just wondered whether the nutritional level might have been so low that they would have been?</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">A: Yes, they were not interested, that was mostly the Stubeneldester and Blockeldester and people working in the hospital who always know how to get out to new food.</span> <span id="s1657">Most of the people who were sick, they didn’t eat, you know, they were too sick to eat.</span> <span id="s1658">So, the food came in anyway, and there was, for so many prisoners, so much food -- so they took care of what was too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">Q: OK!</span> <span id="s1660">Well, the Stubeneldester did have a chance to exercise some power.</span> <span id="s1661">How did someone get to be a Stubeneldester?</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">A: By choice of the SS.</span> <span id="s1663">They were always Germans.</span> <span id="s1664">They were always what you call professional goof-offs who went in and out of the prisons.</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">Q: Habitual criminals?</span> <span id="s1666">Professional criminals?</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1668">Or those who, for some reason did something really bad and then they put them in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1669">They became the big shots, you know, among the prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">Q: Well someone like you that would, maybe, be able to survive for a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">A: Oh they survived, they all survived.</span> <span id="s1672">There were hardly any to whom anything happened, unless they did something wrong that was really against their law.</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">Q: It never happened that a Stubeneldester would go out of his way to help somebody who was a prisoner?</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">A: Well, seldom, if it was not a friend.</span> <span id="s1675">If you were a friend of them, you know that was OK.</span> <span id="s1676">In the whole barrack, there were always two or three people who stayed in the barracks, to clean the barracks.</span> <span id="s1677">That was the most beautiful job you could have, you know; but you had to be a real good friend of one of the characters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">Q: They would want something in exchange?</span> <span id="s1679">They wanted something in exchange?</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">A: Yes, you had to give them something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">Q: Never real friendship, just exchanging [favors]?</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">A: And the Blockeldester, that was the one who had the command over the whole barrack.</span> <span id="s1683">See, the barrack was divided in “Stuben,” in two or three different parts which were called the Stuben, and then the Blockhaus [probably means Blockeldester] was the man who was the commander of one whole block.</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">Q: Of one whole building?</span> <span id="s1685">Under one roof?</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1687">Then you had another guy who has several barracks under his command .</span> <span id="s1688">That was the end, that was the top for a prisoner.</span> <span id="s1689">He couldn’t get any higher than that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">Q: What would be the duties of a Blockeldester?</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">A: Well, he was a contact man between the prisoners and the SS.</span> <span id="s1692">If something had to be done, then the SS gave him the idea -- told him what to do -- and he saw to it that it [would be done].</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">Q: Did he ever deal directly with the prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">A: Yes, he was a prisoner himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">Q: But he would just transmit orders to the Stubeneldester?</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">A: Yes, or to the [Stubeneldester], or he did it himself.</span> <span id="s1697">He let the whole block stand outside and told what had been “misdone.”</span> <span id="s1698">You know, we had to stand out there during the night, or an extra hour in the Appel, you know, in the evening.</span> <span id="s1699">Well there were always several things which they could do to pass the time and to make life unbearable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">Q: Would they do that kind of thing just for their personal purposes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">A: Maybe they did, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1702">I mean I can’t say that they did.</span> <span id="s1703">Maybe they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">Q: I wonder if ever there was a Stubeneldester or a Blockeldester who went out of bounds.</span> <span id="s1705">So that the SS kept him from going out of bounds?</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">A: You mean that he would do worst things?</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">Q: Nothing like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">A; He was a little boss, among the big bosses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">Q; He could do whatever he wanted?</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">A: They never would say, we give today half a ration of food because you were bad boys.</span> <span id="s1713">Nobody would complain about it to the SS, you know.</span> <span id="s1714">Complain about him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">Q: So there was very little friendship, very little trust outside of these small groups.</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">A: In the small groups, that was the only way [in which] they trust each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">Q: You mentioned the man who said he was your friend who suggested that you say you were a “Schlosser,” a locksmith?</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">A: Yes, that was then one of my best friends, he became my best friend.</span> <span id="s1719">How could I say?</span> <span id="s1720">He saved my life by giving me the information and the help that he could.</span> <span id="s1721">Instead of working on the outside in the winter, I could work inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">Q: Yes, so that there were then acts of friendship.</span> <span id="s1723">That could happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">A: Oh yes, oh yes!</span> <span id="s1725">Really well.</span> <span id="s1726">And I had several friends whom I kept after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">Q; Oh, you actually kept in touch?</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">Q: Have you seen them recently?</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">A; No, he is in, most of them are in Europe, you know.</span> <span id="s1731">But just before we left for Indonesia, we had real close contact.</span> <span id="s1732">Then we had, after the war, we had a group of old concentration camp prisoners, kind of a club.</span> <span id="s1733">They were mostly from certain concentration camps, where people came together once a year, or twice a year; started telling all the stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">Q: Is there still an organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">A: There is, in Holland.</span> <span id="s1736">I just received, last week, it is called the “Stifting -- forty --forty-five.”</span> <span id="s1737">I don’t know if you want to put it on tape, since it uses up, maybe too much of the tape?</span> <span id="s1738">It says, “A flower -- you call it here, the daisy -- and it was when the war broke out, Queen Wilhelmina made the daisy the flower of the people who were in the underground.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">A: And after the war, they gave the people three little marguerites.</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">Q: Lapel buttons with three daisies?</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">A: Yes, for a memento.</span> <span id="s1743">I just received it last week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">Q: From the government, then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">A: That is from my government.</span> <span id="s1746">A kind of paper.</span> <span id="s1747">It says here: “For the people who worked in the underground” --</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">Q: That is from my government.</span> <span id="s1749">A kind of paper.</span> <span id="s1750">It says here: “For the people who worked in the underground” -- and it was for 30 years after the war, they came out with this little insignia.</span> <span id="s1751">And since I am living outside the country it took a while before all the people in other parts of the world got their little signets.</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">Q: I am sure that you will wear this with pride.</span> <span id="s1753">So that the people who suffered together also stayed together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">A: They stayed quite solidly together, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">Q: You are scattered in different parts of the world now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">A: Yes, and that is kind of funny, if you think about it.</span> <span id="s1757">I never really thought about it, but now that I do, there are so many people who were in concentration camps have emigrated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">Q: Do you talk about what happened in those years a great deal?</span> <span id="s1759">Do you find yourself talking about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">A: Never!</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">Q: Not?</span> <span id="s1762">Not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">A: Never!</span> <span id="s1764">You are the first one, really, since I left the concentration camp to whom I told the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1765">Even to my wife, I hardly ever talked about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">Q: It is easier to talk about it to people who know what it is all about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">A: Yes, maybe that you want to bury it, as deep as possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">Q: I have heard that people sometimes have dreams about those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">A: That is what I have, really strongly, and that is why I am under the control of a doctor for that.</span> <span id="s1770">I still get medicine for it, to try to get this [taken off my mind].</span> <span id="s1771">Really to sleep.</span> <span id="s1772">At night I wake up and go through the whole thing again, dreaming.</span> <span id="s1773">My wife wakes me up and says, “Honey, you are home and you are safe.”</span> <span id="s1774">So then I fall asleep again.</span> <span id="s1775">But there is hardly a night which goes by without me waking up screaming and scared.</span> <span id="s1776">All the time poor [his wife’s name].</span> <span id="s1777">But this is something which I think you would never lose, even the smell, the smell of the crematory -- the smell of the crematory is something you never lose.</span> <span id="s1778">It goes always; why, I don’t know, why a smell can come back to you.</span> <span id="s1779">But it comes back all the time.</span> <span id="s1780">I wouldn’t say that it is always there, just at certain moments.</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">Q: Do you feel that even talking as we have here for the tape, has caused a lot of efforts on your part?</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">A: I think that it did, it was just a moment.</span> <span id="s1783">[His wife’s name] woke me up by shaking me and saying, “Wake up, wake up!</span> <span id="s1784">You started dreaming again, yes, screaming.”</span> <span id="s1785">So it must have come back stronger than it did before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">A: It doesn’t matter, there is only one way to recall and collect together and get all the stories from all the people from different camps together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">Q; OK, well, I appreciate your talking about it, because that is a permanent testimony which we now have to refer to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">A: And it is really strange to think that something like this happened over 35 years ago.</span> <span id="s1790">But it is something which you can never forget, and never lose, and intentionally you try to forget it.</span> <span id="s1791">You know, you try not to think about it anymore, but it must be deep somewhere in you, in part of your brain it is stored.</span> <span id="s1792">And when you rest, when you relax during the night, it comes back.</span> <span id="s1793">It is exposed, or [something].</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">Q: I read from someone who was in the camps and who said,” How can you believe in the goodness of man, anymore.</span> <span id="s1795">In the camps everyone fights against everybody else.”</span> <span id="s1796">What he was saying was that the protection which society with its mores and laws gives each of us is stripped away there, so you just have people, almost like animals, fighting each other, at least more openly fighting each other.</span> <span id="s1797">And that after such an experience he could not believe in the goodness of man anymore.</span> <span id="s1798">The truth about man is that man is an evil animal.</span> <span id="s1799">But so much of what you say doesn’t, wouldn’t bear that out.</span> <span id="s1800">talking about friendships, to some extent, people keeping their spirits up; I don’t know, what would you think about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">A: Well, if you fight for your life, I don’t think that it makes any difference whether you are in a concentration camp or if you are any place else.</span> <span id="s1802">Something that would happen to me when I was in Amersfoort, I slept in the third bunk, top bed.</span> <span id="s1803">There were three bunks; in Oranienburg, there were four.</span> <span id="s1804">The fellow in the bed under me, the second bed, knew that I always saved a little piece of my bread from the evening, for the next morning, so that I didn’t have an empty stomach the whole morning, so I saved always this little piece of my bread and I put it under my pillow.</span> <span id="s1805">He knew that, and one night he tried to steal it.</span> <span id="s1806">Now, in Amersfoort we had wooden shoes, you know what they wear on farms.</span> <span id="s1807">And I took my wooden shoes and put it in my bed too, since that was stolen by other people.</span> <span id="s1808">You know, I had a good pair.</span> <span id="s1809">There were no holes in them.</span> <span id="s1810">so I kept them in bed too.</span> <span id="s1811">So I took my wooden shoe and hit him on the head so hard when he tried to steal my piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1812">Now if I would have killed him, I wouldn’t have cared less at the moment -- the animal instinct of surviving</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">Q: Sure, survival instinct!</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">A: And I am not a person who wants to hurt somebody, or so.</span> <span id="s1815">But at that moment I really wouldn’t have felt sorry -- I really would have blasted his brains out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">Q: Kind of a sobering thought then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">A: Well, it was a question of surviving.</span> <span id="s1818">You know, it is him or you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">Q: That is a terrible question then if I dare to ask it now.</span> <span id="s1820">If the Nazis wanted to dehumanize people, did they succeed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">A: They succeeded, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">q: Temporarily at least.</span> <span id="s1823">Because I don’t perceive you as a [heartless person].</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">A: They succeeded.</span> <span id="s1825">If you, except for a little circle of friends, looked always at everyone else as kind of an enemy.</span> <span id="s1826">He could steal something from you, in form of your food or a piece of clothing, or make life unbearable for you in one way or the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">Q: There were a few people, you were saying, who were a close circle of friends -- you probably would trust them with your bread, wouldn’t you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">A: Oh yes, well we gave each other, I mean, in case of sickness or ailment, where somebody needed an extra little bit, you know.</span> <span id="s1829">We hung together and everybody gave a small part, a small piece that he had an extra meal, let’s say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">Q: Were there individuals, to your observations, that never got into a small group like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">A: Well, there were always the loners.</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">A: It seems that they would have a harder time surviving.</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">A: There were, like it is in the outside world.</span> <span id="s1834">The loner always has a harder time to get around than people who can make friends.</span> <span id="s1835">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">Q: So that having friends helped in survival?</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">A: Oh yrs, sure.</span> <span id="s1838">Yes.</span> <span id="s1839">There were days when you were so depressed that you really couldn’t care less what happened to you.</span> <span id="s1840">It didn’t happen too much to me, but that happened maybe three or four times that I had moments where I was so weak, and specifically when I had this terrible dysentery, that I either couldn’t care for the moment whether I died or not.</span> <span id="s1841">I was not interested in life anymore in life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">Q: So how did you get out of it, when it happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">A: I had a good friend who said, “come on Jauf, come on guy, come on up, get up and come outside -- you have to stand in line.”</span> <span id="s1844">I didn’t even want to go out of the barracks in the morning.</span> <span id="s1845">The cold weather isn’t good for it.</span> <span id="s1846">The whole day in the cold weather, standing up behind, you know, the tree with my pants -- they want you to go out.</span> <span id="s1847">I did rather die.</span> <span id="s1848">But I had a good friend who told you, ‘Come on, come on guy” and they give you the lift, you know, to bring you up and give you some will again, spirit to live.</span> <span id="s1849">Without them, I think I would have died, if I didn’t have some friends who would have helped me in that moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">Q: So Hitler did not completely win.</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">A: No, he didn’t win.</span> <span id="s1852">He didn’t win.</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">Q: OK, I was waiting for you [to finish].</span> <span id="s1854">And you also did that for him when he was down?</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">A: Oh yes, the same thing.</span> <span id="s1856">When you were in better situation.</span> <span id="s1857">You had days when you felt good, you know, depending on the weather.</span> <span id="s1858">When the weather was so sunny and warm you felt good and if it was a day when it was cold, freezing rain came down and you didn’t have enough clothing, you know you had to work the whole day in that -- it depressed you as soon as you came outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">Q: Or your wife’s birthday?</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">A: Or some days like Christmas and you know, birthdays, and all talk of home generally was kind of a [low point].</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">Q: I can see that it is not just a physical battle for survival, but also on a personal, emotional, and mental [level]?</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">A: Mentally, that was one of the strongest things you had to try to overcome.</span> <span id="s1863">You know, you could get so depressed mentally.</span> <span id="s1864">I have seen people dying in one night.</span> <span id="s1865">Some healthy people completely died during one night, by giving up.</span> <span id="s1866">We have seen, and people will tell you that this is a story, that this is crazy, but it is true, really true; a Frenchman, who was dark -- he had dark hair, you know -- was grey in one night after an SS interrogation.</span> <span id="s1867">He became completely grey.</span> <span id="s1868">And people will say that this is impossible --_but I have seen it happen.</span> <span id="s1869">The man was really beaten and upset terribly.</span> <span id="s1870">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s1871">He made it, he came through it, but I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">Q: Did you use the term “Muesselsman”?</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">A: The “Muesselsman,” that were the kind of people who had given up.</span> <span id="s1874">That’s what we called Muesselsman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">Q: So that term was used.</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">A: They were the people who had just given up and who couldn’t care less whether they died or not.</span> <span id="s1877">And if you were called a Muesselsman, it seemed that you didn’t have friends either.</span> <span id="s1878">I don’t know why, if there were people who were written off or slowly died anyway; so, why should we care about him?</span> <span id="s1879">And the mentality, it is kind of hard, you know, if you lived through the beginning, I think you became kind of -- you know -- the mentality is not too good, you lived for yourself with the one or two friends you had.</span> <span id="s1880">And the rest you really could care less, if they would stay alive or not.</span> <span id="s1881">As long as you yourself could survive .</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">Q: I think that that is understandable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">A: I think that was awfully hard for people when they came out of the concentration camp alive, and they came home, their life with a family was awfully hard.</span> <span id="s1884">He couldn’t understand that someone could make a scene that he had a bad headache, or such.</span> <span id="s1885">So what about the bad headache, or someone was sick.</span> <span id="s1886">Well, he is sick, sure he is sick, so what?</span> <span id="s1887">You know, your mentality was so --you didn’t have the [caring] mentality.</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">Q: It took awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">A: It took a while to get into a normal world again and to become a human being again.</span> <span id="s1890">Yes, for a while you were just like an animal.</span> <span id="s1891">It took a while to overcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">Q: A year, a couple of years for some people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">A: I had enormous help from my wife.</span> <span id="s1894">So it didn’t take me too long, luckily.</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">Q: And then there was your baby daughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s1897">That was a bright spot.</span> <span id="s1898">The funny thing was that my wife had a picture of mine on the mantel.</span> <span id="s1899">In the hallway you always had an oven at that time, an oven in the living room with a mantel around it.</span> <span id="s1900">And on that mantlel was a picture.</span> <span id="s1901">Oh my heaven, the baby went to bed in the evening and my wife said, “Come, we will say goodnight to Daddy!”</span> <span id="s1902">And she kissed the picture.</span> <span id="s1903">When I came home, so in the evening, I brought the baby to bed.</span> <span id="s1904">So [my wife] said, “Well, kiss Daddy goodnight.”</span> <span id="s1905">So she went to the picture.</span> <span id="s1906">So her mother said, “No, that is Daddy,” Oh, oh, oh.</span> <span id="s1907">That was Daddy, the picture, I was not the Daddy.</span> <span id="s1908">That is a funny story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">Q: It took her a little while…</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">A: To find out who Daddy really was.</span> <span id="s1911">It was not that picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">Q: She was then one year or one and a half years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">A: She was one year, about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">Q: A year, that is right.</span> <span id="s1915">Well, there is more about that camp we should find out about.</span> <span id="s1916">But maybe now is the time to ask how it was that you got out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">A: Well, that is quite a long and interesting story.</span> <span id="s1918">I don’t know if you have enough tape for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">Q: Well, let’s see, there are maybe ten minutes left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">A: Well, let’s do it fast and compressed way.</span> <span id="s1921">In the time that I was in camp, it was in the winter in Amsterdam, there are many canals and quite a few officers walked into the canals, when everything was dark.</span> <span id="s1922">There were no lights in the city, well everything was dark for the airplanes -- so that they couldn’t see where the city was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">Q: A blackout.</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">A: So quite a few of these officers who were on drinking parties or so, and they walked along the canals and fell in the canals.</span> <span id="s1925">Now, somebody who saved a guy and took him out of the canal alive, he had the possibility to ask for a prisoner to be set free.</span> <span id="s1926">And my wife had found out, through the underground, who one of the fellows in our neighborhood was one who had done such a thing.</span> <span id="s1927">And for a certain amount of money, which she paid him, he put my name as his friend to be relieved from camp.</span> <span id="s1928">I don’t know how many times a week my wife went to the headquarters of the SS in Amsterdam -- and all the time asked if I could be set free and so.</span> <span id="s1929">And, in combination with all that, I think that with my record of taking so many bombs out -- that was, maybe, a good thing on my record in camp.</span> <span id="s1930">All these things together presented the possibility to get me out of the camp.</span> <span id="s1931">That is the only explanation we have why I was set free.</span> <span id="s1932">That didn’t happen too often -- there were maybe two or three a week -- that was about all, out of the 70,000 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1933">Q: So that one day -- did you know that this was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">A: No!</span> <span id="s1935">No!</span> <span id="s1936">No!</span> <span id="s1937">One morning they called me and there were always two possibilities, that was that you were shot, or that you were set free.</span> <span id="s1938">If you were called in the morning out to the commander, there were only two possibilities.</span> <span id="s1939">So I prayed to God.</span> <span id="s1940">I got called to the big, the biggest commander in the top building there, and he told me that I was chosen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">Q: The tape ended just toward the end of the story about how you were able to go out of prison.</span> <span id="s1942">The German officer had fallen into the canal in Amsterdam, as sometimes happened.</span> <span id="s1943">So through that there was a chance for one person to be released from prison, and after Mrs. Feenstra went repeatedly to the SS offices in Amsterdam -- and perhaps some other friends too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">A: Well, mostly her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">Q: Well, mostly her, so OK.</span> <span id="s1946">You didn’t know anything about that.</span> <span id="s1947">So you were called one morning, out of your work -- middle of the morning -- to the head office of the entire camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">A: To the main gate.</span> <span id="s1949">That is where the highest SS officer, the commander of the camp, was where his office was.</span> <span id="s1950">Well there were two possibilities there, if you were called to that main gate: you were shot, or you were set free.</span> <span id="s1951">But you didn’t know it until you arrived there, what would happen, so it was quite an exciting moment to walk down there and to find out what would happen.</span> <span id="s1952">I was happy to hear that I was to be set free.</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">Q: They just said it, in just so many words?</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">A: Well, they told me that I was chosen to be free and that I couldn’t say or tell anything what had happened in my time in camp.</span> <span id="s1955">If I would do it then there was a good chance that I would come back there.</span> <span id="s1956">So it was up to me to keep, let’s say, my mouth shut, and not say anything and not tell anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">Q: When did you start to believe that it would really happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">Q: When did you start believing that it was really true?</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">A: When the gate closed behind me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">Q: Not until then”</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">A: [Laughter] They gave me train tickets to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s1963">And from there I didn’t know where to call.</span> <span id="s1964">I mean, I didn’t know where I really was.</span> <span id="s1965">So by talking to people, I found out where the train station was and what streetcar to take to the train station.</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">Q: [Tape Three]</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">Q: Did they give you clean clothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">A: I got a part.</span> <span id="s1969">That was really funny, they had kept it -- I got part of my own clothing back, but only part.</span> <span id="s1970">And what I got back was my wedding ring.</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">Q: They kept that evidently!</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">A: When you came into the camp, you had to give everything you had, watches, or rings or whatever.</span> <span id="s1973">It all went into a bag with your clothing.</span> <span id="s1974">We thought, well, we thought, that is the end of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">Q: You got the wedding ring which you are wearing now, back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1977">I got my own wedding ring back.</span> <span id="s1978">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">Q: I would think that they would steal, that people would steal!</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">A: Well that is what they did, if someone, let us say, died or such.</span> <span id="s1981">When I was working in the hospital, for a short time, we had to take out all the gold people had in their mouth, bridgework, crowns, and so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">Q: You had to do some of that too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">A: Yes, it was part of my profession.</span></p> <p><span id="s1984">Q: Ah, you were a dentist, after all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">A: In that time it seems that you get so, without feeling, without feeling!</span> <span id="s1986">Everything which happened did not touch you anymore.</span> <span id="s1987">I mean, if somebody fell dead next to you, well, that was too bad.</span> <span id="s1988">You didn’t make a drama about it.</span> <span id="s1989">It just happened, so.</span> <span id="s1990">It seems like your feeling for other people was completely gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">Q: But if one of the members of your close group of friends, if something happened to them, you might?</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">A: Well, that is a different thing.</span> <span id="s1993">There was nothing closer than the few friends you had, and that was mostly not too large a group.</span> <span id="s1994">Maybe two or three., that was about the biggest group.</span> <span id="s1995">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">Q: I suppose that you couldn’t let yourself feel over committed to anybody because you never knew what would happen to them either.</span> <span id="s1997">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1998">A: Yes, what would happen to him.</span> <span id="s1999">I want to say that you get so hard -- I think that that was the only way to make it.</span> <span id="s2000">I think that if you would get too much into it and let your feelings go, then for everything that happened you feel sorry about someone else, I think you would never have made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">Q: I see where that could be a survival instinct, something which you would do for the sake of surviving.</span></p> <p><span id="s2002">A: Yes, it seems like it.</span> <span id="s2003">I mean, I never have been a person who was not feeling sorry for someone who is sick, or had trouble in the family.</span> <span id="s2004">Always, you know, tried to help.</span> <span id="s2005">But in camp, after a while, you really didn’t care, what happened to someone else -- as long as it didn’t happen to you.</span> <span id="s2006">This may be kind of an egoistical point of view, but that was the way it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2007">Q: And a Muesselsman was someone who stopped caring for himself too, I suppose.</span></p> <p><span id="s2008">A: Yes, I think a Muesselsman was completely -- well, I don’t think that he thought anymore -- that he thought about living or dying.</span> <span id="s2009">He was just waiting until it was all over.</span> <span id="s2010">They didn’t struggle for life anymore.</span> <span id="s2011">Normally you do everything to stay alive, whatever, but a Muesselsman was somebody who had just plain given up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2012">Q: So everybody, except the Muesselsman, well anyone between a Muesselsman and the friends of the Stubeneldester, who would have a little more easy way of life, slightly more easy way of life, in between, that group of people would always have to struggle, every day, a struggle.</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">A: Yes, it was always a struggle to, let’s say, we got sometimes a couple of potatoes.</span> <span id="s2014">They were cooked in the skin, you know, not washed but the way they came out of the soil.</span> <span id="s2015">They were cooked that way, so on the skin was soil and such.</span> <span id="s2016">So you had to peel them.</span> <span id="s2017">It was so that you looked sometimes until you could find some potato peels to eat -- we had enough actual potatoes -- but to find peels in the trashcan and then steal them out of the trashcan and use that as a snack during the afternoon or the next morning.</span> <span id="s2018">You just can’t understand that.</span> <span id="s2019">If you have never been hungry, you don’t know how that hurts.</span> <span id="s2020">How it really hurts.</span> <span id="s2021">It is not just like I am hungry -- no, it hurts all inside; the intestines are cramping just as if they were tearing themselves apart.</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">Q: You never get used to it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">A: No, you never get used to it -- it gets worse and worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">Q: Living with that pain, then, all the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2025">A: Yes, and then they observe what sometimes here and which you see people throw away and you say, “Oh, my gosh, there are millions of people who would be so happy if they had just the food which we throw away!”</span> <span id="s2026">Well, anyway, that was a part of staying alive, you know.</span> <span id="s2027">And then you were lucky, that every month, the family could send you a package.</span> <span id="s2028">Now it didn’t always arrive.</span> <span id="s2029">Most of the time when it came into the blocks, the Blockeldester took his part and the Stubeneldester took his part -- and what was left, you got.</span> <span id="s2030">So most of the things are gone, but you got at least something.</span> <span id="s2031">Any my wife had done, in that time, something fantastic: by cooking up something what looked like kind of a jelly, but in that she had put sugar and -- I can’t remember what she put in, ground nuts or something which had some vitamins in it.</span> <span id="s2032">They thought that there was something wrong, that it was just a jelly or such, and they never stole it out of my package.</span> <span id="s2033">But that was the most important thing for me, because it had so much vitamins in it.</span> <span id="s2034">I think that brought me back on my feet again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">Q: Now that would help.</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">A: Later on when I had left --– when I came home, we kept going sending such packages to my friends, knowing that that was such a good thing.</span> <span id="s2037">And we put some cookies, and some such thing in -- so that, if the other ones would steal that -- well, we couldn’t care less about stealing the cookies out of it, if they didn’t take the jar with the good stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">Q: Before we stop talking about the camps, I wanted to ask about the hospital too.</span> <span id="s2039">There was that terrible story a couple of tapes ago -- I have forgotten exactly where -- when you started to tell about the Stuben officer who got men on the roof of a house?</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">A: No, that was the commander who ordered this, the commander of the camp ordered this.</span> <span id="s2041">He thought that there were too many prisoners in the hospital so, in order to get as many people out of the hospital as possible, he sent the whole commando as carpenters, or whatever you want to call it, on top of the roof.</span> <span id="s2042">With hammers they had to just sit on the roof and hammer and bang on the roof the whole day long.</span> <span id="s2043">So, if you were not crazy [when you got up there] you became crazy.</span> <span id="s2044">As a result of that, people who were not too sick when that happened – they went out because they couldn’t stand it any more.</span> <span id="s2045">So that was a good way for hi to clear out the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">Q: Was that done for one day, or for many days?</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">A: No, he did it for I don’t know how long, for a couple of days it was going on.</span> <span id="s2048">It was one of his funny ideas.</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">Q: So that, if anyone was really sick and couldn’t move they would be just that much sicker.</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">A: Well, they went I don’t know where.</span> <span id="s2051">You can go crazy from that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2052">Q: Now, what was the hospital like?</span></p> <p><span id="s2053">A: It was just a barrack with some beds in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">Q: Warmer blankets maybe, and sheets?</span></p> <p><span id="s2055">A: No, there were no sheets.</span> <span id="s2056">Well, I don’t know how you call it here.</span> <span id="s2057">You know, the rough kind of a blanket which they use for the horses.</span> <span id="s2058">That was the kind of blanket we had.</span> <span id="s2059">If you were lucky, you got a pillow, if you were lucky.</span> <span id="s2060">Let’s say, if there were ten beds, there were maybe two pillows.</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">Q: They had doctors?</span> <span id="s2062">M.D.s?</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">A: They were all prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">Q: Prison doctors?</span> <span id="s2065">Doctors?</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">A: They were prisoners, all prisoners, who had to do, let us say, without medicines, and try to do something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">Q: Were they good?</span> <span id="s2068">Did they try to help?</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">A: Well, depending on the doctors, here you have bad doctors and good doctors also.</span> <span id="s2070">You had some good ones and you had some bad ones.</span> <span id="s2071">But they couldn’t do too much -- I mean, they didn’t operate, or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2072">Q: Well just medication, or such?</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">A: No, there was not much medication available.</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">Q: Not much?</span></p> <p><span id="s2075">A: Not too much.</span> <span id="s2076">No, they applied bandages -- which were all paper.</span> <span id="s2077">You know, if you had a wound, you put paper bandages on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">Q: So sanitation would be poor?</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">A: Yes, but I had a -- you can still see it on my hand, here -- which was all open.</span> <span id="s2080">They put that paper bandage on it and afterwards, that was while I was still working in the outside commandos, so it was a rainy day, and the paper bandage was gone in a short time again.</span> <span id="s2081">Then the next morning when I came back to the hospital, they said, “You have pulled it off.”</span> <span id="s2082">You know, that paper was just softened by the water, you know, by the rain where I had to work with a shovel.</span> <span id="s2083">That paper was worth nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">Q: Well, was there like a time of day when people would go there if they were sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">A: You could ask to go to the hospital, you know, if you were sick.</span> <span id="s2086">But you really had to be sick, you couldn’t just say “I don’t feel good,” you know, you had to have a high fever.</span> <span id="s2087">That was the first thing they did when you came, was to stick the thermometer in your mouth and see whether you really had a fever.</span> <span id="s2088">If you didn’t have a fever, they beat you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">Q: So people didn’t make it up, did they?</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">A: No, no, you never made it up.</span> <span id="s2091">No, no, this was not something which you just said, “I want to lay down for a couple of days” and asked to be taken in.</span> <span id="s2092">You had to be really sick in order to get in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">Q: Was it full most of the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2094">A: Well, most of the time it was full and you didn’t stay too long in the hospital.</span> <span id="s2095">Either you died in there, or you got out of it.</span> <span id="s2096">I would say that ¾ of them who came also died in the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">Q: So ¾ of those who went into the hospital died there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">A: Died in the hospital.</span> <span id="s2099">They were already that sick, you know, most of the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2100">Q: Well, it had to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">A: Not much to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">Q: Did you ever, that is beside the wound on your hand, ever go in?</span></p> <p><span id="s2103">A: I was in there when I had a terrible angina and high fever, so they put me in the hospital -- and after two days they said that I was good enough to get out.</span> <span id="s2104">I still had a horrible sore throat, but in their opinion, it was good enough to start going back to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">Q: Well, it wasn’t a terribly helpful kind of hospital, then.</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">A: No, that really was not the kind of a hospital which we normally see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">Q: And no dentist, either?</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">A: There was a dentist, yes, there was a dentist, and the only thing he did was pulling teeth.</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">Q: Well, OK.</span> <span id="s2110">I think that some other things will occur to us about the camps.</span> <span id="s2111">I was interested in knowing how you got home, at the time, but I will save that for another time.</span> <span id="s2112">I will see if there is something else about the camps.</span> <span id="s2113">Maybe one other question, which I had about the hospital was whether you knew, whether people heard about some of those medical experiments that did happen in some of the caps?</span> <span id="s2114">Did Oranienburg not have that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2116">I really couldn’t tell you whether it had or not.</span> <span id="s2117">It happened a lot.</span> <span id="s2118">I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s2119">I haven’t seen it, and I didn’t hear about it.</span> <span id="s2120">So I really couldn’t say yes or no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2121">Q: Another question which now I remember I was going to ask was, “People had heard about this group of Jews who were making counterfeit money in the camp.”</span> <span id="s2122">You never saw them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">A: Well, I didn’t see them, but that came out after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2124">Q: Oh, after the war, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2125">A: After the war.</span> <span id="s2126">You know, the moment that they were set free -- the Russians came to Oranienburg, and the moment that they were free all that came out and my friends who were still in camp came to Holland and they told me what that little part of the camp was.</span> <span id="s2127">We always thought, “What happens here?</span> <span id="s2128">What is going on?”</span> <span id="s2129">Everyone was guessing.</span> <span id="s2130">We didn’t know.</span> <span id="s2131">A little camp within the camp.</span> <span id="s2132">You know, all surrounded with wires and the whole thing.</span> <span id="s2133">You couldn’t get in there.</span> <span id="s2134">And we never saw anyone on the outside, you know, walking.</span> <span id="s2135">So it was, for us, always something secretive.</span> <span id="s2136">You know, “What is going on?</span> <span id="s2137">What do they do there?”</span> <span id="s2138">But after the war, when people came out of there, then we found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">Q: But was there much visiting back and forth?</span> <span id="s2140">I mean Sunday afternoon, when there was some free time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">A: Oh, in Oranianburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s2142">Q: Oh, the news that something had happened in one part of the camp, and the news would spread?</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">A: Oh, always, you know, like it is in a jail -- guys always gather rumors, which go on, stories such as, “We will be home by Christmas!</span> <span id="s2144">The war is over!</span> <span id="s2145">Or will be over by Christmas.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2146">Q: Counting the bombers flying overhead, or something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2147">A: Yes, that was always a good sound during the night, when they came over.</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">Q: I was just wondering what they -- there was no such thing as a radio, a secret radio, or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">A: No, not anything like that, that would have been the end!</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">Q: Did anybody have the chance to hide things away at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s2151">A: No, there was no way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">Q: No place to hide it, I suppose.</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">A: There was no way.</span> <span id="s2154">Let’s see, a couple of times a week, they turned the whole barracks over --every little cabinet and nook was completely cleaned out.</span> <span id="s2155">There was always inspections for everything.</span> <span id="s2156">No, there was no way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2157">Q: The SS would come and do the inspecting?</span></p> <p><span id="s2158">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2159">No, there was no way you could hide anything.</span> <span id="s2160">They would shoot you if they found anything.</span> <span id="s2161">That was a dangerous thing in the civil world, for the people outside.</span> <span id="s2162">If they had a radio, they were executed right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">Q: In Germany, at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2164">A: And in Holland.</span> <span id="s2165">Well the minute they found a radio, that was Bang!</span> <span id="s2166">Bang!</span> <span id="s2167">, that was the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">Q: There was no way you could get a radio into the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">Q: So that one morning, when was that, that was in 1943, July, as I recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s2171">A: When I was released?</span> <span id="s2172">Yes, that was in 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">Q: In July.</span> <span id="s2174">So you got just part of your clothes back and your wedding ring, and a pair of shoes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2175">A: Yes, I got my own hat and my raincoat -- and the rest must have been for someone else, it didn’t fit me at all -- anyway, that was good enough for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2176">Q: You found the train station at Oranienburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">Q: You had no trouble getting home, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">A: No, I got a paper from camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">Q: An ID?</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">A: What they call an “Entlassungsschein” [a certificate of release].</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">Q: Permission to travel?</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">A: Permission to travel to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s2184">And when I came back to Amsterdam, I had to go right away to the SS commander in Amsterdam, to show that I was back, and then I had to come the first three weeks every day.</span> <span id="s2185">Then after three weeks, I think that it was twice a week, or three times, and I had to do that for about three months.</span></p> <p><span id="s2186">Q: Just to go and check in?</span></p> <p><span id="s2187">A: Yes, just show that I was still there, and was a good boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2188">Q: Did your wife know that you were coming?</span></p> <p><span id="s2189">A: No, she did not know, she did not know a thing about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2190">Q: You went to your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">A: I just went home and surprised her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2192">Q: That must have been a homecoming?</span></p> <p><span id="s2193">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2194">I never forgot it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">Q: Well, I assume that your friends would hear about this soon.</span></p> <p><span id="s2196">A: And then came the hardest time.</span> <span id="s2197">I think that was the hardest time in our marriage.</span> <span id="s2198">To get used to each other again.</span> <span id="s2199">I mean, if my wife had a terrible headache, I would say that was nothing.</span> <span id="s2200">I would say somebody is sick or shuff off.</span> <span id="s2201">Sick?</span> <span id="s2202">That’s too bad.</span> <span id="s2203">To grow back into a normal life again.</span> <span id="s2204">I think that that was the hardest thing to get used to, civilized life again, you know.</span> <span id="s2205">To get the feeling that you were a human being again instead of like a kind of an animal.</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">Q: Yes, one needs the patience of one’s family.</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">A: I think that it was an awfully hard time for my wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">Q: There you were, but you were different somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2209">A: I was a different person, hard and rough and not caring.</span> <span id="s2210">I think that it took me quite a while before I started getting into normal life again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2211">Q: A year?</span> <span id="s2212">Or more?</span></p> <p><span id="s2213">A: And then the friends came.</span> <span id="s2214">I always wanted to hear the stories about what went on -- you couldn’t say anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2215">Q: You had to be careful?</span></p> <p><span id="s2216">A: So you always said, “I’d rather not talk about it.”</span> <span id="s2217">I think about that, I believe I talked to you about it last week -- I had never talked to anyone about it, with anybody, except you.</span> <span id="s2218">So, you didn’t talk of the things, especially about what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2219">Q: I think that it would have helped you at that time, if you had been able to talk about it at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2220">A: That would have been, maybe better, mentally.</span></p> <p><span id="s2221">Q: Mentally, yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s2222">A: If you could have, you know, spread out the whole thing, tell the whole story, yes.</span> <span id="s2223">But it seems like this, you tried as much as possible to forget, but it is deep inside and you can’t forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s2224">Q: Did you feel as though you wanted to forget?</span></p> <p><span id="s2225">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s2226">I think that you wanted to bury it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2227">Q: To get over that thing, and not have it cluttering up your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s2228">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2229">For the single reason that there were too many things which were so terrible, that you rather not think about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2230">Q: Were you able to take up dentistry again?</span> <span id="s2231">Practice?</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">A: Yes, I did some work.</span> <span id="s2233">My wife had taken care of the office.</span></p> <p><span id="s2234">Q: Oh yes, that’s true, she was a dentist.</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">Q: But it was quite hard since she had the baby, but she did a fantastic job.</span></p> <p><span id="s2236">Q: You got used to things again gradually.</span></p> <p><span id="s2237">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2238">Now I didn’t do anything in the underground.</span> <span id="s2239">I was watched really closely, you know, that I wouldn’t do anything wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s2240">Q: Did they send people around to check up on you at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s2241">A: Well, they had, let’s say, a patient of ours was an SS man and he became real friendly, you know.</span> <span id="s2242">I don’t know if he was sent or if it was just by accident that he came.</span> <span id="s2243">as far as the rest, I don’t know that they came to the house, but I know that they watched by the Sicherheits Polizei, the secret police.</span> <span id="s2244">So I didn’t do anything in the underground until 1944, and then I started with the little newspaper which was called the “Parol,” which is now one of the largest newspapers in Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s2245">Q: Is it still called that, “Parol”?</span></p> <p><span id="s2246">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2247">It is still called the “Parol.”</span> <span id="s2248">Every day the latest radio which came from London, in print; and that was distributed through the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s2249">You did that then always in the evening, after dark.</span> <span id="s2250">But that was quite a dangerous thing to do, in 1944, we had to go inside after eight P.M.</span> <span id="s2251">After eight o’clock you were not allowed to go on the street anymore until the next morning at four o’clock.</span> <span id="s2252">So you had to do it just in the, let’s say the hour before eight o’clock, when it was dark, so you had time to distribute it.</span> <span id="s2253">Then, later on, they reprinted some of the papers in our basement.</span> <span id="s2254">We had a basement under the house.</span> <span id="s2255">We had a stencil machine.</span> <span id="s2256">We stenciled it.</span> <span id="s2257">We got the thing already typed up -- we stenciled it and then distributed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2258">Q; That must have been somewhat risky, though?</span></p> <p><span id="s2259">A: Well, at that time, we were so full of hate that you didn’t think about it, about the danger any more.</span> <span id="s2260">You were so full of hate about it, about what the Germans did.</span> <span id="s2261">Because at that tine, it was getting worse and worse, they really took people off of the streets and just sat them against the wall and shot them.</span> <span id="s2262">There was no judgment anymore, it was just that, if a German soldier was killed for some reason, or even if he was in an accident, they said it was done by the underground and they just picked people up in the street and Bang, Bang, Bang.</span> <span id="s2263">So we really got so full of hate, against the whole Nazis, and I don’t think that we did care too much anymore, as long as we could get it over as fast as possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2264">Q: Well, then, was it the British then who came through Amsterdam?</span></p> <p><span id="s2265">A; The Canadians.</span></p> <p><span id="s2266">Q: The Canadians came then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2267">A: The Canadians, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2268">Q: Early 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s2269">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s2270">Q: In early 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s2271">A: It was May, May ’45.</span> <span id="s2272">And then the American troops, they dropped food packages -- and that was something.</span> <span id="s2273">For the first time in so many years, that we got white bread.</span> <span id="s2274">That was something.</span> <span id="s2275">We were eating tulip bulbs, and the bad thing was that we didn’t know that the kernel, you call it?</span> <span id="s2276">The kernel in the bulb?</span></p> <p><span id="s2277">Q: The seed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2278">A: The seed, that was poison, but we didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s2279">And the people got sick when they were eating it.</span> <span id="s2280">They found out that they had to cut that out first, before they cooked it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2281">Q: Oh, I see.</span> <span id="s2282">People just didn’t know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2283">A: No, they didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s2284">They were eating the bulbs and they didn’t know that you had to cut that out first before you could cook them.</span> <span id="s2285">It made people sick, you know, diarrhea and such.</span> <span id="s2286">But there was hardly anything to eat anymore.</span> <span id="s2287">You didn’t have any bread or anything else.</span> <span id="s2288">We didn’t have bread for, I don’t know how long.</span> <span id="s2289">No gas, no electricity, everything dark, no trains -- trains were all stopped.</span> <span id="s2290">The whole traffic was gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s2291">Q: No food coming in from the farms then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">A: No, there was no distribution system.</span> <span id="s2293">Everything, you know, food was distributed, but that entire system fell apart.</span> <span id="s2294">There was no food -- the Germans didn’t send anything and the Americans were only in the southern part of Holland tat had been liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s2295">Q: These were difficult times.</span> <span id="s2296">But the camp, in a way, was the worst of all, don’t you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s2297">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s2298">Q: By far?</span></p> <p><span id="s2299">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2300">Q: It is hard to know what you would do from hindsight, but one question that people might wonder is, “You knew you were running the risk of being arrested and being sent to a camp when you were helping your friends to escape and so forth, at first?”</span></p> <p><span id="s2301">A: You knew the risk, you knew that the risk was there, that something.</span> <span id="s2302">You didn’t look at it that closely, I mean, you knew that there was a risk.</span> <span id="s2303">That it could happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2304">Q: Now, if people would be willing to -- would have been as willing to help them, if they had known what the camps were like.</span></p> <p><span id="s2305">A: I don’t think that it would have made too much difference.</span> <span id="s2306">They did it anyway.</span> <span id="s2307">Don’t forget that you become a kind of a fanatic -- and once you are a fanatic, the reasoning is gone.</span> <span id="s2308">You know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">Q: I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2310">A: If you are a fanatic about something, your thinking, your realistic thinking is gone.</span> <span id="s2311">If you are a fanatic about something.</span> <span id="s2312">Like say, what just happened a couple of months ago, the Johnstown incident, the man was a fanatic and his.</span></p> <p><span id="s2313">Q: So the anti-German feeling would make people become that committed that they would not consider the consequences?</span></p> <p><span id="s2314">A: No, they did not think of the consequences while they tried to stop it.</span> <span id="s2315">It was just being too much like a fanatic, thinking “Go on, go on, let’s do everything we can do together to get rid of them.”</span> <span id="s2316">And since we have the feeling that it couldn’t take too long anymore -- you know, with the Americans and the Canadians and the English troops being so close by.</span> <span id="s2317">We thought that Holland would be overtaken soon -- but it took still from September to May before, you know, peace came.</span> <span id="s2318">So, I think it was one of the worst times during the war, the last six or seven months.</span> <span id="s2319">After the tape is over, I will show you a book about it.</span> <span id="s2320">It is only a picture book.</span> <span id="s2321">It does not have a story, the pictures tell enough about the situation, to see how horrible it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2322">Q: I have a feeling that people here in Dayton and in the United States may not be ready to hear it yet.</span> <span id="s2323">There has been this television program now on the Holocaust and so on, and maybe people wouldn’t believe it if [they were told what actually took place]?</span></p> <p><span id="s2324">A: Well, “The Holocaust” didn’t tell the true story.</span> <span id="s2325">“The Holocaust,” it was, for people who had been there, understandable, but for people who had never been there it was not a complete story.</span> <span id="s2326">It was too much a piece taken from here and a piece taken from there -- I think that they could have been better if they would had been taken from the beginning to the end.</span> <span id="s2327">How much worse it was every day, every day you got a spoon more of misery.</span> <span id="s2328">Life in camps was really not shown.</span> <span id="s2329">Showing a bunch of dead people laying naked there in heaps.</span> <span id="s2330">Well, that was a normal sight for us, I mean.</span> <span id="s2331">At least 100 or 200 people on a heap, laying there waiting to be cremated.</span></p> <p><span id="s2332">Q: Every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s2333">A: Yes, that was, for us, nothing special.</span> <span id="s2334">We saw it all the time.</span> <span id="s2335">But if you showed it in a movie, to people who have never been there?</span> <span id="s2336">[“The Holocaust”] didn’t say much.</span> <span id="s2337">I mean, did it say much to you, when you saw that picture?</span> <span id="s2338">It was horrible.</span> <span id="s2339">How did it happen?</span> <span id="s2340">How come all these people were dead?</span> <span id="s2341">That they died from hunger and misery and sickness?</span> <span id="s2342">Maybe beaten to death or shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s2343">Q: There is a man who has written a book, and he says that it is all a story which was made up.</span> <span id="s2344">That it is not true.</span></p> <p><span id="s2345">A: No?</span> <span id="s2346">I wish I could talk to him for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s2347">Q: Yes, there is so much evidence.</span> <span id="s2348">It is hard to know how he can write such a book.</span></p> <p><span id="s2349">A: I mean, all the people who are on tape, they should make up all the same story?</span> <span id="s2350">I mean, my tape will be pretty close to the story someone else tells.</span> <span id="s2351">Maybe in a different way, but basically it comes down to the same thing.</span> <span id="s2352">Well, the killings were there, and the beatings were there, how can you otherwise let people die by the thousands, if it is not someone murdering and gassing people?</span></p> <p><span id="s2353">Q: I wondered about the play.</span> <span id="s2354">You said that you helped put on the play about the diary of Anne Frank here in the local theater?</span> <span id="s2355">Did you think that play helped people understand a little about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2356">A: No, not in the form such as we would have done it.</span> <span id="s2357">You never can bring people to [see it].</span> <span id="s2358">We are so spoiled here, in the U.S., with everything.</span> <span id="s2359">It is unbelievable for people to see, even in the imagination, what had happened in that time.</span> <span id="s2360">If you never have been hurt, I can tell you that I was hungry and it hurts, but it doesn’t mean anything to you.</span> <span id="s2361">You believe it, but you never have felt it, how horrible it is.</span> <span id="s2362">I don’t think that you can [truly feel it].</span></p> <p><span id="s2363">Q: It is part of our problem that it is so far from our experience here that it is hard to imagine that, even if you want to.</span></p> <p><span id="s2364">A: Yes, I don’t think that you can understand it if you haven’t been there.</span> <span id="s2365">You have to live through it.</span> <span id="s2366">The same with the war in Viet Nam.</span> <span id="s2367">But what they went through, horrible, it was, well that was in Viet Nam and they had a hard time.</span> <span id="s2368">But how many of these boys really should be in a mental hospital, they are so sick mentally?</span> <span id="s2369">And I think those tremendous killings and such which go on, has a lot to do with the kind of people who have been through the war in Viet Nam.</span> <span id="s2370">A life to them is nothing anymore.</span> <span id="s2371">If they kill somebody, they have maybe killed 100 over in Viet Nam -- if you kill here two or three, it doesn’t mean anything to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2372">Q: Kind of hardening?</span></p> <p><span id="s2373">A: Yes, these people are not accepted here as patients.</span> <span id="s2374">They brought them back and they went directly in the community again, instead of bringing them maybe through a kind of sanatorium or camp, whatever you want to call it, and to educate them back to normal life slowly.</span> <span id="s2375">You can’t put people back out of a war, back in normal life again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2376">Q: What should we learn?</span> <span id="s2377">Is there something that we should learn -- that people should understand, or something that should be said to people now about the camps and about Nazism?</span> <span id="s2378">Could it happen again, for example?</span></p> <p><span id="s2379">A: I am afraid so, yes.</span> <span id="s2380">I am afraid that it could happen again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2381">Q: In this country, perhaps, even?</span></p> <p><span id="s2382">A: I don’t know here.</span> <span id="s2383">I think we are too lucky -- I don’t see that it could happen here, but you never know.</span> <span id="s2384">If the situation would be bad enough.</span> <span id="s2385">But as long as people are not going hungry to bed, they have clothing and TV and everything what we have here, I don’t think that it would happen.</span> <span id="s2386">But I can see that it could happen in other countries, like we have talked about, such as South America and countries like that.</span> <span id="s2387">Countries which are really poor, where they have poor people who hardly have anything to eat.</span> <span id="s2388">In countries like that something of this kind can happen.</span> <span id="s2389">It doesn’t have to be Nazism, it can be Communism, or whatever you want to call it.</span> <span id="s2390">If there is a strong man who has influence enough on the people and tells them that they can have everything much better than they ever had before, and people believe him and follow him.</span> <span id="s2391">A man like that can be a second Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s2392">Q: What should we tell the young people?</span> <span id="s2393">About Nazi Germany, and about the camps, and about the Holocaust, and so forth?</span> <span id="s2394">What should we tell them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2395">A: I don’t think it will help too much, if you tell them.</span> <span id="s2396">I really don’t think that it really [will help].</span></p> <p><span id="s2397">Q; But we must not forget, either?</span></p> <p><span id="s2398">A: No, we should not forget, we really shouldn’t forget, and that, is what I hope to accomplish by taping things like this, and the stories in the TV -- how horrible it is -- how horrible it can be, and that we should do everything to make the world better and to see to it that there is no hunger in the world.</span> <span id="s2399">That every country should see to it that its people can make a normal living and don’t have to go to bed hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s2400">Q: Do you feel optimistic about the world and how things are going?</span> <span id="s2401">Do you think of yourself as an optimistic person?</span></p> <p><span id="s2402">A: I think that I am an optimistic person.</span> <span id="s2403">I think so.</span> <span id="s2404">I personally, that is my opinion, that there is a kind of a Communism is spreading all over the world.</span> <span id="s2405">I think that we can stop it in the Far East.</span> <span id="s2406">I don’t think that we can stop it in Africa.</span> <span id="s2407">Here in the U.S., there is no need for it, we live much too good here.</span> <span id="s2408">We are not ripe for Communism, or any kind of ism, Nazism, Communism, etc.</span> <span id="s2409">But you can see it in the rest of the world -- it is spreading, more and more.</span> <span id="s2410">So fast in the last ten or fifteen years.</span> <span id="s2411">I don’t think that you can stop it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2412">Q: So that would be cause for pessimism, in one sense, maybe, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2413">A: Well, in our way, in the way we live.</span> <span id="s2414">But you look now in the way they live in China -- where millions of people die each year from hunger.</span> <span id="s2415">It doesn’t happen anymore in China.</span> <span id="s2416">And so, it means that it is better for the people.</span> <span id="s2417">They have a better way of life.</span> <span id="s2418">I can see that they are under totalitarianism, OK.</span> <span id="s2419">I just got a beautiful letter from a friend of mine who was born in China from Canadian missionary parents.</span> <span id="s2420">They had to go home to Canada when the Chinese Revolution started.</span> <span id="s2421">He went recently to China again and visited there for three months, and he wrote that it was unbelievable, just unbelievable, the progress which was made in China since he left.</span> <span id="s2422">He said that he spoke to several of his old friends, Chinese friends, professors fro universities, and he says it is just [unbelievable] that Shanghai, which was one of the dirtiest, filthiest cities in the world, is now one of the most beautiful cities, clean, with parks that you can’t believe that it is the same city.</span> <span id="s2423">This and other things, that is spreading.</span></p> <p><span id="s2424">Q: So for them, it is an improvement.</span> <span id="s2425">What I am wondering about is what we should do in a world where there has been the camp system and Nazism and the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s2426">A: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s2427">Q: Well, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2428">What we should do?</span> <span id="s2429">What difference does it make to us that all that happened?</span> <span id="s2430">What should we do differently because we knew this and we are finding it out?</span></p> <p><span id="s2431">A: It has taught me one lesson; that you are better off if you are a loser than a winner.</span></p> <p><span id="s2432">Q: Better a loser than a winner?</span></p> <p><span id="s2433">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2434">See, in Germany and Japan, they are much better off than we are.</span> <span id="s2435">They lost the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2436">Q: I see, they are better off than if they hadn’t lost.</span> <span id="s2437">There is a lot more to be told after hearing about the experiences you had during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2438">A: That is one of the reasons why I hope that Germany never will be one again.</span> <span id="s2439">I hope that they will keep them separated forever.</span> <span id="s2440">And the moment West and East Germany come together, oh gosh, we have the same thing in a short time again.</span> <span id="s2441">I have the high hope that they never let them come together again --– and make them again “Deutchland, Deutchland uberalles.”</span> <span id="s2442">.</span> <span id="s2443">Still the same song, nothing has changed.</span> <span id="s2444">“We are the best, we make the best, we work the hardest.”</span> <span id="s2445">Well, it is true, they work hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s2446">Q: Well, you have enjoyed living in the United States for twenty years?</span></p> <p><span id="s2447">A: Oh, yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s2448">Q: It has been a good move for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2449">A: My fatherland.</span></p> <p><span id="s2450">Q: It is now your fatherland?</span> <span id="s2451">Did you become a citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2452">A: Yes, right after five years.</span> <span id="s2453">I think this is the greatest country in the world.</span> <span id="s2454">It was for us an unbelievable thing, when we came here with absolutely nothing, that we were accepted as one of them.</span> <span id="s2455">We were not just immigrants, we were part of the family.</span> <span id="s2456">And what the people did for us, total strangers, is something we couldn’t get, we couldn’t understand it, you know, that you did something for total strangers, for people you had never seen before in your life, and the warmth, the friendship, it was just fantastic.</span></p> <p><span id="s2457">Q: It was through the Westminster Presbyterian Church ?</span></p> <p><span id="s2458">A: Yes, they sponsored us, they sponsored us.</span> <span id="s2459">But not only the church, I mean all around us, people are always so helpful, friendly.</span> <span id="s2460">We had an awfully hard time with the language.</span> <span id="s2461">You know, people tried to understand us, and make us feel at home.</span> <span id="s2462">Really, it was just unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s2463">Q: Did people know that you had been in the camp for a year?</span></p> <p><span id="s2464">A: No.</span> <span id="s2465">Well, that came out in talking about it.</span> <span id="s2466">We didn’t make a big thing out of it.</span> <span id="s2467">Sometimes you talked about it.</span> <span id="s2468">Generally, you know -- during the war, what happened, what did you do during the war, or things like that.</span> <span id="s2469">If you didn’t use it, it doesn’t make all that much difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s2470">Q: Did it make a difference to people, when they heard about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2471">A: I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2472">Q: Maybe they didn’t know what it was, fully?</span></p> <p><span id="s2473">A: No, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s2474">I don’t think that it would have made any difference if I had been, or never been, in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2475">Q: How about your children?</span> <span id="s2476">Your two daughters?</span> <span id="s2477">You hadn’t talked about that much to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2478">A: No, we never talked much to them about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2479">Q: Did they ask about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2480">A: Oh, for the children, we have so much literature, so many books about it.</span> <span id="s2481">They have read about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2482">Q: They know that you were in a camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s2483">A: They know that I didn’t want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s2484">So they have never asked me too many questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s2485">Q: It might be that eventually when the copies of the tapes are in your hand, you might make it available for them to hear about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2486">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s2487">Q: Maybe when they have a chance in the future to listen to these very tapes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2488">A: Maybe they would like to listen to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2489">Q: I was going to ask Mrs. Feenstra also, about how she got along when Mr. Feenstra got arrested, and you didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2490">[Mrs. Feenstra = MF]</span></p> <p><span id="s2491">MF: Well, the most frustrating thing, the most awkward thing is that I didn’t know where my husband was.</span> <span id="s2492">Because at that time, you know he was arrested, he was taken to the Devesstadt, that was the Gestapo headquarters -- and that was all.</span> <span id="s2493">So, going to the Gestapo and find out, ask questions, just didn’t lead to anything.</span> <span id="s2494">They would let you sit there all day.</span> <span id="s2495">Then when the men had gone home I could go home and go the next day and have the same story.</span> <span id="s2496">So my mother, who was German, she tried to go to some of the land offices of the Red Cross patronized by the secretaries of the Gestapo, and where the people would be.</span></p> <p><span id="s2497">Q: There were German secretaries.</span></p> <p><span id="s2498">MF: There were German secretaries, they were all Germans, and they were all strictly from that particular building.</span> <span id="s2499">We had lived in that area, so we knew pretty well what places were available and where they would go.</span> <span id="s2500">So she found out then the name from somebody, of one of the people who had had a hand on my husband’s case.</span> <span id="s2501">So we went to see him, he was a civilian, and he told me that my husband had done something and had an affair with a Jewish woman, and had done things against the Third Reich.</span> <span id="s2502">That was about the end of the session.</span> <span id="s2503">So, next time, I tried again.</span> <span id="s2504">I just thought that if I could make him [mad] and he will even yell something at me, and then I can find out more about it, about the case, where my husband is, what happened.</span> <span id="s2505">And that night the Americans had bombed, there had been an air raid.</span> <span id="s2506">He said to me, “What do you want from me?</span> <span id="s2507">You come here to look for your husband who had done some things against us, and my family, my children, my wife may be dead, and you want sympathy from me?”</span> <span id="s2508">I said, “I don’t want sympathy, I just want to know where my husband is.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2509">Q: Finally getting to talk to someone, an SS man in civilian clothes, who was trying to put you off by telling you about an air raid on his hometown, he didn’t have time to talk to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2510">MF: I didn’t want to have sympathy.</span> <span id="s2511">Well, I thought that we wouldn’t get anywhere there, so we tried to find other ways to get in contact with my husband.</span> <span id="s2512">So I gathered all the patient cards and went to the SS and said, “Well, this is what my husband has been working on and these are his patients now and anyone who has any complaint, I will send here, to you.”</span> <span id="s2513">And they said, “You are crazy!</span> <span id="s2514">Who do you think you are?”</span> <span id="s2515">and I said, “Well, there can be treatments that are important and which can be harmful to the patients.</span> <span id="s2516">I have to see my husband and I don’t want to see him personally.</span> <span id="s2517">I just want to talk to him on business.”</span> <span id="s2518">Well, the first time, it didn’t work and my mother went back and my mother finally came with a visiting pass for 15 minutes to the jail.</span> <span id="s2519">I could see my husband at the Amsterdam jail for 15 minutes.</span> <span id="s2520">I was not allowed to talk about anything private, but just talk business.</span> <span id="s2521">Well, I said, “If I can take my little baby and go to jail, and he sees us and sees that we are well, that might be helpful to him.</span> <span id="s2522">Maybe we can get some sign which will help us to find out something.”</span> <span id="s2523">That is what we did.</span> <span id="s2524">So at least I knew that he was still in Amsterdam, he was in jail, and the saddest moment in my life was when I saw my husband, without a tie, without shoestrings, without a belt, coming just with chicken wire between us, and seeing his child for the first time.</span> <span id="s2525">Indeed we managed to stay to the business jargon.</span> <span id="s2526">We could understand, since we could ask questions and he could answer some of the things.</span> <span id="s2527">At least he had seen us, and I knew that he was well, he had been questioned, but they didn’t have anything specific on him.</span> <span id="s2528">Naturally, the 15 minutes were over in no time and we had to leave.</span> <span id="s2529">And, in a way, I was happy to see him and was satisfied.</span> <span id="s2530">Now I had something to go by.</span> <span id="s2531">Naturally we knew from the underground that it was hard to get messages to him.</span> <span id="s2532">It was not possible.</span> <span id="s2533">I just couldn’t make a connection.</span> <span id="s2534">The only thing that we had was that every Friday we had to bring clean clothes and Monday we would take a package of dirty clothes away.</span> <span id="s2535">Naturally they were searched inch by inch, and sure enough, one time, my husband had managed to put a piece of cigarette paper -- at that time you had collars with little stays in them, and he had managed, he had, with a brush from a toothbrush, he had punched in a message.</span> <span id="s2536">And I managed to get, one time, a little picture from the baby, and he knew that everything was still going alright.</span> <span id="s2537">Then, one day, we brought the clean clothes and there was nobody there.</span> <span id="s2538">I mean that we didn’t know where he was and I couldn’t find out anything.</span> <span id="s2539">I kept going to the SS, to the Headquarters office, and I couldn’t find out anything.</span> <span id="s2540">But through all kinds of means and ways -- by talking to people; my mother would stick around there and talk to people and try to get connections, and she heard about an SS man who was handling his case.</span> <span id="s2541">And I said, if I could just talk to somebody, and know a little more about it, so just know where he is.</span> <span id="s2542">You know, sending your thoughts out to nowhere is very difficult.</span> <span id="s2543">So, one day I got this name, and I knew where he was staying, and I called him in his hotel.</span> <span id="s2544">And I said, “Well, I had heard about him and I wanted to talk with him, and I wanted to get acquainted with him.”</span> <span id="s2545">Naturally he had something completely different in mind, and he said, “Sure, I can come and pick you up or I can send somebody.”</span> <span id="s2546">And I said, “No, I have to think about my name.</span> <span id="s2547">I cannot do that, I want to meet you at your office.”</span> <span id="s2548">He said, “Oh, fine!</span> <span id="s2549">Good!</span> <span id="s2550">We will take it fro there.”</span> <span id="s2551">I said, “All right.”</span> <span id="s2552">So when I came the next day to the Gestapo and to the doorman, and I said, “I want to see Mr. So-&amp;-So.”</span> <span id="s2553">And he said, “Sure, he is expecting you, go to room 204.”</span> <span id="s2554">And that never had happened before.</span> <span id="s2555">So I was there, and he asked me to sit down and he was very friendly and offered me a cigarette, and he said, “What can I do for you?’</span> <span id="s2556">nicely.</span> <span id="s2557">And I said, “Well, I might disappoint you, but I am coming here to try to find out what happened to my husband.”</span> <span id="s2558">He was not very happy with that, and he really laid it on me.</span> <span id="s2559">He really gave me a hard time.</span> <span id="s2560">Well, I really let him yell and scream -- finally he had to come up for a breath.</span> <span id="s2561">And I said, “You are German and I was born German, and you always have been taught in life to be a good sport, now I have outsmarted you so why don’t you take it as a good sport.</span> <span id="s2562">I am not here to sleep with you and I will not go with you.”</span> <span id="s2563">He said, “\Why don’t you just have dinner with me?”</span> <span id="s2564">I said, “No!”</span> <span id="s2565">and I said, “I outsmarted you and I came here and why can’t you be helpful to me?</span> <span id="s2566">Why can’t you give me just one answer?”</span> <span id="s2567">He said that he just couldn’t do it and that it was impossible.</span> <span id="s2568">So I said, “OK!”</span> <span id="s2569">So I left, but I had the name and the doorman knew that this man had said, “If that lady comes, let her in.”</span> <span id="s2570">From that day on, I had always a way in -- and he was too embarrassed to say that he hadn’t gotten what he had expected.</span> <span id="s2571">So I would go over there and he would say, “What do you want?”</span> <span id="s2572">and I would say, “Well, you know what I want.</span> <span id="s2573">Just tell me where my husband is.”</span> <span id="s2574">“What did you do?”</span> <span id="s2575">and he looked at me in a threatening manner.</span> <span id="s2576">“You are so terrible – I could send you to a concentration camp right now!”</span> <span id="s2577">I said, “OK, fine!</span> <span id="s2578">Send me to the one where he is -- maybe I will find out about it,” you know, jokingly.</span> <span id="s2579">Well, finally the Germans, there were lots of Dutch people that attacked Germans and threw them in the canals and such, and until a certain time they had a reward out [for fishing Germans back out of the canals], and they could either get people for favors, you know, who had been taken for custody, free, or they could get money.</span> <span id="s2580">Now, I had made contact with the -- what is it called, the “Kriegsgericht,” the military court.</span> <span id="s2581">And said to a young man -- we had given him something for his family and so, and talked with him -- now, if someone comes and asks you for an award, will you send them to us before he gets to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s2582">Because all the things went through the Gestapo, and maybe he can help us.</span> <span id="s2583">And, sure enough, one day he contacted my mother and said.</span> <span id="s2584">“Now he will be, tomorrow morning, at the Gestapo --see that you can reach him before.</span> <span id="s2585">He told me at 11 about it, so we went to the man’s home and I said, “I heard that you saved two high military officers lives and you will get a reward for this.”</span> <span id="s2586">He said, “Yes, what about it?”</span> <span id="s2587">He was a really shady figure, but I didn’t know that at that time; but anyway I said, “OK I make a deal with you, I pay you now, or they will pay you.”</span> <span id="s2588">-- there was a set fee for that -- and you will sign a letter for me that you have known my husband and that he was a good friend of yours.</span> <span id="s2589">That you know that he was taken into custody, he never has been tried, and that you want him free, and for two high ranking officers, that will be a good deal.”</span> <span id="s2590">I said, “When my husband comes back, I will pay you the same amount again.”</span> <span id="s2591">Well, he was just a little reluctant.</span> <span id="s2592">He said, “I don’t know your husband and I don’t know if I can get into trouble.”</span> <span id="s2593">I said, “What kind of trouble, what can happen?</span> <span id="s2594">You go to the authorities yourself and they give you maybe 100 bucks, maybe 500 bucks (obviously meaning the currency in use), and then, maybe you don’t get anything, maybe they say that you had done it [throwing the officers in the canal].</span> <span id="s2595">Well, that was a marvelous idea, so he said, “I don’t write letters like that.”</span> <span id="s2596">I said, “OK, I will write a letter, I will translate it for you.</span> <span id="s2597">I will come and give it to you for your signature, and I will give you a copy of it.”</span> <span id="s2598">And he said, “OK.”</span> <span id="s2599">So we went home and we contacted this young man at the court, and we said, “How do you set up a letter like this that is respectful and how do you get it to the right place?”</span> <span id="s2600">He said, “You have to go over to the Gestapo, and when he comes, then you know, get your nerve up, so that he can explain to them that this is a good friend and so on, and that he does not want the money reward.”</span> <span id="s2601">And he said, “Well, the only way I know of is that I could come to your house and I type it, and I bring my typewriter.”</span> <span id="s2602">My mother said, “Well, with German characters on the typewriter, that is a little risky.</span> <span id="s2603">How about if you come and I fix you something to eat and, you know, you are in the family, and then you sit down and tell us, and we write it.”</span> <span id="s2604">And that’s what we did.</span> <span id="s2605">So he got his letter off typed and written up, and went then to the man and he signed it.</span> <span id="s2606">He wanted some more money, but we finally did agree and he signed it.</span> <span id="s2607">And he went the next morning to the Gestapo, I went the same day, to the same man to whom I had been going and I said, “Hey, listen, I heard this and this happened, and I hope that you put in a good word for me.”</span> <span id="s2608">And he said, “How, in heaven’s name, can I do that; these are navy people, or marine people -- I have nothing to do with them!”</span> <span id="s2609">I said, “It all goes through the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s2610">They can’t do anything without you.”</span> <span id="s2611">And he said, “Well, just wait until I get this letter,’ and I brought him a copy so he knew what he was looking for, and he got the letter and he said to me, “OK, I will send the letter, under one promise: that you will not show up here for two weeks.”</span> <span id="s2612">I said, “Well, but how do I know that you really send this letter?”</span> <span id="s2613">“Well, this is once, my word against yours.</span> <span id="s2614">I trust you, that you will not show up for two weeks, and I send the letter.”</span> <span id="s2615">And I said, “Well, OK, it is a deal.”</span> <span id="s2616">He said, “Well there is something else, if your husband had done during his time while he was under arrest anything that is against him, this will not work.</span> <span id="s2617">And I can’t promise you that it will work, but I will send it and, if anything can be done, it will be done.”</span> <span id="s2618">He did.</span> <span id="s2619">Because later, I received a letter where it was stated that he had sent it by “Kurier,” you know, by personal messenger,and he had gotten the answer back that they were looking into it and there was work done in Oranienburg.</span> <span id="s2620">And then he said, “Look, the only thing I can do is wait.”</span> <span id="s2621">And “I hope he has not done anything that was against him.</span> <span id="s2622">You know I could really get into trouble with this!”</span> <span id="s2623">And I said, “Well, can’t you speed it up a little bit, and get us both out of trouble?”</span> <span id="s2624">And he said, “No, you will just have to wait!”</span> <span id="s2625">You know, one time he was really friendly and one time he was plain nasty, but I would go every day and see him.</span> <span id="s2626">And sometimes you know, he was really upset with me.</span> <span id="s2627">But I said, “Now, listen, I just want to know where my husband is!”</span> <span id="s2628">So he obviously just took it in stride and he was a sport and he gave me the answer to his submission that he had sent it to Doenitz, that is Great Admiral Doenitz, and that they were taking it from there.</span> <span id="s2629">So the only thing I could do was wait.</span> <span id="s2630">Go every day and find out if he had heard something.</span> <span id="s2631">Now, in the meantime, I had a lot of trouble with the patients, who were very well-meaning, but were really touching, because when my husband was in Amersfoort camp, they would say, “Amersfoort, oh my gosh, oh my gosh1 I was just [talking to?]</span> <span id="s2632">somebody who had somebody brought from Amersfoort, but it never happened, there never was anyone brought from Amersfoort, but it never happened, there never was anyone brought from a camp, but he was tortured and every bone in his body was broken.”</span> <span id="s2633">And they had seen it, and they heard it.</span> <span id="s2634">I mean, just to hear somebody talk that way and this out of the same idea that they want to do you a favor, and give you a message with some encouraging words, that was sheer torture.</span> <span id="s2635">I finally had to develop a technique to put a patient in the chair and put one of these cotton things in his mouth, that they keep the mouth open.</span> <span id="s2636">Then I would go on and wash my hands and then I would treat them, because sometimes, I just couldn’t stand it.</span> <span id="s2637">You know, it gets on your nerves, especially if you know that they are telling you stories that they had no way of knowing -- absolutely no way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2638">Q: Well you could drill them a little harder.</span> <span id="s2639">[meaning the teeth]</span></p> <p><span id="s2640">MF: I tell you, I had one time, and I can see now that someone can murder anybody, and in Europe every Sunday somebody has duty.</span> <span id="s2641">There is always, in every neighborhood, one doctor, one dentist, one pharmacist on duty.</span> <span id="s2642">One Sunday I was on duty, and three young soldiers came in, and they wanted to be treated, they couldn’t get to the clinic or someplace.</span> <span id="s2643">Somebody had recommended them, and I tell you, that moment I was so full of hate I think that, if I could have gotten away with it, I would have cut their throats.</span> <span id="s2644">And this is so frightful to me, that a human being can be so possessed with an idea, and so full of hate that I said, enough, this is terrible.</span> <span id="s2645">I treated them and got them out as fast as I could.</span> <span id="s2646">I never, ever, had anybody [like that] come in.</span> <span id="s2647">But then I had this young man from the SS, the watchman, he came in and he wanted to be treated, but on the other hand, he had helped me so -- he was a Dutch fellow -- and by talking to him I learned a little bit more about him and his background, and I could understand his attitude a little bit more, as well as his way.</span> <span id="s2648">He was really, later on, just a victim of his youthful enthusiasm and black and white style of life.</span> <span id="s2649">You know, with young people there is very little grey between there.</span> <span id="s2650">But it was very, very hard, and even shortly before my husband came home -- soon after the message had been sent -- one of the patients, he let everybody else go in ahead of him, and “Oh my gosh, what is waiting now for me again?”</span> <span id="s2651">[I thought].</span> <span id="s2652">He finally came in and he said, ‘I want to talk to you!”</span> <span id="s2653">And I said, ‘OK, what do you want to talk about?”</span> <span id="s2654">He said that I shouldn’t be working so hard and why I did all of this because there was no end to it and he had very good connections in this and this bar, the people from the underground and from the Germans were eating and changing things and he had seen my husband’s dossiers.</span> <span id="s2655">But I knew that that was impossible, because I knew where they were.</span> <span id="s2656">He said that my husband had been arrested for treason and that he would either be shot, or never would come home.</span> <span id="s2657">There was just no chance.</span> <span id="s2658">Well, I couldn’t tell him that there was something else that was working at the moment.</span> <span id="s2659">So I said, ‘why can people be so gruesome to somebody, and all under the auspices of doing you some good?”</span> <span id="s2660">He really meant it.</span> <span id="s2661">But why, in heaven’s name, would people i.e. for this thing?</span> <span id="s2662">I never have understood it and all these rumors and all these stories which were going around, they were so frightful.</span> <span id="s2663">They were all spun around by people who, maybe, meant very well, but had no reason to just talk so and torture people who had relatives who had been arrested and so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2664">Q: Did you get together with other women whose husbands were in prison?</span></p> <p><span id="s2665">MF: Oh, very little.</span> <span id="s2666">I always had been a working woman and I have always been quite independent, and I knew about some of them and I would talk to them.</span> <span id="s2667">But there, they would often listen to all these gruesome stories and would come crying and I always said, “I know that my husband is coming home -- he is coming home.”</span> <span id="s2668">They always thought I was crazy.</span> <span id="s2669">I lived for about 11:30 or 11:45 in the morning, and when my husband hadn’t shown up by that time, then the only time he could have come home [that day] was close to 12 o’clock at night.</span> <span id="s2670">There was another train from Berlin coming then.</span> <span id="s2671">That is what I lived for.</span> <span id="s2672">And I lived from day to day.</span></p> <p><span id="s2673">Q: Oh, you knew that he was in Oranienburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s2674">A: I knew by that time that he was in Oranienburg.</span> <span id="s2675">I had received a letter and I was able to send him packages.</span></p> <p><span id="s2676">Q: Send him packages, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2677">MF: And even the postman got very much upset with me because he thought that because we didn’t have enough to eat, it was ridiculous that I would send somebody, who maybe deserved to be in Germany for being picked up and sent to camp, to send him anything was ridiculous.</span> <span id="s2678">And people, there were still people who believed what was in the paper and all these stories.</span> <span id="s2679">We all knew that it was worse than we could ever dream of; but later it really showed up as it was because in 1942, my mother was a courier from the underground and she would go to forced laborers that were taken to Germany to work in a factory.</span> <span id="s2680">She would go from the underground and make contact and so on and she had brought messages back and she had heard about the crematories which were built, in ’42!</span> <span id="s2681">Nobody believed that!</span> <span id="s2682">So what use is it to talk to anyone, to anybody, about my husband.</span> <span id="s2683">And I had the very strong belief -- and this is the only thing which kept me going, day and night, that my husband will come home and he shall come home!</span> <span id="s2684">This just, at first, kept me going and kept me going to the Gestapo every day.</span> <span id="s2685">Sometimes they were very nasty to me.</span> <span id="s2686">I said, “Well, it’s worth it, but he will come home.</span> <span id="s2687">And sure enough, one of these days, he did come home.</span> <span id="s2688">And I said, ‘You should have gone first to the Gestapo.”</span> <span id="s2689">And he said, “No.</span> <span id="s2690">I wanted to come home first to you and see you.”</span> <span id="s2691">And I said, ‘Well, let’s go then together.”</span> <span id="s2692">Did he tell you what the man said?</span></p> <p><span id="s2693">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2694">MF: Well, when he arrived, while he stood for a moment, he didn’t want me to go in with him.</span> <span id="s2695">But the man I went to see every day, he had said, “Now if your husband comes home, you make sure that he shows up here right away!”</span> <span id="s2696">When he showed up then, we did go there and he said, “Now you stay outside!”</span> <span id="s2697">And he stayed by the door and he showed his Entlassungschein.</span> <span id="s2698">And he didn’t pay any attention to it, and finally he looked at us and said, “Feenstra, Feenstra, Oh thank heaven you are back, get me relief from your wife, listen.”</span> <span id="s2699">But he really was happy, and normally we were not allowed to leave town because he had to report every time [JF had stated that it was every day for the first while] to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s2700">I had asked him, I had said that I needed rest, and my husband needed rest -- and I thought that maybe he needed rest, because I had come to visit him so often, that I said, “I might come to haunt you some more.”</span> <span id="s2701">So he gave the permission that we could go away, out of town, somewhere.</span> <span id="s2702">And then he had to go and report every week.</span> <span id="s2703">There is more to this story: the same man became a prisoner of war in France – and when he became a prisoner of war he wrote me a card and asked me if I please would send him a package.</span></p> <p><span id="s2704">Q: Mh, Mh!</span></p> <p><span id="s2705">MF: There, you see, I have been brought up with the theory that everything in life will repeat itself as the German expression goes, “Will wiedererlebt werden” (will be experienced again).</span> <span id="s2706">There, you see, and it always has been true.</span> <span id="s2707">Because he asked me for a favor and I did it.</span> <span id="s2708">Because, although it was frightful and nerve-wracking and he was sometimes very nasty, and , when he wasn’t nasty, someone else would be very nasty, and they slapped me around one time; but there came another time that he had to ask us for a favor -- and he was in the same position.</span> <span id="s2709">Maybe he remembered that many times and that his father might have come to know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2710">Q: Well, he was high up in the SS, wasn’t he?</span></p> <p><span id="s2711">MF: Yes, he was high.</span> <span id="s2712">I am so dumb in rank when it comes to military, that I truly don’t know.</span> <span id="s2713">He was a Lt. Col. Or a Col. or something, but he had lots of stripes, eagles, and all kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s2714">Because he has a private office and he had three or four secretaries there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2715">Q: Did you ever hear of him after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2716">MF: No.</span> <span id="s2717">after I sent him the package, that was it.</span> <span id="s2718">When we were moving, one time in Indonesia I believe, I found his name -- you know, the prisoner of war [list] -- it had been lost, so much of our luggage had been lost during transports, that I [forgot about him].</span> <span id="s2719">If I had known his name, I would have searched and found out what he was doing now, because every German will tell you, “We didn’t know!</span> <span id="s2720">We didn’t find out what happened!”</span> <span id="s2721">I would have been very curious to find out if he would.</span></p> <p><span id="s2722">Q: Make that same claim?</span></p> <p><span id="s2723">MF: He had a human quality about him.</span> <span id="s2724">I always thought that he had a human quality about him.</span> <span id="s2725">Oh, he was outrageous, and many times he said that if I would once again step in his office again, he would have arrested me and I don’t know what else he threatened.</span> <span id="s2726">And I said, “So what, [you can’t hurt me anymore!”</span></p> <p><span id="s2727">Q: Were you surprised by how much your husband had been affected by his year he spent in prison?</span> <span id="s2728">It affected him, he had lost weight and he was [different].</span></p> <p><span id="s2729">MF: Sure, it affected him mentally.</span> <span id="s2730">And I will tell you, even up to today.</span> <span id="s2731">He had nightmares, and he wakes up during the night and he screams.</span></p> <p><span id="s2732">Q; He was telling me about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2733">MF: And he had, in the beginning, much more.</span> <span id="s2734">No, I was really happy that, because he could come back into the groove of a family again, well, I just had to bear with it.</span> <span id="s2735">Because he would, all of a sudden, get up, put on his coat, and go away, and not say a thing.</span> <span id="s2736">I thought that that was part of, you know, the whole situation, because, mentally, it must have done terrible things to him.</span> <span id="s2737">And then there was something else, he had come home -- he has thought this once, and he had so many things with him -- and this might have helped him to come home -- and when he was home, he felt so badly about his friends who were still there.</span> <span id="s2738">And he could hardly stand it and that was the reason why, as soon as the war was over, we just closed up shop and we searched for the people, and worked for the repatriation of the people.</span> <span id="s2739">We searched for them, and found a lot of them, and we took lots of them home -- and from them I had letters, because he never wanted to talk about anything.</span> <span id="s2740">I never questioned him, because I felt that, whenever the time would be ready, he will tell me, and that I should not force him to tell me.</span> <span id="s2741">That would be just inhuman.</span></p> <p><span id="s2742">Q: All in good time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2743">MF: Yes, I just have to wait, that the time comes.</span> <span id="s2744">Then he found some of his friends who didn’t have a home, and they didn’t have [a place to go to] and we, you know how the situation was, we didn’t have much food, or anything, so when they had to leave the camp, well, we all took them in.</span> <span id="s2745">And nine people came and shared with us.</span> <span id="s2746">We just shared clothing and food and everything we had.</span> <span id="s2747">They stayed with us until they found either their homes or they found somebody they could go to.</span> <span id="s2748">But from them I found out a lot.</span> <span id="s2749">For instance, one of the young men -- we had seven squatters upstairs -- and sometimes I would ask him, “Oh why don’t you go upstairs and do this or that for me?”</span> <span id="s2750">And he did the laundry or something.</span> <span id="s2751">And whenever it was done, he would just stretch and stretch, until finally I forgot about it, or he didn’t have to go.</span> <span id="s2752">And one time I said, ‘Please go and get it, right now, for me!”</span> <span id="s2753">And he went and came downstairs -- and he was white as a sheet and he was out of breath.</span> <span id="s2754">I said, “Stan, what is wrong?”</span> <span id="s2755">“Don’t ever ask me again to do this.”</span> <span id="s2756">And he never went -- and later on he had told me that when he was freed in Austria, where the Russians were -- and he had seen lots of perverts and he was just petrified.</span> <span id="s2757">So it was funny, like, wherever I would go they would go as a group with me.</span> <span id="s2758">In the neighborhood they would say, “There is Mrs. Feenstra with her entourage.”</span> <span id="s2759">They would go to the grocery -- they didn’t want to be alone.</span> <span id="s2760">Then, by their being together, and I would just sit there, they would talk about things, and I would find out things gradually.</span> <span id="s2761">Then, I would sometimes ask them something.</span> <span id="s2762">But I knew that I just could not possibly ask him to tell me what had gone on.</span> <span id="s2763">There still are certain things which remain as scars and which, when you mention them, he will just crawl in his shell, so I never mention them.</span> <span id="s2764">When they were all together, they would talk about it.</span> <span id="s2765">“You know when this happened, or when that happened” and “So-and-so did this to us” and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2766">Q: Well, you both experienced things that should never happen again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2767">MF: No, it should never have happened in the first place.</span> <span id="s2768">But how do you word it?</span> <span id="s2769">And there are still people that do not believe.</span> <span id="s2770">When they read in papers what happened to the people.</span> <span id="s2771">We had too many [experiences] -- I had my husband, we had so many friends, people that came from Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s2772">One of our young friends, his father was still alive, but he had lost his mother, and he had lost everybody.</span> <span id="s2773">We talked to so many of these people, when we were working in the camps.</span> <span id="s2774">Women with their nipples ripped off1 How do you touch those people, and how do you ask them for their choice?</span> <span id="s2775">That’s impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2776">Q: That has to be their choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s2777">MF: That’s their choice, and sometimes, when you sit in a corner with them and they might have an urge to just let it come out.</span> <span id="s2778">They might talk, it doesn’t have to be a good friend.</span> <span id="s2779">It just has to be a willing ear.</span> <span id="s2780">Because many people which we have seen there in Kastin-Erde which I had never seen before and will never see afterwards would sit there, and tell you the story of, you know, what happened to them.</span> <span id="s2781">Then your imagination, you have to be very careful that your imagination does not take over, because otherwise you just can’t cope with it.</span> <span id="s2782">Because, from the story that you hear, from other people, you relate to what your husband has been through and what has happened in between times [he saw you].</span></p> <p><span id="s2783">Q: Then you begin to think to yourself and wonder if he had that also happen to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2784">MF: Well, no, I was sure that a lot of those thing [happened] and I had heard a lot of the things they had talked about.</span> <span id="s2785">You know, these men had been together in camp and they had shared a lot of those things like Kolnisa.</span> <span id="s2786">I don’t know if he talked to you about it, he talked to him when he came back from Klinker and he came to the workmen [locksmith] workshop, and so.</span> <span id="s2787">And those people when they were together, I would just sit quietly back and I wouldn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s2788">So they would gradually talk freely about things.</span> <span id="s2789">Then they acted like it hadn’t been that bad and the memory, just getting rid of it, get it out of their minds, because I think, after they talked about it, they could easier cope with it.</span> <span id="s2790">A lot of them had gone in there [the concentration camps] as young men and they came back as adults and had found a completely different world.</span> <span id="s2791">They had a hard time coping with it.</span> <span id="s2792">Many people that we knew have gotten divorces because the husband said, “You don’t know what I have been through!”</span> <span id="s2793">and the wife said, “What do you think that I went through here, all by myself, and how everything went!”</span> <span id="s2794">And very soon there was a breach and it became bigger and bigger and they just couldn’t stand each other anymore and they broke up.</span> <span id="s2795">It was very sad, a very very bad thing.</span> <span id="s2796">But I never, never had a day where I thought that my husband wouldn’t come back; and I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s2797">There were days where I was very depressed, and later on we compared dates and such, and he said that these were the days when he had had it very bad.</span> <span id="s2798">So we must have been very close, and there must have been a special relationship between us.</span> <span id="s2799">That helped us!</span></p> <p><span id="s2800">Q; I can well believe it!</span></p> <p><span id="s2801">MF: When my husband came home he was very jealous of our little girl.</span> <span id="s2802">I wanted her to stay very little.</span> <span id="s2803">She was a tiny little girl, but she was developed -- she talked so quickly, so clearly, and she walked, potty trained and everything before she was one year old.</span> <span id="s2804">When he came home and I said, “Say good night to Daddy!”</span> <span id="s2805">and she said, “No, this is Uncle, my Daddy is there.”</span> <span id="s2806">And he was the picture on the mantel.</span></p> <p><span id="s2807">A: I told him that!</span></p> <p><span id="s2808">MF: I was run down and I had overdone it a little bit, so I didn’t feel too good, and we went out of town, to a little house outside Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s2809">We would go for a walk in the afternoon with the little girl, and when we came home I had plans that she would go to bed fairly early and that I had the whole evening for my husband.</span> <span id="s2810">When we came home after walking, I was very tired, and I said, “Now I have to take care of her now and get her to bed.”</span> <span id="s2811">He said, ‘No, I am hungry too!</span> <span id="s2812">I don’t want you to make dinner for me right now.</span> <span id="s2813">I can wait and so can she!”</span> <span id="s2814">I said, ‘No, the child is different.</span> <span id="s2815">I have to take care of her and then we will have time together again.”</span> <span id="s2816">It was very hard for him to adjust to that, because when he left we were just a twosome.</span> <span id="s2817">He knew that there was this baby and we had waited for it, and we wanted so badly.</span> <span id="s2818">But he never had experienced it, and he never really had had a person with us, you know, which you have to consider.</span></p> <p><span id="s2819">Q: All the extra problems that these people had to live through.</span></p> <p><span id="s2820">MF; Yes, yes!</span> <span id="s2821">If cut in slices, now this corner now, with nothing around it, that would be so much easier.</span> <span id="s2822">Families, everything!</span> <span id="s2823">It was a problem.</span> <span id="s2824">We were very lucky then.</span> <span id="s2825">We worked very hard on that and we made a go of it and stayed together.</span></p> <p><span id="s2826">Q: And here you are1</span></p> <p><span id="s2827">MF: Yes, married for 30 years and still together.</span></p> <p><span id="s2828">Q: I thank you very much for adding to this.</span> <span id="s2829">We hadn’t really anticipated that you would also add something to the tape, but that was a very important dimension, a very important side.</span> <span id="s2830">We can understand [a lot more now].</span></p> <p><span id="s2831">MF: In our relationship?</span></p> <p><span id="s2832">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2833">MF: I had only one wish: I wanted to work and keep everything in the way it was so that when he came back, if he wanted to he could step right into his office and into the house and take it from there, if he ever could forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s2834">Q: It must have helped to have everything still there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2835">MF: Oh yes, because the only thing I think which kept me going was my belief that he would come back.</span> <span id="s2836">I think that if I had lost, for one day, that, I could not have coped.</span></p> <p><span id="s2837">Q: Was your mother there, the whole time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2838">MF: Well, my mother was with me most of the time, you see, she had a German soldier in her house, so she had to go every so often to her house.</span> <span id="s2839">Then she would go on trips for the underground.</span> <span id="s2840">You see, whenever she had to go, then she had to leave us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2841">Q: She was a courier?</span></p> <p><span id="s2842">MF: Yes.</span> <span id="s2843">She was native German, so she spoke German, but she had traveled so much, and she had the ability to speak so many dialects -- and she could adapt to a dialect so quickly.</span> <span id="s2844">She would put on an old coat and a babushka on and she would go just like one of the peasant women.</span> <span id="s2845">This did help her tremendously in getting around.</span></p> <p><span id="s2846">Q: She did that all through the war then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2847">MF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2848">Q: That is amazing!</span></p> <p><span id="s2849">MF: You see, my mother had learned about Hitler in 1922 from a friend of hers who had said to her, “Beware of this man, he will cause us a lot of trouble,” a dear friend of hers who died.</span> <span id="s2850">Before he died he said, ‘You have to promise me that you leave Germany.’</span> <span id="s2851">My mother left Germany in 1927 and went to the Netherlands.</span> <span id="s2852">Then I went back to Germany to study.</span> <span id="s2853">She had been very much aware politically of what was going on.</span> <span id="s2854">My mother came from an area that was “Sudetenland,” it was Polish and German and many Jews had lived there.</span> <span id="s2855">She had been brought up in that area and she knew so much about it and she had interests in everything which was going on in the world and was very much aware of everything.</span> <span id="s2856">So she felt that she had to contribute something.</span> <span id="s2857">You see, as a German, she was hated by the Dutch and the Irish and she was hated by the Germans also, because she did not want to conform.</span> <span id="s2858">My mother lost everything also, because she had a pension -- and all of her friends’ parents practically lived there, because the children did not want the parents.</span> <span id="s2859">And so it grew!</span> <span id="s2860">Then, when the Germans came into Amsterdam and, one time they -- I don’t know, but it had to do something with her passport -- or so.</span> <span id="s2861">Certainly, they were aware of her, and they came and offered her so much of security if she would take the German girls into her home.</span> <span id="s2862">You know, like the WACS, or whatever the name is, you know, the German girls in uniform.</span> <span id="s2863">My mother wouldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s2864">She lost [the house].</span> <span id="s2865">At two P.M. they came and told her that the next day she had to be out of the house.</span> <span id="s2866">Leave everything she had!</span></p> <p><span id="s2867">Q: Even the dog!</span></p> <p><span id="s2868">MF: Yes, she had gotten a dog.</span> <span id="s2869">It was in the neighborhood where Gestapo office was.</span> <span id="s2870">The house had belonged to a representative from the Coca Cola [company].</span> <span id="s2871">He was married to a German singer, a very famous singer.</span> <span id="s2872">They had a chalet in Switzerland, and they had a house in Spain.</span> <span id="s2873">They were on a trip either to Spain or to Switzerland, I can’t remember, when the war broke out.</span> <span id="s2874">Well, they had said that the maid could stay there -- then the lawyer contacted my mother and asked if she wanted to buy the house next to her.</span> <span id="s2875">She lived next door to it.</span> <span id="s2876">My mother said, “Yes!”</span> <span id="s2877">that she would like to.</span> <span id="s2878">Then the maid had seen to it she got rid of [the personal belongings].</span></p> <p><span id="s2879">Q: Well, there is, I am sure, a great deal more to it.</span> <span id="s2880">I am thinking that when I come back and bring you the tapes, if you have thought of some more which really should be on the tape, we can see you again then and put it on.</span></p></body></html>
