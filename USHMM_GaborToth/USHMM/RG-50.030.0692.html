there as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Were you raised there as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: I grew up most of my years in Rochester, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: What was your childhood like?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: It was pretty much, I guess, like anybody's childhood.</span> <span id="s26">I lived in a rural area.</span> <span id="s27">I was mostly surrounded by farms, and that's about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: What did your parents do?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: My mother was a homemaker, my father was an oil mechanic, and I think that's the only job he ever had, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: Did you go to school there in Rochester as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: I went to school in Rochester.</span> <span id="s32">I started kindergarten in the City of Rochester and later in life I moved to one of the suburbs and went to high school in a town called Webster, New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Which high school did you go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: Webster High School --</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: -- in Webster, New York.</span> <span id="s37">I graduated from there in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Did you enjoy high school?</span> <span id="s39">Did you participate in any sports or...</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: No.</span> <span id="s41">I'm not a very good sports person.</span> <span id="s42">I did play a little baseball, and that's about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s44">And 1940, when -- did you go on to university from high school or what happened after high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: I did not go to college or university.</span> <span id="s46">I did go to night school, taking courses one at a time or two at a time.</span> <span id="s47">Kodak paid for any -- I worked for Eastman Kodak, by the way, and they would pay your tuition if you took some course related to your job.</span> <span id="s48">But I didn't actually get enough credits to get a college degree.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s50">So did you start working for Eastman Kodak immediately after of high school or what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: Immediately out of high school I went to Kodak and was hired.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: A little bit of everything.</span> <span id="s54">I started out at Kodak working in a stockroom, a chemical stockroom, where we used to fill orders for various chemicals for the chemistry departments of various universities.</span> <span id="s55">And I worked there up until I went into the service.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Did you enjoy working for Eastman Kodak?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s58">Yeah.</span> <span id="s59">Actually, if you lived in Rochester you worked for Kodak.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Almost everybody worked there.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Are you married?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Did you meet your wife before or after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: I met my wife in high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Tell us about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: My wife went to a Rochester high school.</span> <span id="s68">She was in a class after me.</span> <span id="s69">I went to a high school in a different town.</span> <span id="s70">And my wife's cousin was a grower of flowers and also had a flower shop and I used to work in the greenhouses and my wife worked in the store -- on the retail store, selling flowers and corsages and different things like that.</span> <span id="s71">We went to the same church.</span> <span id="s72">I knew my wife through my sister, I think, primarily, because they were in Girl Scouts together.</span> <span id="s73">Our church sponsored a Girl Scout troop and a couple of Boy Scout troops.</span> <span id="s74">We did go to the same church.</span> <span id="s75">She was in Girl Scouts with my sister and I was in Boy Scouts.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: So you actually knew her from a very young age?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: I knew her from -- oh, golly.</span> <span id="s78">She was probably 16 or 17.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: When you first met?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: When I first started taking notice of girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: And were you attracted to her straightaway?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s85">She was a very pretty girl, yeah.</span> <span id="s86">And I think part of her family -- my wife's father was a World War I veteran, and the fact that I was -- ended up in the service, he thought I would be a good match for his daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: What's your wife's name?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: Doris.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Doris?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: What's her full name?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: Her first name?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Her full name.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Her full name was Doris Petroff, P-E-T-R-O-F-F.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: When were you married?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: Married in 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: 1943.</span> <span id="s98">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Right after I got out of flight school.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s101">And did you start a family straightaway or...</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: No.</span> <span id="s103">No.</span> <span id="s104">We were married in November of '43 and was married about five weeks and I went overseas.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Were you married at that church that you --</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s109">I was stationed in Tallahassee, Florida --</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: -- and we were married in Tallahassee, Florida.</span> <span id="s112">And I went on the base one day and never came home.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s115">She knew I didn't come home for dinner and I said I'm on my way to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: About the war.</span> <span id="s119">When you realised, did you -- when you realised that America was entering the war, did you enlist, were you drafted?</span> <span id="s120">Tell us about how you entered the service.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: I did not want to be drafted.</span> <span id="s122">I had a couple of reasons.</span> <span id="s123">One, I had an interest in flying and there was the aviation cadet program.</span> <span id="s124">And I looked into that and what attracted me to that, other than the flying aspect, was aviation cadets were paid $75 a month versus 21 as a drafted private into the Army.</span> <span id="s125">So it was partly monetary and partly my interest in flying.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: And what were the qualifications?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: The qualifications to get into the cadet program was two years of college or they said the equivalent.</span> <span id="s130">I didn't have two years of college but I did pass the entrance exam on various subjects that allowed me to join the aviation cadet program.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: And did you study up for that or did you simple take the exam cold?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: I simply took a test.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: I -- I don't want to say I was fairly intelligent but I had a fairly good knowledge of many things.</span> <span id="s135">I did fairly well in high school and had a good knowledge of English and chemistry and physics and most of the subjects I took in high school were in sciences.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Did you go to a recruiting station?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: No.</span> <span id="s138">There was -- I don't think it was called a -- I don't know, it was probably the city hall where they were giving exams for aviation cadet recruits.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Was that the city hall at Rochester?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: At Rochester, yes, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: When was that precisely, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: That was '43, I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: How long after taking the test did you realise that you were accepted?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: I probably knew almost immediately --</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: -- that I had high enough grades in taking the test.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: And were you given shipping orders at that time?</span> <span id="s148">Did you know whether you were going to training?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: No, it was probably five months later that I shipped out to -- or I shipped into a place for classification.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: And what was that experience?</span> <span id="s153">What was your very first military experience when you entered?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Oh, it was different.</span> <span id="s155">When I boarded a train, went down to Nashville, Tennessee, we were classified -- actually we took some basic training down there, we learned how to march and do KP and all the things that usually new recruits do -- and took some tests down there to see -- we were in the Air Corps and to see what we would be classified as.</span> <span id="s156">And I had a preference of being a pilot and passed enough of the tests that they classified me as a pilot recruit.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: And how did they establish that preference?</span> <span id="s158">Were you merely asked or did you fill out a form?</span> <span id="s159">How did you express that you wanted to be a pilot?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: I think the fact that we joined the Air Corps we wanted to be a pilot, period.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s163">And along the way they would classify you, depending on a number of tests we took we would be a pilot, a navigator, bombardier.</span> <span id="s164">So I wanted to be a pilot and expressed a desire to be a single engine pilot.</span> <span id="s165">And there's a series of tests, I think, that we took that they determined and sent us on for further training.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: When did you -- when were you informed that you had been selected for flight school?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: I think from Nashville, Tennessee, which was sort of basic army training, we went to Mitchell Fields and basically just went to school there.</span> <span id="s168">We studied meteorology, navigation, map reading.</span> <span id="s169">We learned reading of code.</span> <span id="s170">They gave us basically a -- almost a two-year college course in a couple of weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: They just crammed us full of knowledge, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Was it mostly -- what was the environment like?</span> <span id="s174">Mostly in the classroom, mostly in the cockpit or all classroom?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: It was all classroom.</span> <span id="s176">We hadn't even seen an airplane yet.</span> <span id="s177">Yeah, it was certainly all -- and a lot of military training, doing what you were told.</span> <span id="s178">The cadet program was like West Point, it was very, very strict.</span> <span id="s179">What we would do, we had to do a lot of parade stuff and we were classified as underclassman for a while and had to do -- we got hazed by the upperclassman.</span> <span id="s180">It was basically like West Point, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s182">What was the biggest challenge for you academically?</span> <span id="s183">Or was there any academic challenges for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: I can't think of any that bothered me.</span> <span id="s185">Most all my training came easy.</span> <span id="s186">I tried to stay out of trouble.</span> <span id="s187">One of the fears was if you were caught in a lie or doing something, they would wash you out.</span> <span id="s188">You just never wanted to do anything that was not proper.</span> <span id="s189">We were trained to be officers and gentlemen –</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: -- and we just tried to keep our nose to the grindstone, because we didn't want to get washed out.</span> <span id="s192">Flying pay was good, we all had a desire to be pilots.</span> <span id="s193">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Did you have any classmates who you felt were struggling, that you had to help out?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Never got close to any of the classmates.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s198">At least I didn't.</span> <span id="s199">But in the thing they told us to look to your right and look to your left, one of you are going to get washed out.</span> <span id="s200">The washout rate was fairly high.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Did that prove to be true?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s203">Yeah.</span> <span id="s204">Yeah.</span> <span id="s205">A lot of the cadets were washed out early.</span> <span id="s206">They couldn't meet the academic standards or did some infraction or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Where did they go when they were washed out?</span> <span id="s208">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: I have no idea.</span> <span id="s210">I think probably went back into service someplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: So after you completed that part of cadet training, then did you go to flight school?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s216">And where --</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: After I finished that I went down to Avon Park, Florida.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Uh-huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: There was a private airfield with private instructors.</span> <span id="s220">They were civilians, they were not military pilot instructors.</span> <span id="s221">It was a primary flight school.</span> <span id="s222">You flew open cockpit bi-planes.</span> <span id="s223">It was a Stearman, with the wind flow --</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: That was in '43.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: '43.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Uh-huh</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s231">What was that experience like?</span> <span id="s232">Take me back to the first time you climbed into a cockpit either alone or with another person.</span> <span id="s233">What was that experience like?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: It was sort of scary.</span> <span id="s235">I had been up in a small aircraft a couple of times prior to being in the service but it wasn't in an open cockpit-type plane.</span> <span id="s236">I was a little bit subject to air sickness, and I remember I used to carry a lemon in my pocket and sort of squeeze lemon juice into my mouth to keep from being too nauseous.</span> <span id="s237">But that went away with -- after some flights with the instructor.</span> <span id="s238">And we did more and more crazy manoeuvres.</span> <span id="s239">We did loops, we did slow rolls, and I soon grew accustomed to various positions in an aircraft.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Did you enjoy it?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: Yeah, I did.</span> <span id="s242">I thought it was great.</span> <span id="s243">Here I am, a hot pilot.</span> <span id="s244">But one day the instructor jumped out and said, "Take it up.</span> <span id="s245">Try not to kill yourself."</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: And what was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: It was fine.</span> <span id="s248">I had no problems at all.</span> <span id="s249">I taxied out, did a circle around, came in for landing.</span> <span id="s250">It was very good.</span> <span id="s251">I had no accidents, no problems at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Was the same sort of aircraft, a bi-plane open cockpit --</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Yeah, I soloed in the PT-13, a Stearman was the aircraft.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: It was nice.</span> <span id="s256">And we still got a lot of instructions.</span> <span id="s257">We learned aerobatics, unusual positions and recovering -- stalls, recovering from stalls.</span> <span id="s258">We learned all the basic things of flying.</span> <span id="s259">And I got through that without being washed out, so...</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: You finish up at Avon.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: Now what happens?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: Then I went to basic.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: I went to Macon -- no -- yeah, Macon, Georgia.</span> <span id="s266">Yeah, I went to Macon, Georgia, for basic air _ training.</span> <span id="s267">Primary training in Florida, then basic training.</span> <span id="s268">And got a bigger aircraft.</span> <span id="s269">It had more things about it.</span> <span id="s270">It was a low-wing monoplane, a closed cockpit versus being in an open cockpit aircraft.</span> <span id="s271">Still had a -- I don't think I had a -- I think I had an Army Air Force instructor.</span> <span id="s272">And, again, it was a plane that was different.</span> <span id="s273">We had, I think, a two-speed propeller.</span> <span id="s274">There were more controls on it.</span> <span id="s275">I think we had flaps.</span> <span id="s276">It was a low-wing monoplane.</span> <span id="s277">A lot more horsepower than the primary trainer.</span> <span id="s278">And, again, we went through the same procedures of landings, take-offs, short field landings.</span> <span id="s279">Just learning the basics with a more powerful aircraft.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: What was that step-up like, to step up from the bi-plane into that monoplane?</span> <span id="s281">Was it a huge experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s283">It was more powerful and you were enclosed in the cockpit.</span> <span id="s284">You had more controls.</span> <span id="s285">It was -- it was nice.</span> <span id="s286">You thought you were on your way to being a great pilot.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: You enjoyed it?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: I enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s289">I enjoyed flying very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: You finish up there, then what?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: Then I went to advanced training.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s293">Where was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: I think I went to (?</span> <span id="s295">Molta?)</span> <span id="s296">, Georgia -- I think one was Macon -- did I say Macon?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Yes, Macon.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: Macon, and then I went to (?</span> <span id="s299">Molta?)</span> <span id="s300">, Georgia, and we flew AT-6s, which was the Texan -- had a nickname, "the Texan."</span> <span id="s301">Again, more advanced, more controls, retractable gear.</span> <span id="s302">We had flaps.</span> <span id="s303">We had -- each one became a little bit more of a challenge.</span> <span id="s304">But it was not like learning everything at once.</span> <span id="s305">From primary to basic to advanced, each aircraft was a little bit more complex.</span> <span id="s306">And we did -- I think it was the first time I did a night flight.</span> <span id="s307">Up to that we had never done any night flying.</span> <span id="s308">And in all these flying schools we did all kinds of manoeuvres.</span> <span id="s309">We learned instrument flying.</span> <span id="s310">Put a -- had a hood put over our heads so we see nothing but the controls in front of us.</span> <span id="s311">And the instructor was still with us, he could see what we were doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s314">So we learned instrument flying where you've got to rely on your instruments.</span> <span id="s315">You can get very disoriented.</span> <span id="s316">If you do some manoeuvres, your ear kicks off and you -- sometimes you can't see anything.</span> <span id="s317">You don't know if you're right side up, sideways, you don't know if you're losing altitude or gaining altitude.</span> <span id="s318">So each step along the way became more complex.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Was it frightening?</span> <span id="s320">Flying blind, you know, with that hood over?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: It -- I didn't find it difficult.</span> <span id="s322">We had some time in Link Trainers.</span> <span id="s323">Do you know what a Link Trainer is?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: A Link Trainer is a little aircraft that's in a stationary position where I'm in there, you're telling me what to do, and you have a _ showing me what I'm doing in the aircraft.</span> <span id="s326">It's a way to learn blind flying without being in an aircraft.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">He'd basically tell you what to do and you'd do it.</span> <span id="s328">And you're just looking at -- you got to rely on instruments, you can't rely on your ear and stuff like that when you're learning to fly.</span> <span id="s329">You got to believe the altimeter, the artificial horizon, the RPMs that the motor's -- you got to rely on your instruments because you can't always see the ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: So throughout this entire process from basic training, to Avon, to going to Macon, to going on to the AT-6, blind cockpit training, what have you, what length of time are we talking about here, this entire time?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Two-month intervals.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: They're cramming a lot into a short period of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s336">I went from not flying to six months later I'm a pilot.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s339">All our training was in two-month intervals.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Up to and through the AT-6 training, is there any training involving combat engagement up to that point or is it purely flying at that?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: At advance training we did some aerial gunnery.</span> <span id="s342">We had a ship that towed a big target and we shot at that.</span> <span id="s343">We had to be fairly proficient because they'd count the holes.</span> <span id="s344">A number of us would be shooting at -- the AT-6 was the first aircraft that we had a gun, and our ammo was painted, the projectile.</span> <span id="s345">So if we shot at the target, as it went through the screen it left yellow or red, so that when you dropped the target you could see what your proficiency was in aerial gunnery.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s348">So we did that in advanced training.</span> <span id="s349">Advanced training was the first time we flew a combat-type aircraft.</span> <span id="s350">Part of our training was to go down to Avon Field in Florida, and they had P-40s and we flew a P-40.</span> <span id="s351">That's the first aircraft I ever flew with no dual time.</span> <span id="s352">Just sat in the aircraft, looked where all the instruments were and took it off.</span> <span id="s353">No training whatsoever on -- the P-40 was the old war hawk that was used, basically, in China.</span> <span id="s354">A very powerful aircraft but sort of obsolete by World War II standards.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: But, still, what was that first experience like, getting into that P-40, no real exposure to the aircraft before, going up in it, what was the --</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: It was scary.</span> <span id="s359">Because when you put the throttle forward, the airplane moved and it was very manoeuvrable, but -- I don't know, it was exiting.</span> <span id="s360">It got your blood going like mad.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: At what point during your training did you realise that you had been slotted and selected specifically for fighter pilot training?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: Oh, it was in the very beginning.</span> <span id="s363">Yeah.</span> <span id="s364">Yeah.</span> <span id="s365">Yeah.</span> <span id="s366">I knew when I started flying that -- well, probably basically at advanced they made up their mind you were capable of being a combat pilot.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s368">How long did you spend with the P-40?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: Probably less than 10 hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: And then on to what?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: Then I came home on leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s374">At that point I graduated from flight school.</span> <span id="s375">I got my wings.</span> <span id="s376">My wife came down, pinned my wings on me.</span> <span id="s377">I went home for 30 days leave and was a second lieutenant, single engine pilot.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: What month, what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: August '43.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: August '43.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: I was in the class of 43H, H being -- A being January, B February, so I was in the class of 43H.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: What happens after your leave is expired and you have to report back?</span> <span id="s385">Where do you go?</span> <span id="s386">What do you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: I went down to Tallahassee, Florida and learned I was going to fly P-47s.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: What did you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Oh, it was great.</span> <span id="s390">I mean this was a big aircraft.</span> <span id="s391">It was -- it had more horses behind that propeller, 2800 horsepower.</span> <span id="s392">It was a big aircraft.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Were you thrilled?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Oh, it was great.</span> <span id="s395">I mean we were just hot pilots --</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: -- you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Do you remember the first flight?</span> <span id="s399">Do you remember getting in the first time?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s401">It seemed pretty natural.</span> <span id="s402">Because I had flown the P-40, which was the fighter aircraft but sort of obsolete.</span> <span id="s403">Went down to Tallahassee -- and, again, it's a single engine fighter, there's no dual time.</span> <span id="s404">You sit in the cockpit, you learn where all the instruments are, you know where all the controls are to pick up the wheels, the flaps and everything you need to know, and just go ahead and fly it.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: How much training did you have with the P-47?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: None.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: None.</span> <span id="s408">You just -- that's it, you were in.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: That's it.</span> <span id="s410">Yeah.</span> <span id="s411">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: From the time that you were first exposed to the P-47 to then deployment to Europe, presumably, how long was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Oh, golly.</span> <span id="s414">I was flying the P-47 in November, I went overseas in December.</span> <span id="s415">So I had maybe two months training in the P-47 before I went overseas.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: How did you get overseas?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: Ship.</span> <span id="s418">Boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: Where did you arrive in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Well, first of all, after I finished my training in the P-47 -- well, my wife and I got married then.</span> <span id="s421">I mean we were married in November.</span> <span id="s422">And one night I didn't come home for dinner and she knew I was going out.</span> <span id="s423">I never said good-bye to her.</span> <span id="s424">My gear was all at the base and they closed down the base.</span> <span id="s425">I got a train up to Boston and a boat to England and she's sitting in Tallahassee waiting for me to come home for dinner.</span> <span id="s426">And she knew I was going overseas because all my gear was on the base, so...</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Were you trying to spare her the pain of separation?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: No, she knew I was going to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: I mean I think during World War II all the wives knew that their -- in the air corp --were going to leave.</span> <span id="s431">They didn't know when, but it's going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Sure, but why did you choose to do it in that fashion, not come home for dinner that night?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: I felt bad because I couldn't say good-bye to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: I couldn't make a phone call.</span> <span id="s436">They just closed down the base, put us on the train and we were on our way to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: So it really wasn't your choice, you were sort of --</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: It was not our choice, no.</span> <span id="s439">I didn't know if I was going to go to eastern -- or to Japan or to England.</span> <span id="s440">I went to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: How did you explain it to your wife?</span> <span id="s442">Did you write her a letter?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: Eventually I let her know, when I got to England and could write.</span> <span id="s444">Communication was bad during World War II.</span> <span id="s445">It took a long time.</span> <span id="s446">She really hardly ever got your letter because if you wrote your wife it was photographed, 16 mm film, went back to the States, and it was printed out on what they call V-Mail, have you heard of V-Mail?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: So she gets a little 4 x 6 copy of the letter that you wrote, so...</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: That was so that the sensors could have a look at it.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s451">Right.</span> <span id="s452">They looked at it, it was photographed, blocked out any reference to where you were in England, and she'd get a little photocopy of your letters.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: How long did it take you to get to England?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: I think it took probably seven days or so.</span> <span id="s455">It was a slow trip.</span> <span id="s456">Went over by boat.</span> <span id="s457">I think it was the EMPRESS OF AUSTRALIA or something like that.</span> <span id="s458">It was pretty nice ride over because as officers we had a nice stateroom, we ate in a nice dining room, we had a table, we had tablecloths.</span> <span id="s459">And it was a troop ship, and a lot of the troops were down in the hold under terrible conditions, I thought.</span> <span id="s460">I found that being an officer had a lot of privileges.</span> <span id="s461">It was amazing, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Where precisely in England did you land?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: I landed, actually, in Scotland.</span> <span id="s464">I think we landed at Liverpool.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s467">Landed in Liverpool.</span> <span id="s468">I went over as a replacement pilot.</span> <span id="s469">I did not train for the squadron or a group, I went over to England as a replacement pilot and didn't know where I would be.</span> <span id="s470">So we went into this pool of pilots.</span> <span id="s471">And they said, "Okay, we need two fighter pilots for Europe, we need four for there," and you just sort of picked out where you wanted to go.</span> <span id="s472">And I had a buddy that I trained with, and we went over to England together, and we found that the 353rd Fighter Group only needed two versus somebody else that needed six or so.</span> <span id="s473">So we figured the guys that needed the least pilots were probably better, so we chose that fighter group to go with.</span> <span id="s474">We had a choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: So where exactly -- which squadron were you with?</span> <span id="s478">Where did you end up?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: I signed up to go to the 353rd Fighter Group and I was in the 350th Fighter Squad.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Which air force was that?</span> <span id="s481">Was that Ninth Air Force?</span> <span id="s482">Which air force?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: Eighth.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Eighth Air Force?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: Eighth Air Force.</span> <span id="s486">So the one we picked out was the 353rd Fighter Group and after getting into that group, then we were assigned to the 350th Fighter Squadron.</span> <span id="s487">The fighter group had three squadrons to it, it had the 350th, 351st and 352nd, and we were assigned to the 350th Fighter Group.</span> <span id="s488">This was the P-47.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Right, the Thunderbolt.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Thunderbolt Group.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: What city?</span> <span id="s492">Do you remember what town or village you were stationed out of?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: The first base I went to we didn't stay there very long, but I ended up in a town called Raydon, R-A-Y-D-O-N.</span> <span id="s494">It was in the eastern area of England, in the East Anglia area of Great Britain.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: What did you think of England?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Didn't see any of it.</span> <span id="s497">I mean at that time.</span> <span id="s498">We just took a train, we got off at this town of Raydon and went on to a base.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: And did you spend most of your time when you were not in the aircraft on that base or...</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s501">Yes.</span> <span id="s502">Oh, we did get leave.</span> <span id="s503">We did go into London and stuff like that on a few occasions.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: What was your sense of how the English people accepted you or your interaction with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: I had basically no contact with them.</span> <span id="s506">On leave -- I only was on leave a couple times and went into London.</span> <span id="s507">And London was strange because it was a blacked out city.</span> <span id="s508">You were there with a little tiny flashlight, they had a little (?</span> <span id="s509">slit?)</span> <span id="s510">, that you didn't bump into people going around the town.</span> <span id="s511">Food was scarce in England at the time.</span> <span id="s512">I did know a family in England through Boy Scouts.</span> <span id="s513">As a Boy Scout we used to sponsor -- or we used to go up to Canada and visit -- sort of an exchange with Boy Scouts, and when I went up to Canada this family had a family in England who I contacted and had occasion to visit them.</span> <span id="s514">We used to take them some food items scrounged from our base because they were limited in what they could buy.</span> <span id="s515">Food was scarce in England.</span> <span id="s516">It was pretty much rationed.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: What was your job as a pilot with the 350th?</span> <span id="s518">What were you tasked with doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: Whatever the mission was.</span> <span id="s520">First of all, when I joined the 350th, that was in January, I really didn't get to fly my first mission until almost March because this fighter group wanted to train new recruits on how they did things, how they flew formation, how they attacked something and just what they did, so you were comfortable and didn't run into each other in combat.</span> <span id="s521">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: And what was that few months like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: It was fun.</span> <span id="s524">It was good training.</span> <span id="s525">We did some dog fighting, we chased each other, tried to evade.</span> <span id="s526">Just to learn how to do stuff as this group did it.</span> <span id="s527">So -- and after that then I flew first mission.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: And what -- I want you to tell me all about that.</span> <span id="s529">What was the first mission like?</span> <span id="s530">When was it, precisely?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: The first mission, if I recall -- I went overseas in January, first part of January, I didn't fly my first mission until, I think, March.</span> <span id="s532">The biggest thing I remember is I was breathing hard because I had never seen these little black puffs coming up into the sky, the flack.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: And I found that I got pretty low on oxygen, because I must have been breathing very, very hard.</span> <span id="s535">It was scary but exiting.</span> <span id="s536">And it was uneventful.</span> <span id="s537">It was just sort of a milk run or escorting bombers into Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: What sort of bombers were they?</span> <span id="s539">Do you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: Yeah, mostly all the bombers that we escorted were B-17s sometimes B-24s.</span> <span id="s541">And we couldn't stay with them very long.</span> <span id="s542">I mean they flew fairly slow compared to us.</span> <span id="s543">So they'd be flying along and we'd be just sort of zigzagging because it was _+ get ahead of them.</span> <span id="s544">So we could only stay with them for maybe 15, 20 minutes before another squadron would come in to take over and escort them a little bit further.</span> <span id="s545">So most all our missions in the beginning were escort missions, high altitude, 28 - 30,000 feet, escorting bombers.</span> <span id="s546">Some of our missions later ran into the area were low-altitude missions where we'd go in and dive bomb a bridge, dive bomb a tunnel, shoot up a train, whatever our mission was.</span> <span id="s547">But most of them -- probably I'd say 60, 70 percent were escort missions and some were just "let's go in and target of opportunity."</span> <span id="s548">You see something moving, try to stop it from moving.</span> <span id="s549">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: Do you recall your first combat engagement?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: I only had one.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: The day I was shot down.</span> <span id="s554">I actually went through 55 ... 55 missions, something like that, and never tangled with anyone.</span> <span id="s555">They were all escorts or dive bombing missions with no opposition at all.</span> <span id="s556">It wasn't until after D-Day that we started tangling with things.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Tell us about the day you were shot down.</span> <span id="s558">Do you remember the day?</span> <span id="s559">Do you remember what month it was?</span> <span id="s560">The year?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s562">The invasion was on June 6, that's when D-Day was.</span> <span id="s563">I flew three missions on D-Day, mostly just trying to shoot up anything that was moving, targets of opportunity.</span> <span id="s564">They were landing on the beachhead.</span> <span id="s565">I flew early morning -- it was dark -- probably three missions on D-Day.</span> <span id="s566">Go over, come back, refuel, go over and try to stop convoy coming into the front, this type of thing.</span> <span id="s567">That was on June 6th.</span> <span id="s568">And I flew a number of missions in between there.</span> <span id="s569">And on June 12 is when I was shot down.</span> <span id="s570">We were, again, looking for targets of opportunity on the ground and actually saw no enemy aircraft.</span> <span id="s571">They were just scarce.</span> <span id="s572">So they were just like milk runs.</span> <span id="s573">And June 12th, out of the blue came probably 30 ME-109s, and out of the 16 aircraft they shot down 12 of us.</span> <span id="s574">I mean you couldn't turn anywhere without having a 109 on your tail, you know.</span> <span id="s575">Fired at a couple of them, did not bring them down.</span> <span id="s576">Got a few bits, that's about it.</span> <span id="s577">Scared.</span> <span id="s578">I really got hit badly.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: And you were going down?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: Yeah, I bailed out.</span> <span id="s581">Aircraft caught fire.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s583">What was that experience like?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: It was pretty natural.</span> <span id="s585">I didn't give a second thought of going over the side.</span> <span id="s586">I mean if an airplane's not flying and I'm in it, I don't want to be in.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: You know.</span> <span id="s589">And my squadron leader was shot down and he said, "I'm going away," and he died, he crashed on the -- he just hit the deck.</span> <span id="s590">And they shot down a number of us.</span> <span id="s591">And now I'm in a foreign country, I'm in France.</span> <span id="s592">I'm not quite sure where in France I am but I knew I was on the ground, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: Do you recall what altitude you were -- roughly what altitude you were when you bailed out?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: I was probably 1,400 feet, 1,600 feet.</span> <span id="s595">The chute opened and I hit the deck.</span> <span id="s596">I just went over the edge and pulled the cord.</span> <span id="s597">I was in the air very little before I hit the ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: Where were you when you hit the ground?</span> <span id="s599">In a field, in a --</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: I landed in a field, in a farm area.</span> <span id="s601">Did the best to -- not bury my chute but keep it under some brush, and before too long there was a fair few Germans looking for me, and I just laid low and hoped I wasn't caught.</span> <span id="s602">Had the Germans had any dogs with them I'd of probably been captured then, but they did not find me.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: Where did you hide?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Where did you hide?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: I just hid on the ground in some brush area.</span> <span id="s607">I could see them looking for me but they didn't get near where I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: How long did that process take when they were looking for you when you were lying down?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Probably a couple of hours I saw them in the area and they disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: Could you hear them?</span> <span id="s611">Could you hear them speaking?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: No.</span> <span id="s613">No, I could not.</span> <span id="s614">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: But you could hear them moving about?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: Other than they were looking for me and they didn't find me and I just stayed low and tried to stay under cover.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: When did you move from that position?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: During the night.</span> <span id="s619">During the night I left the position.</span> <span id="s620">I had a pretty good idea of where I was and I just headed towards where I thought the beachhead was.</span> <span id="s621">This was just six days after the landing on D-Day.</span> <span id="s622">So I was basically going west.</span> <span id="s623">We had a -- we carried an escape kit with us which had a compass, had some pills for -- I've blanked on that word -- purifying water.</span> <span id="s624">We had morphine which we could inject.</span> <span id="s625">Had we been wounded badly we could inject ourselves with morphine.</span> <span id="s626">We had some maps, we had some phrase books, we had some money of the area that we were flying over.</span> <span id="s627">So I just headed towards the beachhead.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: With the idea that you were headings towards American forces?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: Right.</span> <span id="s630">Right.</span> <span id="s631">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: What happened next?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: What happened next, I saw a farmer in the field and went up to him and in my broken French I told him I was an American pilot and if he would help me.</span> <span id="s634">And he was scared, but he did.</span> <span id="s635">He got me some civilian clothes.</span> <span id="s636">He got me some food.</span> <span id="s637">He got me some maps of the area.</span> <span id="s638">He did not think I had enough money, so he finally gave me 500 francs or something, because the cost of living in France was fairly high, and sent me on my way.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: I started towards -- I kept going west and approached another farmer that took me into a town and put me in contact with the mayor of this town.</span> <span id="s641">He got me some papers.</span> <span id="s642">In England we carried our photographs in civilian clothes before.</span> <span id="s643">We started flying missions we were photographed in civilian clothes that we could put on any sort of papers that we might need if we were shot down.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">And he got me some papers and took me to a farm where I stayed for two months.</span> <span id="s645">I stayed on this farm hoping to get into Switzerland or get into Spain.</span> <span id="s646">It was German occupied, German soldiers were all over the place.</span> <span id="s647">But I stayed on this farm and kept a very, very low profile.</span> <span id="s648">And I lived with this family for a couple of months.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: And they provided food for you and...</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Food, yeah.</span> <span id="s651">And then, as the Germans came close, they moved me into a wooded area.</span> <span id="s652">There was a little makeshift shelter and I stayed there for a week or two.</span> <span id="s653">And during the night they brought me food and some wine and some Calvados, which is sort of an apple liqueur.</span> <span id="s654">And I stayed there for a while.</span> <span id="s655">And they came one day and said they had a passage for me.</span> <span id="s656">And I went to the side of the road, I was picked up by a French couple, take me into Paris, and they're the ones that turned me in to the Germans.</span> <span id="s657">They were collaborators with the Germans.</span> <span id="s658">And went into Paris, had an apartment there, and I was there about a day or two and the Gestapo came one night and arrested me, threw me in prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: Must have been a pretty horrifying experience knowing that they were at the door.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s661">Yeah, it was.</span> <span id="s662">Because I didn't know what they were going to do with me.</span> <span id="s663">They interrogated me.</span> <span id="s664">I didn't -- I couldn't tell them anything.</span> <span id="s665">I had already been out of contact with the troops and what was going on in the war because it was -- because _+ two months, shot down in June and I wasn't captured until August, so...</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: When the knock came on that door in that Parisian apartment, did you know straightaway that it was the Gestapo or was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: I didn't know who it was.</span> <span id="s668">They just came in and arrested me.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: And were they uniformed?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: They were not in uniforms.</span> <span id="s671">They -- like you saw in the movies they were dressed basically in black.</span> <span id="s672">Maybe that was the Gestapo's uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: And they had pistols.</span> <span id="s675">And they just told me I was under arrest and called me into Gestapo headquarters and interrogated me for most of the night and threw me in prison in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: Did they interrogate you in English then?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: In very good English, yeah.</span> <span id="s678">I think it was a major, German major, spoke very good English.</span> <span id="s679">Knew an awful lot about the United States.</span> <span id="s680">Name, rank and serial number is the only thing I knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: How did they treat you during the interrogation process?</span> <span id="s682">Were you struck?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: I was hit a couple of times with like a rubber truncheon on the back of head, but they weren't extremely mean to me at all.</span> <span id="s684">They just tried to get me to tell them something.</span> <span id="s685">But I was already out of the war for several months at this point.</span> <span id="s686">I didn't know what was going on from June until August when I was captured.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: How long were you under interrogation?</span> <span id="s688">How long did that process take?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: Probably 10 hours or so.</span> <span id="s690">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: At the end of it, what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: When I was handcuffed -- they picked up a young boy and I was sort of handcuffed to this young boy.</span> <span id="s693">I don't know what his relationship was.</span> <span id="s694">He was in the apartment that I was captured in.</span> <span id="s695">I don't know if it was the son of somebody or -- but I was handcuffed to him all night long.</span> <span id="s696">We were thrown in some room.</span> <span id="s697">And in the morning I understood he was executed, this boy.</span> <span id="s698">And I just was interrogated some more and went into prison, Fresnes prison, which is a big old prison in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: Who was there with you in prison?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: I was in there first with four -- three other prisoners who were French speaking and later on I was put into another cell with English -- four other English-speaking prisoners.</span> <span id="s701">We didn't talk too much to each other because we didn't know who was a spy and who was a good person.</span> <span id="s702">Because they would try to be friendly with somebody that maybe they'd get some information out of.</span> <span id="s703">So we really didn't really talk too much to each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: Maybe three weeks.</span> <span id="s706">Because the troops were coming close.</span> <span id="s707">After the invasion, by August they were getting pretty close to Paris.</span> <span id="s708">And one day they just evacuated the prison and put us on boxcars and we left Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: What was the boxcar experience like?</span> <span id="s710">How many men were put in there?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: A lot.</span> <span id="s712">We were in those _ nights.</span> <span id="s713">Eight horses, forty men.</span> <span id="s714">They were able to squeeze 100 of us in a boxcar.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: That was designed to accommodate 40 men?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: So you all were standing up then?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: We were all standing up, some laying down.</span> <span id="s719">Took turns.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: We were pretty crowded in there.</span> <span id="s722">We had a couple of pales, one with water and one for used water.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: It was very crowded and very unsanitary.</span> <span id="s725">They had given us a loaf of bread and we were in that boxcar five days.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: A single loaf with 100 of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: No, a single loaf for each of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: For each of you for the five days.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: For the five days, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: The doors open up, where are you?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: When they opened up -- well, they opened up a couple of times to let us relieve ourselves on the way.</span> <span id="s732">When they finally opened up we were in Buchenwald concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: How do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: I think some knew where we were.</span> <span id="s735">We thought when the doors would open we would be in a POW camp, except I knew POWs didn't have striped uniforms, were not emaciated.</span> <span id="s736">They were like walking ghosts.</span> <span id="s737">And we just knew we were in Buchenwald but we didn't know too much about Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s738">I didn't hear about concentration camps when I was growing up.</span> <span id="s739">I didn't know what they were like.</span> <span id="s740">And they were bad places.</span> <span id="s741">And these prisoners were all -- well, they were Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, whatever Germany didn't want went into a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s742">And they stripped us completely naked, shaved every hair off our body, doused us with disinfectant, gave us a shirt and a pair of pants -- was probably from somebody who died, they were civilian-type clothes-- we had no shoes, no socks, and we slept outside, just on the ground for probably five or six days.</span> <span id="s743">And this was in October.</span> <span id="s744">It was getting pretty cold.</span> <span id="s745">We finally did get into a barrack type thing and we slept on these shelves and they had four tiers high and probably five men on a shelf.</span> <span id="s746">I lost 68 pounds in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s747">You got a slice of bread in the morning, we got a little bit of watery soup, and you got coffee, maybe a slice of bread at night.</span> <span id="s748">We were pretty much bitten by fleas and lice.</span> <span id="s749">It was -- Buchenwald was a horrible place.</span> <span id="s750">I know you've probably been to the Holy Cross Museum.</span> <span id="s751">It -- it was bad.</span> <span id="s752">We were there until November.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: You said when you arrived you knew it was not a POW camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: What did you think it was?</span> <span id="s756">Where did you think—</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: I had no idea, except all these guys were in sort of grey and black striped suits, they were like walking ghosts.</span> <span id="s758">We didn't know where we were.</span> <span id="s759">We did very quickly know that we were in a concentration camp, but I didn't know what a concentration camp was.</span> <span id="s760">I wasn't alone, there was 168 of us that were picked up in one day in Paris.</span> <span id="s761">They just swept through the city.</span> <span id="s762">They knew where they were and they just decided to pick us all up.</span> <span id="s763">We were Americans, British, Australian, New Zealanders.</span> <span id="s764">All airmen, some officers, non-comms.</span> <span id="s765">All trying to evade capture, and they picked us all up in one day in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: When you identified that you had other allied servicemen with you in the camp, did you do your best to stay with them or did you -- what was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: Well, they kept us together.</span> <span id="s768">Yeah.</span> <span id="s769">We were together.</span> <span id="s770">We were always together.</span> <span id="s771">We didn't talk to each other very much because we really didn't know if there was a spy planted in among us.</span> <span id="s772">Because we didn't know each other.</span> <span id="s773">We were only just -- I think some of the airmen knew each other, some of the Brits probably did.</span> <span id="s774">And we just stuck together as a group, tried to act as a military unit.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: Explain that.</span> <span id="s776">What do you mean by "tried to act like a military unit"?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: We tried to stay together.</span> <span id="s778">We tried to stand at attention.</span> <span id="s779">We tried to act like soldiers.</span> <span id="s780">And just weekly I think we had formations.</span> <span id="s781">We tried to just act like soldiers should rather than wander around the camp trying to steal somebody's shoes or something like that.</span> <span id="s782">It was a -- we were a pretty motley crew at this point.</span> <span id="s783">As I say, there was 168 of us, so we all spoke English.</span> <span id="s784">And that was the other thing, language is a terrible barrier.</span> <span id="s785">And there were Poles, there was some Germans or some French, there were some Danish, there were all kinds of people, gypsies.</span> <span id="s786">All men, there's no women there.</span> <span id="s787">They did have some women in parts of the camp, some children in parts of the camp.</span> <span id="s788">It was a horrible experience because we did find out shortly before we were moved to a POW camp that we were scheduled to get executed.</span> <span id="s789">We just missed it by a few days.</span> <span id="s790">When we got there they said the only way out was up the chimney _+.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: Did you know that they were murdering people?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s793">Yeah.</span> <span id="s794">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: How did they go about doing that?</span> <span id="s796">Did you witness?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: I did not, no.</span> <span id="s798">I saw some people that were hung.</span> <span id="s799">I saw some people who were pretty much beaten to death.</span> <span id="s800">If they went into a _ we didn't know, we were just a separate English-speaking group of people.</span> <span id="s801">We were in one area.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: And why were they being hung?</span> <span id="s803">Why were they being beaten to death?</span> <span id="s804">Were these infractions of the rules or --</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: Infractions.</span> <span id="s806">The concentration camp was guarded by prisoners.</span> <span id="s807">There were some pretty mean prisoners who got extra rations, they got extra benefits by keeping the prisoners in order, and they would not hesitate to beat somebody to death.</span> <span id="s808">Concentration camp was just -- saw very few -- saw very few German guards or anything, they were all civilian guards.</span> <span id="s809">They were called "kapos."</span> <span id="s810">I guess it's some name, probably is an abbreviation for something, whatever this word "kapo" was.</span> <span id="s811">But it was just a bad place.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: You said there were children and women there.</span> <span id="s813">What were they doing there?</span> <span id="s814">Were they the wives and children of some of the administration of the camp?</span> <span id="s815">What were they doing there?</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: I think they were prisoners.</span> <span id="s817">I think they were prisoners.</span> <span id="s818">They were in separate areas.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: So sometimes you'd see them being transported to one part of the camp.</span> <span id="s821">The camp was sort of segregated into various groups of people.</span> <span id="s822">Some may have been children.</span> <span id="s823">There were some women prisoners there.</span> <span id="s824">There were some children.</span> <span id="s825">The children were treated pretty nicely.</span> <span id="s826">I didn't see underfed children.</span> <span id="s827">And not a lot of children, you'd just see them on occasion.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: Were you made to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: On one occasion.</span> <span id="s830">There was an air strike -- Buchenwald was next door to a small factory and there was an air strike and the factory was hit and they made us pick up fire damage, carry away some of the debris.</span> <span id="s831">And I think we maybe did it for something to do.</span> <span id="s832">We didn't work very hard.</span> <span id="s833">Some of us carried the stuff out, some carried it back in, to make it look like we were busy.</span> <span id="s834">But they did force us to supposedly work.</span> <span id="s835">And that only went on for a few days.</span> <span id="s836">The air strike did not hit any of the prisoners.</span> <span id="s837">I think there were a few Germans killed in the air strike.</span> <span id="s838">That's as close as I want to be to an air strike, air raid.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: It's frightening?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s841">Yeah.</span> <span id="s842">Bombs make a lot of noise when they go off.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: It was a little bit away from our camp, where we were, so...</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: Did you ever identify yourself -- knowing that it was not a POW camp, did you ever identify yourself as an American pilot, as an American airman --</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: I think we all did, yes.</span> <span id="s847">I think they did know.</span> <span id="s848">Because we were classified as POWs, I think, in French prison in Paris.</span> <span id="s849">But when they evacuated Paris we were just now political prisoners.</span> <span id="s850">They declared us political prisoners.</span> <span id="s851">Concentration camp, I don't think they care what we were.</span> <span id="s852">We were prisoners, period.</span> <span id="s853">As I say, they did have us scheduled to be executed.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: It may sound like an absurd question, but did you make any friends in camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: Any friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s858">I made a few American friends.</span> <span id="s859">Some I stayed in contact with for quite a few period of years.</span> <span id="s860">There's not very many of us left any more.</span> <span id="s861">Over 168 strong, we're probably down less than 20 now around the country -- or around, even, you know, Australia, England, because we were all together.</span> <span id="s862">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: Was there a leader?</span> <span id="s864">Was there a single man or a couple of men who stood out as sort of the group leader?</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: There was an English officer who outranked us and he became the leader.</span> <span id="s866">And I can't remember his name.</span> <span id="s867">I did have it written down, but ... but he had no -- he tried to keep us as a military unit.</span> <span id="s868">But once we got out of the concentration camp into a POW camp, then there were leaders there.</span> <span id="s869">When we got into Stalag III there were some high-ranking officers that took charge.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: When you were at Buchenwald did you try to escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: No.</span> <span id="s872">No.</span> <span id="s873">I don't know if you could.</span> <span id="s874">It was pretty much enclosed in electrified fences.</span> <span id="s875">And where do you go?</span> <span id="s876">You're in Germany now.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: You don't have any allies like perhaps in France.</span> <span id="s879">No, we made no attempt to get out.</span> <span id="s880">I think that would be a death sentence if you were caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: When and how were you transferred to Stalag III?</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: A German Luftwaffe officer came into camp.</span> <span id="s883">And I don't know what he came into camp for, but it was either an inspection team or something.</span> <span id="s884">And he declared that we were airmen and did not belong in the concentration camp, we belonged in the POW camp and shortly after that we got moved out.</span> <span id="s885">But it was a German officer that declared that we were not political prisoners, that we were prisoners of war and belonged in a POW camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: Why do you suppose he did that?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: Why do you suppose he did that?</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: I think the fact that he was a German Luftwaffe officer, we were airmen, he was an airman, and he just knew what was right.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: Did you see him?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: Yes, we saw him because he walked through the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: Did you interact with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: No, I did not.</span> <span id="s894">Our leader may have.</span> <span id="s895">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: How long after he left the camp were you transferred?</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: Probably less than a week.</span> <span id="s898">Less than a week they put us on the train, we ended up in Stalag III.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: Did they tell you where you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: What did you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: Basically we were going to a POW camp.</span> <span id="s903">I didn't know which one or where.</span> <span id="s904">We went there to Stalag III, came in, were greeted by a bunch of prisoners.</span> <span id="s905">They declared they never saw such a ratty bunch of people, because some of us had shoes, some of us had clogs on, some of us were bare-footed.</span> <span id="s906">We had raggedy clothes and we were dirty because we got no showers.</span> <span id="s907">We went a couple of months without being able to shower.</span> <span id="s908">We were pretty smelly.</span> <span id="s909">We had -- our clothes were basically rags.</span> <span id="s910">After Stalag III -- and they greeted us and first thing you know we were washed up, we had shoes, we had socks, underwear, had a uniform again.</span> <span id="s911">I'm American, but I had an Australian uniform.</span> <span id="s912">But it was a nice uniform, it was warm clothes.</span> <span id="s913">Had nice warm barracks to sleep in.</span> <span id="s914">Everything was pretty good.</span> <span id="s915">This was end of October, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: Were you at all sick or hurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: No.</span> <span id="s918">I had diarrhoea a couple of times but that was about it.</span> <span id="s919">I had a short bout with jaundice, but nothing bad.</span> <span id="s920">I was never wounded or had no broken bones or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: How much weight did you say you had lost in Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: Sixty-eight pounds.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: Did you start gaining it back at Stalag Luft III?</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s925">Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s926">Yeah.</span> <span id="s927">I got back a good share of that weight.</span> <span id="s928">Yeah.</span> <span id="s929">It was good.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: Was the food acceptable?</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: Was the food all right?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: Food was great compared to what we had.</span> <span id="s934">We had Red Cross parcels.</span> <span id="s935">Even though -- we were supposed to get a Red Cross parcel every week and we were on half parcels.</span> <span id="s936">And we got foods from the Germans.</span> <span id="s937">We used to get potatoes and turnips and sometimes a hunk of meat of some sort.</span> <span id="s938">We ate very simply well in the POW camp.</span> <span id="s939">We were in a room, each room held eight prisoners.</span> <span id="s940">We put all our Red Cross parcels together.</span> <span id="s941">So even if we had four parcels, because we were on half rations, and we just sort of planned our meals.</span> <span id="s942">We had one cook stove.</span> <span id="s943">Each room had so much time on the cook stove.</span> <span id="s944">We started in the morning -- each room got one or two brickets.</span> <span id="s945">We'd start a fire and we'd keep it going and each room would take time to prepare some sort of a meal for your room or they would do it through their room.</span> <span id="s946">Or sometimes you ate a meal early, sometimes you ate a meal late, but it was just taken you only had one kitchen and you took turns using it.</span> <span id="s947">We cooked as a group of eight men using Red Cross parcels and what the Germans gave us.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: And were the Germans running the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: And guarding it?</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: And guarding it.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: Did you interact with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: No, I did not.</span> <span id="s954">And I don't think we did.</span> <span id="s955">Other than to line up for a pill in the morning and be counted and go back about our business.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: And were you made to work?</span> <span id="s957">What were your days like?</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: We were not made to work at all.</span> <span id="s959">Our days were going to school.</span> <span id="s960">We tried to run some classes.</span> <span id="s961">I tried to run some classes in photography, because my background was chemistry, photography, I worked for Kodak.</span> <span id="s962">Other people would try to teach a language.</span> <span id="s963">We had a library of many books.</span> <span id="s964">Some of the prisoners put on plays.</span> <span id="s965">This was a -- one of the old-time POW camps.</span> <span id="s966">It was mostly British, Australians were in there.</span> <span id="s967">We as Americans were the minority.</span> <span id="s968">And a lot of the prisoners had been there for five years.</span> <span id="s969">They were picked up in boats when the Battle of Britain went on very early in the war.</span> <span id="s970">And these were old-time Brits that were prisoners after five years and we were the newcomers.</span> <span id="s971">And they were just recovering from the execution of all the prisoners that tried to escape for The Great Escape when they executed -- because The Great Escape took part -- some of it started in the barracks that I was in.</span> <span id="s972">And there were mostly Australian and British airmen in our barracks.</span> <span id="s973">We had basically just one room of Americans in this particular barracks that I was in.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: Did the long-timers talk about that escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: No.</span> <span id="s976">No.</span> <span id="s977">They didn't talk about it at all.</span> <span id="s978">We didn't talk to them very much.</span> <span id="s979">The group of eight Americans that were in my room, we just talked to each other, basically.</span> <span id="s980">We didn't correspond or talk to the Brits or Australians.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: And was that for the same reason, for fear of infiltration or...</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: No, it was just -- it was just the fact that we were Americans, they were Brits, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: Did the Germans at that time treat you properly?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: Yeah, they left us alone.</span> <span id="s985">Other than counting us twice a day they did not bother us at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: Did you have any sense of what was going on in the war after being shot down and all the way up to the point you were in Stalag Luft III?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: We -- you would get a news report almost daily.</span> <span id="s988">There was a clandestine radio someplace and word would be passed along how the war was going, you know.</span> <span id="s989">Where this radio was I had no idea.</span> <span id="s990">These old-time prisoners were pretty innovative of what they did and where they hid the stuff.</span> <span id="s991">Because I think it was disassembled every time and put in various parts of the barracks.</span> <span id="s992">But we'd get a news report, yeah.</span> <span id="s993">We pretty much knew what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: When did you know the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: When did you know the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: When I was liberated.</span> <span id="s998">We were down in (?</span> <span id="s999">Luisburg?)</span> <span id="s1000">, Patton's army came in and liberated us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: Do you remember the day, month or year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: It was -- I want to say 29 April '44 -- was it '45 I think the war ended?</span> <span id="s1003">Yeah, the war was over with.</span> <span id="s1004">Germany was defeated.</span> <span id="s1005">Patton's army came in to -- we had been -- I was at Stalag III and then we were force marched to another POW camp and then we were force marched to another place.</span> <span id="s1006">We ended up in southern Germany and then Patton was coming up from the south and liberated us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: What was the forced march like?</span> <span id="s1008">Was anybody hurt along the way or killed along the way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: I think we -- talking about killed, we did lose one man in Buchenwald concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1010">We had one lieutenant, L.C. Beck, he got pneumonia, was put in the hospital in Buchenwald and he died there.</span> <span id="s1011">He was the only fatality we really had of prisoners that I knew or prisoners that I was with.</span> <span id="s1012">I stayed in correspondence with his mother for a number of years.</span> <span id="s1013">Every time the allies got close they'd force marched us out.</span> <span id="s1014">And the first one was in the dead of winter.</span> <span id="s1015">I think we were given two hours to get ready to march in the end of January.</span> <span id="s1016">And it was a blizzard.</span> <span id="s1017">We were trying to put together every scrap of food that we could put our hands on.</span> <span id="s1018">We tried to take apart our beds to make a sleigh to haul, our bedding -- anything that we could carry.</span> <span id="s1019">And I think it was probably two o'clock in the morning, in a blizzard, they force marched us for 30 kilometers to get out of the area.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: What was the purpose of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: The Russians were coming in.</span> <span id="s1022">They were going to liberate us -- not liberate us, but they would have liberated us.</span> <span id="s1023">They just did not want us to be put back in service.</span> <span id="s1024">They wanted to keep us as hostages, perhaps, for some negotiations later on.</span> <span id="s1025">But they did not want the camp to be overtaken and have us liberated.</span> <span id="s1026">So they just emptied the camp.</span> <span id="s1027">Gave us an hour or two to pack up and they just marched us -- we ended up marching all the way down to Nuremberg over the period of a month or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: So when did you see Patton's army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: Oh, April 29th, something like that.</span> <span id="s1030">Yeah</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: What was that experience like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: We knew we were liberated but we were still captive within the thing, they just did not want 100,000 kriegies -- "kriegies" is prisoner of war in German -- they just didn't want a bunch of kriegies running around the countryside liberating everything they put your hands on.</span> <span id="s1033">So we were still held captive.</span> <span id="s1034">But we had a lot of food then.</span> <span id="s1035">We started getting some army D-rations, whatever they called them.</span> <span id="s1036">So they just -- they kept us enclosed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: It may have been a week or so.</span> <span id="s1039">And they started moving us out into France, to a place called Camp Lucky Strike where we were interrogated by our forces and, you know, what it was like and what we did and who we were.</span> <span id="s1040">And we got some army uniforms again and started looking like soldiers and made arrangements to get back home.</span> <span id="s1041">It took me 30 days to get back to the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: Where did you go from France?</span> <span id="s1043">Did you go back to England or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: Went back to England.</span> <span id="s1045">Got a -- scrounged a ride on a Liberty Ship that was the going back to Boston.</span> <span id="s1046">It was unorganised.</span> <span id="s1047">It was just -- we scrounged a bunch of food and we went back on a Liberty Ship and went home.</span> <span id="s1048">We had had orders in France to whom we had to report back to -- to fly, I think it was Fort Dixon in New Jersey that we had to report within 30 days or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: And you said you came back to the United States via Boston?</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1051">Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: What was that like when you saw-- when you came ashore in the United States again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: It seemed good.</span> <span id="s1054">I don't have a – because I was already free for some period of time and -- it was good to be home.</span> <span id="s1055">What was strange, they just give us a train ticket to our home.</span> <span id="s1056">I came into Rochester and didn't have any money, got a cab driver to drive me to -- because my wife at this point had gone back to her mother's house.</span> <span id="s1057">And I just walked in on them.</span> <span id="s1058">Communication was bad.</span> <span id="s1059">We didn't have telephones.</span> <span id="s1060">Long distance was costly.</span> <span id="s1061">We didn't have any money.</span> <span id="s1062">It was -- it was a strange situation.</span> <span id="s1063">But we did have orders to go back into the service for a period of time to get mustered out, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: What was that experience like walking in on your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: Everybody was in tears.</span> <span id="s1066">They were happy to see me.</span> <span id="s1067">They were glad that I was home.</span> <span id="s1068">There were a lot of parties and, I don't know, it was just a good feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: Did she know that you had been in a concentration camp?</span> <span id="s1070">Was she informed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: My wife did not know what happened to me for -- I went down in June and I think it was late January before she knew I was even alive.</span> <span id="s1072">I was just MIA all this time.</span> <span id="s1073">But she did finally get word that I was a prisoner of war, and that was about it.</span> <span id="s1074">I never -- never heard from anybody for a whole year.</span> <span id="s1075">Had no communication.</span> <span id="s1076">I didn't know if my mum and dad were alive, I didn't know if my wife was alive.</span> <span id="s1077">There was just no communication at all.</span> <span id="s1078">There's certainly no mail in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1079">And, as I say, mail was slow, you know.</span> <span id="s1080">So I just walked in, everybody was happy to see me.</span> <span id="s1081">I said at the time I have to go back to Fort Dixon in 30 days and get mustered out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: How long did that process take?</span> <span id="s1083">I mean you waited the 30 days, went back to Fort Dixon, and then how much longer were you in before leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: My official discharge didn't come into effect until October, but I was not in any place.</span> <span id="s1085">I had built up some leave and I was paid through, I think, October.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: Did you return to Rochester at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: Went back to Kodak, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: How long did it take before you -- did you at any point speak to your wife or anyone else about your experiences at Buchenwald or Stalag Luft III.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: I think I -- oh, yeah, yeah, I think I talked to a lot of people at the time.</span> <span id="s1090">I did some talks for the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s1091">I did some talks for some civic organisations back in Rochester at the time.</span> <span id="s1092">Got some newspaper publicity.</span> <span id="s1093">Even today I talk to school kids if there's any occasion that they would want to know about World War II.</span> <span id="s1094">I had one of the girls at the schools ask me, she said, "When you were shot down, did you call your wife and tell her where you were?"</span> <span id="s1095">All these kids have cell phones today.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">A: Here I am 91, I don't even have a cell phone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: How long did it take before you went back to Kodak?</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: Almost immediately.</span> <span id="s1100">It was a couple of weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: Was it a difficult adjustment returning home or to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: No.</span> <span id="s1103">I was looking forward to it.</span> <span id="s1104">Because I had 30 days leave and I did a lot of stuff, got a lot of things in order.</span> <span id="s1105">It was way past due on my income tax.</span> <span id="s1106">That was what killed me, that I had to pay income tax for all the stuff I was paid when I was in the service and was a prisoner.</span> <span id="s1107">They didn't give me a free rein on paying taxes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: There's a lot of legal stuff to go through and get back into civilian life.</span> <span id="s1110">The time I came home, then my discharge official was in October.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: Did you ever fly again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: I flew once or twice -- I had a customer that had an aircraft, he and I went up a couple of times.</span> <span id="s1113">Flying a _ is not like flying an airplane.</span> <span id="s1114">I was used to a high-performance aircraft.</span> <span id="s1115">So I never flew any more.</span> <span id="s1116">I had it out of my system.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: This interview is going to become part of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum's permanent collection.</span> <span id="s1118">It will be used by historians as well as students of the Holocaust for many years.</span> <span id="s1119">Is there anything you'd like to say in closing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: Nothing I can think of other than the fact I'm extremely proud that I had an opportunity to serve and I think I did some good during World War II.</span> <span id="s1121">I have no ill feelings towards my -- the people that captured me and treated me -- my nature is not to be ever angry at anybody, I'm a very happy person.</span> <span id="s1122">I have no ill feeling towards Germany.</span> <span id="s1123">One thing I have to say, I did get some good compensation from Germany after the war.</span> <span id="s1124">One was for forced labour.</span> <span id="s1125">As a POW you were not supposed to work.</span> <span id="s1126">I got that from the German government and I got a settlement from the German factories for labour I had put in and various aspects of being a prisoner.</span> <span id="s1127">Both were around $50,000 each.</span> <span id="s1128">As I say, I have no ill feelings for -- war is not healthy.</span> <span id="s1129">It's something we do.</span> <span id="s1130">You have to do for patriotic -- that's all I have to say.</span> <span id="s1131">I'm proud I served.</span> <span id="s1132">It was an experience, so... That's about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: Thank you for the interview, sir.</span> <span id="s1134">Thank you very much indeed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: Glad to be operative on the ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">Q: Very good, and we're glad to have you.</span> <span id="s1137">It's 1555 hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
