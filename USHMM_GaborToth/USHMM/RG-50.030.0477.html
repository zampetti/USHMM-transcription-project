Welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: Nice July day.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: Indeed.</span> <span id="s14">Tell me your name.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: My formal name is Charles Siegman, my birth name is Charlie Sigmann, or Jechiel Sigmann, I was born Jechiel, the Hebrew name, and that itself is a introduction to where I come from.</span> <span id="s16">People always ask, how does a good Jewish boy get the name Charlie from Holland.</span> <span id="s17">And the story is that my father had to register me.</span> <span id="s18">In Holland, all children had to be registered by an official roster of names.</span> <span id="s19">And when my father came, he asked what’s child’s name, he answered Chiel, which was the shortened name for Jechiel.</span> <span id="s20">And Chiel was not on the list of names, and he had to choose an official name.</span> <span id="s21">So the first Ch was Charlie.</span> <span id="s22">That was a Dutch name, and so my name became Charlie.</span> <span id="s23">And when I came to United States, they changed it to Charles, because Charlie looked like a child name.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: But [indecipherable] re-registered or became a citizen, I finally made it to Charles Jechiel Siegman, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: And were you called Jechiel at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Yes, Chiel, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Chiel?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Chiel, or Jechiel [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: And when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: October 13th, 1935.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: And you were born where?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: In a little suburb town of The Hague called Scheveningen, which was a fishing town, but it was a really an adjunct town of The Hague, and eventually my parents moved to The Hague in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: So -- but it was a little -- known for its fishing fleet, in fact, and in the war, the name Scheveningen was the shibboleth term by the Germans and the Dutch, because the Germans couldn’t pronounce the sra sound of the guttural ch of Dutch, and they said S-Shravening -- Shaveningen.</span> <span id="s36">So when the soldiers who were dressed in Dutch uniforms, German soldiers, the early stage of the war, were asked whether you’re, you know, friend or foe, and say Scheveningen vischenschuit, they said Scheveningense vischenschuit and they were shot.</span> <span id="s37">So that’s the part of the town, anyway, it’s a small town.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Sin -- since you were such a young person during this period, having been born in 1935, it would be good if we could try to distinguish between what you actually remember, when we talk about the experiences, and what you were -- what you were told, so we can get an idea what your memory is versus what you’re remembering from other people’s, if you think we can do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Correct.</span> <span id="s40">Yes.</span> <span id="s41">Difficult to identify every --</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Yes, no, no, I understand, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: -- part of the element.</span> <span id="s44">This definitely is a blend, what I recall now, or I relate now, is a blend of what I recall -- what I think I recall --</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: [indecipherable], as -- what I’ve heard, which I have seen confirmed, in fact, what I have -- things have re -- recors -- subsequently confirmed in writing, so I guess I attributed it to my recall as well.</span> <span id="s47">And what I’ve read, and heard, and talked with my brother and sister, or others.</span> <span id="s48">But as I’ve mentioned to you, otherwise, my recall is spotty, and more in the sense of mental imprints, like [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s49">Some absolute I recall, I -- I fix in my mind to this day I could see certain pictures, and I don’t have a running --</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: -- [indecipherable] a commentary, nor the chronology thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s53">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: Definitely months, or periods which I have no idea what happened when, or whether anything happened at all in a three month period.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: But I know episodes, and episodes kind of tell my story in the context of the Holocaust, or Shoah.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s58">Let’s get a sense of your -- your family before we get into your particular tale.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Who was your dad, and what did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Right.</span> <span id="s62">My father was born in Poland, Przemysl, established Jewish little community, and he moved to western Europe, I believe first to Germany, then to Holland, in the 20’s, before he was married, in fact.</span> <span id="s63">[indecipherable] long time settler, and was another refugee coming from eastern Europe, or from Germany to Holland, lived there for many years.</span> <span id="s64">He was not a citizen ever, he was stateless, he was Polish nationality.</span> <span id="s65">But for Holland he was called stateless, but Polish nationality, I believe.</span> <span id="s66">My mother came originally from Zborow, which people think wer -- was Hungary, could be Ukraine, cause the countries this -- have shifted management over time, and was raised in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s67">At a very young age she moved to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s68">Her parents were -- grandparents, parents were one of the early settlers of the east European families who moved to Zurich.</span> <span id="s69">Again, that family, that group of families, I was told, could not move to Zurich, didn’t have the right to move to Zurich, they moved outside of Zurich, to -- they had a lot of restrictions.</span> <span id="s70">And my parents were married in the early 20’s -- in ’22, and the wedding had to be held in Frankfurt, because a large number of members of the family couldn’t receive visas to go to Zurich, where the -- typically, the bride’s family town would be the wedding.</span> <span id="s71">I have the wedding picture of that wedding with me, which is a nice memento.</span> <span id="s72">That also has a Shoah story about it in fact.</span> <span id="s73">But anyhow, my father lived in Holland, and he was a postage stamp dealer, had a postage stamp store, had a wholesaler type of business, and had the store and lived origin -- he originally lived in Amsterdam with my older brothers were born in Amsterdam, and then moved to Scheveningen, and he had a store in one of the main streets.</span> <span id="s74">So he was a middle class person, nothing, no -- not an activist, not a Socialist, not a pervert, or what have you, and belonged to the east European community in Scheveningen.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Ca-Can you explain what it means to own a postage store, that’s not stamp collecting, or is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Yes, stamp -- no, stamp collecting, postage stamps.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Ah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: Stamp collecting, or providing postage stamps to other stamp s -- th -- used to be many more small stores in Europe, to this day there are more than United States, who -- that specialized in particular items, so there -- now, also there are few postage stamp stores in the United States, most probably have s -- some Bethesda.</span> <span id="s79">But that was the job, to collect stamps from the other countries, and organize them by country, and know the dates, and the value, and they sell them to dealers, or to customers.</span> <span id="s80">So, postage stamps.</span> <span id="s81">He had his own, apparently a very personal, good postage stamp collection as well, which he gave over to someone, acquaintance or a friend, we don’t know exactly who, before the war.</span> <span id="s82">It never returned after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Do you have any recollection of going into the store?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: No, no, no, not at all, no, no.</span> <span id="s87">I -- but I do know that he dealt with postage stamps.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Whatever that meant, as a child, but oh -- but I-I see them around, I mean postage stamps were very popular, much more than today --</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: So you recall in the house seeing the postage stamps?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: I saw, yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: And did your mother work as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: No, I believe she was home, as far as I recall.</span> <span id="s94">And we -- as -- we are a family of five children.</span> <span id="s95">I was the youngest, born in ’35, and my sister in ’33, and my brother in ’31.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: So ma -- so Leah is born in ’33?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Y-Yes, ’33 --</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: And Leo is born --</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: -- Leo was born in ’31, and my two other brothers who were killed during the war, in Auschwitz, they were born in ’26, and ’24.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: So that’s Aron --</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Ah -- yo -- jos -- Josef --</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Jos -- Josef?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: -- was born in 20 si -- 1926, and Aron -- Erik, was born in 1924.</span> <span id="s104">So they were substantially older than I wa-was.</span> <span id="s105">As a child there’s a big difference, obviously.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: So during this period before the war, between -- before the war comes to the Netherlands, between ’35 and ’40, what is your memory of that household?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: It was a household that was living, I would call middle class life, going to do certain activities, like with fam -- family oriented activities, and Scheveningen was a resort town, so there were a lot of visitors, and to this day it’s still a resort town, the beach, and -- so it was an active household.</span> <span id="s108">I don’t know much about the social life of my family, so I can’t relate to that.</span> <span id="s109">But so I know from the child [indecipherable] I do recall two personal incidents which are interesting in their own right, but the fact that I recall them, but also the interesting feature is that both of these little child events -- childhood events where I was actually was saved, kind of -- that’s all I recall.</span> <span id="s110">The first one was I was lost in the beach.</span> <span id="s111">So the family went to the beach, that’s [indecipherable] a kind of standard activity, it was probably on a Sunday, and I was lost, that’s not unusual.</span> <span id="s112">And the police picked me up, and I do recall that I was sitting on the policeman’s lap, with a policeman’s cap on my head, waiting [indecipherable] was apparently relaxed enough, till they found -- till I was found, I think my brother came to pick me up, and then reunited with the family, so I was saved.</span> <span id="s113">That was what -- what -- what do we do.</span> <span id="s114">Second episode which I recall, was I took a walk with my sister [indecipherable] or Leah, and walked through a -- most probably a shortcut through a park, and was hit by a wooden swing, that time the swings were wood, and I was apparently unconscious.</span> <span id="s115">I had a sort of a scar right over here.</span> <span id="s116">They tell me that had it been a m -- centimeter or two above, I would have been brain dead, centimeter below, I’d have been blind, because I had a big, heavy impact.</span> <span id="s117">I had stitches.</span> <span id="s118">Those days you had stitches with like staples, I remember that.</span> <span id="s119">And I remember the gift coming home to soothe my return, was a wind-up crocodile, which I wound up and I played on the dining room table, back and forth.</span> <span id="s120">So these are kind of vignettes which I recall, but they kind of illustrate I’d led a child’s normal, quotation mark, child’s life in a home environment.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Do you remember your parents at tha -- i-i-in that period when you were [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Yes, again, I remember them as, y -- know, se -- senior adults.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: I was the baby of the family, and I don’t remember any story or event that kind of left a mark with me, but I knew my -- my mother was a housewife, and remember cleaning the house, and taking care of the household events.</span> <span id="s125">The hou -- I mean, the household, as far as I recall, I have heard was kind of gran -- rather normal.</span> <span id="s126">We had a lot of visitors, I do recall people coming by, and we confirmed -- subsequently I met certain people, relatives [indecipherable] I visited when I was a little child with my parents, and down the line.</span> <span id="s127">And that was a kind of -- it was a f -- a close link to families.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s129">Was it a religious household?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Yes, was a religious household.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: It was re -- we were raised -- ra-raised as observant Jews.</span> <span id="s133">Synagogue --</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Was that --</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: -- attending --</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Was that unusual in Holland, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: -- not so much?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: Not really, no.</span> <span id="s140">First of all, Holland has two or three communities, the more -- can’t say native, but more Spanish, Portuguese Dutch are oriented, people had a number of generations.</span> <span id="s141">They had their own synagogues, and own community.</span> <span id="s142">Then there were the east European Jews who came in, who were not always well accepted and integrated.</span> <span id="s143">But in Europe in general, there was much more traditional conduct by people affiliated with synagogues, and went.</span> <span id="s144">My parents were fully observant, a kosher home, and active in Zionist organizations.</span> <span id="s145">My brother -- my older brothers, Josef and Aron belonged to what later became Brei Akiva, but precursor of those that were active in that, and I do kind of have memories on Shabbat afternoons, they were leaving to their groups.</span> <span id="s146">All I really remember of my two older brothers in a mental, visua -- visual image, is two lanky, tall boys with berets -- common people used to wear berets, and weeker pants, which were rolled up at the bottom a little bit, leaving, coming and going.</span> <span id="s147">But they were kind of active in youth organizations.</span> <span id="s148">So it wasn’t, again, in the broader sense, that description were a normal family, as people would have liked to live, and were not allowed to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: D-Do you recall your little friends that you had during that period [indecipherable] family and your --</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: I do not recall friends at all --</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: -- in fact, I mean, in part because we had a sizeable family and had two children -- my bro -- siblings were close enough in age, I suppose.</span> <span id="s153">So I do not recall from before the war, anyone by name, or so.</span> <span id="s154">That’s a -- whether I had it, I just don’t know, I mean, never discussed that with my brother or sister at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Did you go to a nur -- was there something [indecipherable] to a nursery school, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: No, I do recall starting school in 1942.</span> <span id="s157">I was only half a year in school.</span> <span id="s158">We went to what’s called then a public Jewish school, it could -- what’s called nowadays day schools, most probably.</span> <span id="s159">They were Jewish schools, and this was bef -- my brother went before that -- I had to go, cause at the time already when I was going to school, I had to be enrolled in a Jewish school, it wouldn’t -- now the Nazis did not allow --</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: So that was late already.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Late already.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: But I do remember for going to school, and in kind of the courtyard, singing, playing, and I was supposed to be a good boy, called in Dutch, witte boontje -- bon -- boontje, that was a white bean, that’s description of being in -- a goody-goody boy, or so.</span> <span id="s164">But the school period was a very tense period.</span> <span id="s165">People -- there was all kinds of talk going on already around the house and in the school, murmurings.</span> <span id="s166">What it meant, I had no idea.</span> <span id="s167">I knew that something was brewing.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: This is in ’42?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: That was ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: But you didn’t know what.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: No, but there was something unusual, was nothing -- it was like something was involving -- and I sensed, I di -- I do recall sensing -- to the school year was both disrupted obviously, I was -- it couldn’t last very long, several months only, but it was not a normal school experience, because the people in the classes were eventually in doubt.</span> <span id="s172">People came, and people left.</span> <span id="s173">And I si -- this I -- this I did sense, that was an indifferent -- not -- not that I had been in school for many years, so as what I did go to a pre-school, I don’t recall.</span> <span id="s174">But it was not a stable environment, and this I had sensed right away, both at home, where there were murmurings, and most [indecipherable] parents whisper amongst themselves something, you know, something that’s serious.</span> <span id="s175">What exactly it was, I don’t recall.</span> <span id="s176">Was as bes -- I -- and was probably children brought into discussions.</span> <span id="s177">And of course I was too young, because I was a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: Do you have a recollection of 1940, when the Nazis occupied?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: No.</span> <span id="s180">No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: So you don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: No, wa -- w --</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Is -- is there a transition for you at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: The big transition really was when I was in school and I felt that -- I mean, for it -- I think it was big discussion which school I should go to, whether I should start y -- with school.</span> <span id="s185">I re -- kind of there was general discussion, I was on -- certainly going to go to school.</span> <span id="s186">Because that already in -- was -- was probably the fall, I assume school began in the fall like over here, was come to the end of our freedom, because people -- there were deportations, and there were round-ups and there were sh -- transports taking place, so there was some discussion whether or not I should start school.</span> <span id="s187">In retrospect it appears that my family, my parents were almost, I think, you know, how to deal with the family situation of how to -- not escape, but wh -- w -- to find means t -- how to survive.</span> <span id="s188">So if they have to -- if I hid -- if they would place me in hiding, or what have you, then you don’t start school, necessarily.</span> <span id="s189">But anyway, I did go to school, and that school environment, I sensed there was something in the air, what I don’t -- couldn’t specify.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: But the kids didn’t talk with each other, that you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, not --</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Do you remember seeing troops?</span> <span id="s193">Do you remember seeing any soldiers, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Noth -- I can’t -- ca-can’t -- I’m looking [indecipherable] at my mental photograph file there, no, I don’t recall soldiers.</span> <span id="s195">There were soldiers on the street, but wa -- I may have treated them as policemen, or so, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s197">So you never saw anything that made you frightened, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: No, no, no, again I that -- in that respect my parents protected me, kept me, you know, do things -- I wore the --</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: A star.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: A star.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: And you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: On the clothing, yes.</span> <span id="s203">But again it didn’t impact me as it would have done later.</span> <span id="s204">It was a, you know, decoration that something -- that the -- only Jews were wearing it, I may not have been sensitive enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: Okay?</span> <span id="s207">But I had to wear it, yes.</span> <span id="s208">But that’s, you know, you wear your sweater, you wear your jacket.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: And do you think that the same protection and feeling of being -- you’re pretty safe, was true for your -- for Leo, and Leah --</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: I don’t know how far hi -- how hi-high it would went, right, then because an -- a -- a child in general is left out for these sort of discussions, and the youngest, I was a young child, was not -- was not a party.</span> <span id="s211">I was -- I was almost six and a half, seven, right?</span> <span id="s212">So I was [indecipherable] a party to these discussions.</span> <span id="s213">I don’t really know how much my brother -- my brother I think even more.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Leo, or the older --</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Leo, Leo, Leo.</span> <span id="s216">The older brothers definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: Yeah, I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: But I had very little ongoing contact with my older brothers, except as being older brothers, but not on a playing se-sense, and I don’t even recall which grade they were -- they were, you know, adults, and they were adults already.</span> <span id="s219">By 1942 my oldest brother was -- ’24 to ’42 -- ah -- was 18 years old, and [indecipherable] was 16.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s221">So they were much older.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: They were much older.</span> <span id="s223">So the contact between a seven year old, and a 18 or a 16 year old are --</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Big difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Big difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s227">Now, do you re -- do you know how many months you might have been in school?</span> <span id="s228">Was it a few months, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: I think we were in school three, four months.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Before you went to Westerbork?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Before -- no, before Westerbork, I was -- we were already -- our family was split up.</span> <span id="s232">In -- in November, December, I think, our family started splitting up.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: ’42. ’</span> <span id="s235">42.</span> <span id="s236">1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: We end up in Westerbork in ’43, and in Terezin in ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s240">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: [indecipherable] ’42 now.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: So [indecipherable] say it was -- that’s why th -- you say whether or not I would go to school was [indecipherable] issue, cause by ’42, in the fall of ’42, later developments with Dutch Jewry oc-occurred already, deportations, shipments, round-ups.</span> <span id="s244">We were not last, but we were not first, either.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Okay, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: So the family planned to [indecipherable] our situation, and what wa -- was happening -- what happened was that my mother and two older brothers, Erik and Josef -- Aron and Josef, they went to one location, my sister to another, and my brother and myself to another.</span> <span id="s247">And bro -- those locations were strange in retrospect, but made sense at the time.</span> <span id="s248">There was a notion that certain people are less likely to be rounded up, or perhaps even immune, exempt.</span> <span id="s249">So if you stay, even with Jewish families that have that character about them, you are protected.</span> <span id="s250">So the notion was that my mother and her brothers, who were of working age, they were put into a -- a mental asylum, because the thought was that they don’t need -- they’re not going to be prom -- people at -- either accepted or believed the case that there were the people being shipped for work.</span> <span id="s251">So, they’re not going to take people who have mental problems, they’ll leave them alone, spend your energies elsewhere.</span> <span id="s252">My sister was placed in another type of home, and initially with, I believe in her case, a pregnant woman, who again they thought wouldn’t be taken, or a woman who had just given birth.</span> <span id="s253">That was sort of conventional wisdom at that time, and so we were separated from our parent, and the parent itself -- my father stayed at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Your father at home, your mother in another place, where is the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: My -- my fa -- my -- my mother and my two older brothers in another place, and my sister in one place, and my brother and I in another place.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: And where were you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: With my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: No, I know that, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: To -- to this family, I think to -- to a woman had just given birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: And what were you told about -- I mean, it’s very odd for a little child to be separated like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Yes, I’ll see you later, you know, we’ll come back.</span> <span id="s262">Now, what is interesting is that people had -- ma -- see I -- the reason my father stayed at home apparently, was to kind of settle affairs, his belongings, and who knows what, and come -- and contact with family outside of Holland, I believe, which eventually materialized somewhat for that, and to make arrangements for everybody.</span> <span id="s263">So, not clear whether our arrangements were temporary or permanent.</span> <span id="s264">My parents were the ones who were making those decisions, and I was obviously not privy to those at all.</span> <span id="s265">So they have a sense of being in diff -- sure, things were different, but whether it’s permanent or temporary, I had no sense of that at all.</span> <span id="s266">And my brother was there, so maybe that acted as a sense of stability for me.</span> <span id="s267">And the days went.</span> <span id="s268">There also was a conventional wisdom, which was [indecipherable] based on fact, that round-ups took place late afternoon, evening.</span> <span id="s269">So in the morning, my father, he went to synagogue, and we went to synagogue too, we met my father every morning at synagogue.</span> <span id="s270">So that respect, things were normal.</span> <span id="s271">So we met, and he patted me, chatted me, kissed me or s -- what, and it was a daily event.</span> <span id="s272">And my last image of my father is sitting on his lap, he with his tefillin on, and next day I came he wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s273">So then we knew that he was deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: And you knew that, or you knew something?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: We knew something.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: You knew something.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: Right, yeah, my brother and I knew something, right.</span> <span id="s278">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: And this is 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: ’42, December ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: December ’42.</span> <span id="s282">So right at the end of the year.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: That’s end of the year.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: So you are staying with this -- in this family [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: Family, right, now that didn’t last --</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: -- not di -- no, not -- not two, three months, not -- very short period.</span> <span id="s288">That family sofe either couldn’t keep us, or what have you, and we were put all three of us in an orphanage.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Because again, the view was that the orphanage is a safe haven.</span> <span id="s291">They aren’t going to take little children, little orphans.</span> <span id="s292">And meanwhile my mother and two brothers were rounded up, my father was rounded up and they move -- they were shipped to Westerbork in the end of January.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Of ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: And middle of January they were deported to Auschwitz and killed there three days later.</span> <span id="s297">We were rounded up a little later, in February, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: In -- in February.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s301">I think we have to stop it to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Charles, your parents were sent -- th -- your parents, your two older brothers were sent to Westerbork in January of ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: Three, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: And in February, you think --</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: We -- yes, we arrived in February.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: You arrived in February, and were they sent out --</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: They were sent out of west -- out of Westerbork on the 18th of January.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Huh, and -- and when did you find that out, that wh -- that was the transport?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: Well, through the red -- subsequently, in recent years, I’ve tried to trace down through the Red Cross, that -- curious to find out what --</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: -- formally happened, any documentation.</span> <span id="s315">Took a long time, oddly enough.</span> <span id="s316">It’s very strange that the record keeping was so uneven.</span> <span id="s317">After the war -- I mean, now moving --</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: -- on to a different subject matter, after the war, people tried to find out what happened to their relatives.</span> <span id="s320">And in our case, we were more or less told by relatives and others, that our parents were deported and sent to Auschwitz and that was the als -- we had no documentation for that.</span> <span id="s321">As a child I did not pursue it very much, but later on as an adult, I tried to pursue it, especially when I read about that the Red Cross had tracing of a sort.</span> <span id="s322">And the first few answers was -- is all we know is that they were deported to Auschwitz, we don’t know when, where.</span> <span id="s323">Later on they gave us a date, but no formal document confirmation.</span> <span id="s324">In year 2001st, I got a Red Cross notification with documentation.</span> <span id="s325">Now, it turns out that in the Dutch registry, in the -- the government has a regis -- gazettes of a sort, they had ready -- in 1951 printed names of the fate of various people, and they send us a copy of those 1951 items, but nobody who we addressed -- now, had we known that it was in the registry, I would have gone to the Dutch registry, but no one ever hinted that it is available.</span> <span id="s326">So the first time I actually had confirmation of my parents death and departure dates, which initially came really out, that was in year 2000.</span> <span id="s327">A long time.</span> <span id="s328">And in fact, the Yahrzeit celebration -- commemoration, not celebration, commemoration of deceased, was an unknown item for us, we had no idea which day to commemorate.</span> <span id="s329">So -- you may be aware that the rabbinate in Israel selected one date of the year for those people that did not know when their immediate families were killed, or died.</span> <span id="s330">And they selected the 10th of Tevet, but -- so we observe that day as our Yahrzeit day.</span> <span id="s331">So the f -- took us till ni -- year 2000 to find a actual date, which turned out to be the 15th of Shavuot, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: And did Westerbork have deportation lists, or they didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Did they have -- I -- yeah, I’m sure they had, but -- there’s just what happened after the war, a lot of people made confusion, a lot of people made efforts, di -- they hit a roadblock, and they kind of called it quits, or so, and nobody came notifying us.</span> <span id="s334">I mean, this is a problem, it’s a two sided way, be -- those who knew, didn’t know us, and we didn’t know who knew, okay?</span> <span id="s335">So you ask me how do I know the dates, now it’s in black and white and confirmed, and it’s from lists -- a big list in the Dutch registry.</span> <span id="s336">I have a copy of the registry here with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Now, did your mother arrange for the three of you to go to an orphanage?</span> <span id="s338">Do you kno -- do you know how that was arranged at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: I believe it was probably through my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Cause he -- th-they were picked up and -- in beginning of January, I believe, the first week or so, and then they were -- must have been a week or so in Westerbork, and so we were -- was probably more through my father.</span> <span id="s342">The -- these -- there were a lot of ad hoc arrangements during that period.</span> <span id="s343">Some were planned, and some were, you know, you had to improvise, and as -- when one option kind of reached it’s end of contini -- continue, like me being in these private homes, where people thought was safe, they found a next tier.</span> <span id="s344">So we lasted another month in these different places, compared to my parents and my brothers.</span> <span id="s345">And then you ask me, you know, did I know what was happening to me, the answer is no.</span> <span id="s346">I was, know, placed.</span> <span id="s347">I was with people.</span> <span id="s348">I was most probably being fed, and taken care of, and that took care of me.</span> <span id="s349">I did know that i -- used to go to the synagogue in the morning, routine, that stopped.</span> <span id="s350">And my brother knew more, he knew that -- what it meant.</span> <span id="s351">That once he didn’t see us, that he’d been dep -- rounded up and being deported.</span> <span id="s352">So it must have --</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: And he -- he didn’t tell you?</span> <span id="s354">Do you remember -- any recollection?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: I don’t really.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: You don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: I don’t really know.</span> <span id="s358">I don’t know that part.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: So not seeing your parents, I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Being in this different place --</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: -- this woman’s home --</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: -- and seeing your father every day, would give you the sense of --</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: Of some normalcy, also, right --</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Some normalcy, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Exactly right.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: And then it stops.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: And now you’re in an orphanage.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s373">With other children.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: With other children.</span> <span id="s375">Do you feel -- you don’t feel insecure?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: I apparently don --</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: You don’t remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: But again, you can keep in mind, if you rec -- reconstruct, if you’re among a lot of children, suddenly, you are busy, you play, you eat, and you’re taken care of, and you start forgetting.</span> <span id="s381">It’s like, you know, little children with babysitters, when the mother’s -- parents go on vacation, may cry beginning, and subsequently settle down, and -- not that it was so nor -- I’m -- not that it was all shipped away.</span> <span id="s382">I don’t recall being shipped away.</span> <span id="s383">But that was circumstances.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: So I did not attribute it to, you know, imminent danger, or -- except my parents no longer were visible with me, I’d -- I -- my mother had less contact, because while I was coming to the synagogue in the morning, was my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Not your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Not my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: And not my older brothers.</span> <span id="s390">So definitely I must have sensed things were different, but whether that is permanent, or whether that is dangerous, or [indecipherable] I don’t think a child could catch it immediately, because nothing terrible was happening to me.</span> <span id="s391">I wasn’t being beaten up, or on the street, or something of this sort.</span> <span id="s392">So I mean, I was under somebody’s supervision and auspices, and that’s how I -- I took it, I suppose.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Do you know whether this was a Jewish orphanage?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: It was a Jewish orphanage?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: I believe it --</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: So all the kids were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: -- I believe it -- I believe it was a Jewish orphanage.</span> <span id="s399">I believe so.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: But again, based on this assumption, that certain categories of people are going to be bypassed for the round-ups -- the round-ups notion obviously came very known in the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s402">People’s friends and relatives were being picked up, and people swen -- started going into hiding, or escaping, or what have you.</span> <span id="s403">Some tried to make provisions.</span> <span id="s404">Then they tried to find ways which regarded what are -- where could we or our children be safe?</span> <span id="s405">And the idea of splitting up families was not a illogical step, that if some people can’t make it, other could make it.</span> <span id="s406">And very often, you can’t have a place for seven people, you can have a place for two or three.</span> <span id="s407">So you had to split up on practical grounds.</span> <span id="s408">So, did it hit me that something was affecting me, you know, lifetime orsat, I doubt it, it was kind of incremental, another step or so.</span> <span id="s409">But di -- bottom line was, you know, I was separated from my parents at that age, and that was it.</span> <span id="s410">And then separated from my brothers and mother, and that was it.</span> <span id="s411">And I was with my little -- older brother, few years older, and a little older sister, and that we were together.</span> <span id="s412">And then I followed what was -- not instructed, where I was told to go, where to go, and move, and I moved along with the -- the flow.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: And you were a good kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: Apparently.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s417">But in February when we were rounded up, I do recall the round-up part in particular.</span> <span id="s418">We put on the train, and it was a round-up place in Amsterdam, the Schouwburg, I think it’s called.</span> <span id="s419">Schombu -- Schomb -- Schouwburg, it used to be a theater.</span> <span id="s420">That became the round-up place for all the Jews in Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: But now I’m a little confused.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Were you now living in Amsterdam?</span> <span id="s424">Because they [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: Oh, the orphanage was -- the orphanage was in Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: In Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: Oh yes, the orphanage in Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: But your father was not living in Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: In The Hague.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: In The Hague.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: Hague.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Which is fr --</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: He was rounded up in The Hague.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: I see, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: He was rounded up in The Hague, and my -- I don’t recall where the mental institution was --</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: It was probably as -- out -- they didn’t have institutions in the cities, it was probably in the outskirt, someplace.</span> <span id="s438">And -- but the round-ups don’t -- they took the collected people and assembled them, and they brought them all to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s439">That was the collection point.</span> <span id="s440">And then f --</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s442">And you re -- you remember being taken out of the orphanage?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: I remember the -- being in the train in Amsterdam, and people scurrying back and forth from the window.</span> <span id="s444">In fact, one of my relatives was one of -- see the -- they had a -- the council of Jewish -- Jewish council had to do a lot of the paperwork for the round-ups, both identify and do the works.</span> <span id="s445">I do recall people scurrying in front of the window, and mut -- this relative of mine who I knew, waving to me.</span> <span id="s446">I could see it now, I mean -- and then we were put on the train to Westerbork.</span> <span id="s447">That was the next stop, the next movement, in February, sometime.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: February ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: ’43.</span> <span id="s450">Turns out that had we arrived under normal circumstances, we -- they had a procedure in Westerbork when people arrived, the next Tuesday, or the following one, people were picked -- designated to go to the next stop.</span> <span id="s451">That time, ’43, the destination was Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s452">One after the other, every week or two, there was a trainload --</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: On Tuesdays, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: On Tuesday, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: When we arrived in Westerbork, we would have designated to go the next shipment, but -- like everybody else, it wasn’t exceptional.</span> <span id="s457">It turned out our good fortune was there was a scarlet fever epidemic in Westerbork, a certain barracks, so they put the camp in quarantine, they wanted to protect the German soldiers, they don’t want to get sick.</span> <span id="s458">So this int -- this -- they halted the shipments for a week or so.</span> <span id="s459">That week was critical for us, because while we were there, during that quarantine, a very good friend of our family’s in Amsterdam, Mrs. DeYoung, informed, by telegram most probably, Westerbork authorities, the Jewish people, or the council people who worked there, that documents from our family in Switzerland, with Honduran passports, and also, I think, Palestine visas were made available for us and our parents and brothers.</span> <span id="s460">Unfortunately for them it came too late.</span> <span id="s461">But that week of window saved us, because then we put in different category of person, because we had Central American passports, and they treated that a little separate, and the Palestine visa part, they also had some benefit for awhile, because they wanted to exchange German prisoners for British citizens or what have you, and it put us into a different classification of detainee, and then we were in this new category, and we were put into different grouping.</span> <span id="s462">But without that week of scarlet fever, I wouldn’t be talking to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: You would have been sent immediately on the train --</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: Yes, we -- the norm -- right.</span> <span id="s465">The reason why -- we wouldn’t be any different than anybody else.</span> <span id="s466">That was the pattern, people came, and left.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Now, did you know, cause you’re now a little bit older, you’re eight --</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: Right?</span> <span id="s470">Or seven and a half?</span> <span id="s471">Seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: Seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: Seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Were you told -- this scarlet fever quarantine --</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: We were -- no, n-no, we were told --</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: No, but we -- I was told about the papers, something.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: You were told that?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s481">The other thing which I was told, I -- again, is our parents, from the train send a postcard.</span> <span id="s482">That was very standard to drop postcards, and if they were lucky, other citizens would pick it up and put it into the mail.</span> <span id="s483">And was given to my brother, he -- my brother became the oldest person of the family, and I was told my brother had had a postcard from my parents, from what -- what it meant, I didn’t know, but it was now wishing us well, take care, and in fact gave us the name of a relative in Switzerland if you need help.</span> <span id="s484">And at the end of the postcard our brothers wrote in Hebrew [indecipherable] see you.</span> <span id="s485">So I -- this I recall, my brother telling me walking somewhere in Westerbork, and telling pos -- not that -- I don’t know, he tells more later, but the -- that we got a postcard from our parents on the train, wherever it is.</span> <span id="s486">Whatever that meant for me, I don’t know how to re-interpret it, but that little bit of information was given to us, but then we put into a new category of people -- not that we knew that we were different there [indecipherable] cause we didn’t have the sense of this timetable which we know now.</span> <span id="s487">People didn’t know, necessarily --</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: -- that -- came very rapidly.</span> <span id="s490">Now, moving people arrived, stayed, were registered, and then they were shipped out to death camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: How do you picture Westerbork in your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: Small barracks, little wooden barracks, I recall, and we were put under the guidance of a s-s -- orphanage equivalent, a per -- one family was designated to take care of children who were separated from their parents, or lost their parents, or what have you.</span> <span id="s493">And we put in that group, a man named Birnbaum, Mr. Birnbaum, originally from Germany apparently, and that was his task.</span> <span id="s494">He had a number of children as well, so I became friendly with his child, or he’d like me to play with his child, so I hung around his house more than the standard barracks most of the day.</span> <span id="s495">And I kind of took care of us, collectively.</span> <span id="s496">But that status helped us, because we not put on lists.</span> <span id="s497">There is one episode my brother related to me, which I obviously was not aware of.</span> <span id="s498">They didn’t always trust those documents, [indecipherable] they were -- were suspicious, and the fact came from Switzerland helped a little bit, but they called my brother in, and was asking him what do you know about Honduras?</span> <span id="s499">Do you speak Honduran [indecipherable] knows what.</span> <span id="s500">So he was called in, and he was primed by someone, I think a Dutch lawyer, what he should say.</span> <span id="s501">And he was told that his mother’s in Switzerland, to kind of confirm it, the source came -- that came from his mother, rather than relatives.</span> <span id="s502">She was Swiss born, somehow.</span> <span id="s503">Was -- lived in Switzerland many years, and apparently -- he told me recently again, that he was called in, and they asked him this question, you know, how’d you get these things?</span> <span id="s504">My mother’s in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s505">And they accepted, asked what -- where’s your father, and he didn’t -- wasn’t given any prompting for that, so he somehow answered, he’s dead, and they let him go.</span> <span id="s506">But again, I mean, those are kind of intermediate steps where our status was even being questioned, and had they determined that it was a fake, it wasn’t -- we weren’t really, you know, Honduran citizens, or whatever, the passports were not -- we then would have been shipped, that interval.</span> <span id="s507">So we spent the year in Westerbork among children.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: So you lived in a barrack with children?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: Lived in a barrack with children, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: Do you remember the food?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: Very little.</span> <span id="s512">Was a s -- I remember a little more the food about Terezin --</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: -- than the food in Westerbork, but there was food.</span> <span id="s515">I was, I think, not preoccupied with no -- being, again with -- in a group of children, that -- wa -- which probably helped me in various stages, that eventually yeah, you played, and you spend your time, and wha -- wa-was fed, and that was it.</span> <span id="s516">My brother was a little more advanced, so he most probably had to kind of keep his ears out what’s happening, and he was therefore more perceptive.</span> <span id="s517">But I was not drawn into that orbit at that stage of the game.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: Did you notice children coming and going --</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: Coming and go -- yes, yes, yes, yes, I noticed that there.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: But that didn’t necessarily affect you, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: No, because I was there, you see, and as long as I stayed next morning there -- I didn’t -- I mean, it’s -- again, under the circumstances, my age, had no reason for me to think about the instability of the situation.</span> <span id="s522">I mean, as an adult, you think my gosh, you know, look what happened, were you scared, were you -- there’s no -- no reason.</span> <span id="s523">I mean, the saving feature was that I hung around with children, cause I was a child, and I was placed with -- in a children’s home, effectively.</span> <span id="s524">He was the guardian of a number of children, lots of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: This Birnbaum?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: Birnbaum.</span> <span id="s527">And I was even better off, I was put in close contact with his own children.</span> <span id="s528">So I was playing and maybe eating at his table, who knows what?</span> <span id="s529">There were family units in these camp situations, so that kept a little sense of normalcy.</span> <span id="s530">Not having my parents somehow did not hit me during that period.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: Was there something like a school?</span> <span id="s532">Did you have classes at some point?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: They have both there and in Terezin, they had little groups of study groups to keep people entertained and educated a little bit, and teaching, you know, Jewish subject matter, holidays, songs, and both -- some songs, in fact I do recall the music to this day.</span> <span id="s534">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Wh-What -- what do you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: There was a round music in fact, Sim Shalom, with the prayer.</span> <span id="s539">It was a round.</span> <span id="s540">[sings a few lines].</span> <span id="s541">And we sang that, okay?</span> <span id="s542">And another one, Shomer Yisrael.</span> <span id="s543">Now, they’re interesting in retrospect, those two songs, which also in Terezin, the -- exactly the same songs were taught, I recall, is quite remarkable, because both of them are the prayers of hope.</span> <span id="s544">We didn’t know the translation as much, but the teachers kind of were injecting hope on this place, peace on Israel.</span> <span id="s545">Another one is God is the watcher of the remnant of Israel.</span> <span id="s546">So, those two songs I remember to this day, but I didn’t have -- it turns out that -- that people used to sing them subsequently too, so I don’t know what I would --</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s548">Sing a little bit of the second song?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: [sings a few lines of Shomer Yisrael] It was a choir rounding song, or so.</span> <span id="s550">And -- so we had instructions, we had learning in both Terezin and ams -- and Westerbork.</span> <span id="s551">Westerbork I remember more concreteness that I know the loft where we went up, the third floor of the caserne, third tier, not [indecipherable] floor, had three layers.</span> <span id="s552">We went up, and we did our little studying, whatever it had to study, you know, instruction, the stories, holidays, about Israel, Palestine.</span> <span id="s553">And there was a watchman in front of the door watching, because we’re not allowed to have formal classes, and the watchman in [indecipherable] I remember the watchman, and whenever the SS guards, or their equivalent came by to inspect the place, we got the warning, and we started playing cards, or games, or what have you.</span> <span id="s554">Very, very similar to the story about Chanukah, where people -- one reason why people played dreidl, because they -- because at that time also, people were prohibited to study the Torah, and with guards coming by, and then people improvised games.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: And so we went through that in 1943 and ’44.</span> <span id="s557">But there was instruction, but not formal.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: Could you read?</span> <span id="s559">Did you have some instruction [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: I had some instruction, well I had very little formal education --</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: -- with three months or so, at best, in Holland, I -- yes, I learned how to read, maybe even before at home, I don’t recall where.</span> <span id="s563">But I remember I read Dutch.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: And my vocabulary obviously was limited.</span> <span id="s566">Was -- didn’t develop, I didn’t have more -- I spoke Dutch among the Dutch people in Westerbork, obviously Dutch.</span> <span id="s567">And in Terezin also.</span> <span id="s568">But I didn’t read books in the normal sense of the term.</span> <span id="s569">But there was instruction.</span> <span id="s570">People spent again, their time.</span> <span id="s571">They devot -- there were former teachers who were idle, so they had some to do, and people took on responsibility to keep the kids occupied, and study with them.</span> <span id="s572">So that was familiar things, but not when it came back after the war I had handicap when [indecipherable] do some arithmetic or anything of this sort.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: I didn’t have the same background as other children.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: I -- I read that the weather in Westerbork was horrible.</span> <span id="s576">Do you have any recollection if that’s true?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: Yeah, well, the weather was raw.</span> <span id="s578">Dutch weather is not, you know, the most comfortable weather except in the spr -- summertime or so.</span> <span id="s579">It’s a variation of British weather, wet, cold.</span> <span id="s580">I can recall episodes of cold -- periods, but not as a personal suffering part, that it was ca -- always cold, always ya -- again, in retrospect I just don’t recall how we survived both the deprivation and weather conditions, both in Westerbork, and Terezin, which is even colder, because we didn’t come with, you know, baggage of clothing.</span> <span id="s581">Must have had some bags, and as we moved up in age, we grew.</span> <span id="s582">Now, I may have taken my brother’s clothing, but [indecipherable] my brother get?</span> <span id="s583">Now, we didn’t grow that much.</span> <span id="s584">We were stunted in our growth, most probably, but we still grew.</span> <span id="s585">So the question mark still is, where did we get our clothing?</span> <span id="s586">We may have gotten it from other people who left, and the children’s home may well have supplied us.</span> <span id="s587">But we didn’t certainly have our own wardrobe to take care of us, particularly in cold weather.</span> <span id="s588">So every so often I do reflect, how did we manage in cold weather in general, with limited clothing, and not having our own clothing, nobody -- no parents, nobody to provide.</span> <span id="s589">But I -- I sp -- I assume that these people like Mr. Birnbaum, and subsequently in Theresienstadt the woman who took care of us, kind of assembled material, and that there -- that was part of their job, to make sure the children under their charge have clothing.</span> <span id="s590">And where they got it from was probably from people who had to -- we-were transported and left, and then it redistributed.</span> <span id="s591">So I don’t know how bitter the cold was for me personally.</span> <span id="s592">But it -- I do know it was drab.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: Were you also limited where you could walk?</span> <span id="s594">Could you just stay around where this barrack was?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: Well, here again see, I in some sense was a beneficiary of being a young child.</span> <span id="s596">I had no reason to parade in the large areas like most norm [indecipherable] and I was in this Birnbaum family, in their -- and was probably nu -- wherever I slept in the barracks, in the morning go to the Birnbaum’s.</span> <span id="s597">So that was my routine, so no reason for me to wonder.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: So the restrictions that existed most probably did not impair me, because there was no need for me to wander around.</span> <span id="s600">So that respect, being young was a blessing.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: And were you required to have a Jewish star on your clothes as well, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s605">But that did not necessarily, you know, impact me dramatically because that we had -- that [indecipherable] was on my sweater, and I wa -- it was cold you wore a sweater, you wore that with the yode star on it.</span> <span id="s606">So again, in looking back on it, being a sm-small child, or a very young aged little boy protected me, gave me my own little area of protection, that I did not face a lot of the other things which I would have faced four years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: My brother had more exposure, both in Westerbork and in Terezin, because as you move up the ladder of age, you get -- you’re drawn into these other restrictions.</span> <span id="s609">So I can’t say that I felt, you know, restricted or inhibited, like most children in today’s environment most probably wouldn’t feel restricted if they cannot cross the street.</span> <span id="s610">You know, if you ask them 20 years later, did you feel dil -- were you a prisoner of your neighborhood?</span> <span id="s611">I don’t think they would express it in these terms.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: That makes sense.</span> <span id="s613">We’re going to have to change the tape right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s617">Is there anything else that you would remember from Westerbork before you get sent to Terezin?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Not much ta -- of detail, kind of that could mention -- that I have mentioned.</span> <span id="s619">I [indecipherable] come back subsequently.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Right, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: No, I think that’s -- the time passed, and then we were --</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: Now, you’re a year --</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: A year, we --</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: At Westerbork --</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: -- from what, February --</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: February to February.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: -- fe -- February.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: So in February ’44 --</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: ‘44</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: Now, does somebody come and tell you tomorrow you’re going to go to another place?</span> <span id="s633">I mean, how --</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: Not to me, Leo.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: Not to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: Not to me, again.</span> <span id="s637">I was -- I don’t feel bad being left out.</span> <span id="s638">No, but we were told that ending up in west -- in Terezin -- see, in Theresienstadt-stadt, as you know, was a place where they -- that st -- sent people -- a s-second holding place, holding pattern.</span> <span id="s639">Primarily people who had certain privileges stay -- privileged status, and our status kind of held, and therefore Westerbork was a place to -- transits, spot to get people out, and so we were there in some sense too long, we didn’t belong in Westerbork because we’re not transit people, and we were not transit to get transported, so they moved them to a new place, which -- Theresienstadt, which was designed for our kinds of people, all kinds of privileged people.</span> <span id="s640">I had no idea that I was privileged obviously, but that settled in later.</span> <span id="s641">But -- so I had no sense that that’s a new regime, you know, for me.</span> <span id="s642">But my brother and sister were there, of course, must -- that must have been very reassuring, to have my brother and sister with me on an ongoing basis.</span> <span id="s643">That was my anchor of family stability, and the rest was activities throughout the day, or evening.</span> <span id="s644">So when I was -- when we were going to Terezin, we were put under the auspices of a social worker from Amsterdam, also was being shipped there with her husband, her name was Malka Weinmann, and her husband Paul Weinmann, who -- they placed some children under their responsibility.</span> <span id="s645">And we ended up in the train, which again I do remember the physical feature of the train, it was a compar -- a European compartment train, was probably third class, but it was not the cattle train, which people unfortunately were subjected to as well.</span> <span id="s646">Was a commercial type of train with compartment, and we sat there, my brother, my sister, myself, the two Weinmanns, two elderly people, Rosens, elderly people, and another girl Alicia Farber, who was separated from her parents, so she was all alone as well.</span> <span id="s647">And we had this train trip to another place.</span> <span id="s648">And in the train, I was -- was probably playing on the floor, with whatever we had over there, and Miss Malka Pollaczek had a suitcase which I opened up, as a curious child would ordinarily do, and I played with whatever she had over there, I inspected it.</span> <span id="s649">And it was a big t-tin can there, and I asked her what is this all about, what is this for?</span> <span id="s650">And so she tells me, we’ll use that at happy occasion.</span> <span id="s651">Turns out it was used for a happy occasion, subsequently for my brother’s Bar Mitzvah, close to -- to the following year.</span> <span id="s652">But that -- that scene of the train ride I remember like a photograph, sitting there, and we moved onto -- from Westerbork to Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Do you know how long it took?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: Several days, I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: And did they wein -- the Weinmanns have food that they brought with them, so that you could eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: They brought some food, yes.</span> <span id="s657">They brought some food and provisions.</span> <span id="s658">And I assume -- I assume now that we also had our little bags -- people allowed to bring along one suitcase, or some bag or so.</span> <span id="s659">So whatever we had -- what it was inside our bag, I have no clue, nor does my brother really remember.</span> <span id="s660">I asked him.</span> <span id="s661">But people had their belongings.</span> <span id="s662">And when we came to Theresienstadt, we were placed with the Dutch population.</span> <span id="s663">They was s-segmented, they compartmentalized the people.</span> <span id="s664">Sometimes different groups met all across th-the borders, in some sense, but we were among the Dutch.</span> <span id="s665">That again, in retrospect most probably helped because again, Dutch language was the language we sp -- I heard, and people spoke.</span> <span id="s666">Not that we knew people -- I don’t think we knew many people over there, but some -- turned out we had some relatives of my mother as well, whom we dealt with, my brother more than I. And we were put under -- she became our guardian, Malka Pollaczek.</span> <span id="s667">And she, in fact, was put in charge of the children’s home in Terezin as well, which came to my advantage later.</span> <span id="s668">The Dutch compound, we were put in the caserne, that -- not -- not barracks, barracks were flat, usually, and caserne was pretty impressive stone buildings with courtyards, and surrounding were -- originally were made for quarters for soldiers.</span> <span id="s669">And they used it for the people who were put into Theresienstadt, in detention purposes, and they multiplied the number of people in the -- those casernes were multiples of what the soldiers were in, was very crowded.</span> <span id="s670">Had three tiers, beds -- three bunk beds.</span> <span id="s671">And men were separated from the women.</span> <span id="s672">And I now went with my brother, and my sister was -- what -- was accessible, I went to visit my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: She was in a different place?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: Also in the same Hamborg caserne, that’s where the Dutch were.</span> <span id="s675">And they were [indecipherable] pretty impressive stone structures.</span> <span id="s676">And in that respect you look at it now, it looks like, you know with the courtyard, with kind of tiered, round hallways.</span> <span id="s677">But all of that was very crowded, and not very, you know attractive.</span> <span id="s678">But people always say that Terezin is an attractive place compared with the other concentration camps, and they’re absolutely correct in that respect, but it’s not a place recommend for a vacation.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: Or for a pleasant journey.</span> <span id="s681">It was -- had it’s own drabness all the time, of the stench and the physical environment.</span> <span id="s682">So again, I do see a visi -- a vision of a -- of the scene of brown wooden bunk beds, three tiers, and lots of people, and crowded, and noisy.</span> <span id="s683">But it was not a calm environment.</span> <span id="s684">Bedbugs, lice on the beds, killing at night was an activity, you know to s-swipe them, do away with them.</span> <span id="s685">And then had get -- got a new routine in Terezin.</span> <span id="s686">Now, Terezin I remember a little bit more, because I was older, so I have more mental images of Terezin.</span> <span id="s687">In ret -- in comparison to everything else, it was spacious.</span> <span id="s688">Was -- okay?</span> <span id="s689">Because you had these big courtyards, and then from caserne to caserne there was another walkway, and when you moved down from there -- there I did walk outside of the caserne for a reason I’ll tell you in a minute.</span> <span id="s690">So you had a sense of not being totally confined to one building, or one narrow area.</span> <span id="s691">And that kind of tri -- helped the physical benefit from being that -- not [indecipherable] confined.</span> <span id="s692">But it wa -- once you’re in the barracks, it was very crowded.</span> <span id="s693">But I was basically confined to that quarters for line-up, for soup, for the meals, and for daily activity.</span> <span id="s694">And the learning study group I mentioned before, the study group was up in that loft, up to the left, if I recall correctly, where we -- I went on a basis.</span> <span id="s695">So I didn’t, again, wander around much till later in Terezin.</span> <span id="s696">And a lot of the parts of Terezin I never stepped across, because I had no business to be there.</span> <span id="s697">I may not even allowed to be there for all I know.</span> <span id="s698">So you stuck where you belonged, and where I had some reason to be.</span> <span id="s699">And my reasons to be, to go to visit my sister, or go to the study place, the first stage of my stay there.</span> <span id="s700">And spent the time there.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Let me go back for a moment.</span> <span id="s702">Do you remember your arrival in Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: We had to walk a long distance from the train.</span> <span id="s706">Later, I think they extended the train tracks, because when -- eventually right outside of Hamborg caserne, there was a fence, and the train tracks that was visible to my -- later on I saw people come and go, those [indecipherable] my activities during the day.</span> <span id="s707">But I don’t think in our time we got that close.</span> <span id="s708">We had to walk, I think a half an hour [indecipherable] what.</span> <span id="s709">But there was a parade of people marching, and I followed the crowd, and I moved along, and my legs held up, and that was it.</span> <span id="s710">So it didn’t leave as an impression of a torturous rite.</span> <span id="s711">I don’t know what id -- had no idea what I was in for.</span> <span id="s712">See, adults in all likelihood have more uncertainties and more concerns for -- they knew who they left behind, what they left behind, rumors, all of that.</span> <span id="s713">So they’re walking with a different attitude that I -- I was a child again, not -- be -- being protected and being ignorant helped.</span> <span id="s714">So I walked.</span> <span id="s715">But I did not, you know, find that, you know, gruesome or onerous.</span> <span id="s716">I may have been tired, as a child, but moved along, you know.</span> <span id="s717">I was prodded along, and that was it.</span> <span id="s718">So I -- that part, in some sense I skipped easier than settling into the place.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: Was there a registration process at --</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: There was a registration process, which I don’t recall being involved, maybe Miss Malka Pollaczek took care of, maybe my brother took care of it.</span> <span id="s721">Vaguely I recall something, standing on lines.</span> <span id="s722">Lot of line standing in Terezin in general.</span> <span id="s723">Lining for food, was a line always.</span> <span id="s724">Morning line-up sometimes.</span> <span id="s725">Evening I think also.</span> <span id="s726">So there were lines, so -- but at the -- the registration p -- part, again I -- I -- being a child, you -- I take it for granted you stand in line, or you do it, what you were told to do, so -- so it never left a big impact on me, or impression, as other people find that -- was very cold when we arrived in February.</span> <span id="s727">And again, as I mentioned, for how we survived overall cold with inadequate clothing, in all likelihood, pretty impressive.</span> <span id="s728">Course I went -- we visited in 1996, Terezin, was also February, by chance, and was bitter, bitter cold with a winter jacket, and with gloves and a scarf.</span> <span id="s729">And tell my wife that not see how I could have done that so many years before, but I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s731">Did you see any brutality when you first arrived?</span> <span id="s732">Were people screaming?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: No, no, no, no, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: I don’t recall anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: So while it was crowded, it was not a hysterical scene to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: I don’t -- I didn’t -- I don’t recall any of that, I mean I don’t know whether there was or there wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: So, I mean I can’t be a witness for that.</span> <span id="s740">I more recall was the daily routine.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: The food line-up, I recall.</span> <span id="s743">All of us had a ration card for the month, and each of us had a little metal bowl and a spoon.</span> <span id="s744">How I, as a young child in 1944, held onto that without losing it -- I believe I didn’t lose it, I still wonder.</span> <span id="s745">Because nowadays a lot of school kids can’t keep their lunch card for one day, or other tickets, or so, and that mu -- mean -- it was [indecipherable] my survival.</span> <span id="s746">In order to get food you need the bowl, you need the card.</span> <span id="s747">And I never lost the card.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: Where -- where would you put the bowl?</span> <span id="s749">Did you tie it on a belt or something, or you don’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: Carried it with me, or put it back in the barrack when I wa -- was through.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: But I have again these images of walking around at the -- at the serving time, with a spoon and a bowl, and lining up.</span> <span id="s753">And there was a strategy of where to line up, and when to line up, because the main meal often contained like a barley soup.</span> <span id="s754">And if you came early you got the water, if you came at the end you got nothing.</span> <span id="s755">If you want to get water and barley, which had the most substance, you had to be positioned in the right time of your line-up, the people positioned themselves, and I recall always people jockeying for position where to go, partly because of what you get.</span> <span id="s756">And I was part of that jockeying.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: And you knew that?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: I sensed it, yeah, I knew this, I knew that, I was [indecipherable] to become -- after awhile I become streetwise.</span> <span id="s759">And I was again told -- but that was part of my job, to be there on time, at the right time, the right place to get a better serving.</span> <span id="s760">There were times I came late.</span> <span id="s761">There were times I came too early.</span> <span id="s762">But every can’t be in the middle, obviously.</span> <span id="s763">But that whole -- not tension, that whole -- at -- at -- attention, too, and focus on getting your food or so, became part of your daily routine.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: You know, have your bowl and have your food and have your line-up.</span> <span id="s766">Like it was a time consuming affair through three times --</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: And what -- what did this ration card look like?</span> <span id="s768">Did y -- did someone cl -- clip off --</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: Clipped off a piece -- I think they were --</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: They clipped off a piece?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: Yes, piece of paper I think that little sections to --</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: -- to clip [indecipherable] make it 90 little coupons, and took -- each day took three.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: And did you get the soup outside, or inside?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: Outside, outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: It was outside --</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: In the courtyard.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: -- and you ate -- and you ate outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: I think ate outside, and sometimes inside.</span> <span id="s780">But they out -- the courtyard was it -- a place where again, you saw [indecipherable] one photograph, that was the kind of scene you could remember.</span> <span id="s781">All Jewish people in -- interned people who were there, with coats and the star on their jackets were serving the food, and then [indecipherable] people who knew who you were, you know?</span> <span id="s782">And it was a daily routine.</span> <span id="s783">The food wasn’t very much food to eat.</span> <span id="s784">With black bread, with cok -- grain coffee called ersatz coffee, which kids got too.</span> <span id="s785">The barley soup, several times a week there was horsemeat, and vegetables.</span> <span id="s786">Now, one vegetable which lasted for me after the war, as well as a -- we called a [indecipherable] initially, is a -- something which young people don’t know, now we call them green beans, but they were used to call string beans.</span> <span id="s787">Now, string beans had a lot of strings in the one they served.</span> <span id="s788">You ate, and you had your mouth, basically you had the feel of those greens, whatever you got, and then the mouth full of these strings, which you couldn’t chew, you couldn’t digest, and you spit them out, or so [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s789">That was my concept of eating string beans.</span> <span id="s790">So after the war, when it was served, I couldn’t eat them for awhile.</span> <span id="s791">Because they also, still in 40’s, they still had some strings, not as much string or so.</span> <span id="s792">So that was the kind of food, was not very wholesome, but it kept me going.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: Were you hungry?</span> <span id="s794">Do you remember being -- feeling hungry?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: I don’t recall feeling hungry, but was pretty standardized meal, no, you know, special features.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: Pretty routine, but you went -- that was, again, became the norm, and you -- you took what you got and you went on line in order to get your food, that was -- you came every day, you ate this, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: -- your rations were adequate enough to keep going.</span> <span id="s800">I wasn’t working, so I was kind of, you know, wandering around most of the day.</span> <span id="s801">And -- but the -- the food item was an important part of the day.</span> <span id="s802">And having protect your bowl and your ration coupon was an occupation, apparently.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Did your brother work?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: My brother did --</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: Was he old enough?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: -- he was old enough, he was put in some work activity, like messenger.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s808">Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: He served as a messenger.</span> <span id="s810">Deliver internal -- they had -- see, Terezin was organized as a functioning concentration camp with certain activities, with some semblances of normalcy, and the -- again, the Jewish council had to administer a law from the detail, not the [indecipherable] principles, and people were assigned work, and were assigned to do certain activities.</span> <span id="s811">So my brother did work as a messenger, kept him busy, but I basically wandered around the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: Your sister, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: My sister a little less, I think also -- she also did.</span> <span id="s814">My recollection is that, you know, I played soccer with a tin can, that was my toy, kick the tin can.</span> <span id="s815">That was really my outdoor activity.</span> <span id="s816">This woman, Malka Pollaczek -- Malka -- married [indecipherable] Pollaczek, Malka Weinmann was moved to administer a children’s home in relatively nice quarters, in fact, was one very attractive building that they converted to a home for children, and she was the administrator for it.</span> <span id="s817">And after she moved to that place, she found the means to bring me to that place as well if I wanted to, or -- or so.</span> <span id="s818">Of course it was a little better condition, better food they served, lard as part a supplement of the food.</span> <span id="s819">Where there was [indecipherable] only for children, as we were, loose children at the children’s home.</span> <span id="s820">And given that we ate kosher, we -- I remember we had a discussion, my brother, my sister and I, whether I should go to that home and -- because the attraction was eating lard.</span> <span id="s821">And so first of all, I -- I di -- wasn’t eager to separate anyhow, but that [indecipherable] she approached and she thinks it’s good for me, I’ll be better off, nicer physical environment and better food, that [indecipherable] my interest, so we consulted a rabbi, the rabbi said yes, go ahead, under the circumstances.</span> <span id="s822">Go there and eat there, because you have a better chance of survival.</span> <span id="s823">So in answer to your question, whether the food was ample, it really was a consideration for me to get better food, with my interest, or so.</span> <span id="s824">So I moved to the children’s home quarters, and -- but I did go visit my brothers.</span> <span id="s825">That was further away from Hamborg caserne, so I had to cross over one -- a big courtyard to get from here to there, and I wandered during the day, whenever I felt like, or [indecipherable] it is.</span> <span id="s826">So I had had more space than before, and I did wi -- as a functional walk, I didn’t explore the town, or so.</span> <span id="s827">So life moved on, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: Can I ask you something?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: Since you were religious --</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: -- and as a kid you understood that --</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: Did it bother you to have the non-kosher food, I mean that it star --</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: Yes, yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: -- it both -- it bothered you when you were -- didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: -- but yes [indecipherable] consideration -- we -- many people who were in these camps, although the food was not prepared under kosher auspices, ate what they could eat, which was not -- definitively not kosher like.</span> <span id="s838">Pig meat if they had given it, or horsemeat, or this sort.</span> <span id="s839">So -- and all I could do then, eat the horsemeat.</span> <span id="s840">I mean, the soup may have had horsemeat content in there, but it’s -- now a lard was definitively food from -- not to be eaten, and this we knew, I was raised that way, so it became a issue.</span> <span id="s841">That’s why I had to -- we had to debate it, or discuss it.</span> <span id="s842">And I remember that discussion [indecipherable] no, of what should we do, and then we consulted the local rabbi over there, and [indecipherable] rabbis there who gave me a ruling that it’s permissible, and I should go, and it’s in my interest to do so.</span> <span id="s843">So I knew enough about that as well, my brothers knew more -- my brother knew more, my sister knew more.</span> <span id="s844">So it became a legitimate discussion issue, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: Maybe I didn’t ask the question in a way that was understandable.</span> <span id="s846">I meant when you actually ate there.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: Did that bother you, or did you say since they said it was okay --</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: After awhile -- no, after awhile -- but no, after awhile it was okay, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: -- after it was okay -- it was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: Yes, I don’t think I had a great abhorrence.</span> <span id="s852">And most probably kids don’t really know what they’re eating anyhow, once it’s served.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: No, the issue was the underlying principle.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: You know, so no, that.</span> <span id="s857">I’m sorry, that was your question.</span> <span id="s858">I did not sense it was, you know, just didn’t taste good, or th -- I didn’t put up a battle subsequently of saying no, I don’t, that’s not for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: No.</span> <span id="s860">Did you know that people were being transported out of Terezin?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: Yeah, yeah, well see, because we were very close -- lived.</span> <span id="s862">We were associated very close to the transport.</span> <span id="s863">Outside there was a big fence, a metal fence, and a major part of the day I spent around that fence watching the activity of the train depot.</span> <span id="s864">A lot of them -- the arrivals I saw.</span> <span id="s865">And when the arrivals came, there was a lot of discussion, because not only I, other people standing over there, where they from?</span> <span id="s866">Cause sometimes they came from towns close by.</span> <span id="s867">Or from relatives they had, even if they’re from a dif -- different country.</span> <span id="s868">So that people were identified, and the Czech group came in, so the people said, oh not for me, I don’t know anybody.</span> <span id="s869">Or the Danish came, late at the end of the thing, same story.</span> <span id="s870">So -- but the time you -- first you saw the arrivals, so some you knew, so that this came a discussion point, and people tried to see whether they knew anybody.</span> <span id="s871">And they came from Holland, it was a big excitement, because suddenly people -- the adults met acquaintances, or even relatives, and I was part of the -- the watching scenery and taking it in, but not -- no -- I had met -- I never met -- met anybody who I knew, obviously, or anybody who was look -- looking for me.</span> <span id="s872">Although subsequently I have to mention to you, some distant relatives of my mother did arrive, and later on we had contact with them.</span> <span id="s873">So the [indecipherable] contact with us, obviously.</span> <span id="s874">Did I know people were leaving?</span> <span id="s875">I saw transports too, but what it meant -- you see, two way traffic, all right?</span> <span id="s876">But the injection of new coming -- I did sense, of the people with whom I dealt with, that they weren’t there any more after awhile.</span> <span id="s877">So there was a [indecipherable] whether people made friendships or so, it’s different -- different friendships with people are there for two months, or three months, and fending for themselves, and then they disappear.</span> <span id="s878">You become acquaintance, and then you know somebody’s name, and suddenly -- sit next to them in the study group, and he is no longer there.</span> <span id="s879">I had that sense of coming, going, people moving in and moving out, but where they were going, I had no idea.</span> <span id="s880">Where they came from was the curiosity to be discovered.</span> <span id="s881">And in line-ups -- in the time of day we had line-ups, the different groups lined up near the fences, so that conversations started taking place, and you started picking up, you know, different languages.</span> <span id="s882">Danish sing-song, and as a kid started making fun, or trying to imitate, and learning different phrases from people.</span> <span id="s883">But I’d never picked up the language, okay?</span> <span id="s884">But there as a lot of interact -- not lot, there was interaction, we had an hour, half hour, how long it took to wait, and we saw different nationalities, and different languages, and kind of came [indecipherable] curious what was going on.</span> <span id="s885">So there was more -- I think the arrivals left a bigger impact on me than the departures, because I had no idea where people are going.</span> <span id="s886">I knew where they came from.</span> <span id="s887">And you -- suddenly you sit next to the Danes, and you sit next to the Hungarians when they came at the end.</span> <span id="s888">But we were not allowed to mix, and we -- there really was a fence between the nationalities, unless they put them in the same caserne.</span> <span id="s889">So I became more aware of the change of population of Westerbork over time, but the immediate group of people whom -- who I deal with, my brother and my sister, Malka Weinmann and her husband, midway were shipped out to Auschwitz, cause she was more Dutch, and he was more -- he was Czech originally.</span> <span id="s890">So they categorized him, he came under her auspices, and she had other potential [indecipherable] I’m not clear why she survived, but she did.</span> <span id="s891">Anyway, that part I -- that one part of the middle of our stay, he was shipped out in [indecipherable] and I do kind of have a image of her being sad for one period of there, but could have been anything, or so, but later on she told me it was -- what was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: I have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: Oh, okay, okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">End of Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s897">There was some -- something called the helping hand in Terezin, where children were sent around to help out with the sick, or with the elderly.</span> <span id="s898">Do you ever remember anything like -- cause somebo --</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: I was not, because I was in the children’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: Uh-huh, section.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: Section, or that little, special children’s home.</span> <span id="s902">And my brother most probably was, when he was -- was a messenger, that was a helping hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: So he was doing -- delivering messages for different people, Leo Baeck for example, he did -- he ran messages for Leo Baeck, who -- he was a inmate --</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: -- in Terezin.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: Did you ever hear the name Freddie Hirsch, who worked with children there, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: Nope, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: No.</span> <span id="s910">So maybe he didn’t work with little ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: No -- little ones, right.</span> <span id="s912">No, the -- when wa -- which year was he there?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: He was -- well, he was -- I believe he was sent to Auschwitz in ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: Okay, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: That’s o -- that was before --</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: Before you came, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: [indecipherable] came.</span> <span id="s919">See, there was a whole group of people who -- particularly the Czech young people who lived in some of these children’s homes, they were arriving, I think, in ’43, and then they were sent out to Auschwitz --</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: -- elsewhere, in end of ’43, and ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: So, a lot of people ask me, do you know these people, or those people --</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: -- I never was even the same time with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: Time with them, right.</span> <span id="s927">I’m not sure exactly when he was --</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: Yeah, yes, yeah, yeah, ’44, likely.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: Did you ever get sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: Good question.</span> <span id="s931">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: Remarkably, remarkably, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: Cause one would think as a kid, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: And -- exactly, as a kid, and my brother and sister neither.</span> <span id="s936">I may have been, you know, colds or this sort, but in terms of illness, like dysentery, or typhus, which was --</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: Typhus, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: -- going on, given that lice and bugs were around me, no, I was spared.</span> <span id="s939">Remarkable that I didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: Amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: All three of us.</span> <span id="s942">I asked my brother recently again, any of us were serious ill.</span> <span id="s943">In fact, one question which occurred to me, which I don’t know why I started school in 1942, when I was seven, whether that was the norm in Holland or not.</span> <span id="s944">So my brother didn’t know exactly, but he says, when you were a child, you had frequent whooping cough, so maybe our parents protected you more or so.</span> <span id="s945">I suspect that the schools start at the age of seven, and we’ve had an extended kindergarten.</span> <span id="s946">The schools don’t always start that early --</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: Uh-huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: -- in -- in -- in Europe or so.</span> <span id="s949">But anyhow, we talked about that, and to our pleasant surprises, we were not sick of physical si -- illness, you know, I mean, requiring infirmary, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: And did you see --</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: Did I see people sick?</span> <span id="s952">Again the pe --</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: -- the wa -- the small group of people I mention -- mention my circle of contacts became very small.</span> <span id="s955">I lived with children, and she took -- Malka Weinmann took care of me, and I met my brother and sister, that was basically my circle.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: So really very small.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: So plus ma -- the -- when I went up to these little study places.</span> <span id="s958">That was standard, and co -- and again the turnover of people was such.</span> <span id="s959">So [indecipherable] when a person became sick or -- was shipped out.</span> <span id="s960">You -- people didn’t have a tracing -- if you have an ongoing relationship with a know -- fellow, friend or ac-acquaintance, and is -- is there, for no -- three, four months, and disappears for two months, and comes back after three months.</span> <span id="s961">The bulk of people who didn’t come back, didn’t come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: Whether they were sick, or in -- or wensh -- went elsewhere, di-didn’t know, penetrated, and I wasn’t focusing attention on this kind of thing.</span> <span id="s964">But personally, remarkably enough we didn’t get sick, not in Westerbork, not in --</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: Not in Terezin.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: Not Terezin.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: It’s amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: It’s amazing, absolutely amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: Really amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: Did you get ho -- how do you be -- how were you treated -- as a little child there’s a lot of touching that goes on with children, being hugged, and being touched, and whatever.</span> <span id="s972">Di -- did you get that?</span> <span id="s973">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: I received that from Malka Weinmann.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s977">She was attentive to me, and matter of fact she took me into the -- her orbit, direct orbit.</span> <span id="s978">I perce -- now, I was paid attention, I had access to her, and vaguely I recall once or twice, and I came to her with some kind of complaint or so, and soothed my feelings or so.</span> <span id="s979">So I had that, it was not the -- she had a lot of children to take care of, and she was not -- in general she’s not a touchy -- was not a touchy person, was a very professional woman, very capable, and very caring.</span> <span id="s980">But to go and, you know, hug every little child under her care, she couldn’t probably do her job, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: -- or so.</span> <span id="s983">So I, did I lack that?</span> <span id="s984">Most probably I -- I -- did I miss it?</span> <span id="s985">Again, I di -- those -- those were my circumsta -- I mean, I was both accepting, and not knowing any better.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s988">I just -- I appear to have adjusted to the circumstances, and I moved with the tide.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s990">Which was lucky, I suppose.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: Which was lucky, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: Ho -- how would you describe your relationship with Leah, and with Leo?</span> <span id="s993">Did you talk, did you play?</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: We talked, no, we were in conta -- I ta -- I mentioned I c-come -- gravitated back to them --</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: -- or so.</span> <span id="s997">We were a threesome, okay?</span> <span id="s998">And related to each other.</span> <span id="s999">One illustration, which in fact is under, quote, dispute amongst us, and both stories may well be correct, by the way, because what we each remember is something different.</span> <span id="s1000">For -- my recollection of the story is that for Passover, for Pessach, for the Seder time, we knew that Passover is coming around, cause we’re taught in the group, we -- Leo and I --that’s -- I recall, my brother confirms that after I recall it, saved our potato rations, and we ground it up somehow, and gave it to her to make matzoh.</span> <span id="s1001">She does not recall that.</span> <span id="s1002">She recalls something different, that Leo and I saved our potato rations and made a birthday cake for her.</span> <span id="s1003">And I say both may well be right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: Okay, we don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: Or you may be talking about two different times even.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: Or two different times even, or so.</span> <span id="s1008">But that’s the kind we -- and we dealt with each other as a li -- if you ask me as a illustration, well, we came -- she was -- kind of took care of the household things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: Leah did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A: Le -- yeah, li -- li -- call her Lily.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: Lily?</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: Lily.</span> <span id="s1013">That’s her other -- that’s her -- that’s her name we know of her -- Leah is her formal name, and now in Israel she’s -- calls herself Leah as well to other people, but Lily is her --</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: -- common name, mean, as a family, people know Lily.</span> <span id="s1016">But so we had ongoing, you know, relationships, and contact.</span> <span id="s1017">And most probably played whatever children play.</span> <span id="s1018">But she again had her tasks, and my brother had his tasks, and I was separated from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: So the amount of contact was not as frequent and as ongoing as had we been all together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: Now I -- I know that you -- you didn’t feel insecure in the way that an adult would there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: This was the place that you were at.</span> <span id="s1024">But did you feel somehow more secure, more at home when you’d be with your brother and sister, that sa -- you -- do you have this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: The mere fact that I gravitated to them --</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: Towards them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: -- yes, obviously is the case, that I felt that was the know, -- I belonged with them --</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: -- and they could answer my questions, or deal with me, or whatever concerns I may have had, don’t recall the individual point, but I do recall walking regularly from the children’s home, which is separate building, to the caserne, and looking for them, and getting -- moving with them.</span> <span id="s1030">So where that was, know, a stabilizing feature for me, or not, in the likely, yes.</span> <span id="s1031">But as a child I certainly don’t recall that I was looking for, you know, a place where I had to be safe, and only with them or anybody else.</span> <span id="s1032">Somehow I managed to roam the streets, keep busy, the day passes, get my food, and do my things what I had to do, and keep out of trouble, whatever that meant, and function.</span> <span id="s1033">That was my -- that was my daily routine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: And I did that day by day, with some guidance, with some supervision.</span> <span id="s1036">But I don’t think it’s as structured, as organized as people would like to see in retrospect --</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: -- that it was all orchestrated.</span> <span id="s1039">That’s how it worked out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: Now, how were your clothes washed, if they were washed?</span> <span id="s1041">Do you -- do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: I think my sister did some of it, and they washed infrequently, obviously.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: Must -- things must have torn.</span> <span id="s1045">Again, the whole clothing for all of us --</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: -- is not clear.</span> <span id="s1048">I say -- I may have been the beneficiary again of my brothers, but how my brother kept clothing, how I got it, he doesn’t know either.</span> <span id="s1049">But it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: And they -- they were washed, and the total clothing collection, which was probably very meager, and I don’t recall what I wore, I don’t recall the colors or patterns, or of this sort.</span> <span id="s1052">Left no impression that I didn’t have or did have.</span> <span id="s1053">I wa -- I was taken care of because I was dressed.</span> <span id="s1054">I wasn’t walking around naked, or no -- barefoot.</span> <span id="s1055">And again, Malka Weinmann may well have supervised that part for me too.</span> <span id="s1056">So, in broad sense, my needs were taken care of.</span> <span id="s1057">As know, to survive to function.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: Did you wash, did you take baths?</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: Did you smell?</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: Showers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: You took showers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: I think I took showers.</span> <span id="s1064">I think I took showers, yes [indecipherable] there was no bathtubs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: I think I took showers.</span> <span id="s1067">Did I smell?</span> <span id="s1068">The whole --</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: Everybody smelled.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: Everybody, the whole place had a aroma, odor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: Heavy, and so they came -- and eventually people got used to that.</span> <span id="s1073">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: And bathrooms?</span> <span id="s1075">Were there latrines?</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">A: There were latrines, and public long -- long line bathrooms or so.</span> <span id="s1077">Again, all these things don’t leave any impression on me, because it became routine.</span> <span id="s1078">Whatever facilities were there, I made use of.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: You just [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1081">Whether they were foul compared to what could have been, obviously.</span> <span id="s1082">But pose -- mean -- remember, for a little child in ’44, the last time I had normal bathroom facilities, was go back in end of ’42, beginning of ’43, it’s a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: After, I know, two years of not standard sanitary conditions, that becomes, in some sense, the accepted norm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: Now was that similar in Westerbork for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A: Yes, yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: It was?</span> <span id="s1088">They had latrines?</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: Yes, yes, right.</span> <span id="s1090">But it -- nothing to leave any kind of mental picture of it.</span> <span id="s1091">When I visited Terezin, I saw in some of the places what they had, I kind of recollect on all these long lines.</span> <span id="s1092">But only kind of re-emerged something ote -- which I took f -- that was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">A: -- that’s -- that’s how one had to go to take care of one’s needs, one took care of one’s needs using what was available.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: And your recollection of the way people behaved is people were simply accepting, this is what was there, and this is what we have to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: Well, that’s -- that’s what I her -- saw at yet -- but again, doesn’t mean that was all -- always the case, but I was not involved with adult world too much.</span> <span id="s1097">And the adult world I was involved in dealt with me as a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: So I am not a person that could kind of comment anything about that sort of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: Did you ever ask your brother, have you heard from our parents again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: Not far as I recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: Not as you recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">A: Recall, no</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Q: Or did you say wh-where are they?</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: Where -- ask -- no, I don’t recall that I raised this issue, whether it was on my mind.</span> <span id="s1106">And part again is I think eventually I moved from transition to transition to a life circumstance that was tolerable for a child.</span> <span id="s1107">And again, I was not being hurt physically, I was not being -- didn’t get sick or so.</span> <span id="s1108">So I was not in pain, or some of this sort.</span> <span id="s1109">May have cold, but everybody else was cold most probably, so it’s cold.</span> <span id="s1110">And somehow was accepting, adapting to it, and so stopped asking questions.</span> <span id="s1111">My brother was much more alert, and much more troubled about all of this, but either protected me, or didn’t consider me as an outlet.</span> <span id="s1112">I have no idea where he [indecipherable] outlet for that matter.</span> <span id="s1113">He may -- needed outlet more than I did, my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: So in some way your youth protected you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: My youth protected me --</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: Every [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: -- and this way my youth was treated with this -- these little -- being in these little children’s enclaves, and children’s homes kind of protected me one layer better than my siblings did.</span> <span id="s1118">I was more privileged treatment in some sense, than they had.</span> <span id="s1119">He had to work and fend for himself, and I was in this children’s home.</span> <span id="s1120">And it -- physically a more attractive place, I remember that, physically was with a balustrade stairway -- course th-they took over a residential home, that’s how th -- that’s how they were built.</span> <span id="s1121">I think --</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q: Was [indecipherable] sa -- I’m sorry, go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: -- no -- go ahead -- those -- no -- since it was an army camp before, and it was good as an army camp, the commandanters, or the commanders, and all this sort had si -- elegant homes, and that’s where they eventually put the children.</span> <span id="s1124">Right now the museum is in one of those buildings, very elegant room.</span> <span id="s1125">El -- elegant st --</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Q: And did you remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">A: The physical building?</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: -- the physical building very well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: Oh, yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: In fact, when I went to the museum, I thought it was -- that was the place where I was, because very similar stairway, and spatial.</span> <span id="s1132">So, I mean, I -- I was not in no -- in total squalid quarters, fortunately.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: My brother and sister in the bunkbed areas were worse, I was there for awhile, I remember that, but you know, took it, and I moved onto another stage.</span> <span id="s1135">I was very kind of -- not -- not in control of things, nor was I asking to be in control of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1137">Did your sister also eventually work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: I believe she did some work, I don’t recall exactly, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: You don’t know what, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: Was there any delousing that you can remember, where they put powder on you, or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: I think there was delousing, we got chemicals odors periodically, was when the bugs and lice became more prevalent, they had delousing, yes.</span> <span id="s1143">Then, that made life uncomfortable on your bed as well, because had the odor and the residual --</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: -- fu -- features, or so, the only feature was you saw dead bugs.</span> <span id="s1146">I don’t like bugs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: Do you remember being deloused?</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: Personally, I think once or twice, yes I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: Uh-huh, did that hurt, I mean was it -- was it burning or some --</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: I don’t think no, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: -- I don’t -- I recall as -- no, I don’t recall the physical part of it.</span> <span id="s1153">But I think the physical, the barracks themselves were deloused.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: Cause that’s where they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: -- that’s where the lice were prevalent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: Were, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: So, sure that’s not -- not pleasant or so.</span> <span id="s1160">But it can it -- it came, and it went, and it came again, perhaps.</span> <span id="s1161">And that was part of the environment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: So not something to kind of leave a impact, or a imprint on me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: As it would maybe on an adult, or a -- I wasn’t fighting it either, you see, it wasn’t a question that I wanted something better or different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q: It -- in June of 1944, the Red Cross came, and they made this a lot -- certain portion of the place look much, much different, and they call it a kind of potenkin viz -- village, because it was a -- a lie.</span> <span id="s1167">Do you have any recollection of that happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: No.</span> <span id="s1169">Partly I think -- you see, we arrived in end of February, and we were not veterans at the time, this -- the -- these were planned, you know.</span> <span id="s1170">June they came, but they planned it in advance.</span> <span id="s1171">So all the pe -- the kids who they put in the kid shows, and the other items were the fronts for the -- and props for these movies, must have been picked maybe March and April.</span> <span id="s1172">I mean, you don’t -- you don’t do this stuff in June on June.</span> <span id="s1173">So we kind of -- most probably came too late for that, so we were out of it.</span> <span id="s1174">I don’t recall any of this thing of a sort.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: Nothing, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: And I think I would have, had I seen a play or a s -- a soccer match, or something -- this was -- that’s wha -- done the movie.</span> <span id="s1177">I -- had I been one of the props --</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: Right, you would have remembered.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: -- I’d have remembered something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: And I think my brother neither.</span> <span id="s1182">But I attributed that fact that we arrived when the planning for this thing -- this must have been underway already, and we were out of eligibility --</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: -- for that kind of thing, so nor did we get the benefits, whatever benefits existed for the clean up of this sort.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1186">Di -- did you go to any cultural activities during the period of time you were in t -- Terezin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: No, only this little kids, you know, study group, that’s the cultural activity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: That was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: We did have my brother’s bar-mitzvah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1192">That’s where the canned item --</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: -- I mentioned to you, in f -- January, 1945 was his bar-mitzvah, and he was taught by one of the rabbis to read the section of the Haftorah, and be called up to the Torah, and Friday night had a festive celebration where Malka Weinmann pulled out that can of cheese, Dutch cheese.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: Oh, that’s what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: That which she saved for that event.</span> <span id="s1197">And she collected from other people some goodies they had, chocolates and everything else.</span> <span id="s1198">So it was a festive event.</span> <span id="s1199">We did go to services, to synagogue on a weekly basis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: Oh, you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: Oh yes, was a synagogue service going on and so we were part of that little group of people who went to services.</span> <span id="s1202">And in fact my brother recently showed me that they had announcement sheets, they -- the person who was organizing that service send out an announcement to somebody else, be aware that next week or some of this sort, is the bar-mitzvah celebration of this young boy, Leo Sigmann, and make, know, announce it to whoever it is, that will take place on Saturday morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: And he has it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: He has one of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: Well, by chance my brother, a complete fluke chance, he was walking home from synagogue with some of his congregants in New York, and a fellow invited him come up have -- have guests, and he didn’t want to come up, and he did come up, and eventually the person had inherited the diary -- had the -- all these announcements of the Jewish community of Terezin, he had all of them, and he -- when he -- Leo mentioned to him that he was in Terezin, didn’t register.</span> <span id="s1209">When he went back to it, he went looking through all these little notices, and he says, your name is listed in among those notices.</span> <span id="s1210">I have a copy of it here with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">Q: Is-Isn’t that something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">A: And so they have [indecipherable] the fact that he gave him a composite sheet of different notices, which is just interesting enough that they had the -- there was a sense of community, and belonging with different people.</span> <span id="s1213">So that celebration I recall, and the can -- the can of cheese which she saved.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: Was it good cheese?</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">A: Yes, well, Dutch.</span> <span id="s1216">Dutch cheese is good.</span> <span id="s1217">And other treats for -- even if you don’t have -- don’t have treats on a routine basis, it tastes very different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">A: That was the highlight of summer event.</span> <span id="s1220">So it was not just the bar-mitzvah which most probably, was also being commemorated was -- was [indecipherable] so people did continue doing their lifecycle events, or so, and what’s even more interesting in his case, is that bar-mitzvah boys received tefillin, but where do you get tefillin in a camp?</span> <span id="s1221">People happened to have one set, not going to give it away, necessarily.</span> <span id="s1222">Turns out that a Czech person had two sets.</span> <span id="s1223">One a traveling set, was this regular one, which he brought along, so he gave it to my brother.</span> <span id="s1224">Very, very small phylacteries.</span> <span id="s1225">And typically, the ins -- writings inside the tefillin are in parchment, and the very small ones had to write very small letters.</span> <span id="s1226">Typically, typically they are defective.</span> <span id="s1227">It turns out that he had them inspected by a scribe, after -- he has them now, he had them inspected by a scribe after the war, in New York, or -- or in Israel for that matter, and they were letter perfect.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: Very odd.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: And the man was overwhelmed.</span> <span id="s1230">And he told them where he came from [indecipherable] somebody’s been protecting it, or so.</span> <span id="s1231">So he still has those.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: Oh my.</span> <span id="s1233">But we -- these small --</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: Very tiny, very small ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s1236">Amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: So life on -- this respect for life on religious sense went on, circumscribed by the circumstances.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">Q: Did a lot of people go to synagogue?</span> <span id="s1239">There must have been different synagogue groups, always.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: Different [indecipherable] I can -- I would not know -- can’t -- the totality I can’t tell.</span> <span id="s1241">We had a synagogue -- well, a synagogue, a service place, it was an ongoing place, and we went regularly.</span> <span id="s1242">So all these places were relatively small physical space anyhow --</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">A: -- so they couldn’t crowd many people in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1246">And your sister went as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A: I believe so.</span> <span id="s1248">I believe so.</span> <span id="s1249">Yes, I can’t -- you know, but -- but it was ca -- it was an activity, you know, we know Shabbat came, that -- that’s what you do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">Q: And that was what -- right.</span> <span id="s1251">And you celebrated as many holidays as you could?</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: We celebrated, because again we were taught of the holiday cycle, so we celebrated, commemorated with -- within what we could, whether -- the one -- one episode I remember was about the matzoh making, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">A: But whether -- I don’t recall a, you know, full fledged Seder, or so, myself, in detail, but it must have occurred.</span> <span id="s1255">Or a -- a Seder must have occurred, right?</span> <span id="s1256">So again I have these little glimpses, of course that one left an impression to me, that we did something, you know, special.</span> <span id="s1257">But the -- you know, s-some semblance of the calendar commemoration continued.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: Part because of the education, and part because of the practice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: Now, this visa that you had to Honduras, but there was something about going to Switzerland, am I correct, that you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: Du -- the n -- no, there were they -- the visas were for Honduras, provided by our Swiss relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: My s -- mother had a sister and brothers in Zurich, and they are the ones who mobilized --</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: To get the visas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: -- to get those visas.</span> <span id="s1266">But nat -- I believe at my father’s behest, know, been begging and -- but -- and it came too late for my parents and two older brothers.</span> <span id="s1267">So it had a Swiss association with it, but it’s Honduran passports.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1269">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">A: That kept us in this category of treat them differently.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: And that seemed to protect you throughout the whole period.</span> <span id="s1272">Some -- or something protected you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">A: That of -- protect us from the -- of course, in Theresienstadt they had ongoing transports to Auschwitz as well, and Bergen-Belsen, and elsewhere.</span> <span id="s1274">So we were never put in any of the transports, because of that status, not because we were children, because they didn’t differentiate, they put the children on there as well, plenty of them.</span> <span id="s1275">But, at the end of the war they had already in I think the fall of ’44, they had after this propaganda episode, the Red Cross again had a deal with the Swiss people [indecipherable] Swiss authorities had a deal for transporting people to stu -- Switzerland in exchange for trucks and tools, who knows what.</span> <span id="s1276">And money, I think.</span> <span id="s1277">So, a number of people were eligible to go, and rumors spread, or evers know, spread that pi -- that this was happening, people ought to be signing up.</span> <span id="s1278">And they had certain categories people who were eligible, and we cate -- under our categories we [indecipherable] because we had Swiss relatives maybe they thought my par -- my mother lives there, who knows what.</span> <span id="s1279">Anyway, were eligible to go, and we were -- kind of suggested we could go.</span> <span id="s1280">So we consulted with different people, including these other relatives of my mother, which was -- and there was a lot of suspicion, and our name was not put on that train.</span> <span id="s1281">Must have been in the fall of ’44.</span> <span id="s1282">People had arrangements, see th -- whoever was suspicious had arrangement of giving back mailings with codes of -- if it is correct, they write -- some words, or some style, or what have you.</span> <span id="s1283">If it’s not correct, they would do something different.</span> <span id="s1284">When the letters came back, they actually came from Switzerland, the packages were sent from Switzerland, so that train of, I think 11 -- 1200 people left, and I -- my brother and sister could have been on that train, but we missed the bo -- train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: You missed the boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: But subsequently, they had similar types of announcements, and some the -- some went actually to Auschwitz directly.</span> <span id="s1289">They were told they’re going somewhere else.</span> <span id="s1290">We were not eld -- we -- eligible because [indecipherable] workers, had to be of working age, at least I wasn’t, and so we’re not eligible.</span> <span id="s1291">But in ’45, there was another opportunity if you were going to Swiss tr -- [indecipherable] or -- or Freedom train, and for that one we were eligible, and we did sign up.</span> <span id="s1292">Now, that train never left, but ne -- wer -- there -- was destined to go to a gas chamber.</span> <span id="s1293">Many people don’t know that, Theresienstadt had a gas chamber, but Terezin does -- fortunately it was never used, cause they wanted to save the travel time and distance of the trains, for that time they wanted to use the trains for their own war purposes, or [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">Q: Did you hear about that then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A: What, about the train going to tre -- to gas chambers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: After the war we discovered.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: No, I mean, that there -- that they were supposed to be building the gas chamber, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: No, no, no, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: You didn’t.</span> <span id="s1301">This you heard after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: Yes, that’s true [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: But that train never left, because the war is coming to it’s end, but that -- the plan of the Nazis was to have that train go to the -- very close by.</span> <span id="s1305">And it was th -- but the foil was, let’s say, the Swiss Freedom train.</span> <span id="s1306">So we were saved once more by --</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1308">There was a train to Switzerland in 1945 with about 1200 people --</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: I think ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">Q: -- from Terezin.</span> <span id="s1311">There may have been one --</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: May -- may -- maybe jan -- maybe January, February, could be.</span> <span id="s1313">That’s the one we were not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: I see, that was one --</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: Which means that we did not sign on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: I see, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: I don’t know the dates exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1319">Okay.</span> <span id="s1320">We have to take a break.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Q: Sorry th -- End of Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Tape #5</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">Q: Charles, do you -- you were liberated in May, and you didn’t take this second -- or at least we think it may be the second transport to -- to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1325">That was going to go in March or April, you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">A: Around that time, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1328">So is -- is anything ch --</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">A: That was an aborted trip, it never -- that never took off.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">Q: It never took off, so no one went on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">A: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">Q: Did anything change radically in -- in those few months before the liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">A: Well yes, there was much more movement of trains, and so much more activity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: You mean in and out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">A: In and out, yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">A: And towards the end of the war -- and I lose -- I’d -- nobody -- I mean, I still didn’t know the calendar date, whether was mar -- February, March, to me it was the winter, who knows, but I don’t associate with particular months or dates.</span> <span id="s1338">But towards the end, since I hung around that fence at the -- near th -- near the railroad, watching the railroad tracks on one side, and the movement of activity on the other side, there were ki -- more and more people were standing around, and they were kind of coming instant war reporting commentators, because by the sound of where certain cannons went off, or airplanes were flying, they were able to tell, or the -- they thought they could tell whether it’s the allied forces or whether they were the Germans.</span> <span id="s1339">And as a standee next to that fence, I was kind of coming -- hearing about, know, the forces against the Nazis are coming closer to here.</span> <span id="s1340">And that came -- gave momentum as the days increased, whether -- was -- must have been April I assume, or so, but I can tell.</span> <span id="s1341">Also we saw German trucks moving out different kind of German soldiers, w-we had [indecipherable] with the German soldiers, but there was more movement of people [indecipherable] going and -- and kind of what you found out after that they were regrouping and escaping.</span> <span id="s1342">And more people were hanging around that fence rather than working, wherever they was doing.</span> <span id="s1343">So there was a very different atmosphere towards the end of the war than before.</span> <span id="s1344">That was the most noticeable part, and this -- listening to these comments of -- they’re coming, they’re not, they’re further away, closer by, and judging of a sort, I got a sense that -- wh -- since I then knew right -- it was a war, everything else, that this war is now reaching a different stage.</span> <span id="s1345">So that was very much in the atmosphere, in the air, and the conversation, and I was there listening --</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">A: -- and absorbing, and most probably even parroting what was happening.</span> <span id="s1348">Different kinds of transports came the end, I think the Danes and the Hungarians came pretty late in the game.</span> <span id="s1349">And -- kind of -- so new people, you never heard -- you -- heard before.</span> <span id="s1350">The Danes came very late.</span> <span id="s1351">So new languages, but the -- and they were different appearance, too.</span> <span id="s1352">Now, turns out that Theresienstadt also got a whole group of people from the death marches, were -- ended up in Theresienstadt, but they never ended up to our place, they ended up in -- that’s why people ask me about, do you ever meet those people, no.</span> <span id="s1353">Matter of fact, I know now some people who says they were in Theresienstadt at liberation.</span> <span id="s1354">And their description of what they saw was very different than what I lived.</span> <span id="s1355">But they lived in the small compound, away from where we were anyhow -- not that -- not [indecipherable] I’ve seen everybody, but I would have [indecipherable] I seen coming in, I would have seen very different type of person coming in, straggling in, decimated people.</span> <span id="s1356">We didn’t see those people, although we were liberated the same day --</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: Same day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: -- or so.</span> <span id="s1359">So anyway, the momentum that’s -- the scene was changing, the war scene was changing was evident, and was part of the discussion.</span> <span id="s1360">And that I do recall being there, participating, absorbing.</span> <span id="s1361">On again, on a daily, incremental basis.</span> <span id="s1362">By the end of it, you know what was happening.</span> <span id="s1363">And I recall the final days or so where the troops of the German Nazis were leaving, and for good luck threw hand grenades over the fence for us, for now a gift to us, who ducked and moved on.</span> <span id="s1364">But that’s already before we got it, that’s a good sign, because they’re good-bye, and good riddance.</span> <span id="s1365">So that was the approach towards the end of the war which changed the mood.</span> <span id="s1366">I think a lot of people -- and again I capture that indirectly being -- being there.</span> <span id="s1367">Right, I know exactly the details of what was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">Q: I -- I just -- as you were talking I realized that I didn’t -- I didn’t ask you when did you realize there was a war going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">A: In --</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">Q: Was it very late?</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">A: Late, yes.</span> <span id="s1372">In ter -- in tere --</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">Q: It was pretty late?</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: In Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: In Terezin, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: But part of it see, as I grew older and stood in that fence, that fence was a -- a part of my activity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">A: Right?</span> <span id="s1381">And that’s y-you hear people talking.</span> <span id="s1382">You overhear, so at -- at ’44, when I was eight plus, I was kind of understanding a little bit more about war, sides, Nazis, Germany, others.</span> <span id="s1383">People in -- when they lined up, and they had different -- [indecipherable] I overheard conversations, but I was part of it, eventually starts some [indecipherable] so I understood there was a war, and the Jews were targets and victims, because obviously we were -- most of them were Jews, okay?</span> <span id="s1384">And I hung around s -- the synagogues, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">Q: You hear a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">A: You hear -- hear this kind of s-story.</span> <span id="s1387">Whether I knew all the sophisticated details --</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">A: -- or not -- that’s irrelevant, but I knew there was a war, and I knew things were now suddenly being changed.</span> <span id="s1390">One side was losing, one side is gaining.</span> <span id="s1391">What it meant being, you know, who da -- who decides where -- obviously I was not fully in command of that, whether it was allied troops, or even the names of it, but that -- but there was a -- the Nazis, or the Germans, basically, versus other people, and that there’s a battle going on, and you know, you heard these reports about the airplanes flying, and sounds of bangs and booms, and people interpreting all of that, I -- I started ab-absorbing that, over time.</span> <span id="s1392">It wasn’t a one day event either, remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A: -- it was several weeks of time.</span> <span id="s1395">And I -- again, the fact there were more people at the fence than before, I didn’t know why, but it was a changed feature a-as well.</span> <span id="s1396">So that’s how I kind of participated in the approach of liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: When you started learning more, realizing that there’s a war, and hearing the guns, and somebody saying that the Nazis are doing things to the Jews -- wh -- however you heard it, did you start getting afraid then, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: No, it came in a good time, because it was th --</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: Because it was at the end?</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">A: It was the end, and people are saying we’re winning, or you know, we’re going to be freed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">A: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: So no -- no time for fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: Well, not no time for fear, just not -- was again, was n-not the highlight of what I was kind of taking in.</span> <span id="s1405">I was taking in about some war, and one side is going to lose, and these guys are going to get it, and they’re leaving, walking away -- way -- when people saw these trucks, or whatever it was, with [indecipherable] German soldiers running, the commentary was they’re surrendering, they’re escaping, they’re doing something.</span> <span id="s1406">Well, then you sense that these people, the bad people are going out of your life, you know?</span> <span id="s1407">It was not that dif -- kind of fear more than had it occurred in ’43, or ’44, when it was the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Q: Now, is there a period of time between when the Germans leave, and the Russians come, when it’s just all of you inmates in Terezin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">A: There was a short period, but again, only --</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">Q: Not in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A: Not -- not -- again, it wasn’t identified to me as a new period of, know, freedom or so.</span> <span id="s1412">I only sensed it by the number of people at that fence.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">A: That was growing, growing, more people were there.</span> <span id="s1415">People hanging around.</span> <span id="s1416">And you hear this [indecipherable] you know, we being -- going to be freed.</span> <span id="s1417">You understood what was happening, that end was coming.</span> <span id="s1418">And then, see these mass, you know, departures, it also was consistent.</span> <span id="s1419">So now the people -- question of when will [indecipherable] people most probably listen to some kind of radio or other features, then they -- that’s -- word spread amongst each other.</span> <span id="s1420">I was obviously not party to that.</span> <span id="s1421">And -- but it sounded more real that what other people were talking about, and I kind of integrated that into my absorption, whatever I was thinking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">A: You have to re-recollect that when I child hears things, it is not all as logical as what’s being presented, or as totally comprehensible.</span> <span id="s1424">But they ab -- do absorb a change of tone, a change of discussion topics, and that’s what I was capturing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1426">Did food change?</span> <span id="s1427">Did you still ge -- you still ate in the way you had before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">A: Same.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">Q: Same.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">A: As far as I’m aware, the same.</span> <span id="s1431">Not aware of any change.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">Q: Any change in that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">Q: Do you remember the Russians when they came?</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">Q: What was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">A: First of all, they came and obviously jubilant, you know.</span> <span id="s1438">Was a -- and the people themselves were kind of very excited and they handed out ci-cigarettes to people, and chocolates to people, I think to us, to kids, and in that respect they were very, quote, kind, and a breath of fresh air.</span> <span id="s1439">Right?</span> <span id="s1440">Soldiers who were friendly rather than soldiers who were guarding people who -- and people embraced them, and touched them, it was a different -- you saw that some whatever it was, new -- liberators, but that’s what -- that’s what they left the impression.</span> <span id="s1441">In that respect they were most pr -- most probably very good.</span> <span id="s1442">I did know, and I can see that image too, of rampaging through the barrack to the caserne of the -- you know, where people were crowded, and ripping off watches of women.</span> <span id="s1443">I saw that scene, apparently they also pillaged and raped, which I obviously did not see -- or not obviously, but I just didn’t see, or didn’t know what’s happening.</span> <span id="s1444">That’s later, but the grabbing off watches of people who somehow managed to retain them during the war period is -- was very kind of shocking to me.</span> <span id="s1445">But they di -- transformed very quickly, the role of the being behind the fences versus being free, and more movement.</span> <span id="s1446">I think the fence came down, or -- but we still had a fence, I remember was the -- suddenly you saw the German soldiers, whoever the -- whoever was in charge of the control mechanism in Theresienstadt were now being required to go with wheelbarrows and picking things up, and fixing things up, and breaking things down, and they were being beaten by some former German people who ta -- trying to put -- change their roles in order to get more privileges, and that was going on and people were cheering on and pointing out, you know, hit them harder, etcetera, this sort, get even with them.</span> <span id="s1447">So the -- again, that was a very different atmosphere what you saw before.</span> <span id="s1448">So that’s the Russians kind of influence, a very quick turnaround of the ones who were doing the Nazi work before, and now they became -- and we [indecipherable] was a little surprising to see these other naz -- Nazis, or Germans, and Germans beating up their compatriots, or so, and with full vigor, I mean, just reversed direction.</span> <span id="s1449">But that -- the transition from being occupied versus being liberated, and the change took [indecipherable] very, very quickly.</span> <span id="s1450">And very noticeable, and to -- very quick.</span> <span id="s1451">Now in May, the eighth, ninth, we were liberated, and by June already we were out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">A: Now, a lot of people didn’t make it to later.</span> <span id="s1454">There was a typhus epidemic, and again is a quarantine, but the most typhus epidemic took place in that other quarter where these other people who were in the death marches who made it, barely made it, ended up.</span> <span id="s1455">I don’t know whether in our particular compound, they did it by caserne to caserne, I don’t know what -- we were allowed to leave in June.</span> <span id="s1456">Again, some people say you couldn’t have left in June because there was a general quarantine.</span> <span id="s1457">Well, I know I left in June, you know, I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">A: I don’t care what the historian books say on that.</span> <span id="s1460">People verif -- generalize from the generic fact, and apply it to everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1462">So where did you all go?</span> <span id="s1463">And -- and who -- was it Leo who made the decision</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">A: No, no, no, no, no, no, what happened was after the war, there was a very st -- quick effort to identify, locate people who survived.</span> <span id="s1465">And whoever did this, might -- the Russians, or others, made a list of the survivors in tha -- in Theresienstadt, and people from different localities contacted the authorities somewhere, that was designated, maybe Red Cross [indecipherable] I don’t recall, obviously.</span> <span id="s1466">And we had relatives who survived the war in Holland, who were in hiding during the war, in the broadest [indecipherable] were kind of somewhat distant, but in the context of the time they very close to my family, partly they’re -- they were raised in the old country, very close in the same courtyard, effectively, so they were like very close cousins, brother, sister type relationship.</span> <span id="s1467">Anyhow, that relative knew that, you know, who was -- who were the Dutch relatives they had, and went around finding out in Westerbork most probably, with the Dutch authorities, where are the S-Sigmann family, my parents, my brothers and my sister and myself.</span> <span id="s1468">And eventually they found out that the only ones who are surviving from their records was us three.</span> <span id="s1469">And they got in touch with the Theresienstadt people, who went and got in touch with Malka Weinmann, and through us, and saying, oh, yo-you will come back, you have a place to go -- the people who were released from these camps had a -- a place to go.</span> <span id="s1470">We had a place to go because somebody was claiming us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: Had we not had that we would have been again, rerouted somewhere to a displaced persons camp, or hang around later in Theresienstadt, I don’t know what would have happened.</span> <span id="s1473">But since we had a relative who was putting a claim us and offered t-to come to them, we went with Malka Pollaczek, who also had a brother, and Alicia Farber, whose parents survived.</span> <span id="s1474">So she was reunited with her parents, so her parents were claiming her.</span> <span id="s1475">So we all went back on the train from Terezin to the American section, you know, Czechoslovakia kind of was split into different regions whoever liberated them.</span> <span id="s1476">One half was the Russians, one half was the Americans or the French, I think.</span> <span id="s1477">And we took a train from Terezin to Pilsen, and maybe took a plane from Pilsen to Amsterdam, I think a French plane, was probably a army transport plane.</span> <span id="s1478">And we stayed a few days or so with Malka Weinmann, because we were close to her.</span> <span id="s1479">And you ask what attachment, that was probably -- I -- we sensed that.</span> <span id="s1480">And well, a very different life suddenly, you know, plates, and tables, and food that we never had eaten before.</span> <span id="s1481">White bread was served, we thought it was cake, we refused to eat it as bread.</span> <span id="s1482">I had a tin can of anchovy paste, I don’t know whether you know what anchovy paste is, it was in a tin -- a tin little thing like toothpaste, imported [indecipherable] foods never crossed my lips.</span> <span id="s1483">Spent a few days over there, till they discussed with -- how to get us to these relatives, the Bergers, who themselves spent the war years separated from their children, daughter and son.</span> <span id="s1484">The daughter, son and parents were in three different locations, and they were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">Q: And they all survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">A: They survived, yes, they survived.</span> <span id="s1487">And then I rejoined living with them after, for one year or so, till other family members elsewhere in the world started looking for the Sigmann family, and locating us, and discovered we were the only survivors.</span> <span id="s1488">So we spent a year with the Bergers, and were a year in -- from June to July, or June of ni -- June to June, from ’45 to ’46, and being -- lived in Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">Q: And how was that for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">A: Again, they were very caring, and very warm, and very attentive to us, but they themselves had to reconstruct their lives, because they had a major interruption in their life.</span> <span id="s1491">So we took in the scene of reconstituting life, but was really more normal from what people were used to.</span> <span id="s1492">I mean, s-sitting at a table with the family rather than in a compound.</span> <span id="s1493">Cooking, baking, washing.</span> <span id="s1494">You know, th-this family, the Bergers, they were hidden by some nurses, single women who had worked in Indonesia before, and I think they lived at Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s1495">And they lived behind a partition wall for several years.</span> <span id="s1496">Couldn’t go out in daytime.</span> <span id="s1497">Didn’t know where their daughter and son was -- were.</span> <span id="s1498">Their daughter was too old to be hidden, but too young to be hidden, too, so she had had a quote, an Aryan appearance, so she worked for somebody in the outskirts of Amsterdam as a open house help, au pair.</span> <span id="s1499">It’s -- her name is Miriam.</span> <span id="s1500">And she was there, and -- very interesting story is that we -- we -- once we came back, and told us their -- their tale, and each one has his own tale of escape and saving.</span> <span id="s1501">But this girl, Miriam, mus-must have been around 16 maybe, by the end of the war, was in -- publicly hidden, and the people were very devout, Calvinist, or [indecipherable] most people did not e -- travel -- or com -- can’t do anything on a Sunday.</span> <span id="s1502">That when they later on came to visit us, visit us on Saturday in fact, apologized that we came on the sebbe -- Sabbath.</span> <span id="s1503">But they were very devout, they were very close to the family, but they were very good people, too.</span> <span id="s1504">They -- in order to -- they kept the fact that she was Jewish in hiding, or public hiding from their own children, so they couldn’t say very much, but they read the scriptures, and how the very devout Christians, and they tried to read the Scriptures associated with the holidays, to keep this girl informed about purink and how do the calendar, or what have you, but sh -- Passover, and Easter, often overlap, so they read this -- the -- the portion she told us about, it was kind of -- and they’re very nice people.</span> <span id="s1505">We met them after they came, they were very close.</span> <span id="s1506">But kind of seeing how people were coming out of the war, and what they went through, was both interesting, and it was very common.</span> <span id="s1507">Their son, who was a tall fellow, was in hiding in a little attic, in a little town up in -- in the country, again didn’t see daylight, public daylight for several years.</span> <span id="s1508">And he was an artist and he made wooden pins for the underground, emblems.</span> <span id="s1509">I believe that’s how he spent his time.</span> <span id="s1510">And so the reconstituting of life in Amsterdam was -- we were part of it, but we [indecipherable] we were visiting.</span> <span id="s1511">These Bergers are interesting people because they used to have a restaurant, kosher restaurant in Amsterdam, a very elegant one apparently, before the war, and they had pretty elegant dishes, and cutlery, but after the war their apartment was gone, all their belongings were gone.</span> <span id="s1512">They couldn’t -- they knew who they gave it, they couldn’t get it back, even because they survived.</span> <span id="s1513">People denied, apparently that they had received anything.</span> <span id="s1514">They had to start from scratch, in very small quarters, we lived in very, very small quarters.</span> <span id="s1515">There was no shower or bathtub in the house.</span> <span id="s1516">We had a little metal bathtub that we -- I was a little boy, I was able to use, other people used most probably too, and we went to public baths.</span> <span id="s1517">This was the life.</span> <span id="s1518">But for them it was a -- happy to survive, but was a big setback of their lifestyle to what they had to live through, and remember that.</span> <span id="s1519">Of course they would -- had the restaurant before, they’re still -- so they’re getting the old customers coming back, come and eat.</span> <span id="s1520">Some widowers, or single people, lost their family.</span> <span id="s1521">So they used to come in the evening and se -- were served things.</span> <span id="s1522">Whether they paid or not, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1523">But they kind of resumed the sort of role [indecipherable] that was their past life, and lot of war stories were coming around the table.</span> <span id="s1524">You know, sort of hearing these things, the -- we were kind of a special case, now we had one experience, people had very different experience.</span> <span id="s1525">The hiding, some survived, but only, you know, one person.</span> <span id="s1526">And some people were traumatized, and completely troubled.</span> <span id="s1527">And I remember one man, he used to come to visit [indecipherable] Berger to talk or his despair -- despair.</span> <span id="s1528">And I remember he was a very sad person, and he really -- when that man came in in the evening, we would kind of shoot out of the room, the small quarters.</span> <span id="s1529">And a month or so later we learned he committed suicide.</span> <span id="s1530">So those kind of things, you k -- that was the ac -- different things were going on in Amsterdam, it was -- it was not a normal return to life, again.</span> <span id="s1531">These people, the Bergers, at this restaurant, also kept kosher, obviously.</span> <span id="s1532">And basically ate dairy, because they didn’t have any dishes and cutlery for meat, and moreover, meat was very scarce anyhow, because that time the only meat you could get, kosher meat was in cans, preserved.</span> <span id="s1533">But because of their hospitality reputation, and restaurant reputation, the soldiers in the Jewish brigade, who passed through Holland from Canada, or from England, stopped in ou -- those who kept kosher, stayed in their house, or ate in their house.</span> <span id="s1534">But they brought their rations over to the Bergers, so the only time we ate meat was to eat those rations the first time, after many years eating meat.</span> <span id="s1535">But didn’t have enough cutlery, or -- and no plates.</span> <span id="s1536">So the cans were warmed up on the stove, and we passed around the can and this cutlery in order to eat.</span> <span id="s1537">That’s the kind of -- for them it must have been a terribly painful contrast after being a elegant restaurant with all the trappings of a restaurant, having to serve their own in this way.</span> <span id="s1538">But they made -- they made the transition, we’ll open up another restaurant a number of years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">Q: They did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">A: Oh yes, yes, in Scheveningen, of all places.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A: Yes, and then that -- then they moved to Israel, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: So, you know, I’m trying to convey that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">A: -- I was absorbing a complete new s -- and I was getting older, I was able to record that mentally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">A: And that became part of my ex -- post-war experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">Q: Did you, within a short period of time say, where are our parents, or did you have a se --</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">A: No, I was told --</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">Q: Yo-You were told.</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A: -- I wa -- I was -- I was told that we lost our parents, they died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">Q: You were told that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">A: Whatever that meant --</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">Q: Uh huh.</span> <span id="s1556">Meant, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">A: -- in the long run, that was not a issue.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1559">And were you told that once you had left Theresienstadt, or do you -- do you have any recollection?</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">A: No, I think already most probably before, because when we got that postcard from the train, in discussions with my brother and sister, whenever it may have come up, I think I had it already a general sense --</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">A: -- that I have no longer my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">A: But after the war, when you hear other stories of -- people’s life stories of losing a husband, a wife, children, then I realized that -- where I fit it in, that I also lost parents.</span> <span id="s1565">I was part of the group of people who went through the war, some went through in hiding, be -- people in groups, some were in hiding.</span> <span id="s1566">Some were in this camp, some were in that camp, some were in convents.</span> <span id="s1567">And I was in two camps, and some people lost -- or didn’t lose, and I lost.</span> <span id="s1568">So eventually I fit it in to my category, and -- but that was a pretty dynamic -- I use the word dynamic selectively, seeing people were really -- had to re-establish themself, that some people could make it.</span> <span id="s1569">And also it was very much evident people want get out of Europe as -- or Holland as fast as possible, many people, they -- the first opportunity to get out, and especially the children.</span> <span id="s1570">They sh --</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">Q: Especially children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">A: There -- they -- once they get their [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">Q: Children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">A: -- out of the country, out of Europe.</span> <span id="s1575">Not a good place to be.</span> <span id="s1576">Partly out of memory, but partly out of experience.</span> <span id="s1577">So it was a sizeable exodus.</span> <span id="s1578">Felt wa -- was -- weren’t too many people who survived, okay?</span> <span id="s1579">But there was a noticeable exodus of people who left to England, people who left to isr -- Palestine.</span> <span id="s1580">And some people stayed.</span> <span id="s1581">And some elderly parents -- pa -- no -- reluctantly but willingly encouraged their children to leave.</span> <span id="s1582">And some people couldn’t stop the children that want to get out of there as fast as possible.</span> <span id="s1583">And that a -- again, I absorbed that part of the scene.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1585">We need to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">End of Tape #5</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">Tape #6</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">Q: Charles, did you want to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">A: I did leave, as you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">Q: I know.</span> <span id="s1591">I know you did, I wanted to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">A: Right, but for different reasons than what was occurring.</span> <span id="s1593">Th -- when I say people who were eager to leave were the older people [indecipherable] not sure, take these two children of my relatives, Bergers, Miriam and Manfred, they got out as fast, but they wanted to leave right away, I mean they were -- imagine not being with their parents for several years, and May, June they see them, and they wanted to get out, on -- go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1594">The parents did not -- were not encouraging that right away, but reluctantly they yielded, so right after the high holidays, they left on the illegal transport, where they were put in Cypress, they ga -- had a long journey.</span> <span id="s1595">But -- so that age bracket and above, there was a much greater personal decision to leave Europe, or leave Netherlands.</span> <span id="s1596">They both went to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1597">One of them there right now.</span> <span id="s1598">The tragedy was that the brother ended up in Palestine.</span> <span id="s1599">When the state was established, he was in the army, and he was killed by a convoy in the protection of Jerusalem during the War of Independence.</span> <span id="s1600">Was just -- had just become engaged to a beautiful Yemenite girl, and so now that’s -- the family had to absorb that loss after being spared the other hurdles of the war, ended up a victim in Palestine - Israel.</span> <span id="s1601">Parents not fully reverc -- recovered from that wound, whereas the war wounds were healing, that wound kind of was pretty difficult for them to deal with.</span> <span id="s1602">But other people also were leaving.</span> <span id="s1603">And in contrast to the pre-war, which I don’t recall too much, Westerbork or Terezin, there I did have friends.</span> <span id="s1604">I visited homes like in more normal circumstances.</span> <span id="s1605">But again, it was somewhat temporary, because people I dealt with, they moved out to other countries suddenly, okay?</span> <span id="s1606">And myself also left.</span> <span id="s1607">But it was a different -- but I do know the names of people who were there.</span> <span id="s1608">We joined the youth organization, I think it was the precursor of Bnei Akiva.</span> <span id="s1609">My brother was older, he was allowed to join, I tagged along with him, and given that was much choice, not too many other children around, they let me come.</span> <span id="s1610">And we went to hikes and activities.</span> <span id="s1611">So we had a little more normal type of event, of youth organizations that obviously you didn’t have before, and some of the names of the people from that period I still know by name.</span> <span id="s1612">And I’ve discovered recently one is in t -- married, you know, with families in Toronto, and one lives in Israel, and one here, one no longer lives.</span> <span id="s1613">But that kind of life became more normalized.</span> <span id="s1614">I went to school in Amsterdam, Jewish school, and es -- had special studies, Jewish studies in either synagogue, with people.</span> <span id="s1615">So it kind of -- but even those teachers started leaving.</span> <span id="s1616">We had the teacher, and the middle of the year they went to England.</span> <span id="s1617">Of course, it was not a -- people weren’t on the firm ground, or so.</span> <span id="s1618">So we -- I -- when I left, it was not unnatural for me to leave, because that’s what other people were doing for all kinds of reasons, which I may not have been fully aware.</span> <span id="s1619">But it was not my decision, of sorts, because my other relatives, who were closer in relative ranking that the Bergers, my father’s brother lived the United States, and they were also related to the Bergers so they were in touch, wanted us to join him.</span> <span id="s1620">And my mother’s sister in Zurich wanted us to join them.</span> <span id="s1621">So we were wanted, but we were kind of being pulled in two different directions.</span> <span id="s1622">And the decision was that the two boys would go to New York, and the girl would go to Zurich.</span> <span id="s1623">Whether that’s wi -- wise decision or not is not for me to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">Q: Who -- who made that decision, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">A: The relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">Q: Ah, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">A: I mean, both had a loo -- a genuine eagerness to want to absorb us, and you know, take care of us as children without parents.</span> <span id="s1628">And they decided, not to divide the spoils, but they thought that boys would be better off in education, particularly Jewish education in United States, and the girl would fit in better in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1629">My aunt had a -- uncle had a dress store, an elegant dress store, and she could perhaps work her way into that.</span> <span id="s1630">But anyway, we were split, which my sister to this day finds horrendous.</span> <span id="s1631">And she found it very surprising that it was proposed and implemented.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">Q: Wasn’t it difficult for the three of you to split like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">A: It was difficult, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1634">And especially those were days where na -- ba -- people didn’t have telephone conversations, you know, you wrote to each other, kept in touch that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">Q: But she of course, remains even more alone.</span> <span id="s1636">You are split, but you’re still with the one --</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">A: I have a brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">Q: You have a brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">A: Exactly, exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">Q: And he -- she goes into -- did she know these folks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">Q: Not -- no --</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">A: No --</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">Q: -- these are strangers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">A: -- well, well, my -- my uncle from Switzerland, that’s the -- my aunt -- my si -- mother’s sister’s husband came to visit us in ’46, okay?</span> <span id="s1646">Very nice, brought clothing and candy and treated us, and -- very nice, and told us about the family linkages, and all of that, and so it was either total stranger -- we knew the name of the family, the -- these -- okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">Q: [indecipherable] but this was not someone close that you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">A: We hadn’t dealt with them in years, obviously.</span> <span id="s1649">And the United States family, all I knew was my father’s brother, my uncle.</span> <span id="s1650">But I had never seen him.</span> <span id="s1651">I don’t think my brother saw him either.</span> <span id="s1652">And they were again, far away, the United States was far, far away.</span> <span id="s1653">So that was a new change in our life status of being separated, moved away from Holland, and a new stage of our life had to begin.</span> <span id="s1654">But again, the intentions certainly were well-intentioned.</span> <span id="s1655">Whether is was appropriate under the circumstances, but that set the course for our lives, and with the ca -- impl -- consequence.</span> <span id="s1656">My sister married somebody from Switzerland, we ended up in United States.</span> <span id="s1657">And were raised over there by my uncle and aunt, who were very generous to absorb two more children in a household of six children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">Q: They had six?</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">A: They had six.</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">A: And raised us effectively under their auspices, so I’m certainly appreciative --</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">Q: And this was in New York City?</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">A: In New York City.</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">Q: Did he remind you of your father at all?</span> <span id="s1665">Was there any -- anything that struck you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">A: Mm, I -- wa -- that -- my memory of my father was vague.</span> <span id="s1667">I -- my -- the only memory of my father is this -- the last scene, sitting on his lap with tefillin on his head.</span> <span id="s1668">That’s not a association, that’s a picture, a photograph.</span> <span id="s1669">No, I don’t -- I was too young to make that sort of linkage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">Q: Did you get along with the other six kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">A: Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">Q: They didn’t -- they didn’t mind two more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">A: Not -- no, they were kind.</span> <span id="s1676">I mean [indecipherable] me, I was another refugee, and the immigrant, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">Q: Green.</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">A: -- kid who went through the war.</span> <span id="s1679">Went through the war.</span> <span id="s1680">So, of a helpful, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">A: -- no, and some of the children were closer in my age, so I could relate to them, and some were close to my brother.</span> <span id="s1683">They fi -- we fitted in after awhile, and at the time we were arrive already, the older children kind of were started to move out of the house.</span> <span id="s1684">So, the family was not as large on a daily basis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">A: It still was large, I mean, and totally appreciative obviously that I had a home.</span> <span id="s1687">Because otherwise, you know, that’s a big problem after the war, people were homeless.</span> <span id="s1688">Some people had, you know, lost their parents, and their siblings, or what have you, and nowhere to go.</span> <span id="s1689">And their immediate, or s -- distant relatives were also killed during the war, so I was relatively better off.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1691">Did y -- when did you learn English, when you came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">Q: So you -- what -- did you speak a common language in the household before you learned English?</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">A: Well, they spoke German, I understood German.</span> <span id="s1695">I don’t know where exactly I learned German, but I learned German somewhere along the line.</span> <span id="s1696">Of course, at home we did not speak German, Dutch was -- probably -- the parents spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1697">But that was a common language, and then I start --</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">Q: What did you think of New York?</span> <span id="s1699">It’s so dir -- I mean, Amsterdam is small, very quaint.</span> <span id="s1700">New York is huge, massive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">A: Oh, it was very massive, oh yes, it was very massive.</span> <span id="s1702">And the whole -- well, generally, after the war, a lot of things were brand new for me.</span> <span id="s1703">I mean, the food was brand new.</span> <span id="s1704">I had eaten -- I had not eaten oranges till I -- I think got in the -- either in Amsterdam or got in the plane and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">A: -- of -- or so.</span> <span id="s1707">When I came off the boat, came here on the boat, people offered me a banana, I didn’t know how to open it.</span> <span id="s1708">I mean, it’s a strange food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">Q: Course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">A: Or so -- so, y -- generally even in Holland after the war, there were all kinds of new ec -- experiences or so, about food, or otherwise.</span> <span id="s1711">I remember with my bo -- my uncle from Switzerland, who took us out and treated us to vanilla ice cream.</span> <span id="s1712">And the pungency of that vanilla taste is still in my mouth, I mean, I just -- it’s very different today, doesn’t have the same intensity of taste, but it was a very strong taste, a flavor which I never had, or don’t recall, I may have had it when I was five or six.</span> <span id="s1713">But from five to six to nine was a long time.</span> <span id="s1714">So those things kind of, you know, were all sensations that we experienced.</span> <span id="s1715">There was an ho -- another interesting thing was I was saying of -- people were kind of coming out of the woodwork in some sense.</span> <span id="s1716">The people who were in hiding got out right away, from the camps.</span> <span id="s1717">Those who had a place to go had right away -- some straggled in, depends where they were kept, in which camp.</span> <span id="s1718">So it was an ongoing process of people coming, and eventually people leaving.</span> <span id="s1719">Was a lot of young people, particularly children had to be taken out of convents or hiding places, and was a big battle sometimes, you know, older sisters f -- survived.</span> <span id="s1720">[indecipherable] little sister was in the convent in Belgium, went through the effort, identified everything [indecipherable] and that little girl refused to come.</span> <span id="s1721">Again, in this Berger household we had a lot of traffic, but people -- there was a home, people came across.</span> <span id="s1722">So I in some sense absorbed more of that than I would have otherwise.</span> <span id="s1723">And I remember those two sisters finally successful in getting out, this whole discussion of getting their little sister out, finally getting their sister out, and the sister rebellious, she wants to go back to the sisters in Belgium, rather than the sisters in Holland.</span> <span id="s1724">And I think eventually she had -- had -- had to yield it, they got -- bring her back.</span> <span id="s1725">You know, the chief rabbi of Israel, Rabbi Herzog went through country to country, also through Holland, trying to save those children, invoking his position in dealing with the clergy, and the church.</span> <span id="s1726">And had very great difficult time, I remember him there with his top hat, and making, you know, talking about his experiences.</span> <span id="s1727">That was an event.</span> <span id="s1728">So, it was -- th-the post-war reconstitution was very much an activity of the country, of the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s1729">And therefore was a lot of activity and movement, and was not a -- you know, a stable community, were never -- never really became stable, because Holland as you know, lost a very high proportion of it’s Jewish population.</span> <span id="s1730">Underestimated the people talk about [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1731">The interesting little side story, my relative, my uncle -- I call him uncle, he was a Berger, had a brother in Palestine, who was a -- a shoe store.</span> <span id="s1732">And one day he sent a crate of Yaffa oranges to him.</span> <span id="s1733">And that was a communion celebration, they handed out these oranges as prizes to people, and everybody took those -- an orange for their entire family.</span> <span id="s1734">And there was the biggest gift they could ever dream of after going through the war, of getting something from Palestine, a Yaffa orange.</span> <span id="s1735">So, I remember we got one too, and it was something, you know, unique.</span> <span id="s1736">So a lot of feelings were going on in the country, which today people have much less -- they take a lot of things for granted.</span> <span id="s1737">Every -- every -- ev -- all these events became events rather than, you know, part of a routine life.</span> <span id="s1738">So it was, in some sense, quote, exciting.</span> <span id="s1739">Because things were really appearing, and I was -- as I was getting older, I was a -- absorbing these things much more than anything before [indecipherable] certainly I was a little boy, but already approaching 10 - 11, to move on there.</span> <span id="s1740">So carry back interesting memories of the year in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">Q: W-Was there any schooling during that year, or</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">A: Yes [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">Q: There was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">A: There was schooling, in a Jewish school, and I got -- there got my formal teaching, arithmetic, and geography, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">Q: So you were finally getting some subjects that you hadn’t at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">A: Yes, absolutely, and sp -- Dutch grammar, and m-more formal instruction, and also Jewish supplementary education as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">Q: Did you enjoy it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1751">I mean had [indecipherable] fortunately I had no learning disability or learning problem, and most probably I wasn’t the only one who had the shortcoming of lack of education, cause pe -- similar people that were my age must have had something similar, didn’t go to school during the war.</span> <span id="s1752">So it may have been, you know, equal peer class.</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">A: Like, I never thought of it in these terms, but my -- I -- I went to do what s-s-sc -- students have to do.</span> <span id="s1755">And so anyway, we went to the United States, a long route, because The Joint was involved in transporting people from one country to another, and so it was a torturous trip to go from Holland to Antwerp, to end up in Marseilles on the buses and trains, or so, and in fact I saved The Joint, I think, a big bundle because one of the stops, one of the night st -- overnight stops was a U.S. army camp, and we’re supposed to stay one night then go on to the next stop and go to whatever quarters we were supposed to go.</span> <span id="s1756">They have a whole group, not only us, I mean a bunch of children.</span> <span id="s1757">And I became violently sick in that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">Q: First time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">A: First time.</span> <span id="s1760">The odors of the mess hall were so powerful that I actually couldn’t take it.</span> <span id="s1761">I became sick, and vomiting, and fever and all of that.</span> <span id="s1762">I may have had other problems, too.</span> <span id="s1763">So the com-commander of the camp was very upset that somebody became sick under his reign.</span> <span id="s1764">So he told people to stay till I become healthy.</span> <span id="s1765">But they kne -- they knew our travelogue, or itinerary, and he kept us there till we able to go to the boat to Marseilles.</span> <span id="s1766">So I think The Joint saved a big bundle, for again, strange reasons.</span> <span id="s1767">And they took a -- took a boat to the United States, a long journey.</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">Q: A cargo boat, or an actual --</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">A: No, it was a boat that was used for the U.S. army originally, for -- so it was not a -- a cruise boat, but it had berths for people to sleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">Q: Sleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">A: So, it was a long trip, with a storm in the oceans --</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">Q: Get sea sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1774">Seriously.</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">Q: It’s terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">A: It was a terrible day, it was a terrible day.</span> <span id="s1777">It was a Saturday in fact it was, and we’re up on the deck and vomiting, etcetera.</span> <span id="s1778">And well, that’s what the [indecipherable] kind of, then a new stage of life, which -- come to the United States, and be absorbed in a new family.</span> <span id="s1779">And schooling over there, and then things became uphill.</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">Q: You -- you adjust rather quickly, though, don’t you, usually, to circumstances, somehow --</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">A: Apparently I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">Q: -- it seems.</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">A: Apparently I do, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">Q: E-Easier than Leo, your older brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">A: I would say most probably.</span> <span id="s1786">Yes, I think he took things more for -- he must -- may have been more aware than I was what’s happening around him, so he took a little more difficult.</span> <span id="s1787">I do make the -- I did make the adjustments reasonably well.</span> <span id="s1788">In fact, I talked to a survivor, and really there are two stages of survival, one is survive the war, another one is survive the post-war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">Q: Post-war, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">A: And I did, thank God, both.</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">Q: And what was -- what was the name of the family, I know the last name was Siegman, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">A: Siegman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">Q: -- they spelled it differently than you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">A: [indecipherable] right, our original name was Sigmann, S-i-g-m-m -- m-a-n-n.</span> <span id="s1795">That was the family name.</span> <span id="s1796">When my uncle, Mendel Siegman came to United States, they changed it to S-i-e-g-m-a-n, because double n is always -- was regarded as a European legacy, I don’t know how he knew that, or whoever it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">A: -- but that’s how it was.</span> <span id="s1799">So when we came to United States, rather than having in the family, same household, Sigmann and sig -- Siegman, we took on their name, but eventually it had to be changed when I became a citizen, formally, because my -- my passport, original passport from Holland to United States was S-i-g-m-a-n-n.</span> <span id="s1800">That’s how I was registered.</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">A: But the difference in the spelling is not that great, so we took it on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">Q: Why did they change the name to S-i-e?</span> <span id="s1804">Why not S-i-g-m-a-n, do you have any idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">A: No, I think it sounds -- zi -- see, in the German pronunciation was Ziegman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">Q: Ziegman, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1808">And zieg is i -- is a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1811">So they only changed the double n, but I wasn’t -- again, I was not there when it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">Q: Did you call him uncle all the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">A: Uncle, yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">Q: And his wife, aunt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">A: His wife Aunt Susie, yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1816">We knew that we, know, were not part of the original family, we were old enough that -- I mean, that -- had it been, you know, five years earlier, may have been different story, you know?</span> <span id="s1817">So we kept our family identity, but we were certainly part of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">A: Siegman family, and raised under their guidance and support, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">Q: And -- and how many years before you saw Lily again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">A: I saw Lily again in 1960.</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">A: A long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">Q: Long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">A: She had moved to Israel, 1951, I think, married, had a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">Q: Oh, so she -- she left fairly soon from that family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">A: She left fairly soon, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1828">She went down Aliyah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">Q: So she must have been six -- 16 or 17 when she left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">A: Around that time, 16 - 17, right, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s1832">So she must have been unhappy in some way, no?</span> <span id="s1833">I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">A: I don’t want to speak for her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">Q: You don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">A: I mean, I don’t want to put an [indecipherable] on her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">Q: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">A: But she wanted to go to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">Q: To Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">A: Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">A: And then she had met somebody, but she wasn’t married when she left -- who was also going to Israel.</span> <span id="s1843">And soon after, they married in Israel, and settled there.</span> <span id="s1844">But 1960 -- meanwhile we were in touch through letter writing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">Q: Yes, I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">A: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">Q: But he -- here you -- you all grow up --</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">Q: -- and you’re adults now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1851">No, it was a big change.</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">Q: Big change, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">A: Big change, but interesting, there was a lot of personal chemistry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">A: Oh yes, we retained, oh yes, because of our letter writing, and somehow it went through together.</span> <span id="s1856">When I visited her 1960, was immediately back to where we left off, whatever that word means.</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1858">That’s fabulous.</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">A: And this -- and the same thing was true with this daughter Berger.</span> <span id="s1860">I hadn’t seen her -- well, that’s [indecipherable] right.</span> <span id="s1861">I hadn’t seen her from 1946, when she left after the -- 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">Q: Until -- until --</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">A: Well, then I saw her in happene when I visited Holland on 1960, then to Israel, too, I met her again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">A: But we started off where we left off.</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">Q: The same thing, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1868">And now too, when we meet or so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">A: -- we have a much more sense of belonging to the same family or so, than -- or -- although we have very different paths, different experiences since then, but we still have a lot in common.</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">Q: Did you feel you divided culturally when you were here?</span> <span id="s1872">Or were you young enough so that you soon became a kind of American kid?</span> <span id="s1873">Do you have that -- do you have any --</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">A: Well, now it took getting used to, I mean, but people acclimate when they -- first of all, want to acclimate quickly.</span> <span id="s1875">I came in with the Berger family, was -- they didn’t want to send us with old, ragged clothes so they went out -- out of the way to buy new wool suit for us, with the knickers, pants or so.</span> <span id="s1876">That’s how I arrived United States, but it was not stylish here, and I disposed of them very quickly, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">A: And I started wearing, you know, American type clothing, and so I -- I -- the language took a little longer.</span> <span id="s1879">I was in some sense fortunate again under the circumstances that I was raised in a neighborhood in the West Side, where there were a lot of immigrants, too.</span> <span id="s1880">Urban families who so -- survived the war, or came pre-war, so it was not coming into middle America.</span> <span id="s1881">Was partly European, and West Side in general is very cosmopolitan.</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">Q: Now where in the West Side were you?</span> <span id="s1883">Lower West?</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">A: No, the upper -- upper West Side.</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">Q: A hundred --</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">A: 88th Street.</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">Q: Oh, 88th, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">A: West -- on the West End Avenue.</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">A: So -- and the synagogue we went to was again, familiar territory, and so it was at -- that cultural change was not as dramatic had it been otherwise, what some people went through.</span> <span id="s1891">But the language and the clothing you saw this, you want to be, you know, like everybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">A: So I had to learn quickly.</span> <span id="s1894">And up to a point, the children in school were kind to me, because again, there -- that was [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1895">I was a refugee, went through the war, whatever that meant, no parents.</span> <span id="s1896">That’s -- some were sensitive, some were not, but on the whole, they had experienced that too, because the school that I went to, they had -- I was the first one who was -- they had [indecipherable] seen this before, so it was interesting.</span> <span id="s1897">A kind of interesting story was that when -- it was I learned how to play one of the sports, and, you know, and be one of the boys or so, so in the courtyard during recess, the kids played punchball.</span> <span id="s1898">You know what a punchball is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">A: [indecipherable] a pink Spaulding -- Spaulding --</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1902">A: -- punching [indecipherable] baseball with base -- with a Spaulding.</span> <span id="s1903">And everybody had to be chosen for the team, that was the rule, so I was chosen as well on one of the teams, but I was useless because I didn’t know what the game was all about, didn’t understand the language or the instructions, what people screaming about.</span> <span id="s1904">And my luck was that a guy, the other team hits the -- punches the ball right to me, and I miss it, and people started jeering and screaming.</span> <span id="s1905">And then one young kid, young little fellow with black eyes, remember his name, got up and scolded the kids.</span> <span id="s1906">This boy went through the war, etcetera, lost his parents, etcetera.</span> <span id="s1907">If you [indecipherable] with him, you’ll never get it -- never hear it again, the end of it.</span> <span id="s1908">And then suddenly I was part of the team, and people accepted me.</span> <span id="s1909">So it was a good lesson, people learned I was so -- I mean, the kind of [indecipherable] fact I recite it indicates that I remember it favorably.</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">Q: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1911">A: But it was a need to be, you know, integrated in the small and the big.</span> <span id="s1912">But again, my transition was a little bit better than it cou -- it could have been much worse.</span> <span id="s1913">Wasn’t -- for me it was a gradual transition to the American scene, because the rest of the people around me were also heavily from immigrant families.</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1915">We have to stop the tape and change it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">End of Tape #6</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">Tape #7</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">Q: Charles, what did your uncle do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">A: He was in the diamond business.</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">A: Wholesaler.</span> <span id="s1922">But originally when he came to the United States, he was in textiles in Europe, and he had to start a new business, of course, ca -- can’t do textiles over here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">A: Was difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">Q: And where did he come from, did he -- from Poland?</span> <span id="s1926">Przemysl?</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">A: He came from -- was born in Przemysl as well, and lived in Frankfurt, and lived in Antwerp.</span> <span id="s1928">And he managed to escape with his family, quite an ordeal, and quite a story, if you want to hear a -- what’s called a flight story, I recommend you speak to his son.</span> <span id="s1929">A remarkable story, how they managed to go through enemy territory, through France, back to Belgium, through Casablanca, to the United States, with being separated, and my aunt being pregnant, and having a -- he had -- my uncle had his -- my grandmother, his mother with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">A: And down the line, I mean, quite a story how they ma -- how they made it, how they were not driving cars, and [indecipherable] had to hire a car for at that time, for five children and two adults in Europe, a truck or so, and use your wits about it.</span> <span id="s1932">Is -- if you -- I don’t know if you have any flight documentary -- documentation, but it’s a remarkable story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1933">Q: So you -- what grade to you start when you start school there, since you seem to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">A: Well, since I had a year in Holland --</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">A: -- I was not as much back, so f -- had -- technically I had -- give me credit for one year for Holland, and the second year over there.</span> <span id="s1937">So when I came to the United States, they put me into fourth grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1939">So you’re actually pretty much where you should be.</span></p> <p><span id="s1940">A: No, no, I was -- no -- no, no.</span> <span id="s1941">I came to United States in ’46, when I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1943">A: -- okay?</span> <span id="s1944">I should have been really in the fifth grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">Q: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">A: So I’m -- I spent, I think a few months in the fourth grade, and I was promoted to the fifth grade.</span> <span id="s1947">Where I was more sensitive, I wanted to be where I belonged, somehow.</span> <span id="s1948">That -- and I fortunately caught up soon enough that I did not have to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1949">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">A: -- you know, carry that, being behind, whatever that meant, for a long period.</span> <span id="s1951">But the year in Holland was pretty good for me.</span> <span id="s1952">I think it was in Holland, it was in Holland, it was in the third grade they put me.</span> <span id="s1953">So, oddly enough, my arithmetic was better than peop --</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">Q: I’m not surprised.</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">A: -- than the kids over here --</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">Q: The kids here, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">A: -- were, and so I was -- I -- I did all right in schooling, and yet managed to catch up quick enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1959">And you went to high school on the upper West Side as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1963">I went after one year in upper West Side for a kind of day school, I went to Yeshiva in the East Side.</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">A: By the sixth grade.</span> <span id="s1966">And went through high school there as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">Q: And then where did you go to s -- college?</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">A: Then I went to City College in the evening.</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1970">And you worked during the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">A: Part time, and studied in the morning, and the evening -- I worked in the afternoon, I went to evening college.</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">Q: And what were you doing as work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">A: I was -- afternoon I was teaching in Hebrew school, and one semester I worked in the medical library.</span> <span id="s1974">I went into evening school, and got my degree, and then went for graduate studies, Columbia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">Q: In economics?</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">A: Economics.</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">Q: And h -- how did that interest grow?</span> <span id="s1978">Were you always interested in economics, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">A: No, I mean, no it actually was through exposure primarily, the choices that -- some subject matters I was more interested in compared with others, and I was challenged by th -- the bottom line is I had the most difficulty with economics, that’s why I went for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1982">The other courses went much easier.</span> <span id="s1983">I thought originally of going into international relations, or so and was -- had easy street, I got A’s, and you know, just coasting through it, and economics I had to think, had to read.</span> <span id="s1984">So, I decided --</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">Q: So you wanted the challenge --</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">A: I wa -- I wanted to understand it, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">A: I went through a -- I went through economics, on to graduate and -- as a major in graduate studies as well, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">Q: And you got a PhD?</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">A: Co -- all but dissertation.</span> <span id="s1991">And worked toward the university for -- or college for nine years, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">Q: At Swarthmore?</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">A: Swa -- first at City College for nine years, and then Swarthmore for five years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1995">And when did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">A: 1962, in Montreal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1997">Q: So when you went to is -- no, this is after you went to Israel for the first time and saw your sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s1998">A: After, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">Q: Uh-huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s2001">By chance, my wife was in Israel the same summer when I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2002">Q: No kidding?</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">A: And we did meet, but I didn’t know who she was at that time, so two years [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">Q: So where did you meet her?</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">A: On the street with a group, she was with a group of youngsters, and I knew some people in that group.</span> <span id="s2006">So I had a conversation, which she recalls, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2007">Q: That’s funny.</span> <span id="s2008">And you met in Canada?</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">A: In New York, she was in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">Q: In New York, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">A: And the rest is all good history.</span> <span id="s2012">Much, much more favorable chapter.</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">Q: She had a good -- she had a better history than you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">A: Yes, yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s2015">She was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">Q: Cause she was here, she was here?</span></p> <p><span id="s2017">A: She lived in Montreal.</span> <span id="s2018">She was raised in Montreal --</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2020">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2021">A: -- and her parents had been there for -- way before the war, so she did not personally experience, nor did her parents --</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">A: -- directly.</span> <span id="s2024">Her parents lost --</span></p> <p><span id="s2025">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s2026">The plane, I’m so -- yes, okay.</span> <span id="s2027">It’s the first time we’ve had a plane, okay.</span> <span id="s2028">Yes, she comes from Montreal, yes?</span> <span id="s2029">She was raised in Montreal?</span></p> <p><span id="s2030">A: Mont -- raised Montreal, and did not have direct experience with the Holocaust, although her parents, her mother did lose some sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s2031">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2032">A: In Poland, who left -- who remained there.</span> <span id="s2033">So she had a more normal upbringing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2034">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">A: And that -- also the good chapters in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s2037">With four children.</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">A: Four children, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">Q: A boy and three girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">A: -- I have nice grandchildren, and a lot of, you know, happy days and times and -- and of rewards for surviving.</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s2042">D-Do you, when you look back on the times after the war, do you see a lot of ways in which what happened to you affected you, or is that really very difficult to parse out?</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">A: Well, it’s -- definitely the war experience is engraved into me.</span> <span id="s2044">I mean, I know, I went through the war, I know I lost my parents and two brothers.</span> <span id="s2045">So I’m very sensitized to the Shoah and what happened, part because I lived through it, in my own way.</span> <span id="s2046">I was not as directly affected like some other people went through hell.</span> <span id="s2047">I did not have, you know, my -- any numbers carved into me.</span> <span id="s2048">And I was not beaten up physically, or so, but I certainly am a victim of not -- of having had a lost childhood.</span> <span id="s2049">I mean that never -- right?</span> <span id="s2050">I knew I was different, but [indecipherable] and the younger ages when I came United States, I knew I was not the same everybody else.</span> <span id="s2051">Other people had parents, other people had normal memories, I had no pictures of my childhood, I had very few concrete episodes, no family vacations, except for I went back, you know, to the beach story, but -- so I -- I know I was different, and I was at a young age is especially more sensitive.</span> <span id="s2052">Once you get married and have children, you join another category of life.</span> <span id="s2053">I was more with a similar group, but the issue where you come from, whether it was raised, or -- know, specifically, or underlying, people talk about experiences which I could never talk about.</span> <span id="s2054">Or show pictures, or something of this sort, so that respect it affected me, or so, over time I th -- I’m sure that my sensitivities about the world events or so, must have some roots in my experience as well.</span> <span id="s2055">I don’t want to link everything who I am, I do -- I don’t want to sou -- I never wanted to, I don’t intend to psychoanalyze myself, of you know, my behavior or good deeds, or bad deeds, or good habits or bad habits are attributed to the war, and I don’t feel that I have to glean who I am, or attribute who I am to the war experience.</span> <span id="s2056">I am who I am with that being part of me, but it’s -- certainly it’s a very central part of my memory of -- or so, though fortunately, since 1945, many other events have happened, I mean good events have happened, that they have receded, okay, proportionately of my life, I have the good life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2057">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">A: Okay?</span> <span id="s2059">But that doesn’t eliminate --</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">A: -- what I went through, and awareness of it.</span> <span id="s2062">I’m a different person, of course, of what I went through.</span> <span id="s2063">How different, in which ways, very difficult to pinpoint.</span> <span id="s2064">Obviously, I mean [indecipherable] I’d never come to the United States, I mean, that’s [indecipherable] you know, and my wife -- if you go through -- if you go this sort of route, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">Q: You wouldn’t have met, you wouldn’t have --</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">A: Would -- exactly, we wouldn’t be sitting over here right now.</span> <span id="s2067">So I -- by the nature of the animal, life would be different because of the war in so many ways which I cannot eve -- trace.</span> <span id="s2068">Nor would I know what had happened.</span> <span id="s2069">You can’t predict -- too parallel life events, or so.</span> <span id="s2070">So I am who I am, with that being a major part of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">Q: Did your uncle talk to you a lot about your father and your mother, so you could get a -- a -- a picture of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2072">A: No, he talked very little about his family in general.</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">A: And talked very, very little about my father and mother.</span> <span id="s2075">My aunt from Switzerland talked more, oddly enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s2076">Q: You mean the one that -- who took in --</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">A: -- the one -- the one that’s -- my sister, Lily, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">Q: Lily, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">A: Not oddly, I think, just different circumstances.</span> <span id="s2080">And my uncle was much more tight lipped about family in general, or -- not to [indecipherable] re us.</span> <span id="s2081">In part I also think that he -- that’s more speculation than fact, but I feel that maybe even fact, he I think felt somewhat guilty that he did not do more to get my parents out, whether it would be more encouraging or physical action.</span> <span id="s2082">He himself had come to the United States in ’41 or so, so there were some years involved.</span> <span id="s2083">I have no idea -- I have no clue how much contact they had.</span> <span id="s2084">He told us [indecipherable] was very -- always a very -- my -- my father was the older brother, and he always told about his respect and, you know, esteem for him, only to talk to him as a younger brother.</span> <span id="s2085">But he never talked about details of background.</span> <span id="s2086">But he never talked about his own -- to his own children either, too much.</span> <span id="s2087">So when I speak to my cousins, his children are so now about -- because they also regret they never pumped him for information just in the family tree.</span> <span id="s2088">[indecipherable] or so, and his background or so.</span> <span id="s2089">Anyways, the answer to your question is no, very little information about my parents.</span> <span id="s2090">So that’s another void.</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2092">A: How they lived, how they celebrated, how they did things.</span> <span id="s2093">My brother knows a little bit more, my sister knows bits and pieces, I know very little.</span> <span id="s2094">That’s certainly a blank compared to other children.</span></p> <p><span id="s2095">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2096">A: Wa -- so again, that -- it’s understandably I was a very little boy, right, so I don’t recall where -- and my sister mentions to me that for my father’s 40th birthday he got a electric shaver.</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">Q: And you wouldn’t know, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">A: I wouldn’t know, right?</span> <span id="s2099">That was a big deal in Holland to get an electric shaver, because people used to use shaving paste --</span></p> <p><span id="s2100">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">A: -- to do the beards, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">Q: Let me ask you an odd -- something of an odd question.</span> <span id="s2103">When you mentioned the postcard, and your brother telling you of the postcard, something happened to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2104">A: I choked up a little more, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2106">What is it, i-is that symbol of the loss for you, do you think, or s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">A: In part it’s a symbol of the loss, obviously, but also is the content.</span> <span id="s2108">I mean, for parents to write a farewell note to parent -- to the children is not normal, and for a brother to end up saying [indecipherable] which means I will see you again, and never materialized, is a painful message to receive, but never follow through.</span> <span id="s2109">So more emotions may be evoked from that than describing that they went on a train, and they open up a -- a suitcase in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s2111">Okay.</span> <span id="s2112">Is there anything else you’d like to mention that I have not asked?</span> <span id="s2113">I’m sure there’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">A: I’m sure there’s things that you would like me to ask which I haven’t answered, or I -- no, I wa -- my job was not to know, give you all my thoughts and feelings.</span> <span id="s2115">I mean, you asked a number of intriguing questions or so, I think gives you a -- some sense of what the war --</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2117">A: -- was -- meant for me, what I -- what little part I played as one individual, and -- well, in some sense our families are like mic-microcosm of one type of --</span></p> <p><span id="s2118">Q: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2119">A: -- Holocaust story, you know.</span> <span id="s2120">And the implications of it all are serious, you know, let’s talk about millions of people.</span> <span id="s2121">Here’s a very, you know, quote, normal family that was split apart.</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">A: To the extent that I have four children and a family and grandchildren, my two brothers would had equal families, and never experienced any personal fulfillment in this regard, and my parents never saw grandchildren, I did.</span> <span id="s2124">So all the human relationships, and all the human events, were kind of disrupted.</span> <span id="s2125">I had a disjointed childhood at best.</span> <span id="s2126">My brother had consequences of it, my sister are similar, you know, so this is just one family to, quote, just one family, and there’s plenty of damage, and I repeat again, I did not [indecipherable] go through the personal horrors of people who go through Auschwitz, or ber -- Buchenwald, and tell horrible stories, you know, on a personal basis or so.</span> <span id="s2127">But that’s just a kind of little composite story of one family and how it spreads, what happened to us, and how one takes it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">Q: Well, I’m very grateful that you were willing to -- to come and do the interview, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">A: Thank you for --</span></p> <p><span id="s2130">Q: -- I thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2131">A: Okay, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2132">Q: And we’re going to take a break and look at the photographs.</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">Q: Okay Charlie, describe this picture for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">A: This is a wedding picture of my parents, 1922, in Frankfurt, with the extended family there, and including in the back right behind them, my mother’s sister and her husband, Rosie Goodman, and Morris Goodman, where my sister went after the war.</span> <span id="s2136">Next to Morris Goodman is Pepi Berger, who -- with whom I stayed for one year in Holland, with her husband Josef Berger.</span> <span id="s2137">And next to her is Mendel Siegman, who is my father’s brother, with whose family I stayed, starting in 1946 till 1962, with his wife Suzie Siegman, who is not in the picture, he wasn’t married yet.</span> <span id="s2138">This picture went through the war itself, because my cousin carried with him through certain concentration camps, and by good circumstances it was finally brought to our attention, so this was salvaged, and this is the kind of big collective origin picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">Q: And this picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">A: This is a portrait picture of my mother that was taken, I believe, after her marriage, I don’t know exact dates on this one.</span> <span id="s2141">And it was this plus the next one from my father, was given to us by very, very close friends of my mother, who had it in their collection, and when we came back after the war to United States, they wanted to make sure that we have pictures of our parents, and they enlarged it, and framed it, I believe, and -- and have been with us since.</span> <span id="s2142">They hang on a wall in our din -- living room.</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">Q: And this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">A: This is the companion picture of my father, also given by the same friends, Hansha Label Velk, who were close friends of my mother, and this the only full faced picture I have of my father as an adult after his marriage.</span></p> <p><span id="s2145">Q: Okay, the picture on the left?</span></p> <p><span id="s2146">A: On the left is a picture of my mother as a young girl, 1913, must have been 14 years old or so, and the [indecipherable] where she was raised in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s2147">Both this and these other pictures are -- giv -- were given to me by my Aunt Rosie from Switzerland, my mother’s sister, who had it in her collection.</span> <span id="s2148">Without her I would not have any pictures of my mother in any stage of her life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">Q: And the one on the right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">A: The one on the right is 1922, most probably either be -- just before or after she was married.</span> <span id="s2151">Again, for -- formal posed picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">Q: Now who’s this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">A: This is my picture of my brother, must be a half a year old or so, 1926.</span> <span id="s2154">And that’s the only picture I have of my brother.</span> <span id="s2155">My other brother -- this one, ar -- Aron Erik.</span> <span id="s2156">My other brother Josef Trey, I don’t have any pictures at all.</span> <span id="s2157">I am -- most probably didn’t have it in her collection, or they never found the occasion to give it to me.</span> <span id="s2158">But that’s the only remembrance picture I have of my p -- late brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s2159">Q: And this shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s2160">A: This shot at -- is a picture of my father with a friend on the beach in Scheveningen.</span> <span id="s2161">My father is on the right, the taller man, in 1924, just after he was married.</span> <span id="s2162">And the background picture of that big circular building is the prominent hotel in Scheveningen to this day, called The Curacao.</span> <span id="s2163">Until World War two, that’s all existed on the beach as far as the visible building, now it is all built up around it, so it doesn’t look as identifiable any more.</span> <span id="s2164">But it’s only snapshot picture I have of my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s2165">Q: And who is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2166">A: This is my mo -- late mother, 1940 picture, the latest picture [indecipherable] really close to before she was killed in Auschwitz a few years later.</span> <span id="s2167">And again, that was given to me by my relative.</span> <span id="s2168">We have -- we carry no pictures with us -- we didn’t carry any pictures with us during the war, obviously, and any family pictures we had we -- either they were disposed or not given to us after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">Q: And these pictures?</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">A: These pictures are from 1946, must be early ’46, wintertime in Amsterdam, my uncle Moritz from Switzerland came to visit us, brought us lots of clothing, which we are wearing, and other goodies, and parading through the center plaza of Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s2171">To the left I am, next is my uncle, and my sister Lily, and my brother Leo.</span> <span id="s2172">Wasn’t that a nice visit.</span> <span id="s2173">On the right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2174">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2175">A: Is a picture taken after my sister left, otherwise she would have been in the picture, went -- left to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s2176">In the background, in the center, are my relatives, Pepi and Josef Berger with whom I st -- we s -- we stayed for one year in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s2177">To the left, the woman with the beret is Malka Weinmann, who kept close to us, both in Amsterdam, and when she came to United States, stayed with -- friendly with us, on good -- very good terms.</span> <span id="s2178">She is, I think, holding a -- a hand of the little nephew.</span> <span id="s2179">And the woman on the right is a sister of Pepi Berger, who was a Regina Felsen, or Feldrin, who married during the war, and -- to a Dutch person, and she was part of the family as well.</span> <span id="s2180">So this is a kind of contemporary Amsterdam picture.</span> <span id="s2181">Contemporary 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">Q: And who is this good looking group?</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">A: This is the wedding picture of our daughter Dafna with her husband Dani.</span> <span id="s2184">And next to Dafna is my wife Gita.</span> <span id="s2185">And Dafna is holding one of her nephews, Ayal, who is the youngest of our oldest daughter, who is sta -- sitting right be -- standing right behind Dafna and Dani, that’s Atara, right, and her husband Joel - Jody, right next to her, right.</span> <span id="s2186">And their other three children are the boy with the sleeve -- shirts -- shirtsleeve is Ilan, shirtsleeve right behind me, right.</span> <span id="s2187">And on the side, the girl with the white skirt, this is our oldest granddaughter -- the white skirt at the end, next -- behind my wife Gita.</span></p> <p><span id="s2188">Q: Oh, here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2189">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2190">That’s Michal.</span> <span id="s2191">And in front are our two other grandchildren, one of them is Hadar, the small one, and that -- that’s the four children of Atara and Jody.</span> <span id="s2192">And next to her is Shlomit, and the little boy next to me is Yosef, who are the two children, at that time, of our daughter Naomi, in back and her husband Ari.</span></p> <p><span id="s2193">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2194">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2195">This is Naomi, this is Ari.</span> <span id="s2196">And on back, the last two next to Atara are our son, right there, tall fellow is next to a -- next to -- that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2197">Q: Here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2198">A: -- that’s right.</span> <span id="s2199">Our son Dov, and his wife Tzviya, right over there.</span> <span id="s2200">That’s the last family picture we had, but there -- since then, we have had, thank God, a few additions in the family.</span> <span id="s2201">Atara -- Dafna and Dani had -- to have two children, Amihi and Tahiwa.</span> <span id="s2202">And Naomi had another son, Menachim Benjamin.</span> <span id="s2203">So thank God the -- is a contrast that they have two wedding pictures, and this is the continuity which Hitler tried to destroy, but we beat him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">A: Left is my wife Gita and myself, and on the other s -- on the right is my wife Gita and myself again, different poses and formality.</span> <span id="s2206">And this is the best part happened to my life when I met Gita, and she is all around superb blessing for all of us.</span> <span id="s2207">And those are the bright chapters, opened with when I met her, and then the family pictures since.</span> <span id="s2208">So this is the continuity with a major interruption, and some family tragedy between, but thank God that the bright side is that the continuity exists.</span></p> <p><span id="s2209">End of Tape #7</span></p> <p><span id="s2210">Conclusion of Interview USHMM Archives
