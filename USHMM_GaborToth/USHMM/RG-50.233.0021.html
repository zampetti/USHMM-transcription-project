little bit about yourself, for example, what was your name when you were growing up, where were you born, your date of birth and what was your childhood like?</span></p> <p><span id="s5">Yeah.</span> <span id="s6">I was born in Sosnowiec, Poland.</span> <span id="s7">And then I lived all the time in Kozlow, Poland.</span> <span id="s8">When I was seven years old, I went to public school and about five years old, I start to go to the cheder.</span> <span id="s9">So, when I come back from the public school at noon time, in afternoon, I get to go to the Cheder--come home about six o'clock.</span> <span id="s10">My parents were in business, they were dealing with grain, cattle, and farm products.</span> <span id="s11">And we got a decent life, they give everything to the children--what the children need.</span> <span id="s12">It wasn't a rich life, but we got everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">How many children did your parents have?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">We have four.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">You want to tell anything about your brother and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Yeah.</span> <span id="s17">I had an older brother.</span> <span id="s18">He was two years older.</span> <span id="s19">And then I had one brother, he passed away.</span> <span id="s20">That was the third.</span> <span id="s21">He was about six, seven years old.</span> <span id="s22">He passed away.</span> <span id="s23">Then I had another brother.</span> <span id="s24">He was born in 1930 and I got a sister born in 1934.</span> <span id="s25">We had been four in the family.</span> <span id="s26">When I finished school, the seventh grade, I went to public school, my father says nothing wasn't much to do in town--because my brother was the main help for my parents.</span> <span id="s27">So he says that I should go learn a trade and my uncle was a tinsmith in Sosnowiec, Poland so he says I should come learn a trade and I went when I was fifteen years old and I worked there and at night I went two times, three times a week to trade school to learn about the trade.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">And which trade was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Tinsmith, sheet metal, blocker.</span> <span id="s30">And then I did all right, I made already good money and on holidays I came home and visit with the parents.</span> <span id="s31">The parents can visit with us because they were coming to Sosnowiec with the produce to sell.</span> <span id="s32">So I wasn't lonesome, so I always see the parents.</span> <span id="s33">The war broke out in 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Can I stop you before we go back to that?</span> <span id="s35">What was your home like Jewishly?</span> <span id="s36">Were you traditional?</span> <span id="s37">or?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Traditional orthodox.</span> <span id="s39">I didn't know anything else.</span> <span id="s40">I have to lay tefillen.</span> <span id="s41">I have to daven every morning and every night and Shabbos was real orthodox.</span> <span id="s42">I went to Cheder, I learned the main thing, whatever.</span> <span id="s43">When I was fourteen years old, then I started to learn a trade.</span> <span id="s44">Tinsmithing, you know, I went to my uncle and learned the trade.</span> <span id="s45">That maybe saved my life, too, because, you know, during the war in 1939, in my town I was doing the tinsmithing so they give me a pass that I can go from one place to another.</span> <span id="s46">Because they didn't have no tinsmiths and I was working in town.</span> <span id="s47">I did not have to go out and do the digging and hard work, on the railroad or building roads.</span> <span id="s48">It has been like this until 1941.</span> <span id="s49">In 1940 in March, they came out and everybody got to wear armbands, Jewish star to be recognizable and you wouldn't get out from the town.</span> <span id="s50">You got to have a pass to get out, you couldn't go with the train, you have a pass, you could, you know.</span> <span id="s51">And my brother has to go out and work for the Germans.</span> <span id="s52">Right away, they took all the young people, they took him to Cracow.</span> <span id="s53">They have to work like making bricks, they still could come home for the weekends--they work six days and Saturdays they could leave Cracow and could come home to Kozlow.</span> <span id="s54">They were maybe fifteen or twenty boys that age, 22, 23.</span> <span id="s55">They took some food with them, whatever they got there, there wasn't enough.</span> <span id="s56">So it was helped out, they still could buy some food on the black market.</span> <span id="s57">In 1942, so they start to gather us, we have to go--in one spot like a ghetto.</span> <span id="s58">In about, I should say, then they took all the Jews--they have to get out.</span> <span id="s59">They took them to Slomniki, that was a town-- Could you spell that?</span> <span id="s60">(Thank you.)</span></p> <p><span id="s61">S-l-o-m-n-i-k-i.</span> <span id="s62">That was in Poland, you know.</span> <span id="s63">That was county of Miechow.</span> <span id="s64">That was I should think in August, the grain was already taken up from the fields in 1942.</span> <span id="s65">They started out, they took the young people, the boys, the groups were working already but they took them to the place Slomniki, there was still some young people.</span> <span id="s66">And I wasn't there because I still have a pass that I can stay in town and do my tinsmithing, you know.</span> <span id="s67">They give me that privilege.</span> <span id="s68">They took all the old people and I with my parents because I knew they gonna--so we hid in Kozlow.</span> <span id="s69">We hid and we stayed for another three months.</span> <span id="s70">They took us from there, they took us to Welbraun.</span> <span id="s71">That was where they make the ghetto and that was Judenrein, all around.</span> <span id="s72">About in November, they cleaned out the Welbraun, they took it to Miechow, in the county.</span> <span id="s73">They load up all the people in the cars and they didn't sort it out no more, they took everybody, young, old.</span> <span id="s74">They took to Treblinka that time already.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Oh, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Yeah.</span> <span id="s77">You know, we think that they went up that way.</span> <span id="s78">We don't know, they went up that way.</span> <span id="s79">So that was the end of the--.</span> <span id="s80">We took off from that town, Welbraun, I got a policeman, a town policeman came to help clean up the town with the Jews.</span> <span id="s81">They have to have the police.</span> <span id="s82">So the policeman came to me Saturday and he says to me "On tomorrow, there going to be liquidation here."</span> <span id="s83">So I knew what it is, so we took off again.</span> <span id="s84">We went to Kozlow, to town, me, my father and mother and sister and brother and uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">You're still out together.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Yeah, we're still out together.</span> <span id="s87">We come back to Kozlow and we went then to Polish people, we hid out for a day.</span> <span id="s88">And then at night, we split up.</span> <span id="s89">I went with my father to one place and my mother went with the two children, my brother and sister, to another place, to a ghetto in Cracow Podowiec and my uncle went to another place.</span> <span id="s90">We stay in town for about four days and then they come out with an order, that if some Jews are left, they can come to Cracow and that's where we went, to Cracow.</span> <span id="s91">I went to work to the camp and I took my father with me--we were working with bridges for a German company--Langert was their name.</span> <span id="s92">They were from Zwickau.</span> <span id="s93">That was Lager--the Judenlager that was Cracow-Plaszow.</span> <span id="s94">That was in 1942 and my parents, my mother went with a sister and brother and she was there by herself and my father was working with me in Lager and like a husband, he says he wants to go back to his wife, his kids and his wife, so he went back.</span> <span id="s95">Maybe, if he would have stayed with me, maybe he would have been alive.</span> <span id="s96">So he went back in 1942, in the end sometimes, they liquidated the Judenlager, they brought us up to the Judenlager and made a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s97">There was Cracow-Jerozolimska, I don't know if you heard of it.</span> <span id="s98">There I worked in a mine shaft.</span> <span id="s99">They have the trades and I was working there until about March, 1943 because they liquidated the ghetto-- all at the same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Can you recall what the conditions were like in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s101">Do you remember it?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">The ghetto was very crowded.</span> <span id="s103">The hygiene wasn't there.</span> <span id="s104">They got one room and maybe four or five families got one kitchen and it was crowded, lice and bugs, you know.</span> <span id="s105">Whenever they could, they washed, they washed the clothes.</span> <span id="s106">Like us, we also been with lice and dirty.</span> <span id="s107">We washed once a week, we went to a cold shower or something like that.</span> <span id="s108">Or you went to the ghetto to get a bath and have a shower so I visited with my parents when I was in Lager I took sick, I was sick of typhoid, you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Oh, really.</span> <span id="s110">Well, you recovered.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Yeah.</span> <span id="s112">I recovered, yeah.</span> <span id="s113">And I was--in Lager I was going out to work--we still could buy something outside because Polish people were coming and selling on the black market.</span> <span id="s114">They took a chance, you know, brought it into the camp.</span> <span id="s115">So in 1943, it must have been in the fall time, or in the beginning so they took us out and sorted us out when we come from that Judenlager, they sort us out.</span> <span id="s116">They wanted tradesmen, they took to a different side and non-tradesmen.</span> <span id="s117">The non-tradesmen they sent to Skarzysko, to a munitions factory.</span> <span id="s118">A lot of my friends went there.</span> <span id="s119">They read my brother's name because he was registered also as a tradesman and I don't know, my name why I didn't hear, why they omitted or something, so I see that he's going there so I went too because that time they didn't ask no questions.</span> <span id="s120">So they sort us out and we stay on the Jerozolimska we stay about a couple of weeks and they took us from there, they send us to Mielec.</span> <span id="s121">Mielec was a big factory, that was the Polish airplane factory.</span> <span id="s122">They were making planes, the Poles.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Could you spell that please.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">M-i-e-l-e-c.</span> <span id="s125">That was an airplane factory.</span> <span id="s126">And Henckel the German bombers they build there.</span> <span id="s127">We were there for about six months in that factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Where did you live at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">They got barracks.</span> <span id="s130">And you know the food was poor, the hygiene wasn't there.</span> <span id="s131">If you want anything you got to wash the clothes and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Were you tortured or anything at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">No, you know, the thing is somehow when you come into the camp sometimes they been frisking you or something if you didn't go in line or something.</span> <span id="s134">The job wasn't too bad because you know we were working with the Polish people.</span> <span id="s135">I was working, making all the things inside what comes in the plane, the fastenoffs, they called it, and was two Jewish boys and one Polak.</span> <span id="s136">And he was, you know, whatever has to be done, we did.</span> <span id="s137">And my brother was working on the top, he was putting up the covers on the plane.</span> <span id="s138">We was there until about June, 1944.</span> <span id="s139">Then when the Americans start to come in, what they call it, offensive?</span> <span id="s140">so they thought that the Russians are going to come in because we weren't too far from the Russian border, Sandomierz.</span> <span id="s141">We were next to the San, that's the water.</span> <span id="s142">Past the San, the Russians were there and on this side the San, the Germans.</span> <span id="s143">So they were afraid the Russians were going to come and we would be--they would grab us, you know, they grab the factory and everything.</span> <span id="s144">So they took us out that time and I think that was the 22nd of June, 1944 and they took us to Wieliczka.</span> <span id="s145">That was still in Poland, that was a salt mine.</span> <span id="s146">They have a factory there also, an airplane factory.</span> <span id="s147">The only thing we didn't stay there too long, maybe a couple of weeks.</span> <span id="s148">From there they took us--again in 1944, they took us to--they load us up in the cars and they say that we were on the railroad siding in Auschwitz for about two days while they were deciding what to do with us.</span> <span id="s149">You know, because we were important to them, we were tradesmen.</span> <span id="s150">So that's what they say now, who the hell knows, you know, because I didn't know that time.</span> <span id="s151">We were in Auschwitz, on the siding, to be liquidated.</span> <span id="s152">Meanwhile from there, they took us to Flossenburg.</span> <span id="s153">We came into Flossenburg iu July--it was real hot, I think the middle of July.</span> <span id="s154">They took off all the clothes.</span> <span id="s155">We have to throw away the clothes, naked, you know, like you're born.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">You're still in your regular civilian clothes, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">No, no, no.</span> <span id="s158">Already in Mielec we already got the mark, you see, that was the mark from Mielec.</span> <span id="s159">We were already concentration camp.</span> <span id="s160">Soon we came up to the Jerozolimska no more civilian clothes, was already the striped clothes, was concentration camp.</span> <span id="s161">And Mielec was already concentration camp.</span> <span id="s162">They thought we brought something with us so they took us to shower us.</span> <span id="s163">So they took about three hundred people.</span> <span id="s164">We thought that they were going to kill us, you know, because people start to scream; so many people and then all of a sudden they let the shower go in Flossensburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">You had heard stories already about the gas chambers?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Yeah, sure we had.</span> <span id="s167">'Cause that was already 44, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Right, right.</span> <span id="s169">Some people say that they--even to the point that they got rumors or whatever, they weren't...</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Yeah, rumors sure, all rumors, we thought we are going to get killed, you know.</span> <span id="s171">People were screaming and everything.</span> <span id="s172">Then on the way out, they shaved us the hair and they threw some lye.</span> <span id="s173">It was burning like a fire.</span> <span id="s174">You know, they grab and throw it between the legs, in here, (points to crotch) and they marked us.</span> <span id="s175">I had a two.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">With a tattoo?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">No, with paint.</span> <span id="s178">The ones they took to work, to dig big stones, what is it?</span> <span id="s179">stone mines?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A quarry.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A quarry.</span> <span id="s182">You see they didn't care any more.</span> <span id="s183">The tools, even the tradesmen, if you was rugged, they separate you.</span> <span id="s184">They didn't care.</span> <span id="s185">That was in Flossenburg.</span> <span id="s186">We were there for about a week, staying in the sun and the hot without clothes.</span> <span id="s187">And we were like animals, we were sleeping crossways on the wooden beds, because it was so packed about four hundred, five hundred in one barrack.</span> <span id="s188">About five, six days without clothes.</span> <span id="s189">And then they give us clothes and they send us from there, they send us to labor the twos, the threes, the fours stay in--I don't know if they send them to kill or something or they kill them off because that was the lowest one.</span> <span id="s190">So we went with the twos, we went to labor.</span> <span id="s191">From Flossenburg, then send us to Leitwezil, Czechoslovakia, near Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s192">That was carbide mine, you know what carbide is.</span> <span id="s193">We could see Theresienstadt (from) the place where we were.</span> <span id="s194">And they kept us there also not too long, I should say about six weeks.</span> <span id="s195">We supposed to fix some machines, put it in the mines and still working for the airplane.</span> <span id="s196">I guess they didn't much realize so they send us from there, they send us to Dachau.</span> <span id="s197">In Dachau, we were there about three or four days.</span> <span id="s198">From there they send us to Augsburg.</span> <span id="s199">That was a big Messerschmidt plant.</span> <span id="s200">Everything with no food, nothing much to eat, and you know, hungry, and the railroad cars.</span> <span id="s201">They brought us to Augsburg.</span> <span id="s202">Every morning about five o'clock in the morning, they wake us up, they give us a little bit of coffee and a piece of bread and we have to go again to an airplane factory.</span> <span id="s203">The name was Horgau in the woods.</span> <span id="s204">A regular train and for us they got a cattle car, you know.</span> <span id="s205">Every day you are going in that cattle car and they let us out in Horgau.</span> <span id="s206">And from there they kept us till about, I don't know, every so often they would transfer us from one place to another.</span> <span id="s207">Sometimes they'd transfer us in December, 1944.</span> <span id="s208">They took us to Leonburg, not far from Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s209">Leonburg was a tunnel, a big tunnel--blocked off.</span> <span id="s210">Half the tunnel was for cars to go on through and trucks and half the tunnel was building wings for the Messerschmidt planes.</span> <span id="s211">All the time, we was supposed to do--they need bolts, we already got rivets, they need rivets--was already everything in disarray.</span> <span id="s212">We were there until about April, '45.</span> <span id="s213">They took us out from there on a march because then we go in from there to Kaufering That was a camp, you know, Landsberg was the main camp, Kaufering was a side camp.</span> <span id="s214">We were there for about three weeks, nothing much to eat, nothing to do and that was in '44 at the end and a week before the lilberation, they took us to Allach that was next to Dachau.</span> <span id="s215">On a Friday night, we hear the artrillery, the things, shooting and they hit the barracks, a lot of people got killed and the Germans took off.</span> <span id="s216">They left the camp and the Germans, what you call the political Germans who were in the concentration camps, the ones what grab us and steal us.</span> <span id="s217">The political got a red mark and the rabbles(?)</span> <span id="s218">got a triangle, a black one.</span> <span id="s219">So they were watching us.</span> <span id="s220">Sunday morning, the gates opened, so we got liberated May 1, 1945.</span> <span id="s221">As soon as the gates opened, there were outside potatoe piles, you know, for the winter.</span> <span id="s222">They didn't feed us, the only thing, the piles were still there, they didn't give us.</span> <span id="s223">So I took a can, I had a buddy of mine so I said, "I'm going out to get some potatoes."</span> <span id="s224">I took a can aand filled up with potatoes from outside the camp.</span> <span id="s225">So I get out, we made a fire and he was cooking the potatoes.</span> <span id="s226">So while he was cooking, I says I'm going to get another can.</span> <span id="s227">So I get out, I get another can, he stays and cries, somebody stole the can.</span> <span id="s228">We already got liberated and people--it was for them easier to take it from me then to go out the gate.</span> <span id="s229">I said what's you crying, we got liberated, let's go.</span> <span id="s230">He didn't want to go and I didn't see him since.</span> <span id="s231">I went out right away and went on the road with some four or five other concentration camps.</span> <span id="s232">We went to the town, about a mile.</span> <span id="s233">On the way a jeep went by and the jeep turned back and he give us chewing gum.</span> <span id="s234">That was the liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">This is the Americans?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Yeah.</span> <span id="s237">And they told me to chew.</span> <span id="s238">I didn't know, I ate.</span> <span id="s239">We didn't know what chewing gum is.</span> <span id="s240">So I ate the chewing gum.</span> <span id="s241">We came in, they were camping out, they were cooking and they surround us.</span> <span id="s242">They were Polish soldiers, Jewish soldiers.</span> <span id="s243">They start to ask questions and they give us to drink.</span> <span id="s244">I got drunk that evening.</span> <span id="s245">And I stay overnight, I was sleeping there on the bunk, where they were camping and in the morning, I wake up, they've been gone.</span> <span id="s246">So we went as a group, four or five, we changed clothes.</span> <span id="s247">We went to the German houses, they left their houses.</span> <span id="s248">So we throw away the striped clothes, they walked away from us, a lot of lice, you know.</span> <span id="s249">So we change clothes, we shower and cleaned up a little bit.</span> <span id="s250">It took us three days to go into Munich.</span> <span id="s251">Because from Allach, we went by foot, there was no transportation.</span> <span id="s252">And then we came into Munich, I saw people carrying wine they would sell us.</span> <span id="s253">They took out some wine and I was also going in for a case of wine.</span> <span id="s254">So we celebrated and then I start after a couple of days, I went to work for the Americans, for the GI's, for the kitchen.</span> <span id="s255">That was the best thing I ever did because I had plenty of food and I brought home some food for my friends.</span> <span id="s256">A lot of friends came to the kitchen there because they got a lot of leftovers because in the beginning everything was rationed.</span> <span id="s257">Even for money, you couldn't buy.</span> <span id="s258">So that was a big help.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Could we back up a little bit and go throught---we sort of zoomed through these times in the camps.</span> <span id="s260">Are there any images of things that you remember that made an impression on you?</span> <span id="s261">or any episode that happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">What I can say?</span> <span id="s263">On the mark because we were camping outside and I see some people eating flesh, you know, human flesh.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Oh, my God.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Yeah, they were cooking.</span> <span id="s266">Yeah, we didn't have too much food.</span> <span id="s267">People were eating snacks, they were eating grass.</span> <span id="s268">I did myself, I eat grass, you know.</span> <span id="s269">What else?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Any episode when you were in all these places?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Yeah, you see when I got sick with typhoid on the way home from work, somehow I still was weavy, you know.</span> <span id="s272">I didn't walk straight.</span> <span id="s273">So the guy came, he was Ukranian, he was watching out.</span> <span id="s274">That was still in Poland, you know, in 1941, 42.</span> <span id="s275">He came to the camp and the good thing that the sharf, the SS wasn't there.</span> <span id="s276">His wife was there.</span> <span id="s277">He said that I want to take off, that I want to run away.</span> <span id="s278">I didn't have no strength to walk, never mind run away.</span> <span id="s279">So she called, we would have been there with the bullet, there was no question asked, give you the bullet right away.</span> <span id="s280">So she said to call the Jewish kapos, they should give me twenty-five on my body.</span> <span id="s281">So they took me in, they say scream, they know if they give me twenty-five, I wouldn't survive either.</span> <span id="s282">So they told me scream, they didn't hit me, they didn't touch me.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">So these were half-decent kapos.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s285">I was still in Poland in Allach, Judenlager.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Do you know what year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">That was in 1942 in the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">When you had the typhus, you didn't have any medical care, I assume.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Just had to pass, exit.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s292">We were laying in the thing they got separated, quarantined, you know.</span> <span id="s293">You have to go into that quarantine and you stay there.</span> <span id="s294">The doctor that was taking care of us, he died of the typhoid.</span> <span id="s295">He was an older man, I remember like today.</span> <span id="s296">And I got a friend of mine and he died too.</span> <span id="s297">He didn't make it.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">This was just from the bad conditions.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Yeah, they didn't have the food there, the fever ate you up.</span> <span id="s300">What else you want to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Anything else you can remember about that.</span> <span id="s302">Then you can continue to tell me about what happened, you were working in the kitchen, you were saying. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Yeah, for the American Army.</span> <span id="s304">And I work for about four or five months.</span> <span id="s305">They took them out, they supposed to go to Japan so they left Munich so I was without a job.</span> <span id="s306">The only thing, we already formed committees and this and that so I was involved in some.</span> <span id="s307">Then I start to look for my--to look in my profession as a tinsmith.</span> <span id="s308">We went to try to build houses.</span> <span id="s309">This was kind of tough to get into.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Can I ask you, how did the Germans, all of a sudden Germany is defeated and you are in Germany, how did they?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">You know, a lot of Germans, they say they didn't know what was going on.</span> <span id="s312">I say how come you didn't know.</span> <span id="s313">You seen us marching.</span> <span id="s314">I was marching in Augsburg in the morning, we were marching for the train.</span> <span id="s315">They saw in what condition we were.</span> <span id="s316">When I got liberated, I weigh 95 pounds, I was a skeleton marching.</span> <span id="s317">So I says how come you didn't know.</span> <span id="s318">And the Germans they work with us too, some Germans.</span> <span id="s319">I ask them because they say they didn't know.</span> <span id="s320">You know, like when I went to a bakery, he didn"t take no money from me, he give me bread, he give me cake because he felt sorry for me.</span> <span id="s321">The only thing, you couldn't trust them, I wouldn't trust them today.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">What about when you were growing up in Poland.</span> <span id="s323">Did you feel any antisemitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">In my town, you know, because I was involved in going to school, public school, because I was not a softie, I was one of theirs, they couldn't fight with me; I'd fight back.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Did they ever call you any .</span> <span id="s326">.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">No, they called you.</span> <span id="s328">Friga (ph) friga, Jud go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s329">Fria is Palestinic.</span> <span id="s330">Other than this, I didn't care because I was going to their schools and they were learning about their religion and everything.</span> <span id="s331">The priest came for an hour so I walked out.</span> <span id="s332">Sometimes It was bad weather so I stayed and I listened to the teaching.</span> <span id="s333">I wasn't the type of guy, they did some--some Jewish boys, they wear peyes(earlocks) or something like this, they like to grab the pais.</span> <span id="s334">Jewish was the cheder, for school we have to go with them.</span> <span id="s335">Afterwards like in a big city like in Sosnowiec, they already have public schools for Jews, just Jewish public school.</span> <span id="s336">Where I was, we were maybe a dozen or maybe two dozen Jewish kids in the public school from my town.</span> <span id="s337">So we kind of got a mixture and we did the same thing.</span> <span id="s338">Like with the physical education or something like this or playing music or exercise or something, we wasn't bothered.</span> <span id="s339">It started in 1935, '37 when the Jews came from Germany - - That the Polish Jews were sent back?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Back, yeah.</span> <span id="s341">At that time they start already to...like in the stores, they say don't buy from the Jews, you know.</span> <span id="s342">They were picketing, they use pickets.</span> <span id="s343">That was the guys that were antisemites.</span> <span id="s344">Otherwise, . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Were you involved with any youth groups, any Zionist groups, or did you play any instruments or have any hobbies?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">No, I didn't have the time.</span> <span id="s347">I used to belong to the Bethar organization.</span> <span id="s348">The only thing I wasn't involved too much because I have to learn the trade and then I have to go to school at night and my uncle did feel mercy for me.</span> <span id="s349">I was working during the day and at night I got to do a lot of things.</span> <span id="s350">Sometimes I went to meeting, I didn't get involved too much.</span> <span id="s351">I had friends who were not involved.</span> <span id="s352">Mostly I went to synagogue for services on Shabbos.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">That's okay.</span> <span id="s354">You didn't have to be involved.</span> <span id="s355">I'd like to go now back to the time just when you were liberated if that's all right.</span> <span id="s356">We can talk a little bit about your working for the GI's but then they departed.</span> <span id="s357">What happened after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">After that, when they departed, we were still in the group.</span> <span id="s359">We tried to go in business, building houses because I was a tinsmith.</span> <span id="s360">It was very tough, it was hard to get into construction.</span> <span id="s361">We were four or five of us so we work for about a couple of years.</span> <span id="s362">We didn't accomplish too much.</span> <span id="s363">They have an office, didn't make too much money.</span> <span id="s364">Whatever we made, we got expenses, paid the help and everything.</span> <span id="s365">In 1947, 48, we were thinking we should emigrate.</span> <span id="s366">We still worried about with the building and everything until 1949.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Can you back up and tell us, were you married by that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">But you had met your wife while you were working for the GI's?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s371">We were together, like the boys were together and the girls were together.</span> <span id="s372">We see each other.</span> <span id="s373">Then about 1946 - 47, we were thinking about getting married.</span> <span id="s374">The only thing, we wait until we come to the United States and we got married in the United States in 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">So you came to America together?</span> <span id="s376">You came with all these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Yeah, she came with my brother together.</span> <span id="s378">We didn't have nobody here.</span> <span id="s379">So we have to register under the 200,000, I don't know if somebody tell you about this.</span> <span id="s380">That's the Truman's quarter.</span> <span id="s381">My brother registered as a farmer so they took the farmers first.</span> <span id="s382">And the girls registered as domestic.</span> <span id="s383">They supposed to go work for somebody.</span> <span id="s384">So they took them.</span> <span id="s385">And I was a tinsmith, I was the last one to go.</span> <span id="s386">She went with my brother together in December, 1949 and I come in June, 1950 and I got married in November.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Did you come to New York at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Yeah, we were in New York.</span> <span id="s389">They came, she and my brother.</span> <span id="s390">We had a friend, he had already a house so they rent an apartment in the Bronx.</span> <span id="s391">When I come, I come already to a real thing.</span> <span id="s392">They already got furniture and everything.</span> <span id="s393">I got a little bit of money because, you know, from the construction thing, whatever we sold and everything.</span> <span id="s394">So I went there with some friends.</span> <span id="s395">They were working for the uncle, they were in the jewelry business, costume jewelry.</span> <span id="s396">So they tell me that I should go back to Europe and get some connections for the costume jewelry, for the Catholics, you know the prayer beads.</span> <span id="s397">Yeah, that's in Jewish hands.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Don't tell the antisemites!</span></p> <p><span id="s399">I went back to Germany and make some connections and we're supposed to open up a business.</span> <span id="s400">We did open up and then I got my brother, I want him to be a partner and my friend, he got a cousin, he wants him to be a partner.</span> <span id="s401">The only thing they said, because they knew the trade, they were working for the uncle, both of them, they said no I can be a third partner.</span> <span id="s402">I said I'm not a schlamazle, you know what a schlamazel is, so I says no.</span> <span id="s403">Either I take 50%, you don't want my brother, give me 50%, you take 50.</span> <span id="s404">No, I give him the key.</span> <span id="s405">You take the business.</span> <span id="s406">So they paid me out and I came to the farm about a year later.</span> <span id="s407">Meantime, my wife was working, my brother was working and I went to work for Bethlehem Steel.</span> <span id="s408">At that time, they be remodeling the Liberty Boats--as a tinsmith.</span> <span id="s409">I was making good money, $2.75/hour in 1952.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">That's great!</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Yeah, I was making about $75 a week and the taxes-- Oh, a week.</span> <span id="s412">First you said $75/hr.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Oh, no, $2.75 an hour.</span> <span id="s414">At that time it was big money.</span> <span id="s415">My wife was making 60 cents, my brother was making 90 cents, I was the big macher.</span> <span id="s416">This is my son and wife and me.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Do you have anything else that you can think of that you'd like to add?</span> <span id="s418">about your family?</span> <span id="s419">about your experiences during the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">You know I see a lot of things like in the Holocaust I saw some friends at night, next morning they were dead, all of a sudden--that kind of experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Okay, I think I'll turn off the tape now then if that's okay with you.</span> <span id="s422">Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Okay.</span></p></body></html>
