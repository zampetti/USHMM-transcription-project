<p><span id="s12">Q: Good afternoon, Flory.</span> <span id="s13">Can you please tell me your full name and where you were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: My name is Flory Jagoda, and I was born in Sarajevo, Bosnia.</span> <span id="s15">You want to know when?</span> <span id="s16">I don't think I should tell youDecember 21st, 1923.</span> <span id="s17">A lot of years.</span> <span id="s18">Actually, most of the survivors are this age, maybe a little younger, a little older.</span> <span id="s19">But this is more or less around 70s and so.</span> <span id="s20">And they have one thing in commonsilence.</span> <span id="s21">They sort of don't like to talk.</span> <span id="s22">We don't like toit is almost like a wound that, you know, you heal.</span> <span id="s23">And you don't want to scratch it.</span> <span id="s24">It bleeds.</span> <span id="s25">And also, a lot of them do not want to burden their families, especially their children, with sadness.</span> <span id="s26">They want to forget.</span> <span id="s27">And it works for a while.</span> <span id="s28">You have children, and you have weddings, and grandchildren, and music lessons, and piano lessons.</span> <span id="s29">And I was teaching music myself for 25 years.</span> <span id="s30">So I was quite a busy lady.</span> <span id="s31">Then all of a sudden, children leave, and marry, and get a little older.</span> <span id="s32">And you know, you don't sleep.</span> <span id="s33">You sort of start dreaming, and seeing some images and faces of your familyand, uh, you wake up in the morning disturbed and restless.</span> <span id="s34">And, uh, then you read these horrible storiesthere was no holocaustnever happenedand you know what that means to a survivorno holocaust?</span> <span id="s35">Your whole inner starts screaming.</span> <span id="s36">I think the ageand I also think the story of the holocaust never happenedisI think it broke the silence of a lot of holocaust survivors.</span> <span id="s37">Age definitely had something to do with it.</span> <span id="s38">So here I am.</span> <span id="s39">I'm going to take you to a small little town in Bosnia, and share with you my childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">01:02:48 Actually, I'm not going to start in Sarajevo.</span> <span id="s41">We will go about 98 kilometers up northeast Bosnia, a small town called Vlasenica, very picturesque.</span> <span id="s42">It's know for its pine trees.</span> <span id="s43">My whole family lived there.</span> <span id="s44">Their name was Altarac, the Altarac family.</span> <span id="s45">And they were very proud of their name.</span> <span id="s46">It meant __________, the high placevery proud of that.</span> <span id="s47">And, you know, all these towns that you read today unfortunately, from Srebenica to Rogatica to, which is close to Gorazde, to Travnik, to Zvornikall these little, tiny towns hadbesides Moslems and Serbs, they also had a Bosnian Sephardi Jewish communities.</span> <span id="s48">A lot of people don't know thatBosnian JewsLos Judeos Bosnia, they would say in Ladino.</span> <span id="s49">And they came from Sarajevo.</span> <span id="s50">Actually, they were descendants of the Spanish refugees that were expelled from Spain in 1492the inquisitionSpain and Portugal.</span> <span id="s51">The word Sepharad means Iberian peninsula in Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">01:04:32 Actually, they had no choice.</span> <span id="s53">I mean, they had to leave, or convert to Catholicism, or leave home.</span> <span id="s54">They were given three months.</span> <span id="s55">A lot of them converted.</span> <span id="s56">A lot of them remained.</span> <span id="s57">They couldn't leave the country they really loved.</span> <span id="s58">My ancestors went towards Turkey.</span> <span id="s59">There sultan Bayazid II gave orders tothroughout his Ottoman Empireto let the refugees in, give them freedom, to worship, to build synagogues, and, most of all, freedom to travel through his Ottoman Empire.</span> <span id="s60">So there were big communities in Salonika, Greece, BulgariaSarajevo definitely became a thriving Sephardi community.</span> <span id="s61">They called it a _________ Yirushaliam, the small Jerusalem, with their religious schools andso, from Sarajevo, looking for new opportunities, they went to these small towns and villages that you read about today.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">01:05:53 Now the life in Vlasenicait was a very simple life.</span> <span id="s63">The family was very close nit, about 15 families, 15, 16, familiesmost of them, Altarac families.</span> <span id="s64">And in my family, definitely, the leader was my nona (ph.), my grandmother.</span> <span id="s65">My nona was a kind of a grandmother that a child dreams of having, not because onlyI mean, her voice was something that was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s66">She sang beautifully.</span> <span id="s67">But she was a midwife, a well known midwife, in all the neighboring villages, she knew herbs.</span> <span id="s68">Her house was always full of women with babies and children"What do I give to this one?"</span> <span id="s69">"What do I""What herb do I use?"</span> <span id="s70">.</span> <span id="s71">She was the one to put the first pair of earrings through the babies' ears.</span> <span id="s72">And naturally, she was the leader of her own band, as we say in Americaleader of the band.</span> <span id="s73">She had her own singing family, which was well known as the Altarac family, the singing Altarac family, five daughters and three sons.</span> <span id="s74">She was the teacher of religion in the house.</span> <span id="s75">Women did not go to the synagogue as much as we see here.</span> <span id="s76">The men usually went to synagogue, took their sons, taught them Hebrew.</span> <span id="s77">And the woman stayed at home, and she taught her daughters and granddaughters tradition, religion, heritage.</span> <span id="s78">All that she learned from her nona, and her bis-nona, the great grandmother, just went on from generation to generation.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">01:07:49 They lived there for about four centuries, and the old peacefully died, and the young were born and married, and there was harmony in Vlasenicathe Moslems and Serbs and Jews lived in harmony there.</span> <span id="s80">I never remember hate or quarrels.</span> <span id="s81">The women visited and the children went to school together.</span> <span id="s82">I would never, never, never, believe that the madness of the Second World War would bring something.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">01:08:25 So, uh, the life didn't have too much change.</span> <span id="s84">And more or less, everybody was quite satisfied, went along with the life as it was.</span> <span id="s85">But my nona's familythere was one daughtershe just couldn't take itthat was my mother, Rosa (ph.).</span> <span id="s86">And she was actually considered as a rebel.</span> <span id="s87">I mean, she always dreamt of far‑away places, she read books that she was not supposed to read.</span> <span id="s88">If there was something in the familyor the girls wanted to try something new, let Rosa do it firstto eat somethinglet Rosa taste it first.</span> <span id="s89">She was just very, very different.</span> <span id="s90">So finally, she talked her family to send her to Sarajevo, which was a thrivingI mean, big city at that time, huh?</span> <span id="s91">And she went to stay with my tia esperansa (ph.).</span> <span id="s92">Tia is aunt.</span> <span id="s93">And I will be adding some of these Ladino words, because they just fit in with the words that I'm saying.</span> <span id="s94">It's, as we call it, Lingua De la Madri (ph.), the language of the mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">01:09:48 This was the language in the home.</span> <span id="s96">You passed the door, and you did not hear Serb or Croatian words.</span> <span id="s97">It was only in Ladino, as we call it, Judeo-Spanish.</span> <span id="s98">Sometimes, we would come home andwith non‑Jewish friendsand I would sort of be a little embarrassed, I would say nonacan't you speak sothey'll think maybe we're talking something, you know, behind their back.</span> <span id="s99">She would look at me very seriously.</span> <span id="s100">She'd say _________ _________.</span> <span id="s101">And she'd say, "You know, you are Jewish.</span> <span id="s102">You have to speak Jewish."</span> <span id="s103">This is her Jewish language.</span> <span id="s104">She considered that as her religious, Jewish language.</span> <span id="s105">It was written in Hebrew letters, Rashi.</span> <span id="s106">And all her prayers were written in that language.</span> <span id="s107">So she considered that her religion.</span> <span id="s108">She was very religious, and she raised a very, very religious family.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">01:10:46 Anyway, going back to my mother, Rosashe finally managed to go to Sarajevo.</span> <span id="s110">And she falls in love.</span> <span id="s111">She falls in love with a musician.</span> <span id="s112">And what did he play?</span> <span id="s113">Accordion and guitar.</span> <span id="s114">And he had a gorgeous voice.</span> <span id="s115">The moment the family heard a musicianI mean, it was something you should never even consider.</span> <span id="s116">A nice Jewish familyI mean, a girl, a Sephardic girl, to marry a musician who plays for money?</span> <span id="s117">I mean, you are blessed with a voice.</span> <span id="s118">That means that God gave you a gift so you can help and share with other peoplenot to take the money.</span> <span id="s119">But you know, nothing would help.</span> <span id="s120">And as much as they really respected the fatheryou never questioned grandfatherwhatever he said, that was it.</span> <span id="s121">She decided to marrySamuel Poppel (ph.) was his namevery handsome Samuel Poppel.</span> <span id="s122">And she found out very, very early that it was no big deal, because Samuel Poppel played all night and slept all dayand at night, he was out singing __________, which is a Bosnian folk song.</span> <span id="s123">And after she had the babyshe right away had the baby, little Floritza, which is me, she wrote a letter to her father"I want to come home."</span> <span id="s124">And the father came to Sarajevo, he arranged a real Jewish divorce, and took his daughter and little Floritza back to his house.</span> <span id="s125">And she brought shame to the family.</span> <span id="s126">A divorced daughter in the family?</span> <span id="s127">Never heard of it.</span> <span id="s128">Never was a divorce in Vlasenica.</span> <span id="s129">So here she was with a child.</span> <span id="s130">She couldn't meet with a man becausethe single peoplesingle men are not going to looka divorced girl with a baby.</span> <span id="s131">So, she was very lonely.</span> <span id="s132">Her life was spent with her family.</span> <span id="s133">They sang a lot.</span> <span id="s134">They have, every Sunday, a picnic in different gardens.</span> <span id="s135">And there was a lamb on a spit, and a lot of singing.</span> <span id="s136">So that was, really, her life.</span> <span id="s137">And I, actually, was never supposed to ask about Samuel Poppel.</span> <span id="s138">It was something you never asked, you never talked about.</span> <span id="s139">I never saw him.</span> <span id="s140">I don't even know what he looks like.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">01:13:52 But my grandfather went right away to work to find a husband for Rosa.</span> <span id="s142">The marriages were, really, arranged.</span> <span id="s143">The father, the grandfather, would call you, you would kiss his hand, and he would say, "I have a husband for you."</span> <span id="s144">You would kiss his hand again, and you were very happy.</span> <span id="s145">In one way, it was justit was very simple.</span> <span id="s146">You didn't have to worry about the singles, or "Where am I going to meet a man?"</span> <span id="s147">.</span> <span id="s148">And usually, the father knew what theyou know, what kind of man their daughter needs.</span> <span id="s149">So every little town from the Srebenica to Travnik as I told you beforethe families kept in touch, they visited each other, and they knew exactly who had daughters, who had sons, their ages.</span> <span id="s150">And in between the cities, there were such people as Casmententeros, the matchmakers.</span> <span id="s151">They usuallyit was a side job, besides what they were doingand they would get 20 percent here, and 20 percent on the other side.</span> <span id="s152">They would match, give parties.</span> <span id="s153">So they found a match.</span> <span id="s154">And it was a salesman who was traveling from city to city.</span> <span id="s155">They only spoke in Judeo, in Ladino.</span> <span id="s156">The salesman too.</span> <span id="s157">Everything was done in this Ladino language in between them.</span> <span id="s158">So his name was Mikaiel (ph.) PoppelnosorryMikaiel Cabeelio (ph.).</span> <span id="s159">Poppel was my father who I never met.</span> <span id="s160">And Mikaiel Cabeelio comes to Vlasenica, and meets Rosa.</span> <span id="s161">And by golly, she liked him.</span> <span id="s162">She was very picky, you know?</span> <span id="s163">She was a very pretty, pretty girl, pretty woman.</span> <span id="s164">I'll show you a picture latervery pretty.</span> <span id="s165">And they arranged a wedding.</span> <span id="s166">Naturally, I was not at the wedding.</span> <span id="s167">I was sent to play with the cousins.</span> <span id="s168">It was something that was not part of me, whichit hurt, you know, later onwhen you get older, you think back, "Well, how could they do that to me?"</span> <span id="s169">.</span> <span id="s170">You know.</span> <span id="s171">Anyway, she gets married, and they go to the city of Zagreb, a big city.</span> <span id="s172">This is what she wanted to do, to go live in a big city.</span> <span id="s173">And they left.</span> <span id="s174">To my happiness, because I was going to stay with nona.</span> <span id="s175">And I adored that womanjust adored.</span> <span id="s176">I think all the feeling that I have for this Sephardic culture, for stories, for songsit's all really a gift from her to me that I will have for the rest of my life.</span> <span id="s177">It wasI considered her as my mother.</span> <span id="s178">I didn't miss Rosa.</span> <span id="s179">It's sad.</span> <span id="s180">But that's just the way it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">01:16:47</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: How old were you when they got married and left for Zagreb?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Well, before nine.</span> <span id="s184">I was about seven, or maybe even younger, because Inoseven, because I stayed with nona two years, until they got settled.</span> <span id="s185">And then, one day, my grandfather comes in with a hat on, a real hat.</span> <span id="s186">You know, I was used to seeing my grandfather dressed with a _______.</span> <span id="s187">All the Jews in Vlasencia and all these little townsthey were dressed the same as the Moslems.</span> <span id="s188">You wouldn't know which one's which.</span> <span id="s189">They all had ________, and shuck sheers (ph.)that's pantaloon pants.</span> <span id="s190">And he put a hat on because, I guess, he wanted to look a little more modern.</span> <span id="s191">He was going to a big city.</span> <span id="s192">And, oh, it was tough on me.</span> <span id="s193">I hated that day.</span> <span id="s194">I'll never forget it as long as I live.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">01:47:43 My nona gives me an orange bag with the pictures of my family, all my aunts.</span> <span id="s196">And she said __________, don't ever forget your Mishpachah (ph.), which is, really, a Hebrew word.</span> <span id="s197">But it's family.</span> <span id="s198">And she gave me a little gold locket, which I still carry with me all the time.</span> <span id="s199">And she said, "Anywhere you go, carry that with you.</span> <span id="s200">So those were the two very precious things that I had all my life with me, even today.</span> <span id="s201">I'll show it to you later.</span> <span id="s202">01:18:19 Coming to Zagreb is like day and night, a difference of life and people andmy motherI mean, I couldn't recognize my mother before anything else.</span> <span id="s203">She was very dressed up in very beautiful clothes.</span> <span id="s204">And my stepfather, my new father, who adopted meand I became Floritza Cabeeliohe started a necktie business, and she was in business with him, very active, verythis is what she wanted.</span> <span id="s205">This is the kind of life she wanted.</span> <span id="s206">She could not take that small, village existence.</span> <span id="s207">And she mingled withsocially, with the Ashkenazi Jews, who are a little different than the Sephardim in that part of the world.</span> <span id="s208">They were modern.</span> <span id="s209">They were from Austrian background and they spoke German at home.</span> <span id="s210">And socially, this is where she felt more important.</span> <span id="s211">The kosher that was completely gone.</span> <span id="s212">I don't remember anything that was connected to Vlasencica that I could see in her.</span> <span id="s213">We did not speak Ladino.</span> <span id="s214">It was all SerbaCroation.</span> <span id="s215">And not only that.</span> <span id="s216">She had so many things prepared for meI think all the things she wanted for herself that she could never gethad music lessons, piano lessons, ballet, and drawing, and went to Maccabi (ph.)that's like, a health clubthree times a weekhad tickets for the operetta on Sunday afternoonLahar, I knew all the Lahar pieces by heart at the time.</span> <span id="s217">It was too much to take actually.</span> <span id="s218">She had a maid who spoke to me only in German because that was the language, you know, a fine language.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">01:20:25 I couldn'tIthe only thing I would like to do is go back to nona and her Sephardi cooking, and her _________, and ___________, and ___________, all that Sephardi cooking.</span> <span id="s220">It was so good.</span> <span id="s221">And to hear their languageI miss that the most, that Lingua De la Madri.</span> <span id="s222">And besides, I wasn't too crazy about Mikaiel Cabeelio.</span> <span id="s223">I always felt maybe he'll take a knifeand come in my roomI mean, I had that fright, until one day I come out of school, and there is Mikaiel Cabeelio waiting for me.</span> <span id="s224">He said, "Floritza (ph.), we are going to buy a harmonica today."</span> <span id="s225">A harmonica we called an accordion.</span> <span id="s226">And it was my dream to have an accordion.</span> <span id="s227">If you have a harmonica, you are usually very popular.</span> <span id="s228">Everybody wants to be with you.</span> <span id="s229">You can start a partybut just the dream that I would never believe it would happen to meand we go to thisthe store in Zagreb, right near the park, called __________I'll show you that picture tooand, uh, we went to the music store, and he said, "Floritza, pick any one you like."</span> <span id="s230">Well, I saw that little white Honer, 24 base (ph.).</span> <span id="s231">And I said, "That's the one I would like to have."</span> <span id="s232">"That's yours."</span> <span id="s233">And, you know, I fell in love with Mikaiel Cabeelio.</span> <span id="s234">I justhe was my best friend.</span> <span id="s235">The harmonica did it.</span> <span id="s236">And we hopped home through _________, west of the park.</span> <span id="s237">We live in thethe _________ _________ is the name of the street, not far from the railroad station.</span> <span id="s238">And we come home and I'm all excited.</span> <span id="s239">I said to my mother, "look, I have a harmonica."</span> <span id="s240">Oh, she was very pleased.</span> <span id="s241">She knew how much I wanted to have that harmonica.</span> <span id="s242">I took it out, started picking notes.</span> <span id="s243">She says, "Oh, no way.</span> <span id="s244">You are not going to play music the way our family plays, in Vlasenica.</span> <span id="s245">No.</span> <span id="s246">You are not going to play by ear.</span> <span id="s247">You are going to have music lessons.</span> <span id="s248">This is the way the people in big cities do."</span> <span id="s249">And she found a teacher, a charming youngcharming young womanher name was Edat Schatsberg (ph.).</span> <span id="s250">And I took lessons twice a week, walked to her with my little friend, and she loved me.</span> <span id="s251">We just connected, you know?</span> <span id="s252">Not that I would come to the lessonshe would give me a hug and a kissyou know, you don't hug and kiss every student who comes in.</span> <span id="s253">We really developed a deep friendship.</span> <span id="s254">Besides, I was a good student.</span> <span id="s255">I would ask her, "Let me just hear what that sounds like," and I would copy it by ear, and she would say to my mother, "I never had a student like this right away knows the song."</span> <span id="s256">It took two years to get to adjusted to this big city life.</span> <span id="s257">I did get adjusted to pretty clothes.</span> <span id="s258">I never left the house without a hat and gloves.</span> <span id="s259">That was the "Zagreb life", you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">01:24:01 Then '41, and the war started, and everything went down, just from one thing.</span> <span id="s261">Every day was a new day of new pain, and new fright, and new disappointment, and waiting for something terrible to happen everyday.</span> <span id="s262">The first thing that really killed me is we went to school, the teacher gets up, and she says, "Pinto (ph.), Abuhari (ph.), Stein (ph.), Schiller (ph.), Cabeelio, leave and don't come back."</span> <span id="s263">That waskicked you out of school, so you couldn't go back to school.</span> <span id="s264">Then the second day, you were all called to a place, and they put yellow badges on you, badges too, with a `Z'.</span> <span id="s265">Zidov means Jew.</span> <span id="s266">Then everybody had to bring their radios in.</span> <span id="s267">I mean, every day was something frightening.</span> <span id="s268">Then comes Wednesday day it was my music daymusicand that was, to me, a day I lived for, because I always had my lessons all ready for Edat.</span> <span id="s269">And I come to her door, and she opens the door, and there were two German soldiers in the back visiting with her.</span> <span id="s270">This was early '41.</span> <span id="s271">The Germans have come and occupied Zagreb.</span> <span id="s272">She saw me, and she saw my `Z', and she froze.</span> <span id="s273">She said, "Floritza, I can't teach you anymore.</span> <span id="s274">Don't come back."</span> <span id="s275">And that was tough and that was hard.</span> <span id="s276">That was tough.</span> <span id="s277">And I just turned around, and me and my harmonica, my friend, just walked home broken‑hearted, just broken‑hearted.</span> <span id="s278">Since that day, I play only by ear because that was my salvation.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">01:26:08 Everyday was worse and worse.</span> <span id="s280">My father had a friend in Splitthat's a Dalmation Coast that was under Italyand arranged with him successfully to receive some tickets with Gentile names, so we would get away.</span> <span id="s281">I hear my father talk to my mother nextin the next room"This is getting worse.</span> <span id="s282">We have to get out of here.</span> <span id="s283">All three of us can not go to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s284">We'll have to send Floritza first, and then the two of us will follow."</span> <span id="s285">And I couldn'tcouldn't believe what I hear.</span> <span id="s286">Me?</span> <span id="s287">To go alone?</span> <span id="s288">And this is what we had to do.</span> <span id="s289">"What do I take with me?</span> <span id="s290">What do I take with me?"</span> <span id="s291">My mother said, "Take a couple best dress that you have, put it in an old suitcase and, naturally, your harmonica."</span> <span id="s292">And I picked up my nona's orange bag, and a little piece of gold, and I was ready to go.</span> <span id="s293">Our Gentile neighbor was kind enough to take me.</span> <span id="s294">And my father said, "Floritza, the moment you come to that station, to that compartment, don't talk, _________ gavoriti"in SerbaCroatian"samo svira harmonika, just play your harmonica."</span> <span id="s295">And that's what I did.</span> <span id="s296">I sit in the compartment, find myself a little cornerthere were three women sitting there and two menand I took my harmonica out, and I started playing every song I knewrepeat and playand, you know, we had a party because everybody joinedsome soldiers travelingand the conductor camehe didn't even ask me for my ticket.</span> <span id="s297">He sang with us.</span> <span id="s298">It was very beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">01:28:18 Now, the two of usyou know, there's something about a harmonica that I have to tell you.</span> <span id="s300">It isyou can hug it.</span> <span id="s301">See, you put both hands around it, and you always have it almost like a shield and somebody that you could be very close to.</span> <span id="s302">And the two of usyou know what we were going through.</span> <span id="s303">But we sort of spilled everything out through the song.</span> <span id="s304">She saved my life.</span> <span id="s305">She really saved my life.</span> <span id="s306">And many times later, the same thing happened.</span> <span id="s307">This harmonica really came in so handy when I needed it so badly.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">01:29:03 Anyway, we did come to Split and arrived , I found the _________ family waiting for us, two sons and a very, very friendly wife, and we went home.</span> <span id="s309">And every day, I sat at that station waiting for my parents, one day, two days, three days, four days, sitting there.</span> <span id="s310">There were two trains coming in.</span> <span id="s311">2:00 and 6:00.</span> <span id="s312">Finally, the eighth day, I see Mikaiel Cabeelio fat, like this.</span> <span id="s313">I said, "How he'd gethow'dhow'd he gain so much weight?"</span> <span id="s314">.</span> <span id="s315">And later on, I see he put four suits on to save, you know, as much clothes as he could.</span> <span id="s316">He liked clothes, you know?</span> <span id="s317">He loved to look city‑like, pretty.</span> <span id="s318">And that was our new beginning of life in the City of Split, a Dalmation Coast.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Could I ask you a question?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: Please do.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: The day that your teacher said, "Don't come back," did you say anything to her</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q:or did you just turn around and</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: I turned around.</span> <span id="s325">I turned around.</span> <span id="s326">I knew.</span> <span id="s327">What is there to ask?</span> <span id="s328">German soldiers there who were her friends, or brothers, or whatever.</span> <span id="s329">The whole city was in a turmoil with this"Jew can only walk on the street, you can only go to the store"I mean, it was every daythat this was just part of bad things happening, that just was one thing after another.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">01:30:36</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Did the same thing happen to you with your friends who were now Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: I didn't see my friends anymore.</span> <span id="s333">Nobody came around anymore.</span> <span id="s334">Not that they were bad people.</span> <span id="s335">They were afraid.</span> <span id="s336">They were afraid.</span> <span id="s337">The moment and theevery knock on the door was something thatyou would freeze"Uh oh, now what?"</span> <span id="s338">and they were already taking people to the camps, see.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">01:31:04</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: What did you know about what the Nazis were doing</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: What did I know the Nazis were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q:at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A:All I knew is that they are conquering, going from country to country, and killing Jews.</span> <span id="s344">That's all I knew.</span> <span id="s345">A teenager is not so much into politics.</span> <span id="s346">They're with school and friendsand maybe go to a dance or learn a new songa teenager, a young teenager.</span> <span id="s347">I knew there was danger.</span> <span id="s348">I knew that they didn't like me.</span> <span id="s349">I also knew to get away from them as fast as you can.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">01:32:42</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: But you knew that they were killing Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s353">Oh yes.</span> <span id="s354">So we knew that they don't want us alive.</span> <span id="s355">I did not hear of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s356">I didn't hear of these places yet, no.</span> <span id="s357">It was too early.</span> <span id="s358">But the rumor was "Get away.</span> <span id="s359">Otherwise, you will not be alive."</span> <span id="s360">This was right from the beginning and this was why my father worked so hard to get out of Zagreb and thanks to him we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">01:32:18</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: And this friend of his, was he somebody who was in business?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: The friend of his, Sylvia, was a friend of his.</span> <span id="s364">He also came from Sarajevo.</span> <span id="s365">They were friends as children.</span> <span id="s366">Then he moved to Split, the City of Split and luckily was able enough to send us tickets with gentile names.</span> <span id="s367">All three of us were gentiles.</span> <span id="s368">And it worked.</span> <span id="s369">For hundreds of them it didn't work because then it became a regular thing, that they knew--"let me look--is this the right paper"--this was the beginning in '41.</span> <span id="s370">So in Split, we found a room, started a new life, my mother found a music teacher right away and I continued my lessons.</span> <span id="s371">It lasted a couple months, not too much because refugees were coming from all over the place to Split.</span> <span id="s372">The City couldn't take so many new people.</span> <span id="s373">So instead of sending them to Germany, which they were supposed to do, they sent them to different islands on the Adriatic Sea.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">01:33:38</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Who's the "they"?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: The Italians.</span> <span id="s377">And they to me were the most wonderful people in the world.</span> <span id="s378">I still--I hear an Italian language, I hear an Italian song, I meet an Italian--I melt because they gave us life.</span> <span id="s379">So they send about 300 Jews to Korcula Island.</span> <span id="s380">That is about three or four hours by boat--beautiful Adriatic Sea.</span> <span id="s381">And we started a new life on this island--nothing to do.</span> <span id="s382">The men were going absolutely crazy.</span> <span id="s383">The worst was that they were not in contact with the world, to what was going on.</span> <span id="s384">We didn't have a radio.</span> <span id="s385">You didn't have news.</span> <span id="s386">Once a day a boat would come in, a ship, from Split.</span> <span id="s387">And everybody would be there--01:34:46 "What's new, what's new?"</span> <span id="s388">.</span> <span id="s389">I became a harmonica player on the island, walked aroundand anybody who was celebrating anything would call Floritza.</span> <span id="s390">And I became a teacher.</span> <span id="s391">My students were all older, but I was a teacher.</span> <span id="s392">They had big accordions.</span> <span id="s393">I had a small Honer.</span> <span id="s394">My student was a butcher's daughter, she would bring a piece of meat, a baker's daughter--I got a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s395">And I had olive oil, and bread, and meat, and cheese--we were rich.</span> <span id="s396">We had a house full of food.</span> <span id="s397">We ate.</span> <span id="s398">It was wonderful.</span> <span id="s399">The diet on the island was sardines.</span> <span id="s400">That was it.</span> <span id="s401">We ate sardines two and one half years.</span> <span id="s402">But you know, thinking now, now that we're into a fish diet--we ate sardines and big long leaves like kale a lot of it grew all over the island, and breadgood diet.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">01:35:53 Life was tough on parents.</span> <span id="s404">We childrenwe had no worriesyou know, we swam all day.</span> <span id="s405">But the men organized sort of a school among themselves to teach because we didn't go to school.</span> <span id="s406">So, we had language lessons.</span> <span id="s407">We studied English, and we studied Italian, and we studied stenography.</span> <span id="s408">We studied anything that anybody was able to teach.</span> <span id="s409">And that came in later very handy, very, very handy.</span> <span id="s410">We lived there for two and a half years.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">01:36:33</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Where did you live on the island?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: We lived in different houses, whoever had a room to give us.</span> <span id="s414">With the natives.</span> <span id="s415">We went from room to room, from house to house, seeing who has a room to let.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">01:36:48</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: So what is the relationship between you and the Italians who were occupying--</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: These were Yugoslavs.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: These were Yugoslav?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">01:36:56</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: These were Yugoslav islands, former Yugoslav.</span> <span id="s422">Speaking SerbaCroatia with a dialect of Italy, butand they were occupied by Italy.</span> <span id="s423">But they were Yugoslav, spoke the language and generous-- how would you like somebody to come to your house tomorrow, a bunch of refugees-- and says "here, have a room", not so easy.</span> <span id="s424">Every house, more or less, had a refugee family and we had a room and a half, starting from scratch, from nothing, you know one box or something--a barrel to use as a table, I mean nothing.</span> <span id="s425">Two and a half years we lived--I made a lot of friendships with the local friends, boys and girls--we sang and we swam had a good time.</span> <span id="s426">_____________ until one day my father says Floritza the captain of the island knows you well because he likes your music and I'm going to get permission from him to go to Split to buy you a bigger harmonica, because yours is a child's harmonica.</span> <span id="s427">And he did.</span> <span id="s428">That same day the most horrible news came to the island.</span> <span id="s429">The Germans are retreating, going up north, coming through the islands.</span> <span id="s430">Well, I was very much frightened.</span> <span id="s431">The decision I had to make is do I go with all the local friends to the forest to become a partisan, because that's what they decided to do.</span> <span id="s432">Or to stay with mother who was going crazy "My Mikaiel.</span> <span id="s433">My Mikaiel.</span> <span id="s434">My Mikaiel."</span> <span id="s435">I naturally stayed with my mother.</span> <span id="s436">And that night, late at night, very stormy horrible night, we all got in a tug boat and went over to Italy.</span> <span id="s437">Again, what do I take with me--hurry, hurry, hurry.</span> <span id="s438">My orange bag, my harmonica was gone, which was the worst, and my nona's little gold piece--and we were on our way.</span> <span id="s439">The most horrible, horrible trip toward the mainland of Italy.</span> <span id="s440">We traveled nights.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">01:39:25</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Why was it so horrible?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: Well, the weather was very, very bad and the Germans--You could hear planes overhead bombarding everything before leaving.</span> <span id="s444">It was frightening.</span> <span id="s445">And we were afraid to travel during the day.</span> <span id="s446">So we, you know, hid during the day, traveled at night.</span> <span id="s447">Finally arrived to the main land of Italy, two days later.</span> <span id="s448">It was like arriving to a promised land.</span> <span id="s449">I mean it, when we saw that land, You know.</span> <span id="s450">And there were boats all over the place.</span> <span id="s451">People coming from all over the place to Italy.</span> <span id="s452">And the scene that I will never forget was the Italian women dressed in black with big, big, big baskets of grapes, black grapes.</span> <span id="s453">And we were hungry.</span> <span id="s454">That was great.</span> <span id="s455">Anyway, all the refugees came to the Piazza, the middle of the city, and a couple of the organizations, humanitarian organizations, had big tables full of clothes and they took care of our daily needs of bread, but they couldn't find places for you to live.</span> <span id="s456">So it became the same situation as when we arrived to Korcula--door to door.</span> <span id="s457">The worst was my mother, to live with my mother, that was the worst.</span> <span id="s458">I mean she cried about her Mikaiel.</span> <span id="s459">It was impossible.</span> <span id="s460">So at the Piazza I would say "You sit with this one and that one"--there were so many refugees there.</span> <span id="s461">I would go from house to house from apartment house door to door and see if we can find a place to stay.</span> <span id="s462">And after walking about six hours, you know, a lot of them had a way of "No, gratzi" and close the door, you know.</span> <span id="s463">I come to a door, knocked on the door and here comes this big heavy set lady dressed up pretty.</span> <span id="s464">And I explained to her my situation.</span> <span id="s465">Thank god I had learned Italian.</span> <span id="s466">And, uh, that I need a room, just my mother and I. "I have a room for you.</span> <span id="s467">Bring your mother."</span> <span id="s468">So I ran to get my mother to come in.</span> <span id="s469">She had a, what you call a " ."</span> <span id="s470">A little room.</span> <span id="s471">That was just for her and a couch that she gave to my mother, and two chairs together for me.</span> <span id="s472">And we had--this was a start of a new life in Bali.</span> <span id="s473">You go to the bathroom, you couldn't get in the bathroom.</span> <span id="s474">There were women coming in and out all the time, all night.</span> <span id="s475">And we found out she was running a prostitution, house for the prostitution.</span> <span id="s476">So, but she was a good women.</span> <span id="s477">I mean, good hearted lady.</span> <span id="s478">See, she shared.</span> <span id="s479">Okay?</span> <span id="s480">And we stayed there a couple of days and kept on looking.</span> <span id="s481">There was nothing to do.</span> <span id="s482">We walked the streets.</span> <span id="s483">And everybody would come to this Piazza.</span> <span id="s484">Everybody was coming to the Piazza--"What's new, did you hear anything?</span> <span id="s485">Who arrived, what news did they bring?"</span> <span id="s486">They were arriving every day with this horrible news.</span> <span id="s487">All the Jews in Split were killed and all the Jews from Belgrade are gone.</span> <span id="s488">Nothing good.</span> <span id="s489">And my mother Rosa, she was hard to live with.</span> <span id="s490">She was sure Mikaiel was finished.</span> <span id="s491">So one day, I don't know how many days after we found this lovely room.</span> <span id="s492">We were walking down the street and all of a sudden I hear my mother, I hear her screaming.</span> <span id="s493">A piercing scream right through you.</span> <span id="s494">And I turn and I see her frozen.</span> <span id="s495">And I look in front of me and I see Mikaiel Cabeelio.</span> <span id="s496">Okay.</span> <span id="s497">You know, everything in the story is smooth until it comes to this scene.</span> <span id="s498">Because there's just no way that I can explain this scene.</span> <span id="s499">I don't even know if, uh, Spielberg or whoever it is that makes a movie could duplicate a scene like that.</span> <span id="s500">See, it was so human and so, uh, unbelievable.</span> <span id="s501">Soso everybody stood and everybody cried.</span> <span id="s502">And he says--"You're alive.</span> <span id="s503">They told me everyone in Corsila is gone.</span> <span id="s504">You're alive."</span> <span id="s505">Well, it was the most wonderful reunion and new way to start.</span> <span id="s506">Where do we go to sleep.</span> <span id="s507">Again, door to door.</span> <span id="s508">Door to door.</span> <span id="s509">We found a small little apartment, Cassa Popalari.</span> <span id="s510">It was a place that Mussolini built for the underprivileged and the poor.</span> <span id="s511">A whole unit, unit of little apartments.</span> <span id="s512">And we end up very--we were very lucky.</span> <span id="s513">And a new life started.</span> <span id="s514">And thank god for the lessons, I found myself a job.</span> <span id="s515">American army, they were hiring civilians, their offices.</span> <span id="s516">And I come in and say I'm a typist.</span> <span id="s517">They were hiring civilians.</span> <span id="s518">And there was a very friendly Lieutenant Evans from Indiana and he says "well sure come in and, here type this."</span> <span id="s519">And I started this (type with two fingers) and the poor guy knew right away I'm not a very good typist.</span> <span id="s520">He says Signorina-- they all called us Signorina.</span> <span id="s521">We were all Signorinas.</span> <span id="s522">--You know Signorina I have a better job for you.</span> <span id="s523">-- He really had a heart.</span> <span id="s524">And uh, he takes me to the next office and he says--You see, this is a salvage depot were they bring all the material that is left and brought into Bali-- American army material.</span> <span id="s525">So he says, uh, --"Every morning there's a big black board, write what's the day, the date, and then a young Corporal is going to bring you a piece of paper with numbers.</span> <span id="s526">And you take these numbers and copy them in this book ."</span> <span id="s527">That was my job, perfect.</span> <span id="s528">And every lunch hour he would teach me English and he would bring peanut butter sandwiches and when I saw peanut butter first time, "ewe", you know, it was not a very pretty sight, until I got used to the taste.</span> <span id="s529">And one day this very handsome Sergeant walks in.</span> <span id="s530">I mean handsome.</span> <span id="s531">His name was Sergeant Harry Jagoda and he comes from Youngsten, Ohio--and very devilish.</span> <span id="s532">All the girls went with him.</span> <span id="s533">Full of jokes.</span> <span id="s534">And II also was thought his name was BTO.</span> <span id="s535">And later I found out it was Big Time Operator.</span> <span id="s536">And if you needed a jeep you would go to Sergeant Jagoda.</span> <span id="s537">If you needed eggs he would fly to Africa and bring back eggs.</span> <span id="s538">I mean he really was a big time operator.</span> <span id="s539">he walks to my desk and he says " Would you like to go to a Sergeant's dance?"</span> <span id="s540">I said, well, I have to ask my parents.</span> <span id="s541">--"Where are your parents?"</span> <span id="s542">--Well, this is where we live.</span> <span id="s543">-- "Well can I come and ask your parents?"</span> <span id="s544">--Sure.</span> <span id="s545">See, you couldn't get out of the house after six o'clock they call it at war time.</span> <span id="s546">He come to our house he really does, full of presents.</span> <span id="s547">He had a blanket and all kind of good things, you know.</span> <span id="s548">And it was Rosh Hashanahand my father had a Machzur, a prayer book on the table.</span> <span id="s549">Well, he looks at the book and he couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s550">He says "____________."</span> <span id="s551">And my father says "Look at .</span> <span id="s552">You.</span> <span id="s553">"Sure we're Jews".</span> <span id="s554">Well, that was big excitement because he was Jewish too.</span> <span id="s555">And my father says yes, we can go and we all went together.</span> <span id="s556">We married that June 24, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Was he your first boyfriend?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: No, I had boyfriends before.</span> <span id="s559">I had quite a bit of boyfriends before.</span> <span id="s560">My first boyfriend actually was in Zagreb right before we left and uh, I saw him quite often.</span> <span id="s561">In fact I received a very beautiful picture of him.</span> <span id="s562">I'll show you the picture.</span> <span id="s563">Uh, asking my father to help him that his parents were already taken away.</span> <span id="s564">My father didn't.</span> <span id="s565">And I never forgive him for that.</span> <span id="s566">The poor guy I guess, you know.</span> <span id="s567">War time, everybody watches their own head.</span> <span id="s568">Everybody thinks about themselves.</span> <span id="s569">And that's what happened, you become kind of selfish, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s570">So, who knows where he is today?</span> <span id="s571">Who knows--a very handsome boy.</span> <span id="s572">Anyway, I was going to go to America.</span> <span id="s573">And Harry asks "Are you ready?</span> <span id="s574">Could you leave your parents?"</span> <span id="s575">I said well, well maybe they'll follow me.</span> <span id="s576">What did we have in Italy.</span> <span id="s577">Just broken memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: How was the wedding?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: My wedding was gorgeous.</span> <span id="s580">I mean, I could spend hours telling about my real American army wedding.</span> <span id="s581">He brought a half a parachute so I could make my gown and all the lingerie.</span> <span id="s582">He brought a piece of leather and we made the shoes.</span> <span id="s583">The whole company came to the wedding and hamburgers to order, hours of making hamburgers and the cook made a big cake and we had a big orchestra.</span> <span id="s584">And everybody kissed the bride.</span> <span id="s585">You know how many kisses I had.</span> <span id="s586">Anyway, beautiful memory.</span> <span id="s587">Uh, Sergeant Jagoda had to go back to America, it was the end of the war.</span> <span id="s588">I stayed behind and left after.</span> <span id="s589">One day coming from work my father, is sitting next to Rosa and she is, I mean a stage again in that I would never imagine her to be in.</span> <span id="s590">She received a letter from her brother.</span> <span id="s591">It was a day before I left for America and the brother, Lezo (ph.), writing to her that he is the only survivor of the whole Altarc Family.</span> <span id="s592">I left the next day.</span> <span id="s593">It wasn't fair to her but my ticket and Red Cross Papers from Naples, everything was ready to go.</span> <span id="s594">And I left.</span> <span id="s595">I arrived to America and it was almost like reading a book and saying "I'll never go back."</span> <span id="s596">I'll never this way.</span> <span id="s597">Let me start a new life.</span> <span id="s598">It's a beautiful country.</span> <span id="s599">I fell in love with the country the moment-- I spent a week, I said "This is it, this is a dream come true."</span> <span id="s600">Anyway, a life went raising children.</span> <span id="s601">And grand-children.</span> <span id="s602">Taught music.</span> <span id="s603">'Till one day, I mean, I did go back.</span> <span id="s604">I went back the first time with my son Andy and Lori, just to see Vlasenica.</span> <span id="s605">But, you know, I was so into being an American lady, an American mother, raising American children and even giving them names like my oldest daughter, her name is Betty Lou (ph.).</span> <span id="s606">She hates that Lou.</span> <span id="s607">To me it sounded so American.</span> <span id="s608">Okay?</span> <span id="s609">Anything that would be American was just a dream come true.</span> <span id="s610">So I didn't even want to mentally think what happened to this one, or when it happened, or how it happened.</span> <span id="s611">I wanted to be an American.</span> <span id="s612">So going back to years or how many years I could go back to go to this point where I came to 40 years later, sometimes you don't see day‑to‑day.</span> <span id="s613">But in the whole.</span> <span id="s614">You could see I spent great 40 years just being busy with things I love to do.</span> <span id="s615">Mostly raising children.</span> <span id="s616">I filled my house with song and folk dancing and folk singing.</span> <span id="s617">And it was always parties and maybe I was covering up.</span> <span id="s618">You know?</span> <span id="s619">Covering up what I didn't want to think about.</span> <span id="s620">Kept always very busy.</span> <span id="s621">And when I went back with Andy and Lori the first time, my son Andy tells me "Mom, you act so American.</span> <span id="s622">You dress in pants."</span> <span id="s623">And I didn't even want to even know what happened, I talked to nobody.</span> <span id="s624">And then the second time I went with my whole family it was for my 40th anniversary present from Harry to give concerts.</span> <span id="s625">We went from Belgrade to Zagreb to Novisca to Sarajevo.</span> <span id="s626">Bringing all these songs back to all these communities that have not heard these Sephardic Songs for years.</span> <span id="s627">I, myself, could not sing these songs in front of my mother.</span> <span id="s628">My mother arrived three years latertwo years later to America and Rosa was a, really a holocaust victim .</span> <span id="s629">She was never the Rosa that I knew.</span> <span id="s630">I wish myI wish my children would have met Rosa the way she was vivacious and romantic and full of spark.</span> <span id="s631">She was always very depressed and what hurt her the most was she was very a proud Jewish and the communities that we lived in --it was only Yiddish her generation.</span> <span id="s632">One day she asked me "What is shiksah (ph.)?</span> <span id="s633">What is shiksah?"</span> <span id="s634">That hurt a lot.</span> <span id="s635">That hurt her a lot.</span> <span id="s636">She couldn't take this uh, the whole life around her that was Jewish life and it was not her kind of Judaism.</span> <span id="s637">The language was tough and you couldn't sing in front of her, the Ladino songs.</span> <span id="s638">She would say "My harmony died."</span> <span id="s639">See her sisters and her brothers, they had an unbelievable sense of harmony.</span> <span id="s640">You would start a melody, they would harmonize it either way.</span> <span id="s641">No notes.</span> <span id="s642">And if you hear, if you would sing in front of her, her face would go like this, you know.</span> <span id="s643">She developed a policy.</span> <span id="s644">So there was no Ladino singing till after her death.</span> <span id="s645">Then people approached me, "You are Sephardic, do you know anything about Sephardic Music?"</span> <span id="s646">Well, do I know enough about Sephardic Music.</span> <span id="s647">It was just sort of inside.</span> <span id="s648">And the first time was when the Rockville Jewish Community Center had a Sephardic Music Festival and that was '77.</span> <span id="s649">And I performed that day.</span> <span id="s650">And since that day it just poured out.</span> <span id="s651">And here I am, still doing it full time.</span> <span id="s652">Not just myself, but with two daughters and a son, and we just do the same thing--I think what my nona did in Vlasenica.</span> <span id="s653">Same thing, just going around and singing for people and bringing music.</span> <span id="s654">So the second trip was just to go and give concerts which again, I had nothing to do with questioning or asking, but came in as a performer.</span> <span id="s655">And all of a sudden again we go back, the children leave and marry and, again you start dreaming.</span> <span id="s656">It's terrible.</span> <span id="s657">And I had this overwhelming need, I don't know, growing in me somewhere to go back.</span> <span id="s658">And that wasI talk to myself.</span> <span id="s659">I say "Its crazy.</span> <span id="s660">This is 43 years after, it's forgotten."</span> <span id="s661">But I couldn't fight it.</span> <span id="s662">I had to go back and see what happened to this family that I loved, with my own eyes.</span> <span id="s663">Maybe Uncle Lazo didn't have the story straight.</span> <span id="s664">Maybe my motherI mean, I foundI started looking for excuses that I had to go back to find out for myself.</span> <span id="s665">And I did.</span> <span id="s666">I have a wonderful husband who puts up with all this.</span> <span id="s667">Very supportive.</span> <span id="s668">And we went back to Vlasenica 43 years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: So when I stoppedgo back to the .</span></p> <p><span id="s671">02:00:07</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: Flory, before we go to the time that you returned to really find out what happened to your family, I'd like to go back to thosefirst to those two years that you spent with your grandmother, while your mother and her new husband are off in Zagreb--Tell me a little about the kind of relationship that you had.</span> <span id="s673">What she taught you.</span> <span id="s674">What you talked about, if that was part of your relationship, because she's obviously a very important person to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">02:00:39</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: Well, the most important personI told you before she is the kind of a nona that a grandchild dreams of having.</span> <span id="s677">I think what tied me to her more than anything else was the music, because I was very much of the music myself.</span> <span id="s678">And, uh, she had a full drawer of lyrics.</span> <span id="s679">She really had a hobby.</span> <span id="s680">And my mother was one of the best singers too.</span> <span id="s681">She was way ahead of her time because she played a guitar.</span> <span id="s682">And what girl played a guitar in Vlasenica?</span> <span id="s683">And her sister Hannah too.</span> <span id="s684">The boys all played tambouritzas (ph.), and violins, and guitars, by ear.</span> <span id="s685">And every woman had el pandereta, the tambourine.</span> <span id="s686">I mean there was no wedding, or bar mitzvah, or festivity, where this Altarac family were not asked to come and do the music with my nona, Henia (ph.), which was beautiful.</span> <span id="s687">And I think why I was so close to her is because of her music, because of hernaturally, cooking.</span> <span id="s688">But teaching us the music, teaching us the prayers, seethe prayers were all in this little book that was only for women, Machzur (ph.).</span> <span id="s689">And in Ladino andwould you like to hear a prayer?</span> <span id="s690">I have one that is La Bendision Di Madrethat is, Mother's Benedictionwhich you usually singa woman sings as her husband, or her sons, or her sons‑in‑law, went to the synagogue to pray for her and the whole Mishpacha (ph.), the family.</span> <span id="s691">So she's thanking God for giving her children to continue.</span> <span id="s692">So she sings in this veryI mean, the style is very Bosnia, because the languageyes, it's 15th Century, Castillian (ph.).</span> <span id="s693">We know that.</span> <span id="s694">Today it's a mixture of many languages.</span> <span id="s695">Because wherever they settled, they picked up the words from that country, because they forgot the real Castillian Spanish.</span> <span id="s696">So the Ladino that we know today has a lot of Turkish words, has a lot of Slavish words, Italianlike nona, in real Spanish language, is abuella.</span> <span id="s697">So nona is Italian.</span> <span id="s698">And we all called our grandmothers nona.</span> <span id="s699">And the rhythms have changed.</span> <span id="s700">They adopted the rhythms of the region where they settled.</span> <span id="s701">So the Ladino, as we know today, is a mixture of rhythms from different countries and many words that were added to the realso she is thanking to God for giving her children.</span></p> <p><span

its own style that was part of a Sephardic-Bosnian household that you don't write and you don't teach.</span> <span id="s712">You just pick it up as you live in that household.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: Did she have a sense of humor?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">02:05:58</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: A lot of sense of humor.</span> <span id="s716">She had sense of humor, and she was very generous.</span> <span id="s717">On Friday, every Friday, at 2:00, we all had to come home from school.</span> <span id="s718">At 2:00, she had all the baskets ready.</span> <span id="s719">She called it "la tsedaka," (ph.) the good deed.</span> <span id="s720">And she would have prepared food for the poor.</span> <span id="s721">And we, the children, would deliver the baskets of food.</span> <span id="s722">And she would always say, , "Don't wait that they should tell you thank you," , "You are lucky that you can give."</span> <span id="s723">That is what ties us to nona.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">02:06:51 On Saturday morning, all the daughters las fijas, las nietas, the granddaughters, the daughter‑in‑lawsthey would all come "a besar le mano de nona", to kiss her hand, and wish her Bueno Shabbat, a good sabbath.</span> <span id="s725">And she would be sitting there with her , the little hat, that ishat covering that all the Sephardic women wore.</span> <span id="s726">And her pockets were always full of the , the candy.</span> <span id="s727">In the afternoon, the men would comeall afternoon to study the Torah with the grandfather.</span> <span id="s728">He was a very important man in that household.</span> <span id="s729">He was the king.</span> <span id="s730">I mean, to have himif you don't feel good, if my nonu (ph.) would come, and just put his hand on your forehead you'd feel better.</span> <span id="s731">That's so much power, see, of a family leader.</span> <span id="s732">So the whole afternoon, they would be reading and studying.</span> <span id="s733">Toward the evening, my nona, as I rememberfor years, she always had , a headache.</span> <span id="s734">So she would take a potato, and she would slice the potato, and she would put in a hanky, , and she would put it on her forehead, and she wouldthey felt and believed that that draws the heat.</span> <span id="s735">Try it, you know, it's just a potato.</span> <span id="s736">And with a potato on her headand also a cigarettethey were heavy smokers.</span> <span id="s737">All the women smoked with their Muslim neighbors and their strong Turkish coffee, , , all the littlea little coffee pot with the round little cup.</span> <span id="s738">They smoked and drank coffee all the time.</span> <span id="s739">So with the first cigarette and potato on her head, she was just like a new nona until next weekend again.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">02:09:07 Each one of the songs that I'm telling youstories had a song that I performed, because I have written all the holiday songs.</span> <span id="s741">Thinking of this wonderful family, wonderful aunts, and going from house to housethat that this is what childhood was all about to me that tied me to this little town that I could notI mean, Zagrebthe big‑city life could never make it up to me, you know.</span> <span id="s742">I missed this closeness of the Mishpacha a lot.</span> <span id="s743">She used to sing songs like, oh, fromnot only religious songsbut she was full of long stories, like 20, 25, verses.</span> <span id="s744">And eveningshow were evenings spent?</span> <span id="s745">I mean, no television, no radio.</span> <span id="s746">You sang and you tell stories.</span> <span id="s747">All her stories were told cappella singing, real old Bosnian style.</span> <span id="s748">One of the songs that she really was good at, because we loved itit was a song of a slave whose name was Andeletto (ph.).</span> <span id="s749">And Andeletto was a slave who the Queen was in love with.</span> <span id="s750">And, actually, the Queen had two sons with Andeletto, and she had two sons with the King too.</span> <span id="s751">So she's singing to Andeletto, "Mi Andeletto," "My Andeletto, I love you more than the King and his Kingdom.</span> <span id="s752">And your sons are always in my arms.</span> <span id="s753">And sons of the King have gold and horses."</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Andeletto, Mi Andeletto Mi que (ph.) ditu en amourado I(ph.) Mi que ditu (ph.) en amourado Mas de kill (ph.) y mas diamour (ph.) Que le de e con amourado I Que le de e con surdanadu (ph.) And this goes for 25 verses.</span> <span id="s755">But this was her style of telling stories.</span> <span id="s756">So naturally, once I left this nona, the life was never the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">02:11:56</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: Did she ever talk to you about your mother and being</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: No.</span> <span id="s762">That was never touched.</span> <span id="s763">The father was not touched.</span> <span id="s764">The mother was not touched.</span> <span id="s765">Just the family daily life was spoken.</span> <span id="s766">Never about her.</span> <span id="s767">ActuallyRosa never returned to Vlasenica.</span> <span id="s768">She never came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: So, she never saw her mother once she left?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: No.</span> <span id="s771">She never came back to Vlasenica.</span> <span id="s772">Her summers were spent in fancy resorts on the Dalmation Coast.</span> <span id="s773">I was all dressed up and went with her.</span> <span id="s774">I couldn't wait for summers to go back to nona.</span> <span id="s775">But she never returned.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: So you would go back in the summertime?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: When the school would stop, I'd get on the train, go to nona's.</span> <span id="s778">She never went back.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">02:12:54</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: What was it like for you after being with nona for two years alone, essentially without your mother and the man who would become your father, when you first saw your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: It was terrible.</span> <span id="s782">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s783">I knew that was my mom.</span> <span id="s784">But I had no closeness only because of the not being able to know about who Samuel Poppel was.</span> <span id="s785">I was not part of her life.</span> <span id="s786">There must have been something closed, where I did not fit, I guess, at that time in her life, see?</span> <span id="s787">And I think that was the reason of being far away, one from the other.</span> <span id="s788">She gave me all of the beautiful things.</span> <span id="s789">I have really benefited out of things she gave me in Zagreb.</span> <span id="s790">I mean, I'm a musician today, I go do aerobics like everybody else, and I play golf, and I do many things, because she opened the world to me, see?</span> <span id="s791">If I would have lived in Vlasenica, I would just do what nona told me, and I would teach my child, and just go on.</span> <span id="s792">So I benefited a lot from her culturally.</span> <span id="s793">But I didn't get the love that a child needs from a mother, see?</span> <span id="s794">It was very foreign.</span> <span id="s795">The whole life in Zagreb was foreign for me at the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">02:14:31</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: Did you think that in some way she didn't want you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: She wanted me there.</span> <span id="s799">She left the idea that I would come in two years after they got settled right away.</span> <span id="s800">And when I arrived, everything was laid outwhat I'm going to be doing.</span> <span id="s801">She wanted me there, definitely.</span> <span id="s802">I had letters from her all the time, packages, clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: When you were with nona?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: When I was with nona, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: And did you write her also?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: Yes, I wrote to her.</span> <span id="s807">I wrote letters, usually, what goes on in school.</span> <span id="s808">I sent her drawings, because I was very good in drawing.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">02:15:14</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: Did you become close as time went on, or was there always a distance?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: I don't know how close did we become because she was a very business person.</span> <span id="s812">She was very busy.</span> <span id="s813">I gotI became very close to the maid.</span> <span id="s814">She was a great woman.</span> <span id="s815">But, you know, she worked all day and went out at night to dinners.</span> <span id="s816">No, we never had a time really to get close.</span> <span id="s817">Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: And her husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">02:15:45</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: Her husband adored her, absolutely adored her.</span> <span id="s821">And they were a wonderful couple together, see?</span> <span id="s822">And he was good to me afterward.</span> <span id="s823">After I had my harmonica.</span> <span id="s824">Then it was great.</span> <span id="s825">But when she came to America, the sad part of it, seeing this successful, proud woman to become nothing, broken up, just a broken birdthat was the saddest thing for me to see.</span> <span id="s826">And she ended up in a nursing home because she developedshe had arteriolar sclerosis.</span> <span id="s827">He had strokes.</span> <span id="s828">They were young and they were very old.</span> <span id="s829">They were hurt and they suffered all the time.</span> <span id="s830">They both ended up in a Hebrew home.</span> <span id="s831">She would not let him go alone.</span> <span id="s832">He had to go.</span> <span id="s833">I mean, he was really, completely paralyzed.</span> <span id="s834">But she would not let him go alone.</span> <span id="s835">She wanted to go to.</span> <span id="s836">And the last scenes that I see of this couple that were so successful and so beautifulin a Hebrew, she is pushing his wheelchairhe was in a wheelchairlike nothing, and she spoke to him only in Ladino, and he sang only Ladino songs.</span> <span id="s837">And she spoke to him only in the language that she wanted to get away from.</span> <span id="s838">She went right back to it.</span> <span id="s839">That was tough.</span> <span id="s840">It was tough to see, see?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">02:17:32 The meantime, when I did go back to Vlasenica, my cousin thereI had a cousinactually, we will go back and forth a little bit, until we come sort of in the middle.</span> <span id="s842">She was the last survivor of the Altarac family in Vlasenica, the only Jewish girl in Vlasenica.</span> <span id="s843">And, uh, she lived in her father's house, my mother's brother, Layzo (ph.), and she was a professor in a local high school.</span> <span id="s844">And when my husbandmy husband said, "Okay, we'll go," I said, "Let's go and spend our Rosh Hashana with her.</span> <span id="s845">So we went to Vlasenica andto my Uncle Layzo's houseshe had a friend, Soyanovanovich (ph.), who was the Vlasenica newspaperwas a journalist.</span> <span id="s846">He knew what I came for.</span> <span id="s847">He knew what I was searching for.</span> <span id="s848">He also made his business to research, a little bit, the Jewish Bosnian community, of Altarac.</span> <span id="s849">So he said to me, "Flory, I will meet you tomorrow and we will cover the whole Vlasenica."</span> <span id="s850">He was there 9:00 in the morning with his camera.</span> <span id="s851">And naturally, we went from house to house.</span> <span id="s852">But I've seen these houses before, when I went with my children.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">02:19:18 Something else I was searching for.</span> <span id="s854">I was looking for the roses in the windows of my aunts.</span> <span id="s855">Carnations-- They loved flowers.</span> <span id="s856">I went to the cemetery.</span> <span id="s857">I was searching for gardens, where we had picnics every Sundaythe , we called itlooking for different things than when I was there the first time, just to show them I'm an American lady with my American children, and I'm all dressed up in pants.</span> <span id="s858">So wefinally, he said, "Well, I don't have a car.</span> <span id="s859">But we'll take a little trip.</span> <span id="s860">It's about six to seven kilometers from Vlasenica."</span> <span id="s861">And we rented athere were two taxis in all of Vlasenica.</span> <span id="s862">We took one, which unfortunately broke down half way.</span> <span id="s863">So we walked up.</span> <span id="s864">It was quite a walk up.</span> <span id="s865">And we stopped at a farm, and he called the farmer out.</span> <span id="s866">He had his wife there, and the cow, and thereal farm lookand he said, "Could we go down to the valley.</span> <span id="s867">I would like to show them the place."</span> <span id="s868">And the farmer in his little Bosnian accent said " ," "Why not?</span> <span id="s869">Go."</span> <span id="s870">So we went over one fence, and another fence, and another fence, just going down.</span> <span id="s871">I have pictures of that.</span> <span id="s872">I would really like to showshare this with you.</span> <span id="s873">And there was a small tree in the middle.</span> <span id="s874">Everything was surrounded with this beautiful forest of pine trees which is known in the whole area, valley.</span> <span id="s875">And in the valley there was a ravine?</span> <span id="s876">Is this what you call it, ravine?</span> <span id="s877">And the farmer says, "I bought this farm in 1956.</span> <span id="s878">And one day, we had a storm that lasted three, four, days, rain, rain, rain.</span> <span id="s879">And it just filled up with water.</span> <span id="s880">One day, the pigs, the dogsthey're all walking around with human bones in their mouths.</span> <span id="s881">And I got all excited.</span> <span id="s882">I went down and followed them.</span> <span id="s883">And this ravine was filled with bodies that came up."</span> <span id="s884">And the farmer stood there and he said, "That's where your family is.</span> <span id="s885">All of them."</span> <span id="s886">42 people, nona, the daughters, the grandchildren, the babies, bottles.</span> <span id="s887">All of them.</span> <span id="s888">All the songs, the culture.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">02:22:51 The story was that a , who worked with Germans, in 1942, had the local Muslims do the killing.</span> <span id="s890">They took all the men and closed them in a big barn, and went to every house, and forced the women to dig backyards, because they, for some reason, had the idea that every Jew had gold, which was not the truth.</span> <span id="s891">They had stores-- were ordinary people.</span> <span id="s892">Store in front.</span> <span id="s893">The family works in the back, or upstairs.</span> <span id="s894">Every‑day living, nobody had gold.</span> <span id="s895">After they dug all the backyards women had to dig, they took all the women, and their nonas, and the grandchildren, to the same barn where the men were closed, and they had a great reunion, not seeing each other for a long time.</span> <span id="s896">Father hugged son.</span> <span id="s897">The son hugged his son.</span> <span id="s898">And after they had this happiness for a moment, then they killed each one of them, separate, one in front of the other one, and through them in this big, big hole, a mass funeral.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">02:24:38 Can you imagine a father seeing his son being beaten in the head, and the grandchildren being beaten, half alive, thrown in a hole?</span> <span id="s900">It's hard to believe that one human can do this to another human.</span> <span id="s901">And today, you see the same things being done, this mass grave.</span> <span id="s902">I don't know if it's a Balkan mentality, orit isagain, I said, like the last time, when my father met us, there are no words that I can use.</span> <span id="s903">Maybe, I don't know enough of these words, that I could really give you the picture.</span> <span id="s904">But that is the end of the Altarac family from Vlasenica.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">02:25:32 Now, one member, my mother's brother, Layzo (ph.), the night before he loosened a board and ran away.</span> <span id="s906">And when he saw what happened to his family the next night, he ended up as a lunatic himself, never forgot this.</span> <span id="s907">Even after the war, he tried to marry, he had a little girl, Berta (ph.), Berta Altarac, like his mother.</span> <span id="s908">But he never survived this.</span> <span id="s909">He finally went to Israel and died.</span> <span id="s910">He couldn't live with it.</span> <span id="s911">Even if he was alive, there was no life.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">02:26:17 So this is really the story.</span> <span id="s913">We stood there frozen, listening to the farmer.</span> <span id="s914">My husband Harry said the Kaddish, the prayer for the dead.</span> <span id="s915">We were numb.</span> <span id="s916">But in one way, you know, I was glad finally to see with my own eyes and hear what happened to the family.</span> <span id="s917">I went home and I wrote songs.</span> <span id="s918">I just threw myself into music.</span> <span id="s919">And every song I have written about holidaysthere is an cappella song, there is a , the aunt's song, there is a song about Pesach, Purim, Hannukah songit's all about them.</span> <span id="s920">So they're with me.</span> <span id="s921">They're with me, they're with my children, and they're with my audiences, because they sing these songs.</span> <span id="s922">And it's for them.</span> <span id="s923">And every holiday, we're together.</span> <span id="s924">So that trip had a purpose.</span> <span id="s925">And I'm very glad, as horrible as it was, that I did go.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">02:28:17 That evening, what is really unbelievablefriends of mine of Berta, all Muslim kids, they knew who did it.</span> <span id="s927">I mean, the city was silent.</span> <span id="s928">Nobody remembers what happened to anybody.</span> <span id="s929">Nobody.</span> <span id="s930">They knew.</span> <span id="s931">They came over and we had a party for Rosh Hashana.</span> <span id="s932">And I have pictures of that too that I want to share with you.</span> <span id="s933">They invited a musician and we sang and we danced.</span> <span id="s934">Can you remember a day like this?</span> <span id="s935">After which you found out what happened, we sang and we danced.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">02:29:07</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: When Layzo wrote to your mother the day before you left to go to the United States, is that the information that he gave to your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: So</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: He wrote to my mother that he's the only one who survived of the whole family, that they were all gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: And did he explain in the letter howhow he</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: He explained the same thing I told you.</span> <span id="s943">They were all closed, and they were in the barn, and he managed to escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: So in somebut in some sense, it was never a reality to you until you</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: I wouldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s946">I would not believe it.</span> <span id="s947">I thought maybe Uncle Layzo was not right, or maybeI had to see this for myself.</span> <span id="s948">There was somethingI don't know what youyou know, what I hadthe worstthe worst things that I hadworseis religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">02:30:10 I had a tough time with religion when I came back.</span> <span id="s950">The whole family was so religious.</span> <span id="s951">They were raised with the fathers telling them about the inquisition of burning of their ancestorsour ancestors never had a chance to enjoy their religion.</span> <span id="s952">It's our duty to go on and teach it.</span> <span id="s953">What did these young kids think as they saw, one by one, being killed?</span> <span id="s954">What did they think?</span> <span id="s955">The women screamed , "God, help us."</span> <span id="s956">Where was the God?</span> <span id="s957">I had a tough time with religion.</span> <span id="s958">The tough time I had sitting in a synagogue, hearing Hebrewbecause Hebrew, I don't understandit was Judeo-Spanish that I understood.</span> <span id="s959">But the Hebrew sound had a magic sound, something that my grandfatherI would see him and my uncleshe had a magic sound.</span> <span id="s960">You didn't have to know what they sang.</span> <span id="s961">It just gave you a good feeling in your soul.</span> <span id="s962">That disturbed me the mostpraise the Lord business.</span> <span id="s963">I had a tough time with that.</span> <span id="s964">Thank G-d I had a husband who's a believer, who didn't go through this.</span> <span id="s965">That he could take over the religious part in my family.</span> <span id="s966">I gave them my songs.</span> <span id="s967">I drew the prayer at the sedar, the Ladino prayers.</span> <span id="s968">I had a hard time with myself.</span> <span id="s969">And my children knew that.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: Do you still have such a hard time?</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: I'll never be 100 percent with it anymore.</span> <span id="s972">No way.</span> <span id="s973">I'm a good person though.</span> <span id="s974">I make up in other things, okay?</span> <span id="s975">I go to nursing homes with my harmonica.</span> <span id="s976">I'll show you a picture of that.</span> <span id="s977">I cover all the nursing homes and play for the old, I cook, and Ithe refugees who came late, the Muslim refugees, Serbwho cares.</span> <span id="s978">I try to help them all.</span> <span id="s979">I give benefit concerts so the money is sent to Sarajevo, which is, really, a feeding kitchen for the resta little bit that's left in Sarajevo today.</span> <span id="s980">We spendwe send money for that.</span> <span id="s981">I think I do my religion a different way.</span> <span id="s982">But I can't sit there and listen to Hebrew sounds.</span> <span id="s983">Can't.</span> <span id="s984">The worse is Yom Kippur when they have Yizkor.</span> <span id="s985">11:00, I dread it.</span> <span id="s986">I don't know who to pray for.</span> <span id="s987">They're all gone.</span> <span id="s988">I can't pray for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">02:33:05 And I guess there is an answer to this.</span> <span id="s990">If you would go and really analyze this, I'm sure there's an answer how to overcome this.</span> <span id="s991">Since I do my religion in an other way, I'm satisfied with myself.</span> <span id="s992">And that's very important, to be satisfied with myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: Do you ever think that it was your mother's rebellion, her desire to not follow the tradition of your favorite nona</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: Well, she was not reallyshe abandoned religion completely in Zagreb.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: No, I know</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: Everything I know, everything I learned, is from nona when it comes to Sephardic culture.</span> <span id="s997">Not from my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: But it's your mother who saved your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: It's my mother who saved my life many times.</span> <span id="s1000">She had that quick decision way of doing things, quick decision that saved our lives most of the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: Can you give some examples?</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: The exampleone of the examples in Zagreb, when they started collecting all the Jews of the Citythey knock on the doorthere were two officials who wanted to know "Are you the Cabeelio family?"</span> <span id="s1003">"Yes, we are."</span> <span id="s1004">My mother took her pocketbook and she said, "Floritza, ," or "Take this pocketbook to your mother."</span> <span id="s1005">I understood.</span> <span id="s1006">I took the pocket book, started running down the street, I ran and ran.</span> <span id="s1007">And finally, I stopped and said, "Where am I going?</span> <span id="s1008">," "Why am I running for?"</span> <span id="s1009">.</span> <span id="s1010">This is when the came for the Cabeelio family.</span> <span id="s1011">Luckily, my father had wounds from the first war, and he told them that he had a disease.</span> <span id="s1012">That was right at the beginning.</span> <span id="s1013">And they let him out.</span> <span id="s1014">That's when he wrote to to Split right away, "Send me anything, Let me get out of here."</span> <span id="s1015">But this is how Rosa always acted.</span> <span id="s1016">Fast decisions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">02:35:16</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: When you were in Corsila, in the island, was it for you the life of a kid?</span> <span id="s1019">I mean</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: It was the life of a kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q:withoutbut you had some responsibilities.</span> <span id="s1022">In fact, you were providing food for</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: Well, I played the harmonica and taught music.</span> <span id="s1024">That was about it.</span> <span id="s1025">It's the old people who had a very tough life not knowing what's going to happen tomorrow with us.</span> <span id="s1026">They could be sent to Germany the next day.</span> <span id="s1027">That was the worst.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: And were you frightened of this as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: No.</span> <span id="s1030">No.</span> <span id="s1031">No, I was not.</span> <span id="s1032">It was a way of life.</span> <span id="s1033">And when you have people around you who are in the same boat, you're not alone.</span> <span id="s1034">I had a good life.</span> <span id="s1035">I play music, see?</span> <span id="s1036">It's them who suffered.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">02:30:25</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Q: Is there anything else you'd like to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">A: No.</span> <span id="s1040">This is a story.</span> <span id="s1041">I would not say an Auschwitz story.</span> <span id="s1042">I don't have a number.</span> <span id="s1043">This is an experience of a survivor.</span> <span id="s1044">And all of us have a different story.</span> <span id="s1045">Each one of these stories are filled with a lot of painand as we find outthe kind of a pain that does not leave you.</span> <span id="s1046">I mean, you can be busy, and you can do all of these beautiful things, but it's there.</span> <span id="s1047">So to carry it for as many years as I did, there must have been a reason, okay?</span> <span id="s1048">And I accomplished what I wanted to accomplishof raising an American family.</span> <span id="s1049">That was very important to me.</span> <span id="s1050">I didn't want them to be had.</span> <span id="s1051">Now, some survivors say it's wrong, they should know, they should grow with this.</span> <span id="s1052">And I would always say, "What for?</span> <span id="s1053">They'll be old enough.</span> <span id="s1054">They'll understand later.</span> <span id="s1055">Then, grow as happy."</span> <span id="s1056">My family is a very happy family.</span> <span id="s1057">You should see my daughters.</span> <span id="s1058">I mean, they take over when they walk in.</span> <span id="s1059">And when get on that stageI mean, they're stage people.</span> <span id="s1060">My son, too.</span> <span id="s1061">So all four are very, veryI mean, a pride and joy to me.</span> <span id="s1062">So I think, through that, I have accomplishedI've done right, see?</span> <span id="s1063">And a time came when it had to come out, that also I'm happy that I've done right and gone back.</span> <span id="s1064">The timing to me was right.</span> <span id="s1065">It worked for me.</span> <span id="s1066">The pain will be always there.</span> <span id="s1067">I don't think I'll ever get rid of that.</span> <span id="s1068">I don't think I even want to get rid of it.</span> <span id="s1069">That's the way it is.</span> <span id="s1070">This is the reality.</span> <span id="s1071">I live with it, see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">02:38:31 But at least I know who I am, where I come from, what happened, and why am I what I am today.</span> <span id="s1073">People come see me on the stage.</span> <span id="s1074">They enjoy the songs, because I put all my heart in it.</span> <span id="s1075">I feel it.</span> <span id="s1076">It's not a "Let me sing a song and get it over with."</span> <span id="s1077">It has meaning.</span> <span id="s1078">So I'll go on as long as I can, and do my thing, andI enjoyed this, I really enjoyed this.</span> <span id="s1079">I thoughtI dreaded it.</span> <span id="s1080">I thought, "Oh, how am I going to go through all of this and talk, talk all that"maybe, this is what psychiatry is.</span> <span id="s1081">Maybe, people goand to spill it outand here I am spilling it for you and the camera.</span> <span id="s1082">I enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s1083">I really did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: Well, I want to thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: I really enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s1086">And I hope many people and children, especially, can sort of learn a little bit from this.</span> <span id="s1087">And maybe I can help them in some way.</span> <span id="s1088">But I enjoyed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">02:39:37</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Q: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1092">Well, this is actually two pictures.</span> <span id="s1093">The one to the left is my nona.</span> <span id="s1094">It's her engagement picture.</span> <span id="s1095">As you see, they're dressed very much like the Muslims.</span> <span id="s1096">But she already has her head covering, because she's a bride.</span> <span id="s1097">And from that day on, she will be wearing a that you see on your right‑hand side.</span> <span id="s1098">And this is maybe, let's say, 1938.</span> <span id="s1099">This is the last picture of nona.</span> <span id="s1100">She's older.</span> <span id="s1101">They are dressed in the modern clothes of today.</span> <span id="s1102">But they had never abandoned the and that my grandfather is wearing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">02:40:39 This is nona's family.</span> <span id="s1104">This is the singing Altarac family.</span> <span id="s1105">Unfortunately, the men don't have their instrumentswhich I'm so upset and so sorry.</span> <span id="s1106">But my mother, Rosa, has her guitar, the one to the leftactually, to the right from where I'm sittingand her sister, Luna (ph.), has her guitar.</span> <span id="s1107">As I said before, they were known as the singing Altarac family.</span> <span id="s1108">There's my mother, Rosa.</span> <span id="s1109">Always very pretty.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">02:41:21 Now, this is my mother, Rosa, with her brother Layzo.</span> <span id="s1111">I think this was taken right before she left, after she married Mikaiel Cabeelio.</span> <span id="s1112">They were very, very close.</span> <span id="s1113">And the way that history brings things together, they were the only two survivors.</span> <span id="s1114">Can you believe that?</span> <span id="s1115">The only two survivors of the whole Altarac family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">02:41:53 And this is Mikaiel Cabeelio.</span> <span id="s1117">He's handsome, isn't he?</span> <span id="s1118">He's blonde, has blue eyes, blonde hair, not as usual Sephardic men looked.</span> <span id="s1119">They were more on a dark side.</span> <span id="s1120">This one was very, very handsome.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">02:42:54 This is one of the streets in Zagreb.</span> <span id="s1122">We are actually going to the kazaliste, to the theater.</span> <span id="s1123">One of the afternoon outings that was in our program almost every week.</span> <span id="s1124">These were my very dear friends, and .</span> <span id="s1125">Who knows where they are?</span> <span id="s1126">Who knows if they're alive?</span> <span id="s1127">But look at the fashion.</span> <span id="s1128">I mean, we were all dressed up, always dressed up.</span> <span id="s1129">Well, I'm, here, I would say, about 13 years old in Zagreb when I was taking accordion lessons.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">02:43:10 This is it.</span> <span id="s1131">This is my friend harmonica.</span> <span id="s1132">She has survived it all, she traveled, and she is right here in my music room.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">02:43:24 Now, the picture next to it isit's her sister.</span> <span id="s1134">This is not the little Honer, because I have gone to a bigger accordion.</span> <span id="s1135">But I'm still doing the same thing, I'm walking around, playing, playing mostly to nursing homes, and playing the songs of our people, from their country.</span> <span id="s1136">And I would usually ask them always, "What country do you come from?"</span> <span id="s1137">.</span> <span id="s1138">And if it's an Italian lady, I would play some Italian music.</span> <span id="s1139">For a Polish lady, I would do a polka.</span> <span id="s1140">So she is still with me.</span> <span id="s1141">And I love her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">02:44:06 This is Corsila, a beautiful, beautiful island.</span> <span id="s1143">As you see, the piece of blue water in front, that's where the ships would dock daily.</span> <span id="s1144">And we would all stand there and wait to get any kind of news, anything; that is, what's going around the world.</span> <span id="s1145">Also from there, we took that tugboat at night andwhen we ran away toward Italy.</span> <span id="s1146">Also, the childrenif you see that whole islandwe'd swim around it all day, every day.</span> <span id="s1147">And it's a beautiful place to go, even for a vacation, today.</span> <span id="s1148">It brings bad memories to me.</span> <span id="s1149">But it's a beautiful place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">02:44:57 Well, believe it or not, the one in the middle is me, the teacher, the music teacher.</span> <span id="s1151">All of my students were a little older.</span> <span id="s1152">But this was the butcher's daughter and the baker's daughter.</span> <span id="s1153">And that's where my meat and bread and olive oil came from.</span> <span id="s1154">So they were really very important people in my life.</span> <span id="s1155">And this harmonica, actually, is not mine, because my father went to the City of Split to change for a bigger one.</span> <span id="s1156">So this one is borrowed.</span> <span id="s1157">But these are my students on the isle of Corsila.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">02:45:39 Well, this was June 24th, 1945, the wedding day.</span> <span id="s1159">Take a look at that Sergeant Jagoda.</span> <span id="s1160">Isn't he a handsome man?</span> <span id="s1161">The wedding was really first class America from the cake to the hamburgers to my dress made out of parachute.</span> <span id="s1162">I mean, everything was just first class.</span> <span id="s1163">And I love this picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">02:46:12 Well, this is the farmer who started talking to us and telling us the story of the stormy night.</span> <span id="s1165">And we are standing, actually, on the spot where he was telling us that that is where my family is, both of these places.</span> <span id="s1166">And this is where we were standing, just frozen.</span> <span id="s1167">This is really when I heard the whole story about the Altarac family.</span> <span id="s1168">And the little treethat's where they are.</span> <span id="s1169">One day, I hope to be able to go back and put something there, a stone, a music lesson, anything that is sort of connected with this Altarac family who gave me so much and left so much behind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">02:47:16 This is the badge that I talked about before.</span> <span id="s1171">It brings a lot of memories, a lot of pain, actually.</span> <span id="s1172">This was issued to every Jewish person in Zagreband I'm sure in many other citiesand you would not ever leave the house without the badge.</span> <span id="s1173">Because, God forbid, if they catch you without it, you are really in jail.</span> <span id="s1174">So miraculously, it just traveled with me.</span> <span id="s1175">I would make sure that this goes with me, plus my nona's bag with family pictures, and the little gold piece that you will see very soon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">02:47:56 There it is.</span> <span id="s1177">This is the locket that she gave me after I left Vlasenicaand "Keep it with you anywhere you go"and I sure did.</span> <span id="s1178">It's very old.</span> <span id="s1179">It's broken up.</span> <span id="s1180">But it's very, very dear to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">02:48:22 , keys from Spain.</span> <span id="s1182">Most of the Sephardic communities know the legend of the key.</span> <span id="s1183">When our ancestors left Spain, they took theirthe keys of their homes with him hoping that, one day, they will return.</span> <span id="s1184">I have written this song maybe 10, 15, years agoand it's on my first album, or second albumwhere I'm asking where is the key that used to be in the drawer that our ancestors brought from Spain.</span> <span id="s1185">My cousin, Berta, when she left Vlasenica that this Bosnian warshe called me and I tried very hard to bring her to this country, which I did, thank God.</span> <span id="s1186">And she said to me on the phone, "I left everything.</span> <span id="s1187">But I have the key."</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">02:49:17 This is my Uncle Layzo's watch.</span> <span id="s1189">Actually, my grandfather gave it to him for his good grades in school, when Vlasenica had all that trouble and all the Jews were taken to that forest mountain.</span> <span id="s1190">After thatthe reason, I guess, that the City was such in silenceeverybody had somethingbecause all of a sudden, 15 familiesall their houses were empty.</span> <span id="s1191">Somebody had to have all these things that were in their houses.</span> <span id="s1192">My Uncle Layzo, after coming to Vlasenica, looked, searched, all over the place for something to remember his family.</span> <span id="s1193">He found nothing.</span> <span id="s1194">Finally, he went to Sarajevo.</span> <span id="s1195">In one of the pawn shops, he bought this watch.</span> <span id="s1196">And this watchhis father gave to him.</span> <span id="s1197">And in fact, when you open it, you can see his handwriting, "To my son, Layzo, for the good grades in school."</span> <span id="s1198">Education was always very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">02:50:32 Again, a story ofthis, Berta gave me the first time I went to visit.</span> <span id="s1200">One of the neighbors was dying.</span> <span id="s1201">And she called Berta and she wanted to give her something.</span> <span id="s1202">It was on her conscience.</span> <span id="s1203">And she gave her this buckle that belonged to the Altarac family.</span> <span id="s1204">As you see in the middle, it's a Magen David, and it was worn by one of my uncles, orI don't know whombut it belonged to the Altarac family.</span> <span id="s1205">It bothered the lady a lot.</span> <span id="s1206">So she gave it to Berta.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">02:51:18 You know, a very talented musician of Sephardic musicthe group is called the Voice of Sepharad in Saint Paul, MinnesotaDavid Harris (ph.) is his name.</span> <span id="s1208">He called one day.</span> <span id="s1209">He said, "Flory, I would like to commission you to write a song for my group."</span> <span id="s1210">And he gave me two words, "You return what you find."</span> <span id="s1211">Well, what did I think of about?</span> <span id="s1212">I thought about going back to Vlasenica, , and "What am I looking for, the houses?"</span> <span id="s1213">.</span> <span id="s1214">And this is what thethis song is all about.</span> <span id="s1215">I will sort of speak it as you are listening to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">02:52:03 I start with thinking with the guitar.</span> <span id="s1217">That's what the guitar is coming out and doing.</span> <span id="s1218">And as I'm thinking, the scenes come out of the family houses.</span> <span id="s1219">I look at the windows, I look for roses.</span> <span id="s1220">And this is what you will hear now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">02:52:36 "The streets are empty.</span> <span id="s1222">The houses are without happiness, and the windows are without roses, and the carnations, and the beautiful roses that these people love so much in their windows, and the gardens, the gardens without the lovers, and the worst of all, there is no nonas wearing the little head covering, and the mothers with cradles that used to sing to the childrenwhere have they gone?</span> <span id="s1223">Where have they gone?</span> <span id="s1224">Where have they gone?</span> <span id="s1225">Everybodyeverybody is gone.</span> <span id="s1226">Everybody, everyoneeverybody is gone"the guitar is always your thinking and your searching"And the Rabbis that used to pray, the prayers that used to give us so much peace, and the weddings, the weddings of the young ones that used to sing and dance with the tambourines back to the mothers with their cradles that used to sing to their childrenwhere have they gone?</span> <span id="s1227">Where have they gone?</span> <span id="s1228">Where have they gone?</span> <span id="s1229">Everybodyeverybody is gone.</span> <span id="s1230">Everybodyeverybody is gone."</span> <span
