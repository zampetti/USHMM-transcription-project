<html><body><p><span id="s1">Irmgard Horn</span></p> <p><span id="s2">Q: When and where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s3">A: I was born in Cologne in 1909.</span></p> <p><span id="s4">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about your education in Cologne?</span></p> <p><span id="s5">A: I went to high school.</span> <span id="s6">I didn’t study.</span> <span id="s7">I went to the University and heard Gastvortregen and played piano, went to my father’s business and worked there a little bit and married fairly young to Hamburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Q: What type of business was your father in?</span></p> <p><span id="s9">A: He had a factory for calenders and other stuff – stationery and reclame, advertisements (she showed me a pencil with the name of the business on it)</span></p> <p><span id="s10">Q: Let’s just go back a little bit, while you were going to school, how would you describe the relationship between the Jewish children and the non – Jewish children?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: Perfect because there were only two Jewish children and all the others were my good friends.</span> <span id="s12">This was different at this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: You say only two Jewish children, was that usual in a city like Cologne?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: In a regular school, yes.</span> <span id="s15">There were not too many Jewish children.</span> <span id="s16">We were not religious so I didn’t go to a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s17">As a matter of fact, I didn’t ever learn Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: Did you belong to a congregation?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: Yes, we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: What type of congregation was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: It was a congregation in the Rohnstrasse, Dr. Kober, whose wife still lives here.</span> <span id="s22">No, it was more or less like the Tabernacle.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: When you started to work in your father’s business, in what capacity were you working?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: As a bookkeeper.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: You mentioned also that you got married young, what type of business was your husband in in Hamburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: He happened to be in the same type of business strangely enough than my second husband.</span> <span id="s27">He was a salesman for all the same articles he had that means buttons and all these – funny enough, they never knew each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Was life different for you in Hamburg than in Koln?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: It was beautiful.</span> <span id="s30">We had a gorgeous apartment and as a matter of fact, something funny, I had a built in maid.</span> <span id="s31">She was two months already in my parent’s house before I married to learn exactly how to do everything that the poor little girl didn’t have to work.</span> <span id="s32">And when I came back from my honeymoon, she came the same day and that was it – she stayed with us in Hamburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Did you work at all in Hamburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: No.</span> <span id="s35">I never worked.</span> <span id="s36">I did help my husband by taking phone calls and so on but I never worked until about four months before we emigrated to South Africa.</span> <span id="s37">Then I started to learn how to make hats but four months is not exactly a long time and I worked at a very nice lady who happened to be not Jewish and I had to go through the back door in and in a little room where nobody saw me, she showed me everything.</span> <span id="s38">It was impossible at this time to be anywheres especially with non – Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Let me go back just for a moment.</span> <span id="s40">When did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: I married Christmas, 1932 and came the beginning of 1933 to Hamburg and I was only in Hamburg three weeks before Hitler came and it was very very nice.</span> <span id="s42">I had nice friends.</span> <span id="s43">We met nice people.</span> <span id="s44">I didn’t know anybody in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s45">But for my part, I would have left in April, 1933.</span> <span id="s46">I begged my husband let’s go to South Africa or anywheres.</span> <span id="s47">It’s no good.</span> <span id="s48">We just married.</span> <span id="s49">We are just starting here.</span> <span id="s50">Let’s go out of Germany because I don’t like what I see here.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: What was it that you saw that you didn’t like?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: That I thought Hitler was there for good and that we Jews after the 1st of April 1933, after the stores were marked, I didn’t think it was good to stay there and for us as a young couple, it would have been much better to leave like I wanted but my husband wouldn’t think of it.</span> <span id="s53">My parents in law lived in the Saarland and they went in 1935 after the plebiscite when the Saar voted, they went the same evening to Luxemburg where they already had an apartment and that was a clever thing to do for them.</span> <span id="s54">They could or they did take all their money along at this time and my two sisters in law with their husbands also followed to Luxemburg and they wanted us to come and my husband didn’t want to.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Why didn’t your husband want to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: Because he made a good living in Germany and he didn’t think that it would become bad and being that I tried all the time, Let’s go, let’s go, there is an interesting thing to say.</span> <span id="s57">We had one Jewish girl friend and she was married to an Artling von so and so and he wasn’t Jewish and he lived with her together and they had a baby.</span> <span id="s58">She was my best friend.</span> <span id="s59">He sent her to America – he wanted her to go to America with the child and she came back and said no and I will never forget it.</span> <span id="s60">On the 2nd of January, 1938, he asked all their friends and they all were Jewish – at this time, he didn’t live with her together anymore – he was one of the very first Nazis and he ordered us to her apartment and he came in and he said “I want to ask a favor of you.</span> <span id="s61">All of you are my very close friends, I can’t help it that I don’t live with Ruth anymore but it’s impossible.</span> <span id="s62">Please leave Germany as fast as you can or you will not be able to leave it anymore.”</span> <span id="s63">So from that time on, I begged my husband and finally I had him – went one day to the American Consulate and asked for two numbers and I came home and he had to sign and he didn’t want it and that was actually my first fight I had.</span> <span id="s64">Finally he signed it and that was our luck.</span> <span id="s65">We went to South Africa because my mother is born in South Africa, went back with my grandmother and the other three children to Germany after my grandfather died but two of her sons went back to South Africa and the one was a very big man in tobacco and they were very well off.</span> <span id="s66">So naturally, it was understandable that we all wanted to go to South Africa.</span> <span id="s67">In August, we wrote to my uncle that we would like to go to South Africa and the answer came back that it was impossible for us because we were born in Germany to go to the Union of South Africa.</span> <span id="s68">He sends us affidavits to go to Swaziland for my sister, my brother in law and their two children and my husband and me.</span> <span id="s69">And my parents could go to South Africa because my mother was born there.</span> <span id="s70">My parents were in Cologne at this time and my grandmother from my mother’s side lived with them and my parents didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s71">My father said nothing will happen to us and then came the 10th of November and in the meantime, we had already our passports with the visa for Swaziland.</span> <span id="s72">We had everything ready and at eight o’clock our phone rings and at the same time, the door rings.</span> <span id="s73">I open the door and there were the Nazis.</span> <span id="s74">“Herr Ehrman, sie sind verhaftet.”</span> <span id="s75">I came out of the bathtub soaking wert with a towel around and I said “You cannot take him because here is our passport, we are going to Luxemburg.</span> <span id="s76">We can leave today.</span> <span id="s77">You can bring us over the border.</span> <span id="s78">We are ready to leave today.</span> <span id="s79">We will leave everything here.”</span> <span id="s80">No, we take him.</span> <span id="s81">And they took him and I stood there all by myself.</span> <span id="s82">Now, I must have been quite clever because at 9 o’clock the Jewish girl came who helped me at this time because we were ready to leave Germany and I first made a check out for the complete amount I had in the bank and I had all our jewelry at the jeweler to have fixed and I sent her out.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: When you say a Jewish girl...</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: At this time you had to have a Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s85">My original maid had to leave.</span> <span id="s86">(Rassenschande) So then I called five friends and told them to come over to my house as fast as they can because they just took Max and if you stay home, they will take you too.</span> <span id="s87">They will not come back to my apartment.</span> <span id="s88">I don’t know how I had the insight.</span> <span id="s89">When they said, where’s your girl and I said I sent her to get all the money we had and to get the jewelry.</span> <span id="s90">Are you crazy, that’s much to much for anybody.</span> <span id="s91">I said she will be back and she came back and you wouldn’t believe what happened with this money.</span> <span id="s92">I really fed about 30 people who didn’t have a penny and didn’t think of it.</span> <span id="s93">At 10 o’clock that morning, all the money was stopped to be taken out of Jewish accounts.</span> <span id="s94">Then the first thing I tried to call the Jewish agencies and I couldn’t get through.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: What organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: The Judischer Hilfsverein.</span> <span id="s97">I couldn’t get through and my husband was gone.</span> <span id="s98">I do not know how I survived but I survived and I tried every day something else.</span> <span id="s99">Five days later, I went to the Nazi headquarters in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s100">I went in and they looked at me and stopped me in the same moment because I looked Jewish and I said I want to talk to somebody in charge of the concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Did you know where they had taken your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: No.</span> <span id="s103">I had no idea.</span> <span id="s104">So I go in there with my two passports and the man said “are you Jewish” and I said “Yes, I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s105">He said what do you want here, go home.</span> <span id="s106">I said now I want to tell you one thing – if you would be in the concentration camp and your wife wouldn’t try to get you out...and he looked at me and he said you are right and he gave me the address of the police department where I should go and I went right there over and there was a man who was a human being and he told me what do you want.</span> <span id="s107">I told him my husband is in the concentration camp – there is no reason why he is there because we have our passports, we have our visas, we can leave today, you can send us out of the country, you can keep what we have here – that’s quite a bit but let him out.</span> <span id="s108">He said there’s nothing I can do.</span> <span id="s109">But evidently there was something that he did because after thirteen days, I heard he would be out the next day.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: How did you hear?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Through the Jewish organization where I went every day and every night I had six different friends of ours sleeping in our two beds until one said, you know you have already 12 pajamas in the beds.</span> <span id="s112">What if somebody comes again?</span> <span id="s113">But you know, where they were once, they didn’t come a second time.</span> <span id="s114">They were saved.</span> <span id="s115">The Nazis came to their homes.</span> <span id="s116">So, by now, I didn’t have any furniture anymore because I had my lift packed to South Africa.</span> <span id="s117">I had the tickets for South Africa for the 15th of January.</span> <span id="s118">Everything was ready – only my husband was missing.</span> <span id="s119">I think I sent 6 times money and my mother got the money back later on because he never got the money in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s120">Then I knew where he was – he was in Oranienburg.</span> <span id="s121">And I went to the station with one of my good friends in his car – my car was sold by then – and there came my husband.</span> <span id="s122">I never saw anybody in two weeks looking like that.</span> <span id="s123">Thin like a stick, no hair on his head and actually mentally somehow not right.</span> <span id="s124">We took him in the car and he asked how come this car and not our car.</span> <span id="s125">I said it was at home, I was afraid to drive.</span> <span id="s126">Then we took him to our apartment and in our apartment was one bed which wasn’t our bed and slowly but surely we told him everything and then he had about fifty names.</span> <span id="s127">Our friend wrote the names down and we called – he had them all in his head.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: To tell them...</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: To tell them that the men are alive and okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: When your husband came home, did he tell you what had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: Till today I don’t know it.</span> <span id="s132">We never talked about it.</span> <span id="s133">I put him in the bathtub and you have no idea how he looked.</span> <span id="s134">They had beaten him and everything.</span> <span id="s135">And then I put him to bed and I was sitting in front of the bed and he was screaming during the night.</span> <span id="s136">For days, I didn’t go to bed and was sitting in front of the bed.</span> <span id="s137">But, this was the 23rd of November.</span> <span id="s138">On the 25th of November, we went to Cologne to my parents.</span> <span id="s139">He wanted to go to visit friends from business and to one I took him and then he had enough.</span> <span id="s140">He would not listen to me.</span> <span id="s141">He had to do what he wanted.</span> <span id="s142">We tried to calm him down.</span> <span id="s143">We were one night in Cologne and went the next day to Luxemburg.</span> <span id="s144">When we came to the border, this is one thing I will never forget.</span> <span id="s145">When the Nazis came in, how he jumped and stood straight.</span> <span id="s146">Things which you never can forget.</span> <span id="s147">How he looked at them and I just said very quietly he just comes from the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s148">It took months and months until he was his old self again.</span> <span id="s149">We stayed until the 15th of January in Luxemburg because our steamer went one month later and I called from Luxemburg my parents and said will you please go today and buy tickets for the 15th of February.</span> <span id="s150">They said no, we are not going.</span> <span id="s151">I said you are coming, without your furniture.</span> <span id="s152">We have our furniture in South Africa and that is it and mother, not no but yes.</span> <span id="s153">But Uncle Max, that was my uncle in South Africa, just wrote us a letter that it is not so important for us, old people to come.</span> <span id="s154">I said let Uncle Max say what he wants, you are coming with us, otherwise I am coming back to call for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Were you an only child?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s158">You mentioned you had a sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: I have one sister and had one brother who died a few months ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Were they still in Germany at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: My sister left in December, 1938.</span> <span id="s162">She had two children and she lived in Bochold in Westphalen and they had a big factory and on the 10th of November, the Nazis came, all old friends of my brother in law and threw everything they could get their hands on on the floor and they had a gorgeous house and there wasn’t much left and all of a sudden my sister said it smells like gas and my brother in law ran to the basement and they had cut the pipe.</span> <span id="s163">And my little niece who was 7 years old at this time didn’t talk for four weeks.</span> <span id="s164">They went to a doctor and he said he can’t do anything – maybe it comes back naturally.</span> <span id="s165">And when they went to Holland by car, their old chauffeur drove them with their car which was a big risk, she started to cry for the first time and started to talk again.</span> <span id="s166">And we were in Luxemburg and we didn’t want to go back to Germany to get the steamer in Rotterdam so we had to get the visas to go through all the countries.</span> <span id="s167">And I tell you until we got to Rotterdam, I was half – dead, honestly half – dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: How did you get the visas to go through?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Through money – only through money.</span> <span id="s170">False visas – only through money.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: When you had taken your money out of the bank that morning, were you able to take it with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: No.</span> <span id="s173">I used it all.</span> <span id="s174">I told you I really saved the lives of friends and what was left I gave to friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: You left with the 10 RM?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Yes, with 10 marks and then when we were in Rotterdam and the steamer came – and to know are my parents and my grandmother on there – this was also one of the tense moments but when I saw them, you have no idea how we were crying.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: They had gone from Koln to...</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: To Hamburg.</span> <span id="s179">It was A German steamer and from there, we went to South Africa.</span> <span id="s180">My grandmother was very sick at this time – she was a diabetic and my parents left the boat in Cape Town and we went to Durban because we had to go to Swaziland.</span> <span id="s181">But we went to Durban and from Durban, we went for one week to Johannesburg – for that we got the permit and my uncle told us you are not going to Swaziland, I will try to get you to Bulawayo, Rhodesia.</span> <span id="s182">And he gave us a tremendous big letter of credit to go there and we were there for four weeks and on Easter Saturday morning, they came at 10 o’clock and said at 11 0’clock your train is leaving and you have to leave Bulawayo.</span> <span id="s183">In the running train, they threw our passports.</span> <span id="s184">I went through quite a bit.</span> <span id="s185">Then we were for another week in Johannesburg and then we went to Swaziland where my sister and brother in law and the two children were already.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Before we go on, I would like to go back for a minute so that I have it all straight.</span> <span id="s187">When you were still in Germany, before Kristallnacht, did you ever see signs Juden Unerwuenscht?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: All over.</span> <span id="s189">For instance, one evening we went to visit friends.</span> <span id="s190">They happened to live in a very Jewish neighborhood and there still lived quite a few Jews at that time and when we were in the bus going down there, we heard they were running outside and singing “wenn das Juden blut vim messer spritzt” and we went already two stations further and went as fast as we could to the house of our friends and we see them coming there and we rang the bell without letting off.</span> <span id="s191">In Germany at this time, there was only light for thirty seconds, then the light in the hallways went out and they knew that something was wrong and we were screaming from downstairs open the door and hold the light and we were running like crazy and they behind us till to the third floor and then our friend called from upstairs ‘the police is coming, we called the police” and then they turned around.</span> <span id="s192">They had knives in their hands and after that, I fainted.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: When your husband saw incidents like this, did he then...</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: He still didn’t want to leave, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Why didn’t he...</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: He was afraid to start anew, I think.</span> <span id="s197">That was it.</span> <span id="s198">And then we went to Swaziland and we stayed there from April, 1939 until August, 1940 because we had our visa for America.</span> <span id="s199">I started to make hats there.</span> <span id="s200">They still wear them most probably today.</span> <span id="s201">There is a residence commissioner and all the employees at this time wore my hats.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: You mentioned that you went to this woman in Hamburg to learn to make hats.</span> <span id="s203">Did you go specifically because you knew you were going to emigrate?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s205">Because I didn’t learn anything, I couldn’t do anything, I never worked in Germany.</span> <span id="s206">And for the three months we were in Luxemburg, I went every day too to a very good person but this isn’t enough to learn a profession properly.</span> <span id="s207">I only knew half the things I had to know.</span> <span id="s208">I took all the gadgets you need for making hats along.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: How did you get the idea to do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: We all had ideas.</span> <span id="s211">The one learned cooking, the other did this.</span> <span id="s212">Most of the women did try to learn something if they didn’t work before.</span> <span id="s213">And in Swaziland were sixty (60) Jewish refugees.</span> <span id="s214">In Mbabane, Swaziland and one of these, were one Dr. Mastbaum and his wife and their daughter.</span> <span id="s215">He is one of the biggest men for malaria now.</span> <span id="s216">My brother in law who was a big manufacturer in Germany and my husband and I who came with our own money because my parents in law lived in Luxemburg and gave us a certain amount.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: Did you also use this money to pay for the visas through the other countries to Rotterdam?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s219">And all the others were people from little towns and the residence commissioner and his family never looked at one of them but we three families were always invited for everything and we always talked as liaison with all the other people.</span> <span id="s220">Whatever came up, we were the liaison.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Let me just recap.</span> <span id="s222">Your parents got off in Cape Town and went on to Johannesburg...</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: And my uncle looked after them beautifully.</span> <span id="s224">There are not many people who had such a nice life and it was through my uncle.</span> <span id="s225">We went further because we were not allowed to stay there.</span> <span id="s226">Swaziland is a very wild country.</span> <span id="s227">We lived first in a hotel for a few weeks but this became too expensive so my brother – in – law, my sister and we moved in one house which was empty at this time.</span> <span id="s228">It belonged to the police commissioner who was away for one year and we stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: What was your impression when you came to Mbabane?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: That it is very primitive.</span> <span id="s231">You have no idea how primitive.</span> <span id="s232">This is unbelievable.</span> <span id="s233">Whatever I tell you is not enough.</span> <span id="s234">We were really in the wildest Africa.</span> <span id="s235">My brother in law came over with a car so we could drive a little bit around but on the 1st of September, we only were allowed to go approximately two miles in every direction.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Because we were enemies of the English – we were still Germans.</span> <span id="s238">German – Jews didn’t make a difference, we were German and this was England.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">(tape turned)</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Then my husband got a job in Esureni, that was seven miles from Mbabane as a manager of a hotel.</span> <span id="s241">He had as much idea as I would have as a manager of a hotel but it was quite interesting and it paid well but it was very soon over on account of the war.</span> <span id="s242">And we lived there – we moved into our own house.</span> <span id="s243">This own house was one room.</span> <span id="s244">The cockroaches and mice were just walking around – that’s why I will never be afraid of anything.</span> <span id="s245">I sewed little things to put on the window – you should have seen the furniture – mostly orange crates where I put a little bit material on.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: What happened to your lift?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: The lift was in Mozambique and certainly we couldn’t take it to Swaziland.</span> <span id="s248">There wouldn’t have been any room for it.</span> <span id="s249">My brother in law built the house in Swaziland, had his life there and it was a very nice little house, and we left in August, 1940 and in October, 1940, they started a factory in Swaziland – the Jewish organizations from Johannesburg because the people were moneyless and didn’t know what to do and my brother in law became the manager of the place.</span> <span id="s250">Nobody made much money but they were occupied and had enough money to live on and we went in August to Cape Town and left from there.</span> <span id="s251">A little thing typical for refugees, we stand on the steamer, a Japanese boat and I said there is the brother of a very close friend of ours of Willy Hesse.</span> <span id="s252">It must be his brother because the little girl which he has on his arm has a jacket on which belonged to Helen Hesse.</span> <span id="s253">My husband said are you crazy.</span> <span id="s254">I said no, I saw when Ruth made it, it’s hers.</span> <span id="s255">So we go on the steamer and went over to him and asked are you Mr. Hesse?</span> <span id="s256">And he started to cry just like we cried.</span> <span id="s257">Yes, it was him.</span> <span id="s258">They went to South America.</span> <span id="s259">We were on a Japanese boat.</span> <span id="s260">My husband was supposed to sleep with four men and I with four women and with money, you can do anything and we were able to get a room for ourselves.</span> <span id="s261">But in the next room were some Japanese and they were smoking marijuana or something the whole day and we couldn’t sleep because it was awful.</span> <span id="s262">I didn’t go in the bathroom because the bath is one tub where fifty people can go in.</span> <span id="s263">So every morning at 4 o’clock, I set my alarm clock and I went up to the first class and I went into the bathroom.</span> <span id="s264">Nobody saw me and I took my bath and I went very quietly down again.</span> <span id="s265">The food was awful.</span> <span id="s266">You have no idea how the food was – the most awful food I ever had but I am a fresser by nature and I took two hard wurst along from Cape Town and from that we ate the 10 days we were on the boat and I had two or three lbs of chocolate which I got as farewell gifts.</span> <span id="s267">You have no idea how the food was.</span> <span id="s268">There were people who were on first class who brought me quietly food down because we simply couldn’t eat it – raw fish.</span> <span id="s269">Or when we had cereal in the morning, we saw the worms swimming in it and we paid a lot of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: Who paid for the passage?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: As I told you we had our own money and we even came to America with our own money without an affidavit which was very rare then.</span> <span id="s272">I don’t want to exaggerate it but it just happened that my parents in law gave us the money.</span> <span id="s273">Then we were for three days in Rio de Janeiro and in Rio I said to my husband there is a man sitting – I had dancing lessons with him in Cologne.</span> <span id="s274">My husband said you cannot go in a strange town where you don’t even speak the language and talk to him.</span> <span id="s275">He came here in 1951(?)</span> <span id="s276">and the first thing I said to him was Walter, where were you in August, 1940?</span> <span id="s277">He said in Rio de Janeiro so it was him.</span> <span id="s278">We went on the boat, it was an American boat, beautiful, Moore – McCormick line and we were there five minutes and I said to my husband there is my uncle Carl Daniel from Wiesbaden.</span> <span id="s279">He said Irmgard, stop it.</span> <span id="s280">I said it’s him and I went to the purser and asked if he had a Mr. Carl Daniel – he said no but we have a Mr. Charles Daniel.</span> <span id="s281">We didn’t go to him until dinner time, looked where he sat down went over and I stood in front of him without saying a word.</span> <span id="s282">He looked up and we both started to cry.</span> <span id="s283">We were together from morning till night.</span> <span id="s284">We celebrated his 74th birthday onboard and we come to New York and there is my brother and sister in law and his daughter and son in law.</span> <span id="s285">My brother went over to his cousin and said Anne, are you calling for Irmgard too?</span> <span id="s286">She said no.</span> <span id="s287">I’m calling for my father and they were all waiting there until the three of us came down.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: She had left Germany for Rio?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: He went to Buenos Aires where he lived with his son and was coming to visit his daughter.</span> <span id="s290">I especially say this because it was so typical of the world we live in.</span> <span id="s291">And then we came to New York and stayed for one night with my brother – one night because my sister in law was making her doctorate two days later and we didn’t want to make anything wrong for her and we took one room in 87th Street and stayed there until 1948 until we took our own apartment and eight days later, my husband was dead.</span> <span id="s292">I started to work after four days in America making hats and earned very little money but I did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: How did you find the job?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: This was a friend of mine in Hamburg and she had a store here on Pitkin Avenue – two hours ride one way and then the other.</span> <span id="s295">And my husband had the same what he did in Germany – he bought stuff here and sold it to stores.</span> <span id="s296">We were not well off but we had a little bit of our own money.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Is that what he used to buy the things he started to sell?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s299">And then we wanted to try to get his family out of Marseilles.</span> <span id="s300">They were in Luxemburg and were then in Marseilles.</span> <span id="s301">They had the possibility and wanted to come here but the idiots gave the last day somebody 1,000 dollars which they had and this man was captured that night and gave the name of the people and that was the end of their coming over and they all went to Gurs and were deported further from there – end of story.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: When you say all, who do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: His parents were dead in the meantime.</span> <span id="s304">His two sisters and two brothers in law.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: And your parents stayed in South Africa?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: My parents stayed in South Africa and I never saw them again.</span> <span id="s307">My father died in 1950 and my mother in 1957.</span> <span id="s308">I wanted to go to see my mother but then I got the telegram and it was too late so I never saw them again.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: When you decided to leave South Africa, was that a difficult decision for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: It was awfully difficult.</span> <span id="s311">I never forget how my father was running next to the train and screaming “I’ll never see my baby again.”</span> <span id="s312">It was true.</span> <span id="s313">It was terrible hard but there was no other way.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: Did you consider staying?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: In Swaziland!</span> <span id="s316">No.</span> <span id="s317">We couldn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s318">Impossible.</span> <span id="s319">And there was no way – my sister and brother in law only could come to Johannesburg after their two daughters married to Johannesburg and then they could go there.</span> <span id="s320">Otherwise, they would have had to stay there.</span> <span id="s321">My brother in law died in 1959 and in 1962, my sister came here because it got bad there and in 1963 her one daughter came and in 1964 the other daughter came and they live in Massachusetts.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: Would it have been possible for you to go to South Africa after the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: I guess so but by then.</span> <span id="s324">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s325">I don’t think so because they were only able to go because their children were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: You mentioned that when you left Cape Town, you went to Rhodesia and you wanted...</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: We wanted to go to Rhodesia to stay there because we had more opportunity in Bualwayo but they rejected us, they didn’t want us there.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: How did they reject you?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: We had the permit to go there for four weeks and we stayed in a hotel and we had to go every day to the police department to show that we still were there and the last day, the day before Easter, they told us we had to leave within one hour and that was it and then we took the train back to Johannesburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: And from there you took the train to Swaziland?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: No train to Swaziland, no.</span> <span id="s332">My uncle gave his car and his chauffeur and he drove us there – that was seven hours.</span> <span id="s333">There was a train leaving from the border of the South Africa to Swaziland but we had to take the bus for three hours to go there and then for twelve hours on the train.</span> <span id="s334">It was – South Africa was the most interesting country I ever was or ever will be in.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: How did you manage every day living in Swaziland?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: There was one thing – we had a little bit of money and we were very careful but the other people suffered.</span> <span id="s337">There was one thing – meat is killed in the morning about 4 A. M.</span> <span id="s338">It has to be eaten the same day so when I went at 9 o’clock in the morning to buy for instance soup meat, I cooked it until 7 o’clock at night and you still could hardly eat it.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Where did you buy it?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: There were two stores wherever you went.</span> <span id="s341">Half of the store for the colored people and half of the store for the white people.</span> <span id="s342">The toilets – half for the colored people, half for white.</span> <span id="s343">On the street, we could walk up on the sidewalk, the colored down on the street.</span> <span id="s344">Any department store, completely divided at the time we were there and it was hard to get accustomed to.</span> <span id="s345">But you had to be careful, the first evening when I had my own home, I had food left and I gave it to my boy.</span> <span id="s346">To save your face, you had to have a boy.</span> <span id="s347">Now we belonged to the upper class what they said, ridiculous.</span> <span id="s348">I had to have a boy.</span> <span id="s349">So the boy cleaned.</span> <span id="s350">What did he clean?</span> <span id="s351">He was there.</span> <span id="s352">I gave him the food that was left and the next morning I looked for my scissors for my work, a terrific, very expensive scissors – it was gone.</span> <span id="s353">So, we had a very close friend, an African born lawyer and we went to him and said Mr. Lapidus, this and this happened, can you tell us where that scissors could be.</span> <span id="s354">He said Mrs. Ehrman, did you give your boy anything of what was left to eat?</span> <span id="s355">I said yes, everything.</span> <span id="s356">He said you did it once, now you learned your lesson.</span> <span id="s357">Whatever belongs to you, belongs to him if you feed him.</span> <span id="s358">So everyday they got three pounds of mealy meal, that mealy meal is corn meal and they got once a week, one pound of salt and once a week, they got two pounds of meat.</span> <span id="s359">That’s how they ate and that was it but he never got anything from me to eat again.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: When you went shopping, were you able to buy items that you knew or...</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: No.</span> <span id="s362">My mother sent me every two weeks a package with good things to eat.</span> <span id="s363">There was a market.</span> <span id="s364">But unfortunately, our Jewish refugees were terrible.</span> <span id="s365">They went two hours – the people came from the outside.</span> <span id="s366">They knew from where they came.</span> <span id="s367">There were two bunches of radishes, there were two pineapples so when they came to the market, there was nothing left.</span> <span id="s368">They walked two hours, they bought it and they went back.</span> <span id="s369">We couldn’t get everything but we could get cans of soup and such but very little and we ate very primitive – only when the good packages from Johannesburg came, then we had something decent.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Did the sixty Jewish families stay together, live in the same area?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: More or less, there were fights all over, as you can imagine.</span> <span id="s372">For instance, oh, what I forgot to tell you.</span> <span id="s373">We had one room and one room we made into a kitchen.</span> <span id="s374">My kitchen, I had one electric cooker and my icebox was – we made it ourselves – was made out of wood and had corrugated stuff around – that was the icebox.</span> <span id="s375">You couldn’t keep anything!</span> <span id="s376">The foot of my bed was in little cans filled with gas because in there, the animals went.</span> <span id="s377">You have no idea how we lived there.</span> <span id="s378">Nobody ever will have an idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: You put gasoline in little cans to...</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: In little cans where we took the top off that the animals wouldn’t come into the bed.</span> <span id="s381">And everyday twice a day we had to wash the floor with Lysol and with gas that we wouldn’t be overrun with animals.</span> <span id="s382">Then, our toilet was outside.</span> <span id="s383">It was a hole and every afternoon the prisoners in black and white pajamas came and took the bucket out from under us.</span> <span id="s384">Once I was there and they came and took the bucket right out from under me.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: You mentioned the house that you owned was shared by yourselves and your sister, brother in law and their children...</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: No.</span> <span id="s387">The house that they built, they were in alone not with us.</span> <span id="s388">We had for instance a very beautiful bathtub in the house where we stayed together.</span> <span id="s389">Outside, there was a petrol drum so when it was raining the water came in and then one of us could take a bath and the water was beautiful black all the time.</span> <span id="s390">It was very primitive.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Did you need heating?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: We had a little gas oven which we once in a while used but very rarely</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: You mentioned that you went to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: I worked in my own house.</span> <span id="s395">They came to me and I made hats.</span> <span id="s396">But don’t ask me how they looked.</span> <span id="s397">If I think about it, my sister wrote my name “Ehrman” and that was very elegant.</span> <span id="s398">They asked me where I learned and I said in Paris – they should contradict me.</span> <span id="s399">I had two books from Paris of hats which I took along when we left Luxemburg and these served me well for the two years I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Who did you make these hats for?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: For the people of the government.</span> <span id="s402">For these English people.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: How did you get the contract to do it”</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: They came to my house and said could you make a nice hat and I said yes.</span> <span id="s405">I will never forget, one came the very first day with material – she wanted a turban – I never made a turban.</span> <span id="s406">My husband, my brother in law, my sister, we were four people sitting the whole night up trying to make this hat because alone I couldn’t figure it out and do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Did your husband work?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: No.</span> <span id="s409">He couldn’t work because there was nothing to work not because he didn’t want to work – there was nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: How did he feel after having come from his own business?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: He felt like all of us – we all felt kind of lost.</span> <span id="s412">But when the Jewish holidays came, there was one bigger house where we all met and made our own gottesdienst.</span> <span id="s413">It was so primitive – whatever I tell you is too little.</span> <span id="s414">One day we went to our friends, Dr. Mastbaum, and all of a sudden I said look, isn’t that funny how the sky looks and all of a sudden everything starts to shake.</span> <span id="s415">We were running out – it was an earthquake.</span> <span id="s416">Another day, my sister and I when we lived together, we looked out of the window and called our husbands and said look, what is that?</span> <span id="s417">The whole sky is black.</span> <span id="s418">And we said, our girl who we had came running in – Cochukas, cochukas – that means Mrs. And she gives us a cup and a spoon and goes like that and we should put something over our heads.</span> <span id="s419">We didn’t have any idea and these were locusts.</span> <span id="s420">Within half an hour, we didn’t have a leaf left with all our noise which we made with the cups and spoons.</span> <span id="s421">Then we ran into the house and closed it as good as we could.</span> <span id="s422">We had the most beautiful mimosa trees and there was nothing left.</span> <span id="s423">Everything was empty.</span> <span id="s424">And then they went further.</span> <span id="s425">Until you see them, you can’t imagine.</span> <span id="s426">So, we lived really in the wilderness of Africa.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: You mentioned that you came with some money but that most of the refugees didn’t...</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Not a penny.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: How did they manage?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: From relatives in Johannesburg who had some money and other ones, they got money from the Jewish organizations.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: Did most of them come because they couldn’t go to South Africa?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: They all came that way.</span> <span id="s433">There was one couple, he was a tailor and he worked.</span> <span id="s434">There was one woman who altered dresses, she worked.</span> <span id="s435">They all couldn’t do much.</span> <span id="s436">When we got our own house, there was an engineer and he couldn’t work as an engineer even so they could have used him very well.</span> <span id="s437">So he started to cut hair.</span> <span id="s438">We gave him a little room and he closed the room off and he was cutting hair there.</span> <span id="s439">But I’m telling you, I will never forget it – one day, one of the women came into my room, can I come in?</span> <span id="s440">I said yes, what’s the matter?</span> <span id="s441">And she looked – I never saw anything like it!</span> <span id="s442">I said what did he do?</span> <span id="s443">She said he cut my hair!</span> <span id="s444">Look at me!</span> <span id="s445">I said don’t worry, it will grow again.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Did all of the sixty families have plans to re – emigrate?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s448">As soon as possible.</span> <span id="s449">We knew it was only an interim.</span> <span id="s450">One was a butcher – he had a job.</span> <span id="s451">That was about the only one who had a job.</span> <span id="s452">One worked in a little department store – department store!</span> <span id="s453">– it was a little store.</span> <span id="s454">But otherwise, they couldn’t work.</span> <span id="s455">They were running around and talking nonsense and it was not very pleasant.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: What do you mean running around talking nonsense?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: They didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s458">The whole day running around with nothing to do isn’t good for anybody.</span> <span id="s459">And then they sat in our apartment – we rented a radio and that was the biggest radio there and it was much cheaper to rent it then to buy it.</span> <span id="s460">And there they came in and were sitting around and listening to our radio.</span> <span id="s461">And I was very sorry that I didn’t rent a small one because I always had all the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Did you know what was going on in Europe at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s464">Because we always listened and I never will forget the fifteenth of May, 1940 when we heard over the radio that they invaded Luxemburg.</span> <span id="s465">I really collapsed – I was two weeks in bed when I heard it.</span> <span id="s466">The whole family was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: After you were in Swaziland and after your husband had been released from Oranienburg, how did he feel about leaving Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: Very happy.</span> <span id="s469">But I will tell you one thing.</span> <span id="s470">I didn’t want to tell it but I do say it.</span> <span id="s471">When my husband heard in July, 1948, he got a letter from the Quakers that his whole family was dead – eight days later, he was dead – gas!</span> <span id="s472">He never got over it.</span> <span id="s473">So you see that I went through a lot.</span> <span id="s474">And if I wouldn’t have found him (second husband) I don’t think I would be alive.</span> <span id="s475">But he went through so much, I went through so much and ours is the most perfect marriage.</span> <span id="s476">Because we both went through so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: You mentioned that when you first came to the United States, you started to work in the hat business on Pitkin Avenue.</span> <span id="s478">How did you find the job?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: It was a friend of ours from Hamburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Did your husband also start to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: How did he feel about working in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: He liked it very much because he had nice customers and he liked to work here.</span> <span id="s484">And also, I had here five girlfriends with whom I grew up – all married in New York, that was very rare and unfortunately one died already but we are still a very close group.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: Your husband worked here for about eight years.</span> <span id="s486">How did he feel about having to start all over again?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: It was hard for us, very hard.</span> <span id="s488">I as a matter of fact worked until two years ago without ever letting off – once I was eight weeks without a job.</span> <span id="s489">I worked very very hard here and I never minded it a bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: Did your husband mind your working?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: No.</span> <span id="s492">I had to work because I had to make money.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: I meant because in Germany...</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: No.</span> <span id="s495">He never thought of it and we never talked about it.</span> <span id="s496">And I’m one of the people who don’t complain.</span> <span id="s497">I took everything laughingly.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Was your husband in contact with his family at all during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: No, he couldn’t.</span> <span id="s500">He never heard anything again until he found out from the Quakers.</span> <span id="s501">They were the last ones who talked to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: In your life now, are most of your friends German – Jewish refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: All German – Jewish refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: Did you have any opportunity to meet American Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s506">I met American Jews and I always had the feeling that they still look at us as refugees.</span> <span id="s507">I have never unfortunately found people who take us for what we are.</span> <span id="s508">I worked with American people here most of the time and they were very friendly to me but this was as far as it went.</span> <span id="s509">We invited each other home but we never got close.</span> <span id="s510">Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: When you say they looked at you as refugees, what do you mean by that?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: They did not like that we were at first better educated than they were and secondly, we were well off.</span> <span id="s513">The first question was always – did you work in Germany?</span> <span id="s514">And I said yes, for my father.</span> <span id="s515">Then, but you were married.</span> <span id="s516">No, I didn’t work.</span> <span id="s517">You didn’t need to work?</span> <span id="s518">No.</span> <span id="s519">Did you ever have a maid in your house?</span> <span id="s520">Yes.</span> <span id="s521">A sleep – in maid?</span> <span id="s522">Yes.</span> <span id="s523">And then it was finished.</span> <span id="s524">They really hated that we were better educated and we couldn’t help it.</span> <span id="s525">I couldn’t lie for them.</span> <span id="s526">None of them ever knew that we came with our own money, none of them ever knew that, because then it would have been out altogether because unfortunately not many people were able to say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: In having worked in Europe but you really only worked for your father, could you see any difference in working there and working here?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: That I really couldn’t say because if you work for your own father, it is different.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: Have you ever been back to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: I would never go.</span> <span id="s531">You heard how my husband died.</span> <span id="s532">His death certificate says – one also of Hitler’s victims.</span> <span id="s533">That is his death certificate.</span> <span id="s534">So why should I go back to Germany – no.</span> <span id="s535">They could offer me a million and I wouldn’t go back.</span> <span id="s536">I rather would work 24 hours a day.</span> <span id="s537">By the way, I don’t get a penny from Germany</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: When you first came to New York, what would you say the biggest adjustment was for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: To go in the subway to the right place.</span> <span id="s540">I left the house in the morning a quarter past seven (87th St.).</span> <span id="s541">I came home around 11 0’clock at night.</span> <span id="s542">I did my cooking then, I did my washing then.</span> <span id="s543">My husband did the shopping because there was no time for me to do the shopping.</span> <span id="s544">I usually went to bed around 2 o’clock and I got up at 5:30.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: How did you feel about life in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: (laughs) I didn’t have any time to think about it.</span> <span id="s547">It was surviving.</span> <span id="s548">It was living to make your life better, to make it easier and the one thing that helped a lot were our good friends.</span> <span id="s549">We always were together on our Sunday – not on Saturday because we all worked six days.</span> <span id="s550">I was only an exception in that I did not work in the household.</span> <span id="s551">Practically, everyone else I knew did.</span> <span id="s552">This I never did because I started to work right away.</span> <span id="s553">But imagine how many hours I was on the go.</span> <span id="s554">Then, after four months, I went to my friend and said this is it.</span> <span id="s555">I stop working as of tonight.</span> <span id="s556">She asked don’t you like it.</span> <span id="s557">I said no.</span> <span id="s558">It’s too hard.</span> <span id="s559">Then I went into a factory on 38th Street and the first few days I started to cry all the time.</span> <span id="s560">They were the first Puerto Ricans I saw and when I started to put my thread through the needle, they had already two ready(?)</span> <span id="s561">hats.</span> <span id="s562">But it was nice and I worked and after five more months, somebody offered me a job and I took the job and worked there for one and a half years and then I got a better job and in this job, after a few months, I had to have a hysterectomy and the first one who came to the hospital with my husband was my boss.</span> <span id="s563">He puts his hand on my stomach which wasn’t very clever and put 25 dollars down and said this is for you.</span> <span id="s564">And the second thing I do for you, I took you in the union.</span> <span id="s565">You don’t know how good that it is for you.</span> <span id="s566">But you are in the union as of now and as long as you want to work.</span> <span id="s567">But he got sick and he died in 1946 and I stayed with his son until the end of 1948.</span> <span id="s568">In the meantime my husband died in July, 1948 and end of 1948, he said 3 days before Christmas, you don’t need to work now until the first of January.</span> <span id="s569">And I needed every penny and I said what is the reason and he said because he wants to try somebody else out.</span> <span id="s570">I went to friends on Columbus Ave. who had a store and told them what happened.</span> <span id="s571">They said you start with us and you don’t go back.</span> <span id="s572">And I stayed in their place until it burned down in 1963 and they introduced me to my husband...</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: Did you ever have a problem with the language?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: Not at all.</span> <span id="s575">Don’t forget, my mother was English born.</span> <span id="s576">We knew English very well in Germany but unfortunately we always have our hard accent.</span> <span id="s577">But this was a big big difference because my mother always taught us English.</span> <span id="s578">We talked English before we went to school – only our accent and we will never lose it.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: I remember you telling me that your mother was born in South Africa.</span> <span id="s580">Was her family...</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: My grandfather went to South Africa and you know how it was in the 1860’s and 70’s and my grandfather was engaged and they came there and had their children there.</span> <span id="s582">My mother was born in 1881 and he died when she was twelve so in 1893, they moved back to Germany.</span> <span id="s583">One thing, my grandmother didn’t speak English for 50 years, we didn’t even know she still would speak English and she was 80 and very sick and we came to Cape Town and there were two of her sisters in law and from the first moment on, they spoke English and you never thought my grandmother spoke German.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Her sister came in – lives in Forest Hills.</span> <span id="s585">Sounds very English – this is one who lived in Mbabane, went to Johannesburg – then here.</span> <span id="s586">Interesting because had children when she went to S.A.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s588">PAGE
