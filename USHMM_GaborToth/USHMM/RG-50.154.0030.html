1989</span></p> <p><span id="s3">Englewood, Florida Tuesday – January 24, 1989.</span> <span id="s4">This is Fern Niven interviewing Mrs. Lilly Voip in Englewood, Florida.</span> <span id="s5">Mrs. Voip is a survivor of World War II from Estonia who has had her own unique experiences which she’s willing to share with us as part of the Holocaust Project for the National Council of Jewish Women.</span> <span id="s6">Mrs. Voip, good morning.</span> <span id="s7">We were very glad that you were willing to participate in this project and I’d like to start out by asking you to tell us some things about your early life.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Q: What was the size of your family…where did your family live?</span></p> <p><span id="s9">A: Well, as you know we come from Rakueve, Estonia, which is a small country, and the family was very small.</span> <span id="s10">I was an only child.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: In what town in Estonia?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: In Rakueve which is…</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: …a fairly small town.</span> <span id="s15">We did not live exactly in town.</span> <span id="s16">We were out on the farm more or less.</span> <span id="s17">My father was retired.</span> <span id="s18">He had come from…he had traveled the world for thirty years before he came back to his country and my mother and him were married and I was born in 1925.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: What had he done for a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: He was a seaman in England for thirty-two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: He did not marry until after he had retired?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: So he was considerably…</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: He was fifty- two and my mother was nineteen and my mother did not marry him for his good looks either as far as that goes you know because young women like money but that is besides the point, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Well, no, it helps to have a better future…</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: A better future, yes I understand that, and all my learning and what I know now and I still live by a lot of things that my father taught me.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: What religious affiliations did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: It’s Lutheran, most of the country is Lutheran.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: Were they practicing Lutherans?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: No, no -- I don’t practice it.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Did your mother ever work or is she…?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: Housework, housework -- of course everybody worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: I don’t mean at housework -- did she work outside the home?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: No no, not outside the home.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: So you were brought up in a farm community?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: More or less, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: And did you go to school from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Can you tell me about the school -- what is a big school, a small school?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: It was a very small school.</span> <span id="s41">We only had six grades because we have six grades mandatory.</span> <span id="s42">You go from school anywhere from seven to eight years old, and then when you are about fourteen, you’re done and then you have two years of what we call gymnasium and after two years at about sixteen, you’re ready for the university because it’s nothing like this one here.</span> <span id="s43">It takes you twelve years to learn to read and write and then even you don’t make it there.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: So did you go on to the gymnasium?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: No, in 1939 I was fourteen and that was the end of it because the Russians occupied the Baltic States by then and I did not go anywheres anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: The school that you went to -- was it a Public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: Yes of course, it was a Public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: What did you do then when you got out of school about age fourteen?</span> <span id="s49">Did you work?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: No, I stayed home of course, I didn’t have to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: You helped your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Did you have any other activities, did you do sports activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: No no no – the regular activities, summertimes it was going to even we did it in school, we used to go to excursions and sometimes like in the summertime even after groups would get together…you know young people would go here and there…something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: What year was it that you graduated?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: 1939?</span> <span id="s58">How aware were you or your parents of the rise of Hitler to power?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Very aware.</span> <span id="s60">My father was very aware of the whole world because to me when I grew up as a child the world was very small to me, but he had traveled every corner of it and he was very aware of the whole thing and yet there were people who were not aware of it and so this was very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: How did he bring this to your awareness?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Explaining it to me, teaching.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: Did he perceive Hitler as a threat?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Do you remember anything special that he said about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Nothing really special because our history goes back into the German domination in the seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth century where the Germans were the big landowners and the Estonian people were slaves more or less…they worked for them and that was all there was to it…I mean that was all there was to it and I mean we learned that all in school…I mean that was taught to us…the history was there.</span> <span id="s67">There was not a likeable subject to the average…I mean if you understand what it was all about then there was no confusion that they were no good, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Was there a time that you remember that the Germans formally occupied Estonia?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Of course I remember that…that was in 1941 in July and from thereon they were there till 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: From the time they occupied Estonia, was your life style affected?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Of course it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Can you tell us about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: I was sixteen at the time and we were both arrested… my father and me and we were taken to the County Jail.</span> <span id="s74">The reason we were arrested because we had talked to our neighbors and mentioned that Hitler was not what we needed.</span> <span id="s75">The Germans were not what we should be welcoming and my main thing was, I’ve always had a…I don’t know how to put it…I’ve always been very opinionated.</span> <span id="s76">When I believe in something I say it and my biggest crime was because I told my neighbors I was not going to say Heil Hitler.</span> <span id="s77">That was all on the papers written down when they turned me in…and those were my neighbors…the neighbors, you know friends, the people around you know what you stand for…not the Germans, not the Russians…not the Chinese.</span> <span id="s78">This is what is never been brought up…it’s the community around you when the Governments change.</span> <span id="s79">People are not aware of that…that there is always somebody there that is willing to save their life to turn in somebody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: We hear stories and we’ve seen movies about what happened when the Germans came to get someone…you know, pounding on the door in the middle of the night</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Uh hugh!</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Is that what it was like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: That’s right…we were taken away from our home.</span> <span id="s84">It wasn’t in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s85">There weren’t the Germans…I’ll be honest, I didn’t see one German.</span> <span id="s86">This was all done by our own people and that was done in every other country.</span> <span id="s87">This is something that I’ve always tried to talk about but the people don’t believe me.</span> <span id="s88">It wasn’t all done by the Germans.</span> <span id="s89">They had…our own people did more damage than the Germans.</span> <span id="s90">Of course they were the higher – ups.</span> <span id="s91">It was their rule…it was their overseeing it all…but the people…and that happened in every country.</span> <span id="s92">That even happened in Jewish communities which is not being mentioned…I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s93">I guess the people are shamed that their own people can do things like that, but they do…and I wish that would be brought out.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Well part of the reason we’re talking today is to give you the opportunity to bring it out.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Yes, that’s right and I’m glad.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: When they came in the middle of the day, did they tell you why they were taking you away?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: No, no, you were not told anything why you were taken away…you were just taken away.</span> <span id="s98">My father and I …and by that time my father and mother had been divorced and separated.</span> <span id="s99">We had a housekeeper…my father and I were taken away.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: You lived with your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Yes and the housekeeper was left on the premises and so, we were taken away…we were taken to a community of like a jail or what would you call it.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Were you taken in a truck, in a police van?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: No we walked and were taken to the backwoods that nobody would see us, and there were others and we arrived at the place it was full of people all different ages…different women, younger ones, older ones, men, all different people that were there that were arrested and we went to different interrogations that…</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: …and did they tell you why you were arrested?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Of course and when the interrogations started, we were told we had done this and we had said this and we had said that.</span> <span id="s106">I don’t know what they asked my father because we were separated by that time you know because we were all separated from…men from women and so on…and what they asked me was “Did I say that”.</span> <span id="s107">And I said “Yes I did”…and there was of course other accusations that I had threatened to do this and that to the Germans if they come…I said “Yes I did”.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: What had you threatened?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: I had threatened to do whatever…I can’t remember exactly what I had said right now, but if they would be settling, I’d burn them down.</span> <span id="s110">[laughter]</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Does that sound stupid?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: No that sounds terrible and it was all done by our own people.</span> <span id="s113">We were interrogated by our own people…we were tortured by our own people…we were not done by the Germans.</span> <span id="s114">At that time, later on…we seen a few Germans when we were taken to other prisons and labor camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: Where was the interrogation done?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: It was done in the community jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: And they locked you up in that jail?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: Of course they were locked up, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: For how long a time?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: I think we were there about two to three weeks…I’m not exactly sure how many days it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Do you remember that they fed you adequately at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Not adequately but we didn’t starve at that time we were fed.</span> <span id="s123">The people would bring family kind food and it was allowed to be brought in then.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: Did you have a family to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Well I had the housekeeper would bring food in once in a while but then meanwhile the war just had sort of ended in Estonia.</span> <span id="s126">The German troops had been pushed back in July…I mean the Russian troops had been pushed back and the Germans came in and of course there was a lot of clean up work to be done and we were I remember one day…two days in a row, we were sent out to comb the fields.</span> <span id="s127">All the dead Russian soldiers had to be buried that were there.</span> <span id="s128">They had been laying on the ground for about four, five weeks in the hot summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Were you part of that cleanup?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Of course I was part of it…everybody was part of it…everybody that was in that little community…jail or prison whatever you want to call it.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: I gather that up till that point you had lead a fairly sheltered existence.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: No it wasn’t a sheltered existence…I was very independent as a child.</span> <span id="s133">I was taught what life is all about…I did not come out of a cocoon and then open eyes and here I was.</span> <span id="s134">No, I had been taught many things.</span> <span id="s135">I don’t believe in raising children and telling them fairy tales up till they’re fifteen – twenty years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Had anything in your experience prepared you to have to….</span> <span id="s137">.</span> <span id="s138">?????</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: No, no, nothing like that but that was something that you did and I am a very strong person.</span> <span id="s140">It never bothered me and I can look back after all these years where people still I know people had bad experiences still live in the past and they think it was so terrible.</span> <span id="s141">Yes it was terrible but at the same time, I think we learned an awful lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: What did you learn?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: What did I learn?</span> <span id="s144">To appreciate life a lot more and still be truthful and honest and believe in something…have a mind of your own…don’t follow everything that comes along.</span> <span id="s145">This is the biggest downfall of all this because people follow things.</span> <span id="s146">They don’t know what it’s all about but they think it sounds good…let’s go…let’s follow it, and this is what happens to nations…it happens to countries…it can happen here.</span> <span id="s147">It is not that it is impossible to happen, especially when people are desperate for jobs…for this and that…they follow anything that promises.</span> <span id="s148">That’s how Hitler got to power.</span> <span id="s149">That’s what happened in Russia in 1917 when the Revolution came.</span> <span id="s150">When the Government neglects people, they don’t have jobs…they get desperate…somebody promises them something…they follow it.</span> <span id="s151">They don’t have a mind of their own to sort it out.</span> <span id="s152">I said hey, is this going to be right or not.</span> <span id="s153">This is what we face every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Well I agree with you…people do need to learn to think for themselves and be more competitive, but I would…</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Very much so and they have to be taught also by the parents…but the parents are not capable of so I don’t know who they should go to.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Okay, but after this experience of burying the dead soldiers, then what happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Then we were sent to the big city…to the city of Rakueve and we were put into one of the old world Estonia.</span> <span id="s158">Estonia has a lot of old world history and we have prisons that are walls of six foot thick…you know one of these old…I guess you would call them dungeons and we spend about a month or something over there and nobody knew where we were going and by that time I guess we were more or less convicted which we never knew what was what.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: What was it like in that big stone walled prison?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Well there was…you slept on a floor on straw with a blanket that was given to you and you got food.</span> <span id="s161">I always said we got food not enough to live on and not enough to die on…so it was sort of…you hung in there.</span> <span id="s162">You thought you were alive and sometimes you wondered if you were and was it all worth it.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Were you with other women whom you knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Yes of course…no I didn’t know anybody.</span> <span id="s165">There was women…we had a whole room full of women and then in the mornings five o’clock when the door opened, that got to be a signal that somebody was taken out and that somebody was never seen again.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: And you never know who it would be?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: No…you never knew who it would be.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Were you pretty apprehensive?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Of course, everybody was…nobody wants to die but, and then we were sent into a labor camp from there and then we were sent out to work because I was strong and healthy and mean.</span> <span id="s170">[laughter]</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: And mean…were you given work details while you were in the big jail?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: No…not in that one we weren’t.</span> <span id="s173">We just stayed there…we were waiting.</span> <span id="s174">I don’t know what we were waiting for…nobody knew if you were going to live or die.</span> <span id="s175">There was no such option there so we didn’t know about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: And you were there how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: I think we were there about a month or maybe more and then we were sent to a large, large camp which had hundreds of thousands probably…I don’t know how many but it was a huge old military…stone and military encampment.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: How did you get to this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: Of course we walked everywhere we went.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Was it hundreds of miles?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: No that was very close…maybe it was ten miles or so and you had your guards and all over watching you that you didn’t run off.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: What time of the year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: That was probably in October which the winter comes early…there was already winter.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: Did you have adequate clothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: No, no, that was not the thing.</span> <span id="s186">Nobody worried about the clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: You were saying nobody worried about the clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Nobody worried about the clothing…that’s right because we were put into this big military encampment which was all circled with barbed wire…the windows were all covered with barbed wire and all that and at that time we went into a huge huge room which there was about seventy of us women that were rounded up and that was just one room.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Like a barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: Well no they were not barracks…they were old stone buildings that had been there for years for the Estonian military and the place was filled slowly from different areas where they brought them in and then we had Gypsies.</span> <span id="s191">There was a room full of Gypsies next to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Gypsies from Estonia?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A; From Estonia yes…they were all also…they did the same thing to the Gypsies as they did to the Jewish people because it was a racial thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Please tell me more about the Gypsies.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Well every country had Gypsies and every country lost the Gypsies for the simple reason like I said earlier…it’s a racial thing…the Jewish and the Gypsies were killed because of their racial difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Gypsies were significant in the fact they were like wanderers?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Yes, that was not something that if they wanted.</span> <span id="s198">He didn’t benefit anything from these people and that was the reason to exterminate them…and so that was one reason they were all gathered up and they were killed.</span> <span id="s199">We had a room full of women and children.</span> <span id="s200">I have no idea where the men were and they were there and one day they were gone and of course they were all killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: At this point in time if you can remember, were you and the people with you aware of the extermination…</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Oh sure!</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: …or did you just think you would be used as forced labor?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: No, no, no, we were aware of that because they had been taken out of from when we went to the big prison to there, and there some that were left behind in that big prison.</span> <span id="s205">These, I know…we found out later…they were all exterminated.</span> <span id="s206">They were older people and I don’t know what the reasons were but most of them were sent over there to the big camp we were able to work.</span> <span id="s207">There were some older women there and the same thing went on.</span> <span id="s208">In the early morning when the doors opened there was somebody taken out which we never seen and we were aware of it of course.</span> <span id="s209">From day to day you did not know if you were going to be the one next morning and most of the people were taken out into the woods.</span> <span id="s210">They used at that time…they had Russian prisoners of war and they were used to dig the grave and they were lined up at the grave and they didn’t have to push them in so they fall in all on their own.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: And they were just covered up?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Oh sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: They did not have Crematoriums?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Oh no…they didn’t have those things.</span> <span id="s215">These were strictly in Germany in your large camps where they exterminated them by the thousands…no they didn’t have those.</span> <span id="s216">In Estonia and the small countries, they were mostly just shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: Do you remember the name of the camp that you were in?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Well it was in Rakueve.</span> <span id="s219">There was no special name for it really.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: That’s good.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Yeah…</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: Well Rakueve was also the name of a town.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Yeah…it was in outskirt of the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: All of this took place within a few miles of your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Yes…within a few miles…I’d say maybe eight, nine, ten miles or something like that out of town where the camp was at…where the military encampment was.</span> <span id="s226">Then after working there, we were taken out to work for different places.</span> <span id="s227">We used to go to clean houses that the Germans…the Military would be moving in.</span> <span id="s228">Winter was on it’s way…we had very severe winters.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: And how did you keep warm during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: Well we had been given some clothing and the housekeeper was able to bring me some clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: The people that provided for you and others were able to move freely in and out of the camps with food and clothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: No…no…they were all checked but they would let in clothing and maybe some food…not much food, but clothing they would be able to bring in.</span> <span id="s233">That was about it.</span> <span id="s234">You’d never be able to see them or nothing like that.</span> <span id="s235">I don’t know how much of the stuff we ever got…that nobody knows, but we were given clothing…probably the clothing was no value to anybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: And where was your father during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: My father was in a different camp and he was up by our capitol which is called Tallinn or (words missing in original transcript) whichever you want to call it.</span> <span id="s238">He was there…he spent two years in year…so…</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Did he survive it?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Oh yes…he came home after two years and he laughed…nobody’s big enough to kill me.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Tough guy!</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: He was tough…he was seventy - one by then…no he wasn’t seventy - one…he was about sixty - nine by then.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Please tell me…describe some more of your life in the camp.</span> <span id="s244">Were you able to keep clean?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: Well, yes and no…there was no special cleanliness.</span> <span id="s246">We had lice and we had bed bugs and we had all the ordinary bugs that you get when you have no sanitary of any kind and it’s very much the same as here…any camp in Germany…I mean there was no cleanliness.</span> <span id="s247">You did have a chance to wash once in a while and I had real long hair which I have it again now and of course, first thing that was to be cut off because otherwise there was no way of keeping it clean.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: They cut it off?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: No…no, we cut it ourselves because…it was just for the cleanliness purpose.</span> <span id="s250">You had no, nothing…I mean there’s just no way you could keep your long hair in shape and not have lice in them because that was a common thing and when you have seventy women in one room and sleeping on those…how would you say…they were like boards across and you sleep on them with straw on it.</span> <span id="s251">I mean…hey…and you have nothing else there.</span> <span id="s252">You had maybe a rag or two if you did get a chance to wash your face or whatever, you had a rag to wipe it with.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Did you have any blankets at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: Oh yeah, we had a blankets…I guess they were blankets.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Did people try to steal from one another?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: No there was nothing to steal because we weren’t allowed anything.</span> <span id="s257">We had nothing…we got the same amount of food whatever it was…it wasn’t very much of anything.</span> <span id="s258">We got a little piece of bread a day and a cup of hot water in the morning and then lunch – time they called it soup…I don’t know.</span> <span id="s259">My father told me later it looked like somebody washed his socks in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Dishwater!</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Dishwater, yea…and you survived…you lived…and some of them…there was also a suicide rate which there are people that can’t handle this type of life and I’m positive that that happened everywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: What methods did they use for suicide?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: Hanging them mostly with whatever…you know…and that was kinda a shock to everybody because when somebody if you are sleeping and you find some of your roommates hanging somewheres in the corner.</span> <span id="s264">It’s a shock and you have to learn to live with it.</span> <span id="s265">It’s amazing how little it takes to survive… which we everyday…we all we doing is surviving…maybe we think we have all this and we have all that.</span> <span id="s266">It’s nothing but survival anyhow and when you don’t have nothing else left but your life, it’s amazing how you will hang on to that and survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: By any means.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: By any means…no, I wouldn’t go that far to say that because when you say by any means to me that would mean that you would be doing something to somebody else to save your life.</span> <span id="s269">No…I don’t believe in that but you do survive…I personally…I don’t about other people that much, but I personally…this is going to sound funny.</span> <span id="s270">I built a wall around myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: During that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: During that time…and it’s still here and nobody…I convinced myself that nobody was going to penetrate that and I felt safe because I wouldn’t let anybody…in any way, I wouldn’t let their meanness, their cruelty, their hunger, all that stuff, get to me because I was convinced I was going to come out of this and I wasn’t going to end up in a loonie pen somewheres after that…and I wasn’t going to live in the past after that.</span> <span id="s273">This was part of my life…and if I survived, it was not gonna affect me after that anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: Can you describe any of your techniques for doing this?</span> <span id="s275">How did you build this wall?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: I had learned most of it from my father…to be strong, to be independent and to believe in what you believed in…don’t change your beliefs if you…I think every person has a certain sense of right and wrong and you can do that to yourself.</span> <span id="s277">You can study…you can think…you can figure things out.</span> <span id="s278">How would I like…when people are cruel they have never had a talk with themselves.</span> <span id="s279">When they do cruel things to other people, they never stop to think…how would I like that if this were done to me…and this is always a very good example.</span> <span id="s280">You analyze these things and I say hey, I wouldn’t want anybody to do these things to me.</span> <span id="s281">What gives me the right and why should I do those to other people…and that’s one very simple rule… and when you follow these rules, you have no problem, and you know that you’re right.</span> <span id="s282">When you go back, like I was saying history…history tells you an awful lot and if you learn and you read and you wanna find out, it’s amazing what a person can learn and all on your own.</span> <span id="s283">You don’t have to go to school…you don’t have to go to College.</span> <span id="s284">The schools really don’t give you anything if you’re not willing to learn.</span> <span id="s285">You can do it on your own.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: I agree with all you say but as I’m sitting here…in the desperate circumstances in the camps, it would have been harder…</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: Of course it is harder…it’s understandable it’s harder.</span> <span id="s288">Every people from all walks of life…the ones that are screaming at night…the ones that are crying continually, especially the women.</span> <span id="s289">They didn’t know what they were there for because when somebody said when they were asked, “Where’s your husband, where’s your son”?</span> <span id="s290">We didn’t know where people were because the war had been on since 1940 when the Russians came in and I mean, we had no idea…and when you get asked these questions, it is hard to be calm and all that but yet deep down, you have to be and I was one of the lucky ones because I had learned all that from my father.</span> <span id="s291">He was a very, very intelligent man and it helped.</span> <span id="s292">Like I said earlier, it still helps me.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: I can see that.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Yeah, because you can’t let these things make you into something that you’re not.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: And during all this time, your guards were Estonians?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: They were all Estonians…very young men because they were all taken in to the German Army after when they came in and then they were the guards…and even the man that was the camp leader or whatever you would call him…he was Estonian.</span> <span id="s297">We did see now and then, the Germans…the big shots I guess you would call them.</span> <span id="s298">They would come and inspect once in a while.</span> <span id="s299">That was very seldom that we seen them but the dirty work was done by our own people.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Essentially they were like an offshoot of the German Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: Oh sure…they were German Army.</span> <span id="s302">They were all into the German…they were given uniforms and everything by the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Was there any medical attention available to anyone?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: No…no, there was no medical attention.</span> <span id="s305">I think one time I had my finger…something had happened to it and I…there was supposedly been a doctor there.</span> <span id="s306">I don’t if he’s a doctor or not.</span> <span id="s307">I seen the man and what he was capable of doing and I don’t think he was a doctor.</span> <span id="s308">I went to him after about so long you know, suffering with this thing…and they let me see him…and all he did was take a pair of scissors and cut it open.</span> <span id="s309">That was about it, but I don’t think he was a doctor…no.</span> <span id="s310">The medical…why bother with the medical…sooner or later they gonna be exterminated anyhow.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: They just worked people to death essentially.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: Yeah, well we were moved…a group of us was moved into the country.</span> <span id="s313">The last end of it before I was released, we were moved…</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: About how long were you in this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: I think we were there…let’s see I think it was from October to about April…the winter months…and then May, we were sent out into the country…the spring was coming…and then we were sent out into the fields to…we were housed in an old building and then we worked out in the fields.</span> <span id="s316">That was the last end of that and after that it was really.</span> <span id="s317">We did mostly street cleanings and house cleanings…and oh yes and we were also taken by groups of three, four, five, six, whatever women taken into the military kitchens to peel potatoes and I’m an excellent potato peeler.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: If you were in the kitchens, was that a means of getting a little extra food?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: Yes we did have extra food what was given to us.</span> <span id="s320">We were not able to take what we wanted, but were given something to eat during the day…but we were not allowed to take anything back into the camp because we were searched every time we went back in.</span> <span id="s321">There was no way…people tried and sometimes it was embarrassing you know what they tried to bring back and how…you couldn’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: And what was this other camp that you went to?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: That was mainly just working out in the fields and I was there only about a month.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: Tell me about the circumstances of being released.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: I really don’t know…being a political prisoner I guess they decided to turn her loose.</span> <span id="s326">She wasn’t going to bend one way or the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: Did they try to make you bend?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: Of course…you have to admit that what…when a people are made to admit or forced to admit something that they did not do or they do not believe in, that is very hard on everybody…and people will break…but I always believed I stand my ground if I know I’m right you cannot change my mind.</span> <span id="s329">I don’t care what way.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: You would prefer…</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: You better believe it…you better believe it.</span> <span id="s332">It was one of the things I told our own people during the interrogation we had them.</span> <span id="s333">They were quite nasty…they would slap us and beat us and all this.</span> <span id="s334">We had one particular interrogator…he thought he was really…I would say he was probably in his thirties.</span> <span id="s335">He was also an Estonian and the first one we were arrested.</span> <span id="s336">He was the first interrogator and he would yell real loud at you…real obnoxious sort of person…and he would get you, he would hold you by your throat and he’d slap you on both sides of your face.</span> <span id="s337">I guess I got slapped more than the others probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: How often were you interrogated during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: Well, for three weeks…almost three weeks when(words missing in original transcript) we were interrogated all the way through.</span> <span id="s340">I mean just about every other day or every other day they would (words missing in original transcript) and mostly the same thing over and over…if you said this or you did this and yes you don’t believe Germany is bringing us freedom more than the Russians did or something on that order…and of course, they didn’t.</span> <span id="s341">No way that they would.</span> <span id="s342">If I had my choice, I think I would have taken the Russians against the Germans…and I’m still saying it…I’m saying it every day to people that say that there was no such thing as Holocaust…there was no such thing.</span> <span id="s343">I say they’re crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Well those are the Revisionists.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Yeah, that’s what I mean.</span> <span id="s346">They like to make it look good but it isn’t…it’s there and I hope it stays in the history because if this is not taught to people and brought out and explained what can happen, it can happen again.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: People are not prepared.</span> <span id="s349">And another thing, the schools are not teaching.</span> <span id="s350">You take average school.</span> <span id="s351">How much history do they teach.</span> <span id="s352">They teach history in a word of history.</span> <span id="s353">But they never teach history with what has happened and what can happen again.</span> <span id="s354">When you read about the cruelties of thousands of years ago, hundreds of years ago, the cruelties of certain groups of people, certain nationalities, and these have always come back up again.</span> <span id="s355">Germany for one instance.</span> <span id="s356">I don’t know if I can say that.</span> <span id="s357">And the Japanese is another group of people.</span> <span id="s358">And if you read the history, you should learn something from it.</span> <span id="s359">Why is it?</span> <span id="s360">Okay, sure we know Japan is dead, Germany is dead.</span> <span id="s361">China is there.</span> <span id="s362">That is not history.</span> <span id="s363">History goes much, much deeper.</span> <span id="s364">History is something that you learn from.</span> <span id="s365">And when people talk about the Romans -- how cruel they were, I say, “Yes, they were cruel, of course.</span> <span id="s366">But that was 2,000 years ago and they only fed the Christians to the lions.</span> <span id="s367">The Nazis -- compared to the Nazis, the Romans were pussycats.</span> <span id="s368">Cause what they did, they skinned people alive.</span> <span id="s369">They burned them, they gassed them by the millions.</span> <span id="s370">They did all kinds of things and they enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s371">So you’re telling me that the Romans were cruel.</span> <span id="s372">Uh, uh.</span> <span id="s373">But at the same time, when you are reading all these things, you should still learn something.</span> <span id="s374">But the main thing is always the situation of the country, of the people, what happens when people are desperate.</span> <span id="s375">That’s how Hitler got to power.</span> <span id="s376">Germany was nothing in the 20’s – the late 20’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: That’s part of the problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: That’s what I’m saying.</span> <span id="s379">The same thing happened in Russia.</span> <span id="s380">The wealthy were living high up on the hog and the poor people had nothing.</span> <span id="s381">They were on the streets, they had no food, they had no jobs.</span> <span id="s382">They had nothing.</span> <span id="s383">Anybody that comes up and promises something better, of course they’re going to go over there.</span> <span id="s384">Because they’ve got to survive.</span> <span id="s385">They’ve got to eat something.</span> <span id="s386">They’ve got to have a place to sleep.</span> <span id="s387">And our country looks very bad now.</span> <span id="s388">We have so many people out on the street.</span> <span id="s389">If nothing is changed, I hate to see it years from now.</span> <span id="s390">Because if you don’t keep the people working, that’s all most people want.</span> <span id="s391">They want a job, they want a roof over their head and they want something to eat.</span> <span id="s392">They want the children to go to school.</span> <span id="s393">And then them to have a job.</span> <span id="s394">But if those things are not there, it isn’t very healthy.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: We have to have some hope, don’t we?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s397">We have to have hope; we have to have something.</span> <span id="s398">And when you get somebody out there that is promising things that are impossible, you know darn well he’s not going to be able to do this.</span> <span id="s399">And the people do believe him.</span> <span id="s400">See, this again is up to the individual to believe that man.</span> <span id="s401">Is he going to do it?</span> <span id="s402">How is he going to do it?</span> <span id="s403">Of course Hitler didn’t do it alone.</span> <span id="s404">He was their instigator.</span> <span id="s405">But he had to have help.</span> <span id="s406">And the ones that believed in him, they’re the ones that followed him.</span> <span id="s407">They would do anything for him.</span> <span id="s408">They didn’t matter who they killed.</span> <span id="s409">Their own family, their own mother.</span> <span id="s410">It did not matter who.</span> <span id="s411">That went on all over Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: How do you explain that he was cable to get these people to follow him and to do such dreadful things?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Well first of all, there is -- German people are not going to like me…</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Well this isn’t a popularity contest.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: I know (laugh).</span> <span id="s416">There is a race of people in Germany, we have them here now.</span> <span id="s417">They call themselves the (words missing in original transcript) Aryans now.</span> <span id="s418">So they called them then Neo – Nazis.</span> <span id="s419">They’ve always been a race of people there.</span> <span id="s420">They are power hungry and they’re cruel.</span> <span id="s421">And those are the ones who followed him first, to start with.</span> <span id="s422">And another thing, I don’t think in – I don’t know if the Jewish people, I have not seen it mentioned in any…I’ve read a lot of books about the Holocaust and different things, and I’ve seen movies and stuff, and something else is not been quite pointed out.</span> <span id="s423">Another reason, of course, was racial, one.</span> <span id="s424">Number two, it was profitable to exterminate the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s425">‘Cause the Jewish people have always been able to survive.</span> <span id="s426">The business people, they’re successful.</span> <span id="s427">That was another reason to be…to exterminate them, because they had what Germany didn’t have.</span> <span id="s428">They had valuables, they had money.</span> <span id="s429">You know, as well as I do, they even cut their hair off of these women.</span> <span id="s430">They pulled their gold teeth out of their mouth.</span> <span id="s431">This was all used to build up Germany.</span> <span id="s432">Not so much Germany itself, the military power that Germany built up in a matter of a few years.</span> <span id="s433">And ‘cause they had slogans all over Germany that read (words missing in original transcript) which means all the wheels were turning for the war.</span> <span id="s434">And that was the thing that put Germany to work, was building war materials.</span> <span id="s435">They didn’t build anything for anybody else.</span> <span id="s436">And they got every bit of these valuables that people had.</span> <span id="s437">And how many Jewish people were able to go back to their homes that survived and found all their stuff after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: Very few.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Very few.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: Most of them…</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: So this was another -- that was another reason to exterminate all these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Let’s go back to…you were saying you were finally released from camp.</span> <span id="s443">Just one day they said, “Go.”</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Yes, I was more or less told one morning that I can go, that I was free to go home.</span> <span id="s445">And, of course…</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: By this time, how far away were you from home?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: By that time I was maybe like 50 miles from home.</span> <span id="s448">Because I had been moved slowly, you know.</span> <span id="s449">And…where do you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: What was your reaction?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: The reaction was great, of course.</span> <span id="s452">I mean, hey, I’m going to survive.</span> <span id="s453">I made it.</span> <span id="s454">Naturally, that was the greatest thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: At this time you were about 17?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: By that time, I was 17.</span> <span id="s457">Yes.</span> <span id="s458">And I was in my teens in 1942.</span> <span id="s459">And when they told me that, at first I couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s460">And then they said, “Yah, you can go.”</span> <span id="s461">So, I left.</span> <span id="s462">I didn’t even know where I was going, but I went.</span> <span id="s463">Whatever rags were left, I was hungry and I walked, I know I walked all day.</span> <span id="s464">Because there was no way of transportation of any kind.</span> <span id="s465">You had nothing that you could even –no way, no transportation of any kind.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: When you were so malnourished, had you lost a lot of weight?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: Yah, of course.</span> <span id="s468">Everybody did.</span> <span id="s469">Hey, we were skin and bones.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: So walking 50 miles was going to be difficult?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Well, it took me a few days.</span> <span id="s472">It took me a few days.</span> <span id="s473">At first, I arrived the first night and I was around in the middle of the day, and I just walked.</span> <span id="s474">I had a vague idea which direction to go.</span> <span id="s475">And I walked and then I’d spend the night in the woods.</span> <span id="s476">I had some kind of Jacket or something.</span> <span id="s477">And that was one of those things that kept me warm.</span> <span id="s478">If my feet got cold, I put it on my feet, and then I’d put it on top again.</span> <span id="s479">And next morning I arrived at the town of Bruckverne and I didn’t know anybody there.</span> <span id="s480">And then from there I walked home, which was another probably 15 or 20 miles on the outside and I arrived there.</span> <span id="s481">I don’t remember the date exactly.</span> <span id="s482">That’s terrible; I should look it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">I arrived home on Easter Sunday.</span> <span id="s484">The housekeeper was still there, of course.</span> <span id="s485">My father was still in a camp.</span> <span id="s486">He spent two years in it.</span> <span id="s487">It was a weird experience and I always said if you’re a bird, you can sit on a tree limb and then you can look to see.</span> <span id="s488">But when you’re a human being, it takes a little more than that.</span> <span id="s489">And somehow I made it home the second day, in the afternoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: And this was a farm really?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A; Yes, it was a small farm.</span> <span id="s492">My father was more or less retired.</span> <span id="s493">He wasn’t working the farm.</span> <span id="s494">He had the house and about 40 acres.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q; Where would the housekeeper have gotten food?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A; Well, we had enough there that she worked it or went in with the neighbors, also.</span> <span id="s497">People were known there.</span> <span id="s498">They were farm people and they raised everything their own.</span> <span id="s499">Of course everything was rationed at the time.</span> <span id="s500">Also, you got so much of this and so much of that and certain items were completely gone, but they were all taken away by the military.</span> <span id="s501">First, the Russians, then the (words missing in original transcript) and the (words missing in original transcript) and then the Germans.</span> <span id="s502">But the farmers survived a lot better than people in the cities and communities that had to depend on storing things.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: When you were in the camp, you mentioned there were gypsies there.</span> <span id="s504">Were there also Jewish people there?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: I know the Jewish people were separated from the beginning.</span> <span id="s506">They were mostly shipped to Germany.</span> <span id="s507">The Jewish people were always taken to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: Have you any idea what the size of the Jewish population was?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s510">I have read some books.</span> <span id="s511">I have never got quite the amount of people what was there left, because during Russian occupation and before 19 --late ’39, ’40, when the Russians occupied the Baltic States, which was an agreement between Russia and Germany, for Russia not having an outlet to the Baltic Sea.</span> <span id="s512">And then, at the same time Germany started a war with Poland.</span> <span id="s513">But later on, they got known to each other.</span> <span id="s514">A lot of Jewish people left the country already, before and during the Russian occupation.</span> <span id="s515">They were leaving the country, going to Scandinavian countries like Sweden, Norway, different…especially Sweden.</span> <span id="s516">And through different channels they got out.</span> <span id="s517">But the ones that had not left, of course they were all gathered up.</span> <span id="s518">And they were also mostly gathered up by our own people.</span> <span id="s519">.</span> <span id="s520">The German military came from Germany.</span> <span id="s521">When they got there, they didn’t know if you were Jewish.</span> <span id="s522">The only difference they could tell, if you were tell if you were black or white.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Most of the time all these things were done by local people.</span> <span id="s524">And nobody brought this point out.</span> <span id="s525">I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s526">I understand it.</span> <span id="s527">What are they hiding?</span> <span id="s528">I know our people here, my own people, a lot of them are hiding so much of it.</span> <span id="s529">Because they don’t want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s530">But they were probably the people that did those things.</span> <span id="s531">I know –okay, I’ll give you an example.</span> <span id="s532">During Estonian, which was a good democratic country for a very few years between the two wars, and the constable (they call him that over there) he was a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s533">I mean a friend of my father’s.</span> <span id="s534">I don’t mean a real friend, he knew him.</span> <span id="s535">He came over once in a while.</span> <span id="s536">They would visit and drink and so on.</span> <span id="s537">And when the Russians arrived, he disappeared.</span> <span id="s538">I mean the man was gone.</span> <span id="s539">Naturally, people were disappearing every day, same as they did during the Nazi occupation.</span> <span id="s540">So nobody thought nothing of it.</span> <span id="s541">He was the man, when the Germans came in over there, he came back and he was the leader of the whole bunch that was arresting all these other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Meanwhile, later it was found out when the Russians came in, he moved closer to the Russian border.</span> <span id="s543">He was working for Russians over there.</span> <span id="s544">So when the Germans came in, he felt it was safe to go back to his hometown and start working for the Germans.</span> <span id="s545">And this only one example.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: He was a real opportunist.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s548">He was a real opportunist.</span> <span id="s549">Or, like I heard later, while I was in a camp, the people had somehow got hold of him and he was taken back and just shot.</span> <span id="s550">Somewheres in the woods they got rid of him.</span> <span id="s551">It was all found out what was going on.</span> <span id="s552">But there’s always opportunists, there’s always greed.</span> <span id="s553">Greed is number one in most of these cases and this is your everyday life.</span> <span id="s554">A democratic country here, you see greed.</span> <span id="s555">And that was another thing there.</span> <span id="s556">As long as I figure I can save my life, what do I care about the next person.</span> <span id="s557">And that is wrong.</span> <span id="s558">And this is something that should be taught to people.</span> <span id="s559">Not to be greedy.</span> <span id="s560">And always keep in mind, hey, would I like to be treated like that?</span> <span id="s561">And it’s so simple.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: We call it the “Golden Rule.’</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: “Golden Rule” -- right.</span> <span id="s564">The Golden Rule -- I think that rule has been broken years ago.</span> <span id="s565">It doesn’t seem to exist any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: Okay, so how long from the beginning to end, were you away from home?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: (pauses for thought) I was gone for about eleven months.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: Eleven months.</span> <span id="s569">You got home and your housekeeper was there and, of course, you’d be glad to get back home and you also learned that your neighbors were not people whom you could trust.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: Right.</span> <span id="s571">The first day when I was coming home, it was in the afternoon, and like I said, it was Easter Sunday.</span> <span id="s572">I didn’t see anybody.</span> <span id="s573">I had to come through the village and stuff.</span> <span id="s574">I didn’t see anybody.</span> <span id="s575">I guess whatever they were doing.</span> <span id="s576">And, of course the next day we (words missing in original transcript) as soon as -- oh, yeh, when I was on my way through the town of Rakueve, I had to stop at the big camp and pick up my piece of paper that I was free to go.</span> <span id="s577">And as soon as I got home, I had to go and check in with the local police.</span> <span id="s578">Which after that I was under the, what do they call it here, on parole like.</span> <span id="s579">Because I was still a danger to the Third Reich.</span> <span id="s580">So I had to check in every week with the local police.</span> <span id="s581">So the following day, when I went to them, to the original place that we were arrested and sent to, I had to go there and check in that I was back.</span> <span id="s582">And that’s when I met my neighbors.</span> <span id="s583">They were very humble and they were this and that and they were very shocked to see me back.</span> <span id="s584">Of course, the old man says, “Oh, you’re back.</span> <span id="s585">We’re so glad to have you back.”</span> <span id="s586">I said, “Don’t pretend.</span> <span id="s587">I know everything.”</span> <span id="s588">“Well, we didn’t do anything.”</span> <span id="s589">I said, “No, you didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s590">I’m back and I’m here to stay.’</span> <span id="s591">And I have always been a strict believer.</span> <span id="s592">Don’t take revenge.</span> <span id="s593">He’ll get to it.</span> <span id="s594">It’ll come around sooner or later.</span> <span id="s595">And it does.</span> <span id="s596">It usually does.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: Did it?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: Yes it did.</span> <span id="s599">Very nicely.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: Do you want to say anything about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: Yes, I can talk about it.</span> <span id="s602">It’s no big deal.</span> <span id="s603">They had three children.</span> <span id="s604">One was my age.</span> <span id="s605">The son was my age -- no he was a year older than me.</span> <span id="s606">They had a daughter four years older.</span> <span id="s607">The youngest daughter had epilepsy.</span> <span id="s608">When I came back, the son was in the German army and the daughter wasn’t home --the oldest daughter.</span> <span id="s609">Nobody knew what happened to her.</span> <span id="s610">No one.</span> <span id="s611">She just disappeared completely.</span> <span id="s612">And the youngest daughter, she was in an asylum.</span> <span id="s613">And it wasn’t too long after when the son was brought home.</span> <span id="s614">He was nothing -- a total cripple.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: Emotionally or physically?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: No, no, from the war.</span> <span id="s617">Because he was in the German army and he had been sent to the Russian front at that time.</span> <span id="s618">And when he came back, I think he lost a leg and part of an arm and all this.</span> <span id="s619">And I didn’t pity any of ‘em.</span> <span id="s620">Sounds a little cruel, but there’s a little bit of cruelty in every one of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: Poetic justice?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Yes, and that’s the way I feel about it and I’ve seen it happen many, many, many times, over and over.</span> <span id="s623">And it does happen, because I’m a strict believer in that.</span> <span id="s624">I might not go to church and all that stuff, but I believe in something -- there is justice, if it isn’t by humans, it is by something, I don’t know what it could be.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: What were the circumstances of your father’s release from the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s627">He came home two years later and that was that.</span> <span id="s628">He was (words missing in original transcript) .</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: What kind of physical condition was he in?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: He was in a fairly good physical condition because he had been working in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s631">So that gave him an opportunity to survive.</span> <span id="s632">He was a very strong man.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: But he was getting older all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: Of course, he was older, but that didn’t mean nothing.</span> <span id="s635">He wasn’t as old -- according to his age, yes.</span> <span id="s636">But otherwise he was a very young man.</span> <span id="s637">He was an amazing human being.</span> <span id="s638">I wish there were more like that.</span> <span id="s639">Not because he’s my father.</span> <span id="s640">No.</span> <span id="s641">He was an amazing human being.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Do you remember what it was like when he came home?</span> <span id="s643">Did you expect him?</span> <span id="s644">Did he just walk in?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: You didn’t expect anybody to come back and there was no correspondence of any kind.</span> <span id="s646">I didn’t even know where he was, if he was dead or alive.</span> <span id="s647">Nobody knew anything.</span> <span id="s648">Like that.</span> <span id="s649">I mean that was the same as you know, you talking about the Holocaust and stuff.</span> <span id="s650">Did anybody know where anybody was, like that.</span> <span id="s651">I mean that was not the case.</span> <span id="s652">He just walked in one day and that was it.</span> <span id="s653">And, of course, it was a nice reunion.</span> <span id="s654">And then everybody was happy and so on.</span> <span id="s655">We both survived and his first expression was that he said, “Hey, this world isn’t big enough to get me.”</span> <span id="s656">Me neither.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Like father, like daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: That is still my expression.</span> <span id="s659">I tell my friends that people continually – when people are complaining about nothing.</span> <span id="s660">I say, “Hey, look around.</span> <span id="s661">Appreciate nature and things.</span> <span id="s662">Always look at it this way.</span> <span id="s663">It could be so much worse.</span> <span id="s664">It could be so much worse.</span> <span id="s665">What is wrong there?</span> <span id="s666">Nothing.</span> <span id="s667">You have food, you’ve got a house, you’re healthy.</span> <span id="s668">If you’re really sick or something, that’s sad.”</span> <span id="s669">But in general, my God, what does it take?</span> <span id="s670">It doesn’t take a heck of a lot for a human being to survive and be happy.</span> <span id="s671">It has to come from inside.</span> <span id="s672">You can’t buy it, you can’t borrow it, you can’t take it away from somebody.</span> <span id="s673">You think “I’m going to take it away from so and so and I’ll keep it and I’ll be happier.”</span> <span id="s674">You don’t do things that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: True.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: (laughing) I’m glad you agree.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: What were the circumstances that led you to leave Estonia?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: Well, by that time -- okay, someday I should write a book.</span> <span id="s679">I’ve got a lot of it taped already.</span> <span id="s680">I should do something about it and I’d love to.</span> <span id="s681">I’ve had a quite interesting life, from all the way from day one to when we arrived in this country.</span> <span id="s682">Leaving the country, there was quite a bit lighter.</span> <span id="s683">I came home in ’42.</span> <span id="s684">I left there in ’44, because…</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: The war was still on?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: The war was still on, of course.</span> <span id="s687">I think in ’43, the winter of ’43, the Germans were stopped, up by Leningrad.</span> <span id="s688">And the fighting went on for…and I left there September of ’44.</span> <span id="s689">I was one day ahead before the Russians came back in.</span> <span id="s690">‘Cause I know when I had left this town, at that time my father was home, the housekeeper had passed away about a year later and then there was just me and my father.</span> <span id="s691">So, by then it was decided by their new government, which was German government, that there was -- no, I’m getting my story mixed up.</span> <span id="s692">In ’43 we took in a lady with two children that had come from Russia or something.</span> <span id="s693">Her husband was in the Russian military.</span> <span id="s694">See, when my husband’s brother was in the Russian army.</span> <span id="s695">He was taken into the German army when the Russians occupied the country.</span> <span id="s696">My husband was taken into the German army.</span> <span id="s697">So this was one of those things that we ripped everything up.</span> <span id="s698">We had taken in…</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: Let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s700">When did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: Oh, that was later.</span> <span id="s702">We got married in Germany, in a camp.</span> <span id="s703">That has nothing to do with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: When did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: In 1948.</span> <span id="s706">Okay, no, no, that had nothing to do with that.</span> <span id="s707">And so when this lady somehow came back and she had no place to go and somehow, I don’t know, she came to this particular village, so we took her in.</span> <span id="s708">Then it was decided by their government, whoever, there was too many people living in one place.</span> <span id="s709">Some of them should go out and work someplace else.</span> <span id="s710">‘ Cause Germany was great for that.</span> <span id="s711">They would ship people from one side of the country to the other to work.</span> <span id="s712">You wanted to go or not, that was not the question.</span> <span id="s713">If you didn’t go willingly, you were taken and placed somewhere to work.</span> <span id="s714">And so my father, by that, he was 70 years old by then.</span> <span id="s715">So he said he would go.</span> <span id="s716">And I said, “No, I will go.”</span> <span id="s717">So by then I was 18 years old and I was supposed to go work on some farm.</span> <span id="s718">I said, “No, I won’t work on a farm, until I know where I am going.”</span> <span id="s719">I had one of my friends that I had met in a labor camp and by that time she was also released.</span> <span id="s720">She wasn’t in the last place I was in; we were separated.</span> <span id="s721">But she had also survived.</span> <span id="s722">And she was working at a first aid station in Rakueve.</span> <span id="s723">And she had said something, if I ever wanted to work, I could come there.</span> <span id="s724">So I worked there.</span> <span id="s725">It was a German installation, but it was also --‘cause we had also our young men were in the military by that time.</span> <span id="s726">So I worked there, in the kitchen and all these other things, or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s727">And then later, in ’44, ‘cause the war was getting too close, so we -- I left, went back home.</span> <span id="s728">And a day ahead before.</span> <span id="s729">Because my father --some people were leaving and some were staying and so on.</span> <span id="s730">And my father had a talk with me one day and he says, “The Russians are coming back and I don’t know how you’re going to get along with them.</span> <span id="s731">And I’m too old.”</span> <span id="s732">He said, “I don’t really worry about it anymore.”</span> <span id="s733">Which was true.</span> <span id="s734">A lot of the older people had a rough time after leaving and going.</span> <span id="s735">They had no place to go and so on.</span> <span id="s736">But he says, “If you want to leave -- go.”</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: What was the prevailing attitude or feeling about the Russians?</span> <span id="s738">Were they dreaded?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: Well they were dreaded also for the simple -- of course, they were dreaded because at the same time before, when the Russians came in from ’41, we lost 14,000 of our people that were sent to Russian labor camps.</span> <span id="s740">And again, they were mostly, I would say, school teachers and people like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: So they weren’t viewed as rescuers, for sure?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: No, no ,they were no rescuers; neither one of them was a rescuer, as far as that goes.</span> <span id="s743">But, they didn’t use as much cruelty, for one thing.</span> <span id="s744">Not in the country itself there.</span> <span id="s745">I don’t know what happened in Russia, I never was there.</span> <span id="s746">That’s something I cannot verify exactly what went on.</span> <span id="s747">But when they first came in, we lost about 20 acres of our land because we were told we had too much land, we weren’t supposed to have it, it was given to somebody.</span> <span id="s748">It was just like you would take something away from somebody here and give it to the people who had been on welfare.</span> <span id="s749">They don’t really care.</span> <span id="s750">And it was given to somebody; I don’t know who.</span> <span id="s751">My father says, “ Go ahead, take it.</span> <span id="s752">Big deal.</span> <span id="s753">We weren’t using it anyhow.”</span> <span id="s754">So and certain other things.</span> <span id="s755">There was limitations, you know, on this and that, but they weren’t there that long, the first time around.</span> <span id="s756">‘Cause the Germans were there from ’41 to ’44.</span> <span id="s757">So that was a longer time.</span> <span id="s758">And so when we had our little talk there and he said, “If you want to go, go.”</span> <span id="s759">There was a few other people that had young people and I know there was some older people and families that…and the leaving was something that you really didn’t know where you were going.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: You didn’t have a…plan on going to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s762">Oh, God, no; that came way later.</span> <span id="s763">A lot of our people went to Sweden; at least they tried to.</span> <span id="s764">Some made it, some didn’t.</span> <span id="s765">A lot of the boats were sunk crossing.</span> <span id="s766">And so that was one thing that was out.</span> <span id="s767">So there was a group of people that had decided to leave.</span> <span id="s768">There was a couple of families and there was a few single people.</span> <span id="s769">So, somehow we just…I think we walked most of the way.</span> <span id="s770">We got to Latvia and, of course, we were stopped here and there, where were we going and we just made up our mind we were going to Germany because Germany was losing the war by then.</span> <span id="s771">Instead of going to Sweden, be sunk in the middle of the Baltic Sea, it didn’t seem a very good idea.</span> <span id="s772">And so we were in Latvia for quite a while.</span> <span id="s773">A group of us, we got on some kind of a ship, I don’t remember what the heck it was.</span> <span id="s774">I know we were in the harbor there, trying to find out if we could get to Holland.</span> <span id="s775">And so we got on -- it must have been some kind of a ship that hauls stuff and they had straw and we slept on that.</span> <span id="s776">Once you put your head down, you could hear the bugs running around in there.</span> <span id="s777">And we were loaded with lice and all kind of stuff by the time we got to Holland.</span> <span id="s778">Then we went through this delousing station or whatever the heck it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: How long were you on the ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: Oh, I wasn’t -- from Lithuania to Holland wasn’t that long.</span> <span id="s781">I think it was a matter of two, three days.</span> <span id="s782">We did get something to eat there.</span> <span id="s783">I don’t know how much it was.</span> <span id="s784">And we got to Holland and we were in a little town in Holland and we worked there.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: You stayed with the group?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: With the group, yes.</span> <span id="s787">By that time, there was only three of us left.</span> <span id="s788">Then we stayed together.</span> <span id="s789">I think some of the people stayed in Holland.</span> <span id="s790">And then the war was getting closer to England were bombing, coming from the flight over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: Do you remember the name of the town in Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: Yes, it was a small town, it’s called Baarns.</span> <span id="s793">It’s a little way out of Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s794">It’s B-a-a-r-n-s -- Baarns.</span> <span id="s795">And we stayed with some private people for a little while.</span> <span id="s796">And then we left there and came into Germany.</span> <span id="s797">Crossed the border and we came into a factory.</span> <span id="s798">A bomb factory and we got a job over there.</span> <span id="s799">So that’s how we came to Germany.</span> <span id="s800">Hitler was still in power, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: Weren’t you afraid to go into Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: Well, the English were only a little ways away.</span> <span id="s803">See, I -- we came into Germany in December, just shortly before Christmas.</span> <span id="s804">And the first of April England was in there already.</span> <span id="s805">For me, the war was over the 1st of April.</span> <span id="s806">And a funny coincidence again was Easter Sunday, when the English marched into the little town of Ahaus, in Germany.</span> <span id="s807">So two Easters were very important to me.</span> <span id="s808">Yes, the town was called Ahaus – A-h-a-u-s.</span> <span id="s809">Ahaus.</span> <span id="s810">It is about 30 kilometers from the Dutch border.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: What was it like when the war ended?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: Ahh, the war ended, like I said earlier, a bird has a better chance.</span> <span id="s813">There was nothing.</span> <span id="s814">Even there, we worked in a factory there, which was like I said, it was still Hitler’s time.</span> <span id="s815">And they were making a kind of weaving and spinning outfit that they made sacks and stuff for the military.</span> <span id="s816">I don’t know what they were, what they were used for.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: You said you had a sense that the war was coming to an end.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: Oh, of course, it was coming to an end.</span> <span id="s819">There was none of us that didn’t know what was going on.</span> <span id="s820">You know, there was newspapers.</span> <span id="s821">There was like even during the German occupation in occupied Estonia.</span> <span id="s822">There was always the Underground that kept you up.</span> <span id="s823">If you were in contact with them, they kept you up on things.</span> <span id="s824">And so…but otherwise I would have never gone to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: Can you describe what it was like, how people behaved, when they learned that the Germans had surrendered?</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: Well, I don’t know how the people survived --reacted anywhere else, but I know how we did, because it was a relief and still they didn’t see no hope on the horizon at the moment, because you didn’t have nothing.</span> <span id="s827">You had no home, you had nothing, absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s828">We went to, when we worked in the factory, we were put into this big barrack.</span> <span id="s829">Now there was women there from Latvia, Estonia and Russia.</span> <span id="s830">There were 10 of us there.</span> <span id="s831">Well, at that time the air raids were on continually.</span> <span id="s832">We worked in the factory and I lost -- we lost three of the women there.</span> <span id="s833">From the 10 that we worked with in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: Because of the bombing?</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: Because of the bombing, of course.</span> <span id="s836">The whole town was leveled after awhile.</span> <span id="s837">The last one was -- completely -- everything was leveled.</span> <span id="s838">One of the women was very badly wounded.</span> <span id="s839">She was in a hospital already.</span> <span id="s840">And then one of my little girlfriends that I had met, she was from Russia.</span> <span id="s841">She was a year younger than me.</span> <span id="s842">By that time, that was in ’44,, I was 19 and she was 18, so we had kind of got to be friends and we stuck it out.</span> <span id="s843">And so when the factory was blown out, everything was blown out, we did have a few clothes, I did have a suitcase and had some things in it -- had some pictures.</span> <span id="s844">And I found a couple of pictures and I found a picture of my father, which was a great --that’s one of the saddest things.</span> <span id="s845">But -- and then we had nothing, ‘cause whatever was in there was gone.</span> <span id="s846">There was a big hole left in it, the building there.</span> <span id="s847">And we scrounged up some clothes and we just headed out in the country.</span> <span id="s848">And we knew this old German guy, he worked in a factory.</span> <span id="s849">He had already lost a son in the war.</span> <span id="s850">And he was a very, very nice old man.</span> <span id="s851">And he had told us that, “Hey, if things get tough, he lived out in the country.”</span> <span id="s852">To come over there.</span> <span id="s853">So, we did.</span> <span id="s854">This little Russian girl, Irene was there.</span> <span id="s855">And they put us up and we helped them whatever we could do for them.</span> <span id="s856">And we got food.</span> <span id="s857">And then the air raids were still going on.</span> <span id="s858">We used to --every night, when it got dark, so we’d go to town.</span> <span id="s859">If the bakery had blown up or something, we’d get bread.</span> <span id="s860">If the train was at the station, we got flour or different things.</span> <span id="s861">It was all around .</span> <span id="s862">We were always out there, getting something, you know.</span> <span id="s863">Dodging the bombs and what have you.</span> <span id="s864">And then when the war ended, we were (words missing in original transcript) the English (words missing in original transcript).</span> <span id="s865">Like I said, it was Easter morning.</span> <span id="s866">We looked out there and they were marching by.</span> <span id="s867">My English wasn’t so good at the time that I was able to communicate.</span> <span id="s868">My father spoke seven languages.</span> <span id="s869">And as a kid, you don’t want to learn anything.</span> <span id="s870">And I didn’t.</span> <span id="s871">Usually you learn the words that you’re not supposed to.</span> <span id="s872">He used to tell me, Learn this and that.</span> <span id="s873">And I said “Who am I going to talk to in this foreign stuff around here.”</span> <span id="s874">But what little I knew, it helped.</span> <span id="s875">They searched all of the houses of course, the English military and I talked to them.</span> <span id="s876">They said everything was okay.</span> <span id="s877">So then, we didn’t want to stay there anymore because we were more or less living off these people.</span> <span id="s878">So then we decided let’s go and see if we can find some work someplace else.</span> <span id="s879">So we worked on some more German farms over there.</span> <span id="s880">But we got five meals a day.</span> <span id="s881">We didn’t mind helping 14 or 15 hours a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">So then later on we left over there (words missing in original transcript) and going to the, what do you call it, DP camps.</span> <span id="s883">Displaced Persons.</span> <span id="s884">I think it is more and more misplaced than anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: Displaced persons means you expect to go back to where you came from.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: Yeah, well they went back most of them when we got to the camps in ’45, they -- I was in a camp in Hanau, 18 kilometers out of Frankfurt am Mein.</span> <span id="s887">And they have the French, the Belgians, the Italians -- all the different countries that Germany had occupied.</span> <span id="s888">They still had some of those people that hadn’t gone back to their own country.</span> <span id="s889">See our countries were occupied by Russia then.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: And where did you go from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: We stayed in camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: For how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: Until 1951 – until we emigrated to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: That’s a long time!</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: Of course, a long time.</span> <span id="s896">We survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: What was the quality of your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: That’s what I mean, you survive.</span> <span id="s899">That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: What did you do on a daily basis?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: On a daily basis, I think you really didn’t do anything, because there was certain groups of people who worked here and there.</span> <span id="s902">They were sent on labor details and stuff.</span> <span id="s903">I did.</span> <span id="s904">I came there in ’45 and in ’46 I went to a small town by Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s905">We had found out the Americans were looking for people to work in different areas, you know, especially the DPs and so on.</span> <span id="s906">So I got a job working for an American family.</span> <span id="s907">He was a captain in the American military and he had just brought his wife and children over.</span> <span id="s908">I was able to communicate and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: But you meanwhile moved in and out of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s911">I lived there for about a year and then he was sent someplace else and then I came back to the camp.</span> <span id="s912">And in ’48 -- the early part of ’48, I got married in camp and so we stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: Your husband was also in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: Yes, he was also from Estonia.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: But you had not known him before?</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s917">People were very much thrown all over the world by that time.</span> <span id="s918">I mean, all over Europe.</span> <span id="s919">They didn’t know what was what or who was where.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: It sounds like life in the camps was like a miniature city, where people worked…</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: Well, that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s922">There was hundreds of thousands of people after the war in those camps and the emigration opened up, I think, in ’48.</span> <span id="s923">I’m not positive.</span> <span id="s924">It could have been earlier.</span> <span id="s925">The International Refugee organization was taking care of all that.</span> <span id="s926">It was again a time that you stood still.</span> <span id="s927">I mean, you had no future, you had no nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: Did you have in your head that you had plans for yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: Oh, sure, you always had to have a plan.</span> <span id="s930">Because if we gave up dreaming and wishing and thinking -- hey, you might as well dig a hole then.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: What was your dream?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: I’ll be somewheres someday.</span> <span id="s933">And I’ll do something.</span> <span id="s934">I mean, you don’t plan --nobody’s plan will come through, exactly what you want or what you want to do.</span> <span id="s935">Again it comes down to survival.</span> <span id="s936">But I wasn’t going to stay there.</span> <span id="s937">‘Cause a lot of people, especially the older people, I think they stayed in Germany and some of them are still there now, I guess, if they’re still alive.</span> <span id="s938">They had no place to go and they were not able to work.</span> <span id="s939">You know what I mean, there was different types of people who left the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: But you said you were married in the camp in ’48…so you went through a courtship…</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: Well, that was more or less a normal life, I guess.</span> <span id="s942">You had food, you had clothes, which was all, of course, wherever it came from and what it was all about.</span> <span id="s943">Then certain people worked, like I did for awhile.</span> <span id="s944">Then we went into a immigration camp…</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: But wait, when people get married, as you did…by the way, tell us your husband’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: My husband’s name was Ernest.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: Ernest Voip.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: Um, hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: And were you given quarters for married people?</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: More or less, yeah.</span> <span id="s951">More or less.</span> <span id="s952">We were two families in a room, which was like separated, more or less, with a partition or something.</span> <span id="s953">It was very crowded conditions.</span> <span id="s954">There was when we were there, when I first came to the camp, we were put into a room.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">This again was one of those huge, huge German military places, two, three story buildings.</span> <span id="s956">Then the place was turned into a camp.</span> <span id="s957">Like I said, the Italians, the French, the Belgians -- whoever was there.</span> <span id="s958">Whoever’d been there during the Germans, they had been brought over there, working here and then.</span> <span id="s959">They had been in a camp.</span> <span id="s960">But they were taken, let go to their homes.</span> <span id="s961">And then we, people like us, we moved in.</span> <span id="s962">And there was some Estonians, Latvians, Lithuanians, the Poles.</span> <span id="s963">I mean many, many nationalities that did not go back where the Russian occupation was.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: You said you were there until 1951?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: We were there until 1949.</span> <span id="s966">Then we went to Ludwigsburg, to the immigration camp and we were there almost two years.</span> <span id="s967">You had to file for immigration.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: To the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: Well, I filed to Canada before I got married.</span> <span id="s970">It opened up late in ’47, I’m sure it did.</span> <span id="s971">‘Cause I know, when I got married -- we refilled for Canada.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: And how long after you filed did it take before you learned that…</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: Well, it took us about two years before we…we were there in ’49.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: And you came across in a ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: No, we were flown over here.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: From what port?</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: We came out of Munich.</span> <span id="s978">We took a train across to San Francisco.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: Wow!</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: And that wasn’t easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: Why San Francisco?</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: Because that’s where we were going.</span> <span id="s983">We had a…see, when we came over here, we had to have -- everybody that comes through immigration has to have, you either have a sponsor or you have a job.</span> <span id="s984">And we stated that we were like all the rest of the people that were coming in here.</span> <span id="s985">And so this is where our destination was.</span> <span id="s986">And we came to a chicken ranch.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: Near San Francisco?</span> <span id="s988">Who was the person who sponsored you?</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: Well, actually -- see, when we filed for the United States, after Canada failed because my husband had been hurt in the war, he had lost the sight of one eye and a few other things.</span> <span id="s990">And Canada was very strict at first.</span> <span id="s991">They loosened it a little bit later.</span> <span id="s992">But at that time, so we filed for the United States.</span> <span id="s993">We were supposed to come to Mississippi to work on a farm there.</span> <span id="s994">That was our first sponsor.</span> <span id="s995">No way, this girl’s not going to Mississippi.</span> <span id="s996">We fought that for about a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: Who sponsored you?</span> <span id="s998">These were not relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: Oh, God, no.</span> <span id="s1000">They were just people who went into those places where they could get to come and work for them.</span> <span id="s1001">They were sort of -- hey, these people are coming here.</span> <span id="s1002">They’re down, you know, they can work for us forever and ever.</span> <span id="s1003">Well, not me.</span> <span id="s1004">I’m not that kind of person.</span> <span id="s1005">And we had quite a hassle about that for -- it took us maybe more than six months to fight that one.</span> <span id="s1006">And they kept on asking why I didn’t want to go to Mississippi.</span> <span id="s1007">And I was very familiar with the United States in the second grade already.</span> <span id="s1008">And I said “No” because I just don’t like the climate and I’m not going to work.</span> <span id="s1009">And, first of all, I didn’t want an individual sponsor.</span> <span id="s1010">I wanted a group sponsor.</span> <span id="s1011">Like a church, or something.</span> <span id="s1012">We got that finally.</span> <span id="s1013">When we arrived in San Francisco, we had a choice and the first guy that came along, he had a chicken ranch.</span> <span id="s1014">And it sounded good.</span> <span id="s1015">So we went.</span> <span id="s1016">‘Cause I wanted to pick it when I get here.</span> <span id="s1017">Not being afraid of work, but another thing that was done to a lot of these people, I know the same chicken farm, he sponsored a family from Germany.</span> <span id="s1018">He was from somewheres in Europe, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1019">Originally his parents or something.</span> <span id="s1020">He sponsored a family from Germany.</span> <span id="s1021">We stayed there a little over a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: What was your other choice, by the way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: I think there was mostly farm labor, because my husband wasn’t skilled worker or anything.</span> <span id="s1024">So it was mostly farm labor.</span> <span id="s1025">And they sponsored a family from Germany.</span> <span id="s1026">And, my God, they got those people into debt and they have to stay forever, three or four years.</span> <span id="s1027">They couldn’t do anything else, because they had to pay and stay and work and pay back what they owe.</span> <span id="s1028">They tried the same thing with us.</span> <span id="s1029">You know, you give ‘em a little old empty house and he says, “Come on, we’ll go to town and I’ll buy you all this and I’ll buy you that.”</span> <span id="s1030">So, of course, you know, you have to pay it back.</span> <span id="s1031">I said, “No, we don’t need it.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: So where did you go when you left there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: We moved and rented our own house.</span> <span id="s1034">Rented a house and my husband worked for a chicken ranch.</span> <span id="s1035">This was in Petaluma, California.</span> <span id="s1036">It was (words missing in original transcript) of the world at that time, in the early ‘50s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: Did you have children at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: I had two children when I came over here.</span> <span id="s1039">And that was one reason we flew over.</span> <span id="s1040">Because my number two son was less than six months old.</span> <span id="s1041">And we didn’t know if we’d make it across either.</span> <span id="s1042">When we left London Heathrow Airport, we were coming over on one of those little, I don’t know, really, really bad planes.</span> <span id="s1043">It wasn’t pressured very well and everything.</span> <span id="s1044">I think we (words missing in original transcript) ourselves while we were still on the airplane.</span> <span id="s1045">And we did make it finally and one of the motors went out coming in over close to Newfoundland.</span> <span id="s1046">We had to make an emergency landing and everybody was worried.</span> <span id="s1047">And I kept saying, “We’ll make it.</span> <span id="s1048">No problem.”</span> <span id="s1049">My husband always used to say, “You and your gypsy predictions.’</span> <span id="s1050">I’d say, “Yeah, but we made it, didn’t we?”</span> <span id="s1051">‘Cause my heritage goes back to the gypsies.</span> <span id="s1052">Good thing the Germans didn’t know I was a gypsy.</span> <span id="s1053">I was five generations away from it.</span> <span id="s1054">That’s quite a ways away, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: So from Petaluma, California, you somehow made it to Florida.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: Oh, I’ve lived in San Jose, I’ve lived in Arkansas, I lived in Washington State.</span> <span id="s1057">I’m ready to move again.</span> <span id="s1058">I’m on the move continually.</span> <span id="s1059">The world isn’t big enough to stop me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1061">Well I really appreciate all the information you’ve shared with us and before we close this interview, is there anything I haven’t asked you, that you would like to add or anything that you thought of which we talked about earlier that you’d like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: Well, there is, but there is really a lot to be talked about and said, in my way of thinking.</span> <span id="s1063">There hasn’t been enough said about -- I mean there’s been enough said about it, but the saying has been on deaf ears most of the time.</span> <span id="s1064">I think what you’re doing now, if it is for schools, and I think that should be started as soon as the children are able to understand right from wrong and truth from lies and so on.</span> <span id="s1065">And I think that should be taught from then on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: So, as you’ve said before, so it will never happen again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: So it will never happen again and like, I said earlier, when people read history, they only read things and dates and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s1068">History has a deeper meaning, It is not to read and I know which days and what happened.</span> <span id="s1069">Why did it happen?</span> <span id="s1070">It’s the same thing, like a parent says, I’ve always had a way of -- I remember when I was raising my children, and I had neighbors and friends that had small children and the mother would say the child will do something.</span> <span id="s1071">The child is maybe three, four, five years old.</span> <span id="s1072">And the kid will do something.</span> <span id="s1073">And the mother says, “Don’t do it,” And the child will say, “Well, how come?</span> <span id="s1074">Why not?”</span> <span id="s1075">The mother says, “Cause I said so.”</span> <span id="s1076">And I think that is so stupid.</span> <span id="s1077">It’s got a strong footing, it’s stupid, but it’s true.</span> <span id="s1078">You explain to them.</span> <span id="s1079">And the same thing goes for everybody.</span> <span id="s1080">When you say something and if that saying is not an explanation, then will you please put an explanation with it.</span> <span id="s1081">Verify it.</span> <span id="s1082">Why?</span> <span id="s1083">How come?</span> <span id="s1084">What for?</span> <span id="s1085">All these things.</span> <span id="s1086">And I think that is very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: Teaching people to think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: Teaching people.</span> <span id="s1089">This is what all this experience is about, is to learn from.</span> <span id="s1090">I think I’m a heck of a lot better human being .</span> <span id="s1091">I’m not saying that I was ever a rotten kid or a rotten human being to start with.</span> <span id="s1092">But I think I’m a heck of a lot better human being and I have a better understanding of human nature and what can happen.</span> <span id="s1093">And I can sort out the bad people and the good people at my first meeting.</span> <span id="s1094">All you have to do is listen to that person and talk to them and you can decide.</span> <span id="s1095">And this is something that is not taught and this has to be taught.</span> <span id="s1096">Thank God my father taught me all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: Your father did, indeed, give you a heritage of strength.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: Of course he did.</span> <span id="s1099">He was a knowledgeable man.</span> <span id="s1100">He was a strong man and I consider myself a strong person, because people tell me, “How can you be so strong?”</span> <span id="s1101">I say, “Hey, I’m healthy, I have a mind and I have two strong legs to stand on.”</span> <span id="s1102">So what do I need?</span> <span id="s1103">I don’t need alcohol, I don’t need drugs.</span> <span id="s1104">To top it off, I don’t even need
