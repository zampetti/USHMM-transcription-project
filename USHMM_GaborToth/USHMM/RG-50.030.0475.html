name is Paulette Moudzoukos Nehama.</span> <span id="s17">I was born in Volos, Greece, on September 12, 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: Let’s talk first about your family.</span> <span id="s19">So, tell me first about your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: My parents was -- my father was Anselmos Moudzoukos, and he was born in Volos.</span> <span id="s21">And my mother was Thalia, Levi was her maiden name, Moudzoukos, and she was also born in Volos.</span> <span id="s22">My parents were first cousins, which makes the whole family thing very interesting.</span> <span id="s23">They got married in 1921, and they had two children, my sister, who was born in 1923, and myself 10 years later, who was born in 1933, as I said.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: How unusual would it be for cousins to marry first cousins?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: I haven’t heard of anybody else, but it’s certainly something permitted in the Jewish religion.</span> <span id="s26">This was the first time I heard of first cousins getting married.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: And did your parents come from some other region, or had they -- did they come from families settled in Volos?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: Well, their -- their parents were from Halkeela, which is in Emvia.</span> <span id="s29">When exactly did they come to Volos, I’m not sure, but they -- all their children were born in Volos.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: And were they Sephardic Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: No, they were Romaniot, which means they were Jews from very, very old time, who settled in Greece.</span> <span id="s32">They didn’t come from Spain.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: And tell me about what you know of their -- they -- they obviously knew each other all their lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: But what you know of their -- of their marriage, how old were they, how they settled.</span> <span id="s36">I mean, where they first lived, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: They got married when -- when mother was 22, and my father was 23.</span> <span id="s38">They settled in Volos, so that’s where they lived all their lives.</span> <span id="s39">They had a small house.</span> <span id="s40">They were very close to the family, and those there is still in Greece.</span> <span id="s41">Families have houses very close to each other, sometimes a three level home, and each family has one level.</span> <span id="s42">So they -- they lived there.</span> <span id="s43">My grandparents had built a factory, and this was a textile factory.</span> <span id="s44">It was finished in 1906, and about 1920, I think the factory, the grandparents retired, and my father and his brother took over the factory in Volos, which was called Leviathan Moudzoukos, and company.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Now, were there other similar companies in Volos?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: There were three other factories in Volos.</span> <span id="s47">One was also a textile factory, and one was a hardware thing.</span> <span id="s48">My father’s factory was by -- there was the largest.</span> <span id="s49">It had -- it produced material, they called it cashmere, which was material for men’s suits, and women’s clothes -- means women’s suits.</span> <span id="s50">And they imported the yarn from England.</span> <span id="s51">And it was nationally known, and internationally known.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Now that could not have happened were it not for Volos being a port.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: That is true, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Now I had assumed that it would be a factory, I knew it was a textile factory, assuming that it was using yarns from the plain of Thessaly, but really relied on imported good.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Did the other factory -- textile factory use imported basic materials?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: And was there competition between the two?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Yes, but I think my father’s factory was much, much higher both in production, and in exports.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: How many people would be employed in the factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Between 900 and 1200.</span> <span id="s62">And they were running three shifts, the factory never stopped.</span> <span id="s63">And the legend has it that there is a big chimney, which is every morning at five o’clock he would go off to wake up the workers, to come to work.</span> <span id="s64">This was nice alarm clock.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Oh, a --</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: So the whole wallas knew, and it’s said that the chim -- the Moudzoukos chimney i-is ringing, must be five o’clock.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s68">So it would be a -- a chime from a tower?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: No, it was like a big, huge -- like a chimney -- huge, and it will go on, like woo, woo, woo.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Well, does that mean that your name would be -- your family name, Moudzoukos would be widely known in that region, or in Greece generally?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: In that region, definitely, and in Greece.</span> <span id="s72">Not all over Greece, but it’s well known.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: What about the tailors that would make up the -- I mean, we-were you manufacturing the fab -- the cashmere, but also tailoring it?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: No.</span> <span id="s75">No, the tailoring was done elsewhere.</span> <span id="s76">People will buy yards of material, and will have other seamstress, or a tailor, who would make suits.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: And does the company continue?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: No.</span> <span id="s79">Unfortunately, there’ve been many mishaps after the war.</span> <span id="s80">First of all production stopped because we couldn’t get the material from England.</span> <span id="s81">There were no -- there was no way to do that.</span> <span id="s82">Then we had to go into hiding, and the factory closed because also the Germans took over.</span> <span id="s83">And they destroyed some of the machinery, and some of it became barracks for the troops.</span> <span id="s84">So there was no way the factory could operate.</span> <span id="s85">After the war it was in very bad shape, and there was no money to start it over, but somehow the bank gave us a loan, and we started, but with half or a quarter of the people, and the production was very limited.</span> <span id="s86">So it was kind of limping for a war -- a while.</span> <span id="s87">Then, for several years it was a real, real struggle to -- to make it go.</span> <span id="s88">Material was difficult to get, and general the economic conditions were too bad.</span> <span id="s89">So finally the bank repossessed it, and that was the end of that factory.</span> <span id="s90">It became a warehouse for grain for the whole region, and now they have made it into technical schools.</span> <span id="s91">There’s a gimna -- gimnasium, which is like a high school, and also technical schools for the rich.</span> <span id="s92">But the interesting thing is, they kept the façade, which was in -- it was, I mean architecturally it was a very -- it was the thing of the time.</span> <span id="s93">The roof was kind of slanted, and that they kept, but they also kept the name, and they call it Moudzoukos Technical Schools.</span> <span id="s94">There’s also a bus stop called Moudzoukos stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Let’s go back to the beginning, we jumped -- we jumped ahead to follow the history of the company, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: -- let’s go back to your parents time of their marriage, and then your sister’s birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Okay, my father was working with his father in the factory.</span> <span id="s99">My mother was a homemaker, and a socialite.</span> <span id="s100">Her role was to have teas for the ladies, she did a tremendous amount of volunteer work in Volos.</span> <span id="s101">She worked in the orphanage, and another kind of -- of -- what call this, and I always remember that she had teas in the house, and all these ladies will come, and there were beautiful things like cakes and cookies, and that we have to dress up, and come and say hello to the ladies, and curtsy, which I didn’t like.</span> <span id="s102">And so she was a busy lady.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Y-You mentioned -- you sa -- you said socialite, but in fact she was involved in lots of good works.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: So there was --</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: Yes, it was a social life that she had, very social.</span> <span id="s107">And that was expected more or less of the women of her stature, because we were quite wealthy.</span> <span id="s108">We had a maid, and a cook, and we had sa -- I had a nanny, and later a governess.</span> <span id="s109">So -- but my mother always supervised them, everything was absolutely perfect.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Would she be -- when -- when you were a child, would she be fairly constantly in the home, or part of your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: She was there most of the time, yes.</span> <span id="s112">When I would come home, I would go with my nanny to the park, or swim in the summertime, but she was home at lunchtime.</span> <span id="s113">And when I would to go bed, she would be there.</span> <span id="s114">My parents took trips to Austria.</span> <span id="s115">They often traveled to Switzerland and Austria.</span> <span id="s116">So there were extended periods of time that they were not there.</span> <span id="s117">But my grandmother was there, and of course, the household staff, and my sister, who was older, and I was relying on her.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Well, both sets of grandparents would be close by, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Well, I never met my father’s mother, she died before I was born, but my mother’s mother lived with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: So it really was a home with a great deal of stability and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Oh yeah, there was plenty of stability, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Now, what do you remember of your early childhood, and of your relationship with your older sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Well, my older sister was like a mother to me, because she always took the role of discipline me.</span> <span id="s124">And I always wanted to be where she was.</span> <span id="s125">If she had friends over, I wanted to be in that group.</span> <span id="s126">And she didn’t want me to be there.</span> <span id="s127">Her friends were marvelous, they would ask me to come and stay, and talk to them, but she didn’t want me in there.</span> <span id="s128">She -- she was caring, very caring for me.</span> <span id="s129">But she was an older person to me at the time.</span> <span id="s130">You know, she was 21, I was 10, so that makes a big difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: What -- who were the people that you were named after, you and your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: My Hebrew name is Esther, which is my maternal grandmother’s name.</span> <span id="s133">My maternal’s -- yeah, grandmother’s name.</span> <span id="s134">The name Paulette, I think, comes from Paulette Goddard, my mother loved her.</span> <span id="s135">She is the actress, and she just adored that woman.</span> <span id="s136">So I think that’s why she named me Paulette.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: And would you be known by Paulette all your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: I was -- my name was Pauletta in Greek.</span> <span id="s139">Sometimes they would call me Paulettiki, which means little Paulette, and sometimes they still do, when I go to Greece.</span> <span id="s140">They call me Paulettiki.</span> <span id="s141">But mostly Paulette.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: And your sister’s full name, and where that would come from.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: My sister’s name is Yolanda, and we call her Yola.</span> <span id="s144">Her Hebrew name -- I mean, she is named after my paternal grandmother, her name was Santhi.</span> <span id="s145">Well, the English translation will be blondie, which is kind of funny.</span> <span id="s146">But -- but she was called Yola.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: And naming you after grandparents, was that a -- a tradition --</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: -- among Romaniots?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Right, it’s a tradition.</span> <span id="s151">And you name children even when the grandparents are not dead.</span> <span id="s152">In the Ashkenazis you don’t do that.</span> <span id="s153">In the Sephardic and Romaniots tradition, you can name children after living grandparents, or living uncles or aunts, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Now tell me of what you remember of the -- of your earliest childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Well, I remember it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s156">I -- I loved the house we lived, we had a beautiful house, and a wonderful garden that smelled wonderful because we had such nice trees, like lemon trees and orange trees and beautiful roses.</span> <span id="s157">So it was always very pleasant to be outside, and be there.</span> <span id="s158">I had friends, lots of other children.</span> <span id="s159">My governess, who spoke French, and I had to speak French with her, would take me to the park, and there would be other children there, and we would play all sorts of things.</span> <span id="s160">In the summer I would go swimming every day.</span> <span id="s161">We would take little train from Volos, which would go up to the mountain of Pilion, but it would stop at the beach called Anaboros, and we would get off.</span> <span id="s162">There were -- the wagons were regular wagons [indecipherable] there were two of them that were opened, so it was like a coach, and that’s where I sat.</span> <span id="s163">And I loved it, because I could se -- see, and I could see everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: And would you be swimming in the sea?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Oh yes, yes, it was gorgeous.</span> <span id="s166">I never wanted to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: And you mentioned your governess speaking French with you, but what languages -- what would be your mother tongue, and what languages did you -- do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Greek was what we spoke at home, but also we spoke French, because my mother has been educated in Switzerland, in Lausanne, and she wanted us to learn French.</span> <span id="s169">So we spoke French at home with my mother, and with the governess.</span> <span id="s170">So at the age of five I was very fluent in French.</span> <span id="s171">These were the only two languages I spoke.</span> <span id="s172">Of course, now I know English.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Would your mother’s education in Lausanne be the reason that your parents would go to Switzerland and Austria on vacations and on trips?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: I think there was business going there, one of the reasons they went.</span> <span id="s175">They had business with I’m -- I’m not sure with whom, but there wa -- they were business trips combined with -- with pleasure.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: What do you remember of your family’s religious practices?</span> <span id="s177">Did you go regularly to the synagogue, was it -- did you keep kosher in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: No, we did not keep kosher.</span> <span id="s179">I don’t think we ate pork, but otherwise we ate everything.</span> <span id="s180">I went to the synagogue with my mother on special occasions to take oil to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s181">This was a practice that is a good deed.</span> <span id="s182">You would take oil to the synagogue for the lamps, because there were no candles.</span> <span id="s183">And I would go with my mother.</span> <span id="s184">But I did not go to services.</span> <span id="s185">My father would go.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Wo -- would your mother go also?</span> <span id="s187">Was it just the children who would not go, or would -- would it be only your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: My mother would go to the high holidays with my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: And then would you have special observances of the holidays in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: I remember Passover.</span> <span id="s191">But we also celebrated Greek Easter, as well.</span> <span id="s192">We were always invited to someplace where they were roasting a ham, which is a very traditional kind of thing for Greek Easter.</span> <span id="s193">So we were very much part of the whole community.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Do you remember in these -- I know that you were really a very young child then, but what are your earliest memories of whether you felt you were primarily Greek, or Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: I think I felt Greek all along.</span> <span id="s196">I started feeling Jewish when I joined the Brownies, and ma -- I must have been like six years old, probably, or maybe younger.</span> <span id="s197">And the meetings were on Saturday, and I remember my grandmother said, “That’s bad.</span> <span id="s198">You don’t go to meetings on Saturdays, because you are Jewish.”</span> <span id="s199">But I insisted, and my mother didn’t think it was terrible, so I did go.</span> <span id="s200">But when we were asked to bring a needle and a thread, because we had to learn how to sew a button, and I actually had forgotten to bring it, and the -- the leader said to me, “Where is your thread and button?”</span> <span id="s201">I said, “Well, I don’t sew on Saturdays.”</span> <span id="s202">So I claimed my Jewishness, and of course, she couldn’t say anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s204">Would there be other Brownies who were also Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: No, I was the only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: And do you remember whether your early childhood friends would be -- would be Jewish friends, or would there be a real mixture?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Actually, they -- I don’t remember any other Jewish friend.</span> <span id="s208">No, maybe one, I remember one.</span> <span id="s209">It was mostly Greek Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: So your life was thoroughly integrated into the society?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: Absolutely, yes.</span> <span id="s212">My father was also president of the Jewish community, so -- I mean, we did have very strong Jewish component in the family, we just not very religious, let’s put it this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: And the employees in the Moudzoukos family, they would cover the local spectrum, they wouldn’t be more Jews employed than -- than the Greek Orthodox?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: No, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s215">Yeah.</span> <span id="s216">A lot of them were immigrants from Asia man -- minor.</span> <span id="s217">They had emigrated in Volos, in fact my father was instrumental in building homes for them.</span> <span id="s218">And he employed a lot of these people in the factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: What countries would they have come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: Asia minor, Turkey.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Turkey?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: And they would have moved west for economic reasons?</span> <span id="s224">For je -- to improve their -- their lives?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Well, yeah, I’m sure they moved west, but also I think their -- their lives were threatened, so that’s why they left.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s227">I -- I -- I was just wanting you to fill me in on what was happening historically that would have meant they moved to Greece.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: Well, I think Yamala the Turk came, and of course, a lot of people had to -- to leave the area.</span> <span id="s229">Although he did make many changes in the region, but one of the changes was that he has -- foreigners had to -- to leave.</span> <span id="s230">And there was a massacre also, at the time.</span> <span id="s231">So people hoo -- ran for their lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: Your home life really would have been, I’m guessing, very comfortable, if not lavish in these -- in the years of your early childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: That is right.</span> <span id="s234">It was very comfortable, it was very steady and predictable.</span> <span id="s235">And it was lavish.</span> <span id="s236">My parents would give big parties, there was -- there were always a lot of people around.</span> <span id="s237">They were very well known, and it was like, you know, a constant stream of people coming through our house, or going places.</span> <span id="s238">I was a child, and of course, children were not to mingle with adults, so I didn’t participate in all these kind of things, but I remember the excitement.</span> <span id="s239">What I remember was that my parents bought a summer home in -- in Calanilla, which is part of the Pilion mountain, but it’s down by the sea.</span> <span id="s240">And we would go there for weekends, and I remember that we packed the food in big baskets, and then went -- we would get on the train, and then the -- the man who was taking care of the estate would come on his buggy and horse, and pick us up from the train station, and take us back to the -- we used to call it villa, to the villa.</span> <span id="s241">And that was one of my favorite times.</span> <span id="s242">I just loved it there.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: And you -- you’d go there through the summer months, an -- and for how long?</span> <span id="s244">You’d stay on a Saturday night?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s246">In -- in the summer we stayed for a month, or two, or maybe more.</span> <span id="s247">Maybe we went in the winter, I don’t remember, but it was short period of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Now, you mentioned that you would not go to the synagogue except to take oil.</span> <span id="s251">Would your sister, who was older than you have had a Bat Mitzvah, or any kind of formal training in her Jewish faith?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: No.</span> <span id="s253">First of all, girls were not Bat Mitzvahed until much, much, much later in Greece, so this was unheard of.</span> <span id="s254">So there was no particular training, there was no Sunday school as we call it, or Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s255">The training was at home, basically.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: And what would that training be, and who would it come from?</span> <span id="s257">You mentioned your -- your grandmother before, complaining of you going to Brownies on Saturday.</span> <span id="s258">But would she be the -- the person who would sort of teach you what you knew about the Jewish faith?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Well, it was -- I think a combination of things with my grandmother, it was my parents.</span> <span id="s260">But I remember my grandmother was quite s -- had very strong opinions about things, and she would always say that you know, this is not Jewish, this is not the Jewish way.</span> <span id="s261">But she had no formal education either.</span> <span id="s262">Actually, she went up to fourth or fifth grade, and -- but she had a very strong feeling of who she was.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: But that would be normal at the time, I suppose, even for privileged women, not to have a great deal of education, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: Yeah, that’s true, but she was also a sickly child, so -- in her younger years.</span> <span id="s265">She -- I guess if you were sick you didn’t go to school, it was as simple as that.</span> <span id="s266">So that was it.</span> <span id="s267">Her mother died when she was very young, she was like three or four, and she was raised by her brothers, and her sister, who was my other grandmother, and a bit spoiled.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: She might have been a great reader, and have educated herself, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: Ah -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Paulette Nehama.</span> <span id="s271">This is tape number one, side B. We’ll continue talking about your grandmother.</span> <span id="s272">I assume that you had a very close and loving relationship with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: She used to say I was her favorite grandchild, of course she had three.</span> <span id="s274">But I wasn’t very happy with her, because she always mingled a lot in my life.</span> <span id="s275">And I slept in the same room she did, we had one room, and we shared it, and of course I wanted to have all my toys out, and every night I had to put them back.</span> <span id="s276">And this will interfere with the story I had in my mind.</span> <span id="s277">I would take my dolls and everything else, and set them outside -- and there was a story [indecipherable] I had imagined.</span> <span id="s278">And she would make me put them back, and I didn’t like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Now ya -- and your sister did not have to share a room.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: No.</span> <span id="s281">She had all the privileges of the firstborn.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: I’m wondering if any -- if you have any special -- you must -- memories of these early years.</span> <span id="s283">You mentioned it as a very happy time, but are there particular things that evoke wonderful memories, and I’m thinking of foods, or smells, people, pieces of music.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s285">Food was a very important part of our lives, and there was -- there were season things, I remember.</span> <span id="s286">You could not go to the grocery store and buy tomatoes in the wintertime.</span> <span id="s287">First of all, you -- you had to go to the grocery store, or to the produce store and buy things, so there were several stops to buy all these things.</span> <span id="s288">What I remember, we had women who worked in that household from the mountain of Pilion.</span> <span id="s289">And their parents will come to visit, and they would bring these wonderful baskets of cherries, or fresh strawberries, or figs.</span> <span id="s290">And they smelled so good, they were just wonderful, and I always loved it when they came to visit with their daughters, and they would bring all these fresh fruit.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Can you get the same quality of fruit from the same mountains today?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: Oh, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s293">Probably yes, but I don’t know, I haven’t been there for a long time, so I can’t -- but I also remember the -- the way they came, they came in little white baskets, or bamboo baskets.</span> <span id="s294">And they were covered with fig leaves, so the fruit will stay moist.</span> <span id="s295">And it was very, very attractive to look at this.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: And you’d have special foods for high holidays, but I suppose there’d be other Greek holidays you’d also celebrate.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Yeah, I think -- I don’t remember particularly celebrating Christmas, but it was like a gathering, like a family gathering, all people will come, and we’ll have a nice meal.</span> <span id="s298">I don’t know whether we had turkey, I don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s299">New Year’s Eve, or New Year’s Day was always special.</span> <span id="s300">It still is in Greece.</span> <span id="s301">You exchange presents on New Year’s Day, so that was fun.</span> <span id="s302">Easter was one thing.</span> <span id="s303">Tha -- that was basically -- yeah, there were special foods.</span> <span id="s304">There was always some wonderful kind of desserts, and other things that my mother -- my mother was an excellent cook.</span> <span id="s305">I mean, she was terrific, and I loved everything she ate -- everything she made, I mean.</span> <span id="s306">What I remember also, there was a hierarchy, you know, in my house, so when we sat around the table, the food was passed by the maids, first to my grandmother, then to my mother, then to my father, then to my sister, and I was always the last one to be served.</span> <span id="s307">So I remember I always liked chicken livers, so -- you know, there was -- the chicken liver was gone, or -- by then.</span> <span id="s308">Or I wanted something -- I always wanted something that I didn’t have, because I was the youngest.</span> <span id="s309">I ate more slowly, so sometimes, you know, the table would be cleared, and I would still be eating.</span> <span id="s310">Things like that.</span> <span id="s311">So I had a very s -- a very good sense that I was the youngest, and I had to compete with everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Would there have been, though, responsibilities that fell on your older sister, that you were perhaps freed from?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Well, she -- she was, I guess, older, and they were expecting more from her, you know.</span> <span id="s314">They didn’t expect much from me, other than to be a very polite, very well-behaved child.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s316">Now, what about school?</span> <span id="s317">How old would be -- you be when you started attending any kind of school?</span> <span id="s318">A: I was six years old, and I went straight to first grade.</span> <span id="s319">There were no pre-schools those days.</span> <span id="s320">And loo -- when I went to first grade, a month later the Italian war broke out.</span> <span id="s321">And school was dismissed for awhile.</span> <span id="s322">The male teachers were all gone to war, and from then on it’s a whole different story, because we had to leave Volos.</span> <span id="s323">Our house was taken by the navy, because it was just facing the sea, just about a block from the sea, and it was a good observation point.</span> <span id="s324">So we had to leave, pack our things within 24 hours, we had just finished arranging the whole -- whole household, we had just moved to this apartment.</span> <span id="s325">And I still remember the wax, and the clean and shiny place.</span> <span id="s326">And we had to leave, and put our things in storage, because the Italians were coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: And how -- how old exactly were you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: I was six years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: Do you have memories of your parents attitudes or moods at the time?</span> <span id="s330">Did you -- I mean, they would probably shield you from some concerns, but do you have any memories that suggest the wonderfully happy times were over?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: Yes, they did shield me, they were very protective of me.</span> <span id="s332">I was very anxious about this war.</span> <span id="s333">I remember when I went in school the day the war -- we heard the -- about the war, all the children -- the older children anyway, were telling us that people get killed in the war, that men leave their homes, and go to battle, they get injured.</span> <span id="s334">And I was very worried about my father.</span> <span id="s335">So when the principal told us that there would be no school that day, and they didn’t know if there was going to be school the next day, I ran home crying, asking my mother if my father was going to be the -- in the war, if he was going to be in the army.</span> <span id="s336">Well, my father was 40 -- 42 I think then.</span> <span id="s337">So my mother calmed me down and reassures me that this wasn’t going to happen, and that I didn’t have anything to worry about, we’ll all be together, we’ll be fine.</span> <span id="s338">There may be a war, but we’ll be safe.</span> <span id="s339">And that was something that I remember very vividly.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: And what -- what month and year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: That was in October of ’40, 1940.</span> <span id="s342">School had started September, 1940, so it was almost a month later.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: And what happened in the next years?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: The next years -- I remember we -- we stayed -- we moved to Agria, which is a suburb, or it’s one little village by the sea, not far from Volos.</span> <span id="s345">It’s one of the first villages of the Pilion mountain, but it’s down very low, by the sea.</span> <span id="s346">We moved there.</span> <span id="s347">It was also my grandmother, my aunt, who had come from Salonika with her sons, and her husband.</span> <span id="s348">So, it was all of us.</span> <span id="s349">Now that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: Now, this would be your --</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: My --</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: -- oh, the aunt?</span> <span id="s353">A: My sisters -- my mother’s sister.</span> <span id="s354">Her son Raymond was 11 months older than me, so he was a good companion, great.</span> <span id="s355">I made him played with dolls.</span> <span id="s356">He -- he was very accommodating.</span> <span id="s357">He was a great guy.</span> <span id="s358">So anyway, so we moved to Agria, we rented a place, and we stayed there for, I don’t know, the whole summer.</span> <span id="s359">Then we returned to Volos, but shortly after, they started bombarding Volos, being a port, this was a prime target.</span> <span id="s360">And I remember the bombs falling, and having to run into the shelter.</span> <span id="s361">I was quite scared at time.</span> <span id="s362">Then we would come out of the shelter, and we will see all sorts of disasters.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: Who was doing the bombing, and tell me then about the s -- the shelters.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: Okay, the -- the bombing was by the British.</span> <span id="s365">The shelter was at the basement of the building, and I have a feeling if the building collapsed, you know, we wouldn’t be that safe there, but everybody thought they were.</span> <span id="s366">So everybody who lived in that apartment building would go there, and also people from the outside, if they happened to hear the siren, that people had to go hiding, and they would come, although they didn’t live there.</span> <span id="s367">And would stay as long as -- as long as we heard the siren again, which meant that the danger is over, and out you go.</span> <span id="s368">Inspect the damage.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s370">So y-you would go and take food and bedding with you?</span> <span id="s371">What do you remember, or would you go there so fast that you would simply head there with your family as fast as you could?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: I don’t remember taking nothing.</span> <span id="s373">Maybe a blanket, possibly.</span> <span id="s374">You had to run fast, there was nothing to take, because these things don’t last a tremendous amount of time, as far as I remember.</span> <span id="s375">I think maybe an hour, maybe two.</span> <span id="s376">So that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Let me go back to the -- to place what was happening in the context of the second World War.</span> <span id="s378">Why would the British have been bombing the port of Volos, the third largest port?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: Well, I think it was -- it was a protection from -- from -- na --</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: So at this time your life was beginning to change.</span> <span id="s381">And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Well then, it was a worry.</span> <span id="s383">There were curfews.</span> <span id="s384">There were precautions taken, you could not have lights at night.</span> <span id="s385">We had to put panels with black -- dark paper -- with black paper at the windows so no light would fall through.</span> <span id="s386">You couldn’t go out past six o’clock or seven o’clock.</span> <span id="s387">So things started changing, people were more anxious.</span> <span id="s388">When the Italians came, I was fully aware that they were the enemy, and although they were not particularly terrible to Jews, they were still an occupying force, and I was very patriotic, those days.</span> <span id="s389">But I also remem -- remember, that was in ’41, when there was a famine, and I remember it very clear.</span> <span id="s390">We did not particularly suffer from lack of food, although we didn’t have the kind of food we used to have before the war.</span> <span id="s391">But when we got food, my mother will hide it, because Italians wi -- would raid the house and look for food.</span> <span id="s392">And she would hide things in -- I remember in a great, big pot of gardenias.</span> <span id="s393">She would put potatoes, or something, I forget in a pot, or sacks of flour in a big pot, and then put soil, and gardenias on top.</span> <span id="s394">Or other things.</span> <span id="s395">But I remember they would come and lift the mattresses, and look under -- under the mattress to see if there was anything hiding in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: And they’d be assuming that you were a well to do family, and might be the very place to have food.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s398">People were really hungry those days.</span> <span id="s399">I would see people fall in the streets from hunger.</span> <span id="s400">Children.</span> <span id="s401">I sti -- I still remember children looking anorectic, you know, this pale, yellow, a green color almost.</span> <span id="s402">And just walking and collapsing.</span> <span id="s403">It was terrible, absolutely terrible.</span> <span id="s404">As I said, I don’t think we -- we were hungry, that -- as to not having food, but we certainly didn’t have meat.</span> <span id="s405">We didn’t have eggs, which was a constant supply in the household.</span> <span id="s406">We had a lot of beans and chick peas, vegetables, whatever vegetables we can get.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Would you still be sitting down rather formally, with the maid serving all of you according to your hierarchy, even with simpler foods?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: So the -- the staff with your family would in fact be fortunate -- perhaps more fortunate than their families in the -- in the mountains, in perhaps having more food.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: Well, I think the people in the mountain didn’t suffer that much because the earth produced, and many of them had also animals they could slaughter.</span> <span id="s411">They had chickens, lamb, whatever.</span> <span id="s412">But it was the people in the city that couldn’t find food.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: And the cause of this famine in Greece, was that because ships could not get through to the port?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: I think it was mostly because the Italians were taking all the food, but I’m sure that also, you know, supplies couldn’t come, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: So suffering was really quite considerable?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: It was considerable, not only in Volos, but also in Athens and other parts of Greece, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: Now are there any other things you remember during that period of Italian occupation that be -- the famine, but were the Italians taking any measures against the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: No, the Italians did not take any measures against the je -- Jews.</span> <span id="s419">First of all, in 1940 through ’43, it was just the Italians.</span> <span id="s420">It was in ’43 that Italy capitulated, and then the Germans took over.</span> <span id="s421">No, there was absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s422">I remember there was a big, sort of a club that my father used to go there, and my mother, and occasionally sh -- I would go, which wasn’t far from my house, called Exorise thekey, they had the restaurant there, there was a movie theater.</span> <span id="s423">And the Italians have taken this, and I guess they lived there, but there were also Italians outside guarding the place, and every time I would pass by, the Italian will say to me, bambina, bambina, and would take candy to give me.</span> <span id="s424">Will reach in his pocket, and show me the candy, and I would just walk past him, you know, I just didn’t want to have anything to do with him.</span> <span id="s425">And so, you know, me -- I mean -- but I -- but I remember some things.</span> <span id="s426">I remember a man being beaten with a gun, with the back of the gun.</span> <span id="s427">I don’t know what he did, but I remember that an Italian was really beating him up.</span> <span id="s428">This was --</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: And that would have -- you -- that was something you observed in the street, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Yeah, it was in the street, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: And I’m assuming in your attitude, you’d have taken your cue from your parents, but the -- the Italians would be hated as the occupiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Yeah, of course, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: And then everything changed when the Germans occupied -- moved into Greece in 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: Right.</span> <span id="s435">Volos was under Italian re -- you see, Greece was occu -- was divided in three parts.</span> <span id="s436">It was the German sector, which was mostly Salonika, and in the north Athens, Volos, were under Italian occupation, and then Macedonia, and Face were under Bulgarian occupation.</span> <span id="s437">The Italians were by far the mildest occu -- you know, occupying force.</span> <span id="s438">But I -- we left Volos in 19 -- in the spring of 1943, before the Germans arrived, and we went to Athens.</span> <span id="s439">So I never saw Germans in Volos.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: And why did your family move to Athens?</span> <span id="s441">A: Well, I think because -- you see, in ’43, nothing much was happening yet, but there were rumors about Salonika.</span> <span id="s442">My father was a very well informed person, and saw that probably something was going to happen.</span> <span id="s443">So he wanted us to be safe.</span> <span id="s444">We could not hide in Volos, everybody knew us.</span> <span id="s445">Although people were wonderful to us, and very friendly, and very willing to put us up for as long as we needed to.</span> <span id="s446">We still were -- everybody knew us, so there was no way of -- of hiding.</span> <span id="s447">Of course, there were the mountains, the mountain Pilion that a lot of Jewish people from Volos went to.</span> <span id="s448">But that wasn’t safe either for us, because as I said, we were quite well known, so Pilion wasn’t that terribly far.</span> <span id="s449">That’s why we left and went to Athens, where we could be somewhat anonymous in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Do you remember your parents ever talking about the -- the Jews in Salonika, and I wondered what they knew, and I wondered what they shared.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Well, they didn’t share anything with me.</span> <span id="s452">I was quite young at the time.</span> <span id="s453">But I was told that we had to move almost like two or three days before to move, that we were going to Athens.</span> <span id="s454">And this was a place I always wanted to go.</span> <span id="s455">I always thought of Athens as the magnificent city.</span> <span id="s456">So -- but then when I realized that we were not coming back to Volos, it wasn’t just a trip, I started thinking differently, and getting a little anxious.</span> <span id="s457">Not much was explained to me, and as a result of that, my imagination was wild.</span> <span id="s458">I would think all sorts of things, and of course, I couldn’t discuss them, because it was like this is for the good of us, or this kind of thing.</span> <span id="s459">There kind of answers were -- actually didn’t give me much to go with.</span> <span id="s460">I think --</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Did that -- did that make it worse?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: For me it did, to a certain extent, because I could never get a straight answer of what was going on, and I knew a lot was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: And were you noticing -- do you have memories of noticing a changed mood?</span> <span id="s464">Fear on the part of your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s466">I can see the change of mood, I can see the worry.</span> <span id="s467">I mean, I could sense it, but I couldn’t discuss it, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: And you were -- you were 10 then?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: Right.</span> <span id="s470">When we left Volos on that sleek, little cargo boat, with forged papers, actually, to -- to go to Athens, I was 10.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: False papers.</span> <span id="s472">Now, who would have supplied them, and would you have had Greek Orthodox names, and so on?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: That’s true.</span> <span id="s474">We had different names, Greek Orthodox names.</span> <span id="s475">And my name was Paulik Sanny.</span> <span id="s476">And they used to call me Polly, and sometimes I would forget and somebody would call me Polly, I wouldn’t respond.</span> <span id="s477">I guess the -- the police would issue false identity card, because when we went -- we left Volos on this little, tiny boat full of sacks of flour and many rats, we -- the boat broke down, and we had to stop for a couple of nights in -- in the cape.</span> <span id="s478">There is -- you see, Volos is like a gulf.</span> <span id="s479">The very tip of the -- of the gulf is called Trikery, which is a lovely little place, but we had to stay there for about two or three nights until another boat will come and pick us up, and take us to Evian, and from there we went by car to Athens.</span> <span id="s480">So the whole trip took about 10 days, maybe a week, but I think it was more like 10 days, because boats were unreliable.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: And which members of the family would be on this boat with you, and did any of your household staff leave with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: Yes, my parents, and my sister, and I. My grandmother -- maternal grandmother, my Aunt Julia, who is my mother’s sister, with her husband and son, and one of our household persons was with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: And who -- who was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: I think her name was Penny.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: And would she be a -- a maid, or a cook, or a governess?</span> <span id="s486">A: Well, I guess she was everything.</span> <span id="s487">A little bit of everything, but she was very devoted to the family, and she said if the family was going to leave Volos, she was coming with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: And was she Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s490">She was one of the girls from the mountains.</span> <span id="s491">She probably wanted to go to Athens.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: And whatever discussions went on be -- prior to this plan being made, you were not -- you were protected, and you were not privy as a -- as a young child, or a 10 year old.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: No, I certainly wasn’t privy, but I could see, I mean, the house is being dismantled, things are being moved to storage spaces, or some things are being shipped, and other things were given to friends or neighbors for safekeeping.</span> <span id="s494">We didn’t recover any of that, like paintings, or carpets.</span> <span id="s495">So I knew that we were moving.</span> <span id="s496">To me it was a little bit of an adventure, to be -- being on a boat, and the boat breaking down, and all that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s497">I didn’t particularly like to sleep on sacks of flour, and I was afraid of the rats.</span> <span id="s498">There were a lot of rats there.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: What do you remember of your -- of your sister’s attitude?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: I think my sister was taking care of me.</span> <span id="s501">She would always make sure I was fine, and I wasn’t too close to the edge of the -- of the boat, or I was -- I was -- well, she would talk to me, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: Did she seem -- do you -- well, wonder if you even know if she was troubled.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: I’m sure she was troubled.</span> <span id="s504">Now, how much troubled, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s505">I think she was protective of my parents, so I think she tried not to show her anxiety much.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: The -- this was -- I mean, it was a plan that obviously -- I would think obviously, talking to account that your father was full of concern about what was likely to happen.</span> <span id="s507">Do you -- do you remember if he ever thought of -- of leaving Europe, or -- or going somewhere much farther away, leaving Greece?</span> <span id="s508">He would be a man with contacts, and so on, in other European nations.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: I never discussed this with him, but I have a feeling he would never go anywhere other than Greece.</span> <span id="s510">I think -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Paulette Nehama.</span> <span id="s512">This is tape number two, side A. You’re telling me that your father never considered going anywhere beyond Greece.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: No, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s514">Although he never discussed it with me.</span> <span id="s515">I think --</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: Anybody -- was there anyone you knew who considered fleeing to the United States?</span> <span id="s517">A: I never knew of anybody who came to the United States at the time.</span> <span id="s518">Some people went to Palestine, or Turkey.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: And who were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: There was a friend of mine who was a little younger, and her family.</span> <span id="s521">And they went on a small boat, and unfortunately they left them -- there were other people with them, but they were left on a -- on a rock.</span> <span id="s522">Supposedly the boat had trouble, and the man went up to -- went to fix the boat and never came back.</span> <span id="s523">And they were picked up much, much later, by another boat.</span> <span id="s524">But they stayed on that rock for maybe a week or so.</span> <span id="s525">So there were incidents like this, you would hear all over the place.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: And did they return to Greece, or did they continue on their way?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: They returned to Greece, and they went into hiding in Greece, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: And let’s go back to the move to Athens, and tell me about your life there, prior to going into hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: Okay, so we moved, as I said, we came on these two different boats that took about 10 days to get to Athens, and normally the trip is like two days at the most.</span> <span id="s530">In Athens my uncle, who was my father’s younger brother who lived there, had found a place for us.</span> <span id="s531">It was an apartment at -- we had one floor, my aunt and grandmother had another in the same building.</span> <span id="s532">And we went there.</span> <span id="s533">It was spring, so I didn’t go to school, because school would have been over pretty soon.</span> <span id="s534">And I guess we were trying to -- to get acquainted to -- to the city, and to -- to find our way around.</span> <span id="s535">There wasn’t much we were doing as far as I was concerned.</span> <span id="s536">My only playmate was my cousin, who was 11 years old -- I mean, 11 months older than me, and we were constant companions.</span> <span id="s537">I don’t remember having friends, or being encouraged to -- to make friends.</span> <span id="s538">Since I didn’t go to school, of course I couldn’t meet other children.</span> <span id="s539">Then, in September of 1943, we went into hiding.</span> <span id="s540">And the events prior to this, I remember them very clearly.</span> <span id="s541">I had the mumps, and I was in bed, and the dining room was adjacent to the bedroom.</span> <span id="s542">So my -- all my aunts, and uncles came and they were having meetings with my parents in this dining room, and I could hear them whispering.</span> <span id="s543">I could not make out any words, but I knew something very serious was going on.</span> <span id="s544">And obviously they were planning where each one was going to go, what they were going to do, and it was like a big family meeting.</span> <span id="s545">My sister was in that -- in that meeting.</span> <span id="s546">Occasionally she would come out and check on me, to make sure I was all right, or put some hot pads on my cheeks, which was the normal treatment.</span> <span id="s547">And then she would go back in the room.</span> <span id="s548">And when I would ask what is it that -- why are you all in there, and she would say, “Well, we -- we just need to discuss some adult things.</span> <span id="s549">Don’t worry, everything is fine.”</span> <span id="s550">And but of course I worried, because I knew everything wasn’t fine.</span> <span id="s551">So I remember that very, very clearly.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: What had triggered this -- what had triggered the plan, and the crisis, if you like?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: I think the fact that they were hearing more and more things about the Germans coming to Athens, and I think it was about the time that Italy capitulated, and they probably knew that if Germans come, they would probably treat the Jews the same way they treated them in Salonika.</span> <span id="s554">So some advance thinking, at least to have the plan, and if you need to use it, you use it.</span> <span id="s555">It was necessary to do that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: Was there any leadership coming through the synagogue, or the Jewish community, do you think, to help people deal with this?</span> <span id="s557">I mean, did all families begin to make plans at the same time?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: I don’t know for sure, but I have a feeling they probably did.</span> <span id="s559">Some decided the very last moment to go somewhere, because this is something you don’t want to believe that this going to happen.</span> <span id="s560">It’s pretty unbelievable.</span> <span id="s561">So most people denied as wildly exaggerating, or this isn’t going to happen to us.</span> <span id="s562">But people with advanced thinking, and people who know about the world, I guess, don’t leave things to chances.</span> <span id="s563">And my father was one of these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Meanwhile, you were living under false names in Athens, but would your -- would neighbors know your real identity, or would you keep very much to family, and not be mixing much with people who were not close to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: That is true.</span> <span id="s566">I don’t remember mixing much with other people.</span> <span id="s567">We didn’t have neighbors -- actually, there was a lady but i -- who lived in the same building, but I think she was also Jewish.</span> <span id="s568">And we pretty much stayed with the family.</span> <span id="s569">I don’t remember venturing out much -- I mean, not -- we were free to come and go, but I would always go out with someone, I would never go out alone.</span> <span id="s570">But there was no -- no particular friends that I remember at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Now, from the time of these whispered meetings, when you had the mumps, to the time when you left the apartment and went into hiding, how much time went by?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: Probably a month.</span> <span id="s573">Because we went into hiding in September of ’43, and the meetings must have been like a few -- a month, or maybe two at the most, before.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: And what preparation -- obviously the planning was going on, but as a child, do you have any memory of the activities going on in the apartment?</span> <span id="s575">I mean, was there packing of valuables, or anything that you remember observing?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: I don’t think we have any valuables, because I think a lot of the furniture was in there, in the apartment when we arrived.</span> <span id="s577">It wa -- I don’t think it was our furniture, I don’t recall.</span> <span id="s578">So this probably was a -- a furnished place when we arrived.</span> <span id="s579">As far as clothing, I think we took whatever we needed, which wasn’t much at the time.</span> <span id="s580">Maybe some books.</span> <span id="s581">I took my favorite doll.</span> <span id="s582">I was a big doll person.</span> <span id="s583">And I guess that was it, but no utensils, or anything else, because when we were into hiding, we lived with other families, not Jewish families, Greek Orthodox families, so they had their own household.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: And when you left Volos, and came to Greece, you’d already taken a huge -- or made a huge change in your standard of living.</span> <span id="s585">I assume that the apartment in Greece would be much more sparse, you’d left all your possessions and so on behind.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: Right, yeah.</span> <span id="s587">They all went into storage.</span> <span id="s588">As I said, some things went to friends or neighbors for safekeeping.</span> <span id="s589">A lot of stuff we did not recover.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: How -- they would simply not -- they’d have disappeared, or they wouldn’t -- friends and neighbors would not honor the --</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: Either they would move away, or some people even denied of -- I remember there was a painting that was the favorite painting of my mother’s, and this woman denied that she ever had it.</span> <span id="s592">And it was an outright lie.</span> <span id="s593">So, things like that.</span> <span id="s594">I don’t remember if we sold things.</span> <span id="s595">I can’t recall that.</span> <span id="s596">But I remember when we arrived in Athens we didn’t have much.</span> <span id="s597">It was a big change, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: Let me go back to the woman and the painting.</span> <span id="s599">It’s a -- m-m-maybe -- maybe it sheds light on something.</span> <span id="s600">Obviously to have left a cherished possession with her, she would have been a trusted friend.</span> <span id="s601">I -- I wondered was that -- her not honoring that trust later, what did that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Well, I think it was a devastating thing to find that you cannot trust people, on top of everything else that’s happening.</span> <span id="s603">At least there were people you could count on, and you cannot count on them.</span> <span id="s604">And you really don’t know to whom you can turn when things are bad.</span> <span id="s605">I think that was the story in the -- the experience.</span> <span id="s606">How can she be so blatant, and say, we didn’t get it, they didn’t give it to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: And then wa -- when it comes to going into hiding, you had to know that you could trust the people that you were going to be with.</span> <span id="s608">What do you know about the -- how the family split up, who you stayed with.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Okay, first of all, my father had found this place through a friend, a very good friend of his.</span> <span id="s610">He had baptized the oldest child, by the name of Many Babella, and he knew the family well.</span> <span id="s611">So he had talked to them, and they had agreed to take us.</span> <span id="s612">Of course, families could not -- families could not be together if there were more than two, three people, because they could be easily spotted, and they had to disperse.</span> <span id="s613">My father went to some other family, and my mother and I, and sister, went to Calivare, which is a suburb of Athens, to this wonderful family of a couple, the name was Pavella.</span> <span id="s614">And they had three children, a 15 year old, and one girl who was Kate, she was 10, as I was, and a younger boy about six or seven, called Dimitris.</span> <span id="s615">My mother, sister, and I shared one room.</span> <span id="s616">So the three of us shared one room, my father was elsewhere, and we had our meals with the family, I was playing with the children, who were about the same age as I was.</span> <span id="s617">I wasn’t going to school, and my excuse was that I had appendicitis.</span> <span id="s618">And I wasn’t supposed to go to school.</span> <span id="s619">This was what I was telling the children.</span> <span id="s620">Of course, they all wanted to see my incision, and there was no incision.</span> <span id="s621">Basically, I liked these kids, and they were just great, they were warm, and would play all sorts of games, and we had a great connection.</span> <span id="s622">My mother would communicate with my father once a week by telephone, and this was like a coded message.</span> <span id="s623">When the news were bad, the message was, the patient is very sick.</span> <span id="s624">When the news was better, it was that, well, the patient is doing better.</span> <span id="s625">So, this was a pre-arranged kind of code for them to communicate.</span> <span id="s626">My sister became good friends with the sister of the woman who hid us, the family there.</span> <span id="s627">She had a bakery right across from where we were.</span> <span id="s628">And my sister would go there sometimes, and also Adhero will come to -- to the house.</span> <span id="s629">She was very warm, and caring, and often will bring cookies from the bakery.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: I -- I wanted to clarify your not going to school was really because your -- you were more effectively hidden if you didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: Right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: And then -- well, loo -- let’s go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Yeah, I couldn’t go to school, because that involves being outside, and being in public.</span> <span id="s634">The -- the fear was that somebody may recognize us.</span> <span id="s635">Same thing for my mother and sister, we couldn’t venture very far other than across the street to the bakery, because although we had left Volos, where we were very well known, and in Athens we were more -- more unknown people, it still the possibility that somebody would recognize us, and mention our names, and then everybody will be in great peril.</span> <span id="s636">Of course, the family that hid us was in danger by hiding us.</span> <span id="s637">These were wonderful people.</span> <span id="s638">He worked for -- the man of the family worked for a Greek newspaper, so he could bring home news of what was going on.</span> <span id="s639">His wife was also a very good housekeeper, caring for the children, and very nice, and my mother and Dasseia became friends.</span> <span id="s640">And even after the war they would see each other.</span> <span id="s641">And there was great respect for each other.</span> <span id="s642">So there was -- there were good feelings there, and a good connection.</span> <span id="s643">As I said, we couldn’t go out, we couldn’t do things that we normally used to do.</span> <span id="s644">But maybe for my mother this was a big loss, but for me it was fun because there were children to play with.</span> <span id="s645">At some point, I think it was probably around December, which was like three months after we went into hiding to the Pavella family, my father joined us.</span> <span id="s646">I guess he had become very lonely in the family he was with in Athens, and he decided to come to be with us.</span> <span id="s647">Of course, this was with the agreement of the family we lived in.</span> <span id="s648">But shortly after, I remember it very clearly, one evening, Adhero, the -- the wife’s sister, who had the bakery, came running to the house, and saying, “You must leave immediately.</span> <span id="s649">I heard from somebody that they know you are Jewish, and you are hiding.”</span> <span id="s650">We used to tell, or the family used to tell that we were relatives, because sometimes we would be out in the yard, and people would ask, who are these people?</span> <span id="s651">They say they were relatives.</span> <span id="s652">And this man, who happened to be drunk, and he was in a tavern, in a Greek tavern, he said, “Don’t get fooled, these people are not relatives of the Pavella family, they are Jews, and they are hiding.”</span> <span id="s653">So it was heard by everybody who was in that tavern, and Adhero happened to be there.</span> <span id="s654">And she ran and told us to leave immediately.</span> <span id="s655">Well, the first one who left was my father, because he was in greater danger.</span> <span id="s656">And he walked from Calivare to Athens with the man of the family, Milanos Pavella.</span> <span id="s657">He wouldn’t let him go by himself.</span> <span id="s658">He took him on foot.</span> <span id="s659">And the next night, all three of us, my mother, my sister, and I, when it became dark, we also left with him.</span> <span id="s660">He came back, of course, after taking my father to a friend’s house in Athens.</span> <span id="s661">He came back and took us to -- to Athens.</span> <span id="s662">Now this is about, I don’t know, probably -- I remember walking for a long, long, long time in the night.</span> <span id="s663">I don’t know exactly how far it is, but I’m sure it must be like six miles, 10 miles from Athens.</span> <span id="s664">So it’s a long walk for a 10 year old.</span> <span id="s665">And we had put scarfs on our heads, and tied them so people wouldn’t recognize us immediately.</span> <span id="s666">So when we go to Athens, we immediately went where my father was, at the friend’s house.</span> <span id="s667">Now these were very good friends, who were notified, apparently, when this incident of somebody saying that we were Jews occurred.</span> <span id="s668">And they were looking for a place for us to go.</span> <span id="s669">But until they found a place, we couldn’t stay together, because they were in danger.</span> <span id="s670">So my sister went to a friend’s house, one of her friends from Volos, that family lived in Athens, and they took her.</span> <span id="s671">And I went -- they took me to somebody’s house in Athens, and all I remember, it was like a mansion, a huge place.</span> <span id="s672">And there lived a man in a wheelchair.</span> <span id="s673">I think he was an old man, but here again [indecipherable] wrong, being 10 years old -- and a woman who was taking care of him.</span> <span id="s674">I don’t think she was a relative, I think she was a caretaker.</span> <span id="s675">And I was left there for 10 days by myself, not having communication with my family, not knowing what was going on, not knowing these people.</span> <span id="s676">I think this man didn’t talk to me, or if he did, it must have been one or two words, or maybe he couldn’t talk.</span> <span id="s677">I remember the woman feeding him, spoonfeeding him, so obviously he was pretty sick.</span> <span id="s678">And I was desperate.</span> <span id="s679">I was totally lost.</span> <span id="s680">I didn’t know what happened to my parents, I didn’t know if they would ever pick me up.</span> <span id="s681">But the woman, the caretaker of this man was a very kind woman, so when I would cry, she would try to comfort me, or tell me stories, or all sorts of things, just to make me feel good about it.</span> <span id="s682">Well, in about 10 days, my sister came, and she said, “We have a place now.</span> <span id="s683">I’m ga -- I’m here to pick you up, to take you.”</span> <span id="s684">I don’t know if she had called before or not, I don’t recall.</span> <span id="s685">But I took my little satchel of things, a couple of changes of clothe -- clothes, and my doll, and said good-bye and left.</span> <span id="s686">And we went -- we met again at this friend’s house, and we went, I think in installments again, my father went first, or we went first, to the second house, where we spent about seven months.</span> <span id="s687">This was in Kipserly.</span> <span id="s688">It was the family of Andonis Vayas, who was an officer in the navy.</span> <span id="s689">And they had -- he and his wife had the little girl about three years old.</span> <span id="s690">And I think there was a grandmother who was deaf, and also lived in the house, but we hardly saw her.</span> <span id="s691">She stayed in her room for the most time.</span> <span id="s692">Anyway, so it was a new adjustment.</span> <span id="s693">We had a very large room for the four of us, so there was like a -- a screen put in the middle, so on one side where my parents were sleeping, and on the other side was my sister and I.</span> <span id="s694">We were sharing the other side of the room.</span> <span id="s695">And we were closer to the street, it was on a street level, and closer to the street.</span> <span id="s696">I slept on a cot.</span> <span id="s697">And I remember at night I would hear the Germans patrolling, and I could hear their boots going by my window.</span> <span id="s698">And I would stop breathing.</span> <span id="s699">I was so petrified, because I thought they were coming for us.</span> <span id="s700">And I would pull the blanket over my head, and stop breathing, I -- until I couldn’t -- I couldn’t do it any more, and I had to breathe.</span> <span id="s701">So then slowly I will pull the blanket off my head, and I would listen very carefully, and by then the steps with the boots -- because I knew -- I knew they were boots, would disa -- have disappeared, or they would have gone away, or they were far, so I knew we were safe.</span> <span id="s702">This was my biggest fear, that they would come and get us.</span> <span id="s703">Here again, I didn’t go to school.</span> <span id="s704">My father tried to teach me some arithmetic, and I think I had two books, “Robinson Crusoe,” and another one, which was a rather gloomy book called, “The Orphans of Scotland.”</span> <span id="s705">And it was nothing but -- you know, five orphans, or maybe more, whose father was in prison, and how they got him out of prison in a basket, and things like that.</span> <span id="s706">But it was a rather sad book, if I remember correctly.</span> <span id="s707">Then I got hold of a children’s magazine heyou -- I think it was a weekly magazine.</span> <span id="s708">I don’t know who gave it to us, or how I got hold of it, and it had wonderful stories, and this was very nice for me too, to read.</span> <span id="s709">Other than that, think my imagination went wild, because I used to play in the backyard, and all I would do is pick up bamboo stick, and pretend it was a gun, and was shooting all the Germans.</span> <span id="s710">And we were free, I thought, by me doing that.</span> <span id="s711">Games like this.</span> <span id="s712">Occasional I will play with a three year old little girl.</span> <span id="s713">But that was about it.</span> <span id="s714">The backyard had a fence, and the next house was also a two story house, I think, and in the balcony there was a little girl who would be out practically every day, and playing with dolls, and other toys.</span> <span id="s715">And I would go next to the fence, and we started talking.</span> <span id="s716">And she would always invite me to go to her house to play.</span> <span id="s717">But of course, I knew I couldn’t, so I would find all sorts of excuses that I couldn’t go.</span> <span id="s718">But one time I couldn’t bear it any more, so I jumped the fence.</span> <span id="s719">On our side of the yard, the fence was reasonably manageable, I could go over it.</span> <span id="s720">But when I jumped, it was very high on her side.</span> <span id="s721">I’m glad I didn’t break a leg.</span> <span id="s722">So I jumped the fence, and went to her apartment and played there for awhile.</span> <span id="s723">Of course, nobody in my family knew that I left the house.</span> <span id="s724">But when it was time for me to go back, I just couldn’t climb the fence, it was too much.</span> <span id="s725">So finally I decided I had to go around the corner, because this house was around the corner.</span> <span id="s726">So I came, and rang the doorbell, and of course the woman opened the door, and she was so surprised to see me.</span> <span id="s727">And my mother came, and she was absolutely pale when she saw me.</span> <span id="s728">I got a good spanking for that, I remember.</span> <span id="s729">I wasn’t supposed to -- to leave the house, especially not telling anybody.</span> <span id="s730">But it was that urge to be with other children, to be able to play, to be -- to have a normal life like any other child that made me do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Now, at first when you were rescued by your sister from the elderly man, that must have been simply wonderful, to be reunited again.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: Oh sure, that was.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: And I am guessing that was the hardest experience, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: Yes, it was a very hard experience.</span> <span id="s735">It was a hard experience because I’ve never been alone with strangers.</span> <span id="s736">I was -- I didn’t know -- I had the feeling that -- oh, I was afraid that maybe my parents were taken by the Germans, and I couldn’t see them again, or they wouldn’t come back for me, or they would leave me there forever.</span> <span id="s737">That was the feeling.</span> <span id="s738">It was a sense of abandonment, but I’m sure they had no other choice to -- to send me any place else, I mean, I don’t know what went on, and how it was decided for me to go to this man’s house.</span> <span id="s739">Obviously not everybody is willing to take a 10 year old under such circumstances.</span> <span id="s740">You know, 10 year olds talk, and jump fences.</span> <span id="s741">So they are dangerous.</span> <span id="s742">But it was -- it was a very sad time for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: Do you think that that’s stayed with you, any of those feelings?</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: Well, I think the fear of abandonment has stayed.</span> <span id="s745">And at different times I have felt it quite strongly.</span> <span id="s746">Also, I think at times when I think a child being left alone, although there were people -- End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: This is tape number two, side B.</span> <span id="s748">The -- I want to go back a moment and ask for more information about the two families that you stayed with --</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: -- or three, in fact, if you count the elderly man.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: Well, after the second one, yeah, we went to a third one because the -- my father was taken by the Greek Nazis -- Greek SS, as they used to call them.</span> <span id="s752">They were watching the house in -- the third house, and -- no, actually, the second house in Kipserly.</span> <span id="s753">And one day they burst in, pretending they were people from the power company, and they wanted to read the meter, but they came in with guns, and they were asking for Moudzoukos.</span> <span id="s754">And they took him, and fortunately he had money on him.</span> <span id="s755">He had British pounds that were all sewn around his west -- waistband, and he paid them.</span> <span id="s756">And they told him that he and his family had to leave within five hours, and they didn’t guarantee his safety, or anybody else’s safety.</span> <span id="s757">So when they came to get my father -- panic-stricken my mother, and my sister, and me -- my sister went next door -- here again, she jumped from a terrace to the next terrace, where there were people that had help us find this house as well.</span> <span id="s758">And this was in -- somebody in the -- I think in the Supreme Court, or -- he was in charge, anyway, and we knew them.</span> <span id="s759">So she notify them, and they notified another friend, who immediately came -- nearby there was a market, and he was watching the house to see the activity and what was going on.</span> <span id="s760">And as soon as they brought my father back, he came in the house and took us to his house.</span> <span id="s761">And from there he found another place for us.</span> <span id="s762">So I think we stayed overnight, or maybe a couple of days, until a second hou -- a third house was found.</span> <span id="s763">And that’s when we moved again.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: And all these families that were taking you in were Greek Orthodox families?</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: Yes, they were Greek Orthodox families, they were also compensated financially.</span> <span id="s766">Because there were expenses, you know.</span> <span id="s767">We had to eat, and they had to eat.</span> <span id="s768">And of course, there was some danger in there.</span> <span id="s769">So they were being compensated.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: I mean, were they richly rewarded, or was it -- or do you feel it was simply that you were allowed to make a contribution for real costs?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: I don’t know the answer.</span> <span id="s772">I have a feeling that at the time, it was just for expenses, but I know that after the war, they were very much helped by my father when things started going much better.</span> <span id="s773">Because I remember this navy officer who would come often, and ask for a loan, or things like that.</span> <span id="s774">And then my father would forgive the loan.</span> <span id="s775">So probably it was after the war, but I -- I don’t know for sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: I also assume that they were taking very great risks.</span> <span id="s777">What would -- if they had been found to have been sheltering Jews, would their lives be in danger, as we -- as well as the other side of that is that your lives were in their hands.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s779">They were very courageous people to do that, and they were great human beings to be able to -- to help somebody else at such a risk, yes, because if anybody was found to be sheltering Jews, could be shot, he and his family.</span> <span id="s780">So, it was a great danger to have Jews in the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: What did they give as their reasons?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: Their reasons for what?</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: For -- for sheltering you, would they say this -- you would do it for us, or this is just common human decency?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: Yeah, I think that that was the main thing, that this was common decency.</span> <span id="s785">I remember Pavellas, the first house we went, when he learned that this guy said something about us being Jewish, and hiding, and you know, he came to notify us.</span> <span id="s786">She said, “You know, the -- the Nazi may come and take them.”</span> <span id="s787">And Milanos said, “Over my dead body.”</span> <span id="s788">So he had a very sense -- a very good sense of protecting us, of not letting anything happen to us.</span> <span id="s789">That’s why he dro -- he -- he walk with my father from Calivare to Athens, and the next day he walk back again with my sister -- my mother, and my sister, and myself.</span> <span id="s790">So, I mean, he was a man who would take it very seriously that this was the lives of people that were under his care, and he wouldn’t let anything happen, I mean, as far as he could control that.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: I-It does seem very na -- I mean, he was doing the right thing, but it also seems to me admirable, because his own children were placed at risk in -- in acting morally, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: Right.</span> <span id="s793">That’s right, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: Now --</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: Also -- also, the children did not know we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s796">Only the eldest daughter, Many, who was 15, knew.</span> <span id="s797">She knew.</span> <span id="s798">But the children also -- the family had to sacrifice, they had to give up a room.</span> <span id="s799">You know, I mean this was a very small house, it wasn’t a huge place, it wasn’t a mansion.</span> <span id="s800">So they had to give up a room for us to stay.</span> <span id="s801">They had to share the bathroom, they had to -- to share the kitchen, or whatever.</span> <span id="s802">So they made sacrifices as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Tell me what day to day life would be like with the Pavellas.</span> <span id="s804">I mean, would you -- would you all eat meals together, and would you do chores in the house?</span> <span id="s805">Like who would clean the bathroom, and what do you remember about the daily life at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: For me, it was a good time, because I had company.</span> <span id="s807">I mean, it was great to have the children, who were fun children to be with.</span> <span id="s808">The chores were like sitting -- setting the table, or things like that.</span> <span id="s809">We all had dinner together, we all ate together.</span> <span id="s810">I think the cooking was done by my mother, and by Desseia.</span> <span id="s811">Desseia would do the shopping, or sometimes Milanos, the father, would do the shopping.</span> <span id="s812">And they would take turns cooking.</span> <span id="s813">And as far as cleaning, I think we were responsible for cleaning our room, making our beds, doing the laundry, or setting it out, I don’t remember, in those days you were just washing, you know, by hand.</span> <span id="s814">So I think things were divided that way.</span> <span id="s815">For me, I remember I would wait impatiently until the children will come home from school, because that was the fun time I could play with.</span> <span id="s816">During the day my mother tried to engage me in teaching me how to embroider, or how to sew, and I had no interest whatsoever in any of these sedentary activities.</span> <span id="s817">Plus my eyes were not very good, so I couldn’t concentrate on a little hole there for hours.</span> <span id="s818">I -- I -- I may have had one or two books, but basically I think I had a vivid imagination and I would make up stories.</span> <span id="s819">And when the children will come, I will tell them stories, or they will tell me jokes, and this kind of thing.</span> <span id="s820">We didn’t go out, but yet had a huge yard, and that was nice, because we could play outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: What about clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: Oh, you had just not too many clothes.</span> <span id="s823">You just wore the same things over and over.</span> <span id="s824">I mean, you washed them, but I didn’t wash them, my mother washed them.</span> <span id="s825">But there were no new clothes, I mean, probably she would take the here -- sometimes I would get my sister’s things, and she would hem them.</span> <span id="s826">But there was a 10 -- 10 year difference, so you can imagine that her clothes didn’t quite fit me right, even if the hem was put up.</span> <span id="s827">So my biggest -- my happiest thing when she got engaged, was that I would have a new dress.</span> <span id="s828">That was a big thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: What do you remember of your -- of your sister and your mother’s state of mind at this time?</span> <span id="s830">I mean, it sounds as if for you, when you were at the Pavellas, it was not a difficult time, perhaps because you -- I mean, it was difficult in the sense that it was -- you couldn’t go to school, but that -- maybe I’m wrong in saying it was not difficult, but not painfully difficult like the time when you were abandoned and alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: Right.</span> <span id="s832">You’re right.</span> <span id="s833">I’m sure it was very difficult for my mother, first of all because my father was elsewhere, and for my sister, because she was older, and she could understand the dangers, and whatever was going on.</span> <span id="s834">So, since I didn’t know that much about what was going on in the world, you know, I wasn’t particularly worried.</span> <span id="s835">I was worried about my father, and I wanted my father to be with us, and I was told he eventually will be with us, but that was about it.</span> <span id="s836">I -- I didn’t feel deprived, although, you know, food was not really -- it was difficult to get food.</span> <span id="s837">So I remember some of the dishes, it was like cabbage with rice, and carrots.</span> <span id="s838">And to this day I make it, and I think exactly of -- of that time.</span> <span id="s839">I loved it, it was great dish.</span> <span id="s840">You know, I mean, meat, eggs, fish probably were not available that much, and they were expensive.</span> <span id="s841">So, you know, when you have a large family to feed, it’s considerable.</span> <span id="s842">But yes, it wasn’t a painful time for me.</span> <span id="s843">It was more of a -- of an interesting time, or a fun time, I would think.</span> <span id="s844">But the other two places we went, it was a more painful time, because number one, I lost the children, you know, I -- I didn’t have my friends any more.</span> <span id="s845">So that was a big loss when we left.</span> <span id="s846">And they -- I was asking Many when I saw her a couple of years ago, how was it for them when we left?</span> <span id="s847">And what did their parents tell them?</span> <span id="s848">And she said they missed us terribly, because we had become very connected.</span> <span id="s849">The second house, the Vaia house, I was -- I was upset most of the time because -- a little bit of it was boredom, a little bit of it was inability to go out and do things.</span> <span id="s850">Just -- I felt stagnated, there wasn’t much to do.</span> <span id="s851">But I knew that everybody else was trying very hard to -- to put a good face for the other person, so I was trying to be cheerful, so my parents won’t get upset.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: When you spoke of the code language between your parents, first of all, would there be a phone in the home at that time, or would your mother have to go somewhere to make that call?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: She would have to go to the bakery across the street, at a time where the bakery wasn’t crowded, like two or three o’clock in the afternoon, which is siesta time in Greece, to call around that time.</span> <span id="s854">Occasionally, I was allowed to talk to my father, but here again it was very brief, and it was like -- I was told never to mention names, like his name -- well, his name was Daddy, but never to mention my sister’s name is Yola, or things like that.</span> <span id="s855">And he would ask me how are you, are you a good girl, or you know, things, very brief kind of things.</span> <span id="s856">And that was about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: What did -- what did you know about the treatment of the Jews by the Germans then?</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: I didn’t know anything.</span> <span id="s859">My parents probably knew what happened in Salonika, but I had no idea.</span> <span id="s860">I was kept very safe from information of that sort.</span> <span id="s861">And since my parents were not together, and they couldn’t discuss it openly, I couldn’t hear anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: Would you see mistreatment of Jews in the streets, or do you know of family members observing beatings, or killings?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: No, most of it is what I heard.</span> <span id="s864">I actually saw a German kicking a man outside my window in the second house where we were.</span> <span id="s865">I could hear the screams, and the shutters were always halfway closed, and I could see this -- hear this scream, so I looked outside, and there was a German soldier kicking a man -- to me it seemed like an old man -- many times.</span> <span id="s866">I don’t know if he was a Jewish man or not, but I remember feeling very angry that he was doing that.</span> <span id="s867">And then my mother came and pulled me away from the window, so I don’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s868">But I kept on thinking about this man for a long time, and I still do.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: Do you attribute your survival to these families?</span> <span id="s870">I assume that you do.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s872">Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: And how many -- how widespread was this?</span> <span id="s874">Do you -- do you have any sense of the numbers of families who would be sheltering Jews?</span> <span id="s875">Was it extremely rare, or was it very common?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: No, I think it was common.</span> <span id="s877">People -- you see, Greek people are very kind, and very hospitalble -- hop -- hospitable.</span> <span id="s878">So to them, hiding somebody in need was not extraordinary, although it is extraordinary, it was you’re a human being, I’m a human being, we have to help each other, because if I were on your side, I would expect that you would do something like this.</span> <span id="s879">So it was -- they were very generous people to do that, I mean, and very kind.</span> <span id="s880">Very kind.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: I wondered if -- if it’s known, of -- later, do -- do you know of any families that -- where the -- the Jews that they were hiding were discovered, and what actions were taken against these sheltering families?</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: I don’t know of any.</span> <span id="s883">I don’t know of any.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: And at this time, how would you get news?</span> <span id="s885">You were -- you -- with the Pavellas you were getting it through Mr. Pavella’s newspaper, but would there be a radio in the home?</span> <span id="s886">Would you listen to -- to news programs, or would your mother get the news in code from your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: My mother would get the news about the Jews in code from my father only for a short period of time when my father was separate.</span> <span id="s888">But then he -- he came to live with us, and then the second house, and the third house he was with us, so we were all together.</span> <span id="s889">It was primarily the men of the family that would go out and hear things, they would bring newspaper.</span> <span id="s890">I think there was a radio.</span> <span id="s891">I think radios were not allowed, certain stations were not allowed, and you had to take your radio so it would be sealed, as they used to call it.</span> <span id="s892">But I remember hearing some news.</span> <span id="s893">There was a small radio, and I remember my father putting his ear practically on the radio to -- to listen.</span> <span id="s894">I don’t know if it was BBC or whatever, but he would listen.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: What -- what do you mean sealed, when --</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: Well, they used to block certain stations, so you couldn’t listen to all those stations.</span> <span id="s897">And these were the stations that would give you news, propaganda, and all sorts of things.</span> <span id="s898">You know, just kind of controlled the -- the stations you could use.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: Now, at this time do you remember knowing anything about resistance fighters?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: Yes, that I knew, and quite often my imaginary games including me being a resistance fighter, because that bamboo stick that I carried on my shoulder was primarily killing Germans, and often it was being a resistance fighter, just fighting for freedom.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: So th -- th -- those were the heroes, rather than the sheltering families?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: Well, how did this period of hiding come to an end?</span> <span id="s904">What happened, and also how old were you when you no longer needed to be in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: Okay, the -- the liberation came in 1944, October ’44.</span> <span id="s906">So I was 11 years old.</span> <span id="s907">We were hiding for four -- 13 months, or a little over 13 months.</span> <span id="s908">The news came, I think from the radio that we were free, October 12th, in Athens, later in other places, going north, as the Germans started retreating.</span> <span id="s909">It was -- I think it was the radio, but I also think that the man of the house, of the third house, came and said, “The Germans are leaving, we are free.”</span> <span id="s910">And I remember my sister and the -- the daughter of the household, her name was Maria, she was older than me, but she was closer to my sister age, and they were dancing.</span> <span id="s911">So we listened to the radio, and I think some people also came to announce the freedom, that we were free now.</span> <span id="s912">They didn’t know we were Jewish, but they came to say the Germans have left, or are leaving.</span> <span id="s913">And it was going to be a big celebration downtown in Athens.</span> <span id="s914">So my sister and Maria were going to go, and I wanted to go with them.</span> <span id="s915">I was crying to go with them.</span> <span id="s916">They wouldn’t let me because I was too young.</span> <span id="s917">And apparently a lot of crowds were there, you know, so they could have let me go get a sense of what was going on, but anyway, they -- I couldn’t go.</span> <span id="s918">So I stayed home with my parents, but Yola, my sister, and Maria went, and they came home about 12 o’clock, and they was telling us it was such a frenzy, it was wonderful, everybody was jumping and laughing, and it was -- it was great.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: And did things change very quickly?</span> <span id="s920">I mean, what -- what happened next?</span> <span id="s921">Would it take awhile to pick up the pieces of your old life?</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s923">For one thing we were free, but we had no place to go.</span> <span id="s924">We didn’t have -- we couldn’t go back to Volos because we didn’t have a house there.</span> <span id="s925">The factory was not working.</span> <span id="s926">Here again, good friends came to the rescue.</span> <span id="s927">We -- I think in about a week my parents were able to rent an apartment in Athens, and friends lent us furniture, like folding cots, and folding tables, and folding chairs, and mattresses.</span> <span id="s928">I slept on a mattress.</span> <span id="s929">I remember there was only one bed where my grandmother, when she came from her hiding place, slept.</span> <span id="s930">Everybody else slept in cots, or on a mattress on the floor.</span> <span id="s931">And we were reunited with my grandmother, my Aunt Julia, and Raymond my -- my cousin.</span> <span id="s932">But his father was taken to Bergen-Belsen, so he wasn’t with them.</span> <span id="s933">He eventually returned to Greece.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: Now where -- where was he take -- I mean, where was he when he was captured?</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: He was hiding someplace in Athens, I’m not quite sure where.</span> <span id="s936">But he was a Spanish citizen, so he had a sort of better treatment, as they called -- you know, the Spanish citizens were treated differently, the Jewish Spanish -- he was Sephardic -- were treated in a -- a little lenier way, let’s say, were taken to Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: Now, that’s interesting to me, so w -- you mean, the Sephardic Jews who were rounded up, generally were treated differently?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: Only the ones who were Spanish citizens.</span> <span id="s939">If they were Greek citizens, no.</span> <span id="s940">Because Spain was trying to negotiate with the Germans to get the citizens back, or to have a better treatment, and somehow they were able to, up to a certain extent, not really, but they were a little more lenient.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: So he was taken to Bergen-Belsen, wa -- wa -- what -- what did you ultimate -- ultimately learn?</span> <span id="s942">Ha -- was it -- it -- of his experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: Well, he didn’t talk much about his experiences there, other than he’d say it was a horrible time.</span> <span id="s944">I actually don’t know his experiences there, but I thought he was a much sadder man than I knew him.</span> <span id="s945">He was quite a happy man before, and he wasn’t -- he was very subdued, I thought, when he came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: Would he have been working in -- as a -- doing sort of slave labor, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: Yeah, I think they did slave labor, right.</span> <span id="s948">But they were not cremated.</span> <span id="s949">I mean, they didn’t go to the crematorium.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: And do you -- do you know what his relationship with his family was like afterwards?</span> <span id="s951">I mean, was he a --</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: -- was he a man whose spirit was broken, when he returned, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: I think he was okay.</span> <span id="s955">I think he was all right with the family, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: You would -- you were 11 when you came out of hiding.</span> <span id="s957">What are your memories of what it was like in those next years, when you’d be 11 - 12 - 13, and then tell me how you think, subsequently, this period in hiding has changed you.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s959">We came out of hiding, and I was kind of lost.</span> <span id="s960">They tried to enroll me in public school, which was not far from where we lived, and I think it was almost -- it must have been like maybe fifth grade at the time.</span> <span id="s961">I should have been in fifth grade, but I skipped so much school that I really didn’t have the skills any more.</span> <span id="s962">I remember the class being huge.</span> <span id="s963">There must have been like 70 children in that class, and I was taught a little obs -- I had no idea what they were talking about, I didn’t get any particular attention to -- to something.</span> <span id="s964">So I was very unhappy, and eventually, I don’t know how much later, my parents put me in a private school with a much smaller, you know, smaller classes, more attention from the teachers, and things like that.</span> <span id="s965">At the time we didn’t have money for private schools, and I know that my father’s sister helped for me to go to private school, I know that.</span> <span id="s966">So it was something very generous of her to do.</span> <span id="s967">And I did like the school, it was -- the co-owners of that school were both British women, very regimented, very disciplined, but basically it was a very, very good school, and it still exists in Greece.</span> <span id="s968">So once I were -- I was there then, I was able to -- to feel my way a little better.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s970">What’s the name of the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: Hill, H-i-l-l.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: And I wonder if looking back, you think that you were -- in the period in hiding, living in a fantasy world as a protective measure?</span> <span id="s973">I mean, you spoke about your imagination and your games.</span> <span id="s974">I mean it -- have you thought about this, whether -- whether the rich imaginative fantasies were in fact helping to shield your -- your spirit, or your psyche from what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: Oh, I’m sure about that.</span> <span id="s976">I think there was a lot of anxiety I felt, because I would pick up, you know, what the adults, and the other people around me felt.</span> <span id="s977">And although I didn’t show it, I was always a very private person as a child, and some of it was encouraged because I wasn’t supposed to be saying things to others.</span> <span id="s978">I mean, to my family I was supposed to say, but -- End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Paulette Nehama.</span> <span id="s980">This is tape number three, side A.</span> <span id="s981">You were talking about the concern that you would give the game away, blurting something out as a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: Yes, I think that was the fear.</span> <span id="s983">And I think that’s why my parents weren’t telling me too many things, let alone that they felt I was too young to -- to be burdened, and worry about things like that.</span> <span id="s984">But I did worry.</span> <span id="s985">I mean, I was a very sensitive child, so I could feel the moods of everybody.</span> <span id="s986">I mean, I could see my father -- I would enter that part of the room that he -- my parents had in the second house, where it was divided by a screen, and he would smoke constantly.</span> <span id="s987">I mean, the room was so cloudy, it was hard to see him, because it was one cigarette after the other.</span> <span id="s988">And that worried me.</span> <span id="s989">Not that I knew that cigarettes were not good for you, but his -- his mood, his pensive mood, the heaviness was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: What do you think that the impact of -- of that was on you, developmental -- I -- I ask this question just because I’ve heard discussion of it.</span> <span id="s991">Sometimes childhood is robbed.</span> <span id="s992">You were forced to be adult too soon.</span> <span id="s993">Or sometimes I think other survivors have said that it’s -- that they’ve remained a child longer, and been slowed in their normal maturation, because they were bearing these burdens.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: I think that was more of the case with me.</span> <span id="s995">I think even after we were liberated, we were very burdened because we had no money, we had lost the factory at the time.</span> <span id="s996">We had no furniture.</span> <span id="s997">So we had to start life from the beginning, to pick up the pieces.</span> <span id="s998">And I think my parents were very concerned that they were -- they didn’t want -- I don’t know about my sister, but they didn’t want me to be unhappy, and to have a bad childhood.</span> <span id="s999">Here we had everything, and they had planned for everything, and here comes Hitler, and you know, he turns your life upside down.</span> <span id="s1000">So I think they tried to shelter me, maybe a little too much, but I think I didn’t grow up as fast as I thought I would have liked to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: And you spoke about schooling, but as -- as you -- as your teens went on, what would be -- how did schooling progress, and other things?</span> <span id="s1002">Would there be -- would there be any extra curricular things, or were times too hard to have piano lessons, and art lessons and so on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1004">Schools progress normally except I had a great difficulty in school.</span> <span id="s1005">Part of it was I didn’t have the skills to study, or I couldn’t even do arithmetic.</span> <span id="s1006">Things that you learn in third grade, I had skipped second, third, and fourth grade, basically.</span> <span id="s1007">Because also, during the Italian war, school was a [indecipherable] you know, whenever.</span> <span id="s1008">It was -- so it was very hard for me.</span> <span id="s1009">I didn’t know the basics, let’s put it this way.</span> <span id="s1010">But I got up.</span> <span id="s1011">But I always had this feeling that I was lagging, I was behind.</span> <span id="s1012">And this was a very uncomfortable feeling for me.</span> <span id="s1013">I was ashamed of it, that I didn’t know as much as the other children knew.</span> <span id="s1014">My greatest extra-curricular activity was joining the Girl Scouts.</span> <span id="s1015">You see, I always loved the Brownies when we were in Volos, as I said before, but as soon as Metaxess, who was a dictator, Fascist, decided that the Girl Scout movement, and the Boy Scout movement had to cease and all children should joined Apon, which was the youth organization.</span> <span id="s1016">But Jews were not included, so I could not participate.</span> <span id="s1017">So I always felt so hurt, because of that.</span> <span id="s1018">And after the -- after the liberation, and when things started falling into place slowly, my goal was to become a Girl Scout.</span> <span id="s1019">I was dying to.</span> <span id="s1020">We didn’t know any troops, any Girl Scout troops, how do you go about it.</span> <span id="s1021">But I made sure I found out where the headquarters were, and I wrote a letter to the region officers there, a wonderful woman, by the name of Mrs. Sareefee, and I told her that I was a Brownie when I was little, and now I’m out of hiding, and I want to become a Girl Scout.</span> <span id="s1022">And she wrote back and -- a very warm letter that I read, and read, and knew by heart, because that was the letter I had under my pillow.</span> <span id="s1023">Every night I read it.</span> <span id="s1024">And she told me that troop number 21 is not far from where I live, and my mother could get me there, and they used to meet on Saturdays again.</span> <span id="s1025">And sure enough my mother took me, and she met the leaders, wonderful women.</span> <span id="s1026">And it was from then on I was -- my life was nothing but the Girl Scouts.</span> <span id="s1027">It was the most wonderful experience for me to be with this group.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: Now why do you think that is?</span> <span id="s1029">I mean, did it, perhaps, address your strengths?</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: Well, it addressed my strengths, it also addressed my need to -- to be included, to be with children, to be with other people, to be doing interesting things.</span> <span id="s1031">To be going on outings, like excursions, to do service work.</span> <span id="s1032">And I was very, very welcome.</span> <span id="s1033">To this day, I go to Greece, and I see friends that I made in my Girl Scout years.</span> <span id="s1034">I meet them there.</span> <span id="s1035">They write to me.</span> <span id="s1036">In fact, they send me a yearbook lately.</span> <span id="s1037">Every February -- 22nd of February, it’s considered the day of thinking, they call it Thinking Day.</span> <span id="s1038">It was the day that the re -- the Baden Powell, and his wife Olivia, when they formed Girl Scouts, they would correspond with other people, and they had set this day as the Girl Scout day, thinking of each other.</span> <span id="s1039">So it somehow kept it, and many of these friends gather in somebody’s house, and they always send me a card, and they sign their name that they remember me.</span> <span id="s1040">And I think it’s a wonderful feeling, to -- to know that these years were so important.</span> <span id="s1041">I later became a -- a Girl Scout leader.</span> <span id="s1042">I was pretty good at it.</span> <span id="s1043">I was leader taking Girl Scouts camping in service areas that we called -- Greece had earthquakes, and the senior Girl Scouts, above -- above age sic -- 17, I think, or 18, would go and help the village, and the people after the earthquakes, and I was the leader there.</span> <span id="s1044">So they were wonderful years.</span> <span id="s1045">I just love them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: So the Girl Scouts was really a saving --</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: It was a [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: -- thing in your life.</span> <span id="s1049">What about your sister, and when you came out of hiding, how would she resume her education?</span> <span id="s1050">Or -- or did she feel she’d finished it at that time, cause she was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: Well, she had finished high school before that, so she didn’t go to -- to higher education.</span> <span id="s1052">She may have helped my hu -- my father at times with secretarial work, or something like this, but no, she didn’t go any higher education.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: Was she a good student in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: My sister?</span> <span id="s1055">She -- yeah, I think she was, but except she -- she had too many interests, so sometimes she would be very naughty, as the principal said.</span> <span id="s1056">You know, she -- she likes boys, and she liked other things to do.</span> <span id="s1057">You know.</span> <span id="s1058">But basically I think she graduated all right.</span> <span id="s1059">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: Yeah, so she got into -- into trouble?</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: Yeah, at times, yeah.</span> <span id="s1062">But then I left the Hill School, and I went to the American college, which is a high school in Greece.</span> <span id="s1063">It’s a very good school, extremely good school, and it was -- it was very hard for me, because I entered in the seventh grade.</span> <span id="s1064">I had to pass exams, and -- to be admitted.</span> <span id="s1065">And it has been an extremely wonderful experience being in that school.</span> <span id="s1066">Very strict school.</span> <span id="s1067">Academically very high standards.</span> <span id="s1068">That’s where I learned English.</span> <span id="s1069">I had wonderful teachers, that they were not only teachers, but very caring for the children.</span> <span id="s1070">And I still see them when I go to Greece.</span> <span id="s1071">They’re in their 90’s.</span> <span id="s1072">One of them died last year, and she was 103, and I used to go and visit her.</span> <span id="s1073">And this gives me also a routine of what was I like then, because I left, and I came to a country that nobody knew me, other than my husband, who didn’t even know me that well, after a week’s flir -- you know, courtship.</span> <span id="s1074">So it gives me such a good feeling to be rooted again, talking to my teachers, talking to my old friends, the people who knew me.</span> <span id="s1075">They knew who I was, and what I was, and how I was.</span> <span id="s1076">It’s a very good feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: Now, how old were you when you met Isaac, your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: 24.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: So a lot of time went by from the period we’re speaking about until the time --</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: I met him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: -- when you met him.</span> <span id="s1082">But so tell me what went on in those years.</span> <span id="s1083">You continued with your education, were you then working?</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: No, what I did, I finished high school, and then I went to a school of social work in -- which was part of the American college, it’s called Pierce College.</span> <span id="s1085">And it was what they used to call apple division.</span> <span id="s1086">So there were three schools, school -- school of commerce, social work, and literature, so -- so I chose the school of social work.</span> <span id="s1087">Before that I had become a volunteer Red Cross nurse, and I used to -- I mean, I had six months training, and then I had to be at the hospital for two months every year, taking different shifts, and I enjoyed being a nurse, volunteer nurse, but it was great.</span> <span id="s1088">So -- I keep on jumping -- so after I became a social worker, I worked -- at the time I was doing academic work, I also had field placements in different places.</span> <span id="s1089">One was in a community place with refugees, the other was in a -- in an adoption center.</span> <span id="s1090">It was a place called Mittera, and there were primarily children from unwed mothers, and many of their children were being adopted [indecipherable] with American families, or other families.</span> <span id="s1091">So I was the social worker trainee.</span> <span id="s1092">And that -- that was a great place, I liked that place a lot.</span> <span id="s1093">I tried to convince my parents to adopt a baby from there, but it didn’t work.</span> <span id="s1094">And after that, you had to pass exams again, because all social workers were employed basically by the ministry of social welfare.</span> <span id="s1095">So there were a lot of people who were welfare workers, and were going to villages, distributing welfare checks, and taking care of these type of things.</span> <span id="s1096">There were social workers who were working in a hospital, sort -- other kind of agencies, there were no private agencies that would hire social workers.</span> <span id="s1097">So I worked in a -- in a hospital at the beginning at the children’s hospital, and later in a public hospital as a discharge social worker, discharging people, and making arrangements for them.</span> <span id="s1098">And then I met Isaac.</span> <span id="s1099">Oh, before I met Isaac I also belonged to a little Jewish club.</span> <span id="s1100">It was a Jewish youth club where I met Sam.</span> <span id="s1101">Sam is Isaac’s brother.</span> <span id="s1102">And we became very good friends, both with Sam and his then fiancée, Evelyn.</span> <span id="s1103">And we were a group of about, you know, we were groups, several groups.</span> <span id="s1104">We used to go on excursions, or places, different -- to the movies together, but we moved in the group.</span> <span id="s1105">So I was dating at the time a young man, who was part of that Jewish club, and this was a nice time.</span> <span id="s1106">I think the adults were very pleased that we had this club, and I think partially they financed it, because they wanted all the young people to meet other Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1107">And in some cases it worked very well, because quite a few of these people married, you know, other women, men, that belonged to this club, and that’s how they met.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q: Now, who did Sam marry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: Sam married Evelyn Maraka.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: Who he met in this group?</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1112">Actually, I knew Evelyn from my school.</span> <span id="s1113">She went to the same school I did, to American college, but she was in one or two classes younger than I was.</span> <span id="s1114">So I knew who she was, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: And then when they married, that was when you met Isaac?</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1117">Isaac -- Isaac had come to -- from the united -- he lived in the United States, and he had come to Greece for Sam’s wedding.</span> <span id="s1118">And that’s where I met him, the first time actually I lay eyes -- eyes on him, it was at the wedding, and I didn’t particularly think he was attractive, or -- I didn’t particularly was impressed with him, just by looking at him.</span> <span id="s1119">But then I think a couple of days later, my sister had some friends over, and this friend of hers said, “We cannot come, because we have a guest, my cousin from the United States is here, so I cannot come to dinner.”</span> <span id="s1120">And Yola said, “Bring him over,” you know, “it will be fine.”</span> <span id="s1121">So I was invited, and my parents were invited also, to Yola’s, but my parents were not feeling well, so they didn’t go, so I went.</span> <span id="s1122">And that’s where I met him, and I said, “Well, he is kind of interesting guy.”</span> <span id="s1123">You know.</span> <span id="s1124">And things moved very fast from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: Well tell -- tell me the story, a -- a -- actually, in interviewing your husband, I -- I know it from --</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: Ah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: -- one perspective in the museum tape, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1129">I’ll be interested in hearing his version.</span> <span id="s1130">Well, I had broken up with my boyfriend like a week before.</span> <span id="s1131">And I had bought two tickets for Isaac Stern, there was a recital in Athens.</span> <span id="s1132">And I was still kind of lamenting the fact that I would have to either sell the ticket or go by myself.</span> <span id="s1133">So after I met Isaac at my sister’s house, and we talked about all sorts of things, and he was telling me about his interest in music, I thought about asking him to come, but girls didn’t ask boys out those days.</span> <span id="s1134">And I wasn’t sure whether I should do it or not.</span> <span id="s1135">Anyway, I thought about it, I went to work in the hospital, and I thought about it, and thought about it, and I said, “Well, what difference does it make?”</span> <span id="s1136">I want him to come.</span> <span id="s1137">So I called him, and I said, “Listen, I have an extra ticket for Isaac Stern, are you interested?”</span> <span id="s1138">And he said, “I -- am I interested.</span> <span id="s1139">I would love to go.”</span> <span id="s1140">So that’s how it happened, I met him, and we went to the theater, we listened to Isaac Stern.</span> <span id="s1141">During intermission Isaac tells me that he knows Isaac Stern from his college years, where he was directing the concerts at the University of Illinois, and he would like to go and talk to him.</span> <span id="s1142">So he left me there, and he went backstage.</span> <span id="s1143">And of course, when he came back, I asked him if he remembered him.</span> <span id="s1144">Yes, he remembered him, I think.</span> <span id="s1145">Anyway, we went out after the concert, we had coffee, we had ice cream, whatever.</span> <span id="s1146">And then the next day, either he called me, or I called him, and I think it was very shortly after, I think I saw him for the whole week.</span> <span id="s1147">He said to me, “Do you know, in English, when somebody says I want to talk to you, do you know what it means?”</span> <span id="s1148">And I said, “Yeah, it means that somebody wants to talk to you.”</span> <span id="s1149">Well, he said -- so he was trying to explain to me what it meant, but all of a sudden he says, “I would like to ask you to marry me.”</span> <span id="s1150">And I was ah, what?</span> <span id="s1151">You know, I just couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s1152">But he -- he asked me, and I said, “Yes, yes, I will.”</span> <span id="s1153">Right away.</span> <span id="s1154">I didn’t even think about it.</span> <span id="s1155">I was very attracted to him, and I thought he was extremely bright, he was very knowledgeable.</span> <span id="s1156">He had a great knowledge of music, which impressed me very much.</span> <span id="s1157">He was very handsome, and he was an interesting guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: So it was a whirlwind week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: Yes, kind of.</span> <span id="s1160">And I -- I remember [indecipherable] a teacher that I met in the street, and she said, “How are you, what are you doing?”</span> <span id="s1161">I said, “I just got engaged.”</span> <span id="s1162">She says, “Really?</span> <span id="s1163">Tell me about it.</span> <span id="s1164">How long did you know the man?”</span> <span id="s1165">I said, “A week.”</span> <span id="s1166">And she looked at me and said, “You, Paulette, this conservative person, got engaged in a week?</span> <span id="s1167">That can be possible?”</span> <span id="s1168">It was.</span> <span id="s1169">But somehow I knew that this was the guy.</span> <span id="s1170">But I think in retrospect, you know, if any of my daughters would come and tell me they know somebody for a week, and they want to marry this person and go to Australia, let’s say, or someplace far away, I would think they would have to have their heads examined.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q: But you were right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: I mean, it -- it didn’t fit my pattern, I would always think things through.</span> <span id="s1173">I was -- in a sense my teacher was right, I was conservative.</span> <span id="s1174">I was never -- it wasn’t I wasn’t spontaneous, I was spontaneous, but I wasn’t -- I wouldn’t do things at the spur of the moment.</span> <span id="s1175">And this one was very incongruous with -- with my way of doing things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: Well, I think in affairs of the heart, perhaps one -- you know, at once.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: Yeah, I think I knew.</span> <span id="s1178">I think I knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: And when I said you were right, I didn’t mean that you were right to think your daughter’s crazy, it -- it was just that time showed that your -- you were judging wisely your feelings.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: Yeah, I trust my feelings.</span> <span id="s1181">I think I -- I have a good sense of what I need, and what my feelings are, and I think I have intuition, in a way, or maybe a feeling of what’s right for me, and what’s not right for me.</span> <span id="s1182">Not always, but most of the times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: And you had -- you had a lot in common.</span> <span id="s1184">Looking back, do you think that was why you could make a decision so quickly?</span> <span id="s1185">Just that your -- you both had had -- had suffered in different ways during the war.</span> <span id="s1186">You had the same -- you both were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1188">I can’t answer that, because I n -- first I said yes, then I heard about all the war stories.</span> <span id="s1189">Although I did know some from Sam, his brother, and -- but I don’t know if this was a determining factor or not at the time, because I didn’t think it through.</span> <span id="s1190">So I can’t tell.</span> <span id="s1191">But also the fact that he was Sam’s brother kind of gave me a feeling that, well, you know, I make this decision -- this decision, but he can’t be that bad, I mean, I know his brother.</span> <span id="s1192">And maybe my parents felt that way, too, because they knew Sam.</span> <span id="s1193">Sam worked with my father at the Jewish Central Committee.</span> <span id="s1194">And he had high respect for Sam, and Sam for my father.</span> <span id="s1195">So, I mean, he probably thought, who is this guy who is gonna take my daughter to America, you know, to the United States?</span> <span id="s1196">But I think there was some kind of a feeling that he is a solid guy, and I think that helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: What was the reaction of Sam and Evelyn, and your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">A: When we got engaged, Sam and Evelyn were on their honeymoon, so they didn’t know about it until they came back.</span> <span id="s1199">They had just been married.</span> <span id="s1200">And they were thrilled.</span> <span id="s1201">They were very happy, very happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: And you -- in a sense you’ve already explained that your parents knew Sam, and therefore --</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: -- blessed your plans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1206">I think they were -- they were happy.</span> <span id="s1207">And you know, after talking to him, my mother found him very charming.</span> <span id="s1208">My father found him extremely knowledgeable.</span> <span id="s1209">It was the time of the Sputnik, and my father was so interested about that Sputnik, but knew nothing about what was going on.</span> <span id="s1210">And, I mean, the fact that somebody could explain it to him in such wonderful ways, was very impressive.</span> <span id="s1211">So I think he was very taken with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: And then, how did you make plans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1214">A-Also let me tell you that since we got engaged, I would receive huge bouquets of flower every single day, to the point that we had no place to put them, because you know -- and there was always a note from Isaac, you know, with every delivery of flowers.</span> <span id="s1215">And that was very nice.</span> <span id="s1216">So to get back to your question, when did we make plans.</span> <span id="s1217">I think it was understood that I would come to United States.</span> <span id="s1218">At that time, I was applying for a scholarship to come to the United States to study.</span> <span id="s1219">And I had applied to Barnard College, and I forget what else.</span> <span id="s1220">But I had a couple of colleges.</span> <span id="s1221">And Isaac told me that if I come as a student, I cannot stay in the United States.</span> <span id="s1222">So we went to the American consulate to get some advice, and they told us that indeed, I could not -- I could get the scholarship, but I -- even -- I couldn’t get married in the United States and remain in the United States.</span> <span id="s1223">The Greek visa was oversubscribed.</span> <span id="s1224">So I think it was something like 10 years of waiting, or something like that, which didn’t thrill me.</span> <span id="s1225">And one of the suggestions was that maybe I can go to Canada, and get married in Canada, and then for Isaac to apply for me to come from Canada to the United States as a spouse.</span> <span id="s1226">Because Canada had no -- no quota.</span> <span id="s1227">So we thought about it, and thought about it, a-and we thought it might be a good idea.</span> <span id="s1228">My -- there was a family that we knew who had gone to Montreal.</span> <span id="s1229">This was my brother-in-law’s -- Yola’s husband’s cousin.</span> <span id="s1230">And they had moved from Athens to Montreal like maybe two years before that.</span> <span id="s1231">So Freddie, my brother-in-law, wrote to them and told them the situation, and asked them if I could stay with them while all the paperwork was being done.</span> <span id="s1232">And they said they would be very glad to have me there.</span> <span id="s1233">So that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s1234">A friend my sister’s, who was working for HIAS, the Hebrew Immigration Society, said to me, “You know we are going to speed things up for you.</span> <span id="s1235">Why don’t you get your police report, your health records, and everything else you need, and we’ll send them to the consulate in Montreal.</span> <span id="s1236">So after you marry, the -- all your -- all that your husband has to do,”-- [indecipherable], “all that your husband has to do is to -- to apply for you to come to United States, and this will save you a lot of paperwork over there.”</span> <span id="s1237">I said fine.</span> <span id="s1238">So I did all this preliminary work, and Linda sent everything to Montreal.</span> <span id="s1239">So I left in April of ’58 for Montreal.</span> <span id="s1240">It was -- didn’t hit me until I was on the plane, and I said to myself, where am I going, all by myself, to somebody I don’t really know.</span> <span id="s1241">I just wanted the plane to come back.</span> <span id="s1242">But the plane kept going.</span> <span id="s1243">And eventually I re -- I reached Montreal, my friends were there to greet me at the airport.</span> <span id="s1244">And this was a family that they had two children, a six year old, and a baby.</span> <span id="s1245">And I shared a room with the six year old, and also the mother -- his mother lived with them, in a small apartment in Montreal.</span> <span id="s1246">So Isaac came I think the next weekend, or two weekends later to see me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: How long was it since you’d seen Isaac in Athens?</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: Oh, it was -- let’s see, we got engaged in September ’57 -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">Q: -- a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Paulette Nehama.</span> <span id="s1250">This is tape number three, side B.</span> <span id="s1251">You were telling me about being reunited with Isaac.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: Yeah, so we went to the airport to pick him up, the family and I. And I couldn’t wait in the waiting room, I was so anxious to see the -- see him.</span> <span id="s1253">So I went outside, you know.</span> <span id="s1254">Apparently when the plane landed, you had to walk outside into the -- into the terminal.</span> <span id="s1255">So I see him coming, and I was freezing there, it was so windy, and so cold, but I was waiting there to see him.</span> <span id="s1256">And he was wonderful.</span> <span id="s1257">It was really wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: Removed all your doubts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: Yes, yes, it was -- it was nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: And then you planned to marry in Canada, shortly after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1262">Isaac was married before, for a short period of time.</span> <span id="s1263">And we had to -- to go to Toronto for him to sign some papers for the final decree, which we did.</span> <span id="s1264">And I think shortly after that he dis -- his divorce papers came through.</span> <span id="s1265">And we went again to Toronto, and we got married by a Justice of Peace.</span> <span id="s1266">I was all dressed up, not in a wedding gown, but in a very fancy, elegant dress that’s -- my parents made me at a very great attag -- couturier, as we used to call it, in Athens.</span> <span id="s1267">And the question was, do I wear a hat, or do I not wear a hat.</span> <span id="s1268">And Isaac said, “If you wear a hat, I’m not going to marry you.”</span> <span id="s1269">So he doesn’t like hats, or he didn’t like me wearing a hat.</span> <span id="s1270">So I thought well, okay.</span> <span id="s1271">So we were just the two of us, there was nobody, and you had to have witnesses for the wedding.</span> <span id="s1272">So we -- they told us that we can go out in the waiting room and ask two people to come inside and become our witnesses, or go to Eton, we -- which the department store across the street, and [indecipherable] everybody will come, you’re two young people in love, you know, people love stories like this.</span> <span id="s1273">Anyway, at the waiting room there was another couple.</span> <span id="s1274">It was an older couple -- I mean, older, I would think probably in their 50’s.</span> <span id="s1275">And they were going to get married also.</span> <span id="s1276">So we made an agreement, we would sign -- we would be witnesses at their wedding, and they would be the witnesses in our wedding.</span> <span id="s1277">And that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s1278">I had to repeat in English, and my English wasn’t that good at the time, you know, that’s -- I do marry him, and take care of him, for better or worse.</span> <span id="s1279">And that was it.</span> <span id="s1280">At the time -- the more I think about that now, the more I think how I missed my family not being there, and not having anybody.</span> <span id="s1281">And many times I go to weddings, and I cry my heart out.</span> <span id="s1282">And I wanted my daughters to have nice weddings, with lots of people, and friends, and family.</span> <span id="s1283">Because I feel that I just -- was a big loss for me not to have anybody.</span> <span id="s1284">But on the other hand, at the time, I -- all I wanted was to get married to Isaac.</span> <span id="s1285">And to me, that was because there were a few obstacles, as I said, to -- to bypass the immigration laws, to -- to come -- I mean to -- for him to get the divorce papers, and all this kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s1286">So these were like little setbacks that kept me wondering would I ever be able to marry this man.</span> <span id="s1287">And that’s all I wanted at the time, but there was some feeling of not having the people that mattered most in something so important in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: And the waiting in Toronto with the family would not be easy, I assume.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: Well, okay -- well, so we got married, then we went to Niagara Falls, this was our honeymoon.</span> <span id="s1290">And -- okay, so we went for our honeymoon to Niagara Falls, we stayed about a week, and then Isaac returned to the United States, and I returned to Montreal.</span> <span id="s1291">I wasn’t happy at all.</span> <span id="s1292">The family I lived with, as I told you, had two children, so in order for me to be busy and think less of Isaac, Sonia gave me full care of the baby.</span> <span id="s1293">He was about six or seven months old, little Eddie.</span> <span id="s1294">So she would say to me, “You need to practice, you take care of him.”</span> <span id="s1295">And I would say, “Well, I’ve never take care of a baby, what do I do?”</span> <span id="s1296">She said, “You’ll find out.</span> <span id="s1297">Just don’t let him fall.”</span> <span id="s1298">And I was taking care of him completely.</span> <span id="s1299">I would take him for walks, I would take him out.</span> <span id="s1300">We’d play together.</span> <span id="s1301">It was wonderful to -- to have a little baby there.</span> <span id="s1302">Anyway, meantime -- it takes a long time -- Isaac applied for me to come to the United States as a spouse.</span> <span id="s1303">And at some point he said to me, “You know, you have to go to the consulate and tell them that -- find out why is it taking so long.”</span> <span id="s1304">Well, it was taking longer than we thought, and eventually I went to the HIAS office, to the Hebrew Immigration Society, and saw a social worker there, who got interested in the whole thing, and she made several attempts to find out what was going on, and I think eventually what happened is Isaac had applied for me to come to the United States by the name of Nehama, as his spouse.</span> <span id="s1305">The papers that were sent from Greece, by HIAS were under the name Moudzoukos.</span> <span id="s1306">So the two things were never put together, Moudzoukos and Nehama were two different persons for them.</span> <span id="s1307">So they never figured it out.</span> <span id="s1308">It was only after desperation that Isaac went to his congressman in New Jersey where he lived, and talked to him, and the next day I get a phone call from this social worker, and she said, “Guess what?</span> <span id="s1309">You’re going tomorrow.</span> <span id="s1310">We have everything ready for you, the visa is ready, come to the office.”</span> <span id="s1311">And of course, it was wonderful, because it had become to be a big, big problem, you know, six months -- it was six months it took for me being by myself there -- I mean, it wasn’t by myself, but still, I was very anxious to start my life, and for Isaac to be in the United States.</span> <span id="s1312">So, in November, first day it snowed in Canada when I was there, I said good-bye to my friends, and boarded a plane, and came here, in New York, and of course, Isaac was a -- waiting, and he already had rented a house in Lake Hiawatha, which at this time I couldn’t even say the word Hiawatha.</span> <span id="s1313">And I would think, my God, if I get lost, how am I gonna say where I live?</span> <span id="s1314">I mean, this is not the place to take me.</span> <span id="s1315">You should take me someplace where I can pronounce, or I can even say it.</span> <span id="s1316">So it was -- the house was all taken care of.</span> <span id="s1317">I mean, he had arranged it, and fixed it, and he had a lot of his furniture there, but decorated very nicely, painted it, just took good care of things.</span> <span id="s1318">And then it was, how do I live here, and what do I do, and it was a bit hard.</span> <span id="s1319">It was lonely, because I didn’t know anybody, although I met two good friends of his, and their wives were marvelous.</span> <span id="s1320">They would come and pick me up and take me to lunch, or take me places, and they tried very hard to -- to make me feel comfortable.</span> <span id="s1321">But a couple of months later, I -- oh no, I started going to New York, I would take the bus from New Jersey and go to New York in the day time, and started going to the museums, and just getting a feel of the city, and I loved it.</span> <span id="s1322">And one day, I think Isaac had gone to San Francisco on business, I was looking in the newspaper, and I saw that there was a position open for a social worker that -- to deal with adoptions.</span> <span id="s1323">So I called, and made an appointment, and took the bus, and went to -- and indeed, it was the International Social Service in New York, that was looking for a social worker, take care of Greek adoptions.</span> <span id="s1324">I knew all the social workers in the International Social Service in Greece -- I no -- in Athens.</span> <span id="s1325">I knew them very well.</span> <span id="s1326">And to me this was like a glove that fitted perfectly well.</span> <span id="s1327">So I told them I was interested in the job, they said they thought I would be perfect for the job, but they have to communicate with the people in Athens, and get references from there, and everything else, which they did, and then they called me, and they said, “My goodness, I mean we never heard anything as good as this.</span> <span id="s1328">When can you start?”</span> <span id="s1329">So I got the job, and I had to commute, of course, every day from New Jersey.</span> <span id="s1330">It would take me like an hour almost, on the bus.</span> <span id="s1331">And it was very exciting, I was very excite -- I didn’t know what I was doing, but it was very exciting.</span> <span id="s1332">And I liked the people work there, very well, very much.</span> <span id="s1333">Then I got pregnant with Sarah, and commuting wasn’t the best thing for me.</span> <span id="s1334">I had the threatening miscarriage, and the doctor said to me, “Well, all I can tell you is, what you want, the baby or the wor -- the job?”</span> <span id="s1335">So I decided I wanted the baby, and that meant I had to stop working.</span> <span id="s1336">There was no other way to get to New York early in the morning, so I stopped working.</span> <span id="s1337">And I was sad about that, because I just felt I had reached the point where now I’m able to -- to live in the United States, to work, to become part of it.</span> <span id="s1338">So it was a bit sad.</span> <span id="s1339">But of course, having a baby was wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: You had done your training.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: That’s right, I have done my training with Eddie, and I went to his 25th birthday, in Canada.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q: Oh, and when was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">A: In the 70’s, I forget.</span> <span id="s1344">Well, ’57 or ’58 plus -- ‘78 -- about ’78, I think?</span> <span id="s1345">Something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1348">We had gone for a visit to Canada with the childr -- two of the children, Sarah was in college, and it was Maya and Nicole that came, and Isaac and I, we drove all the way up there, it was his 25th birthday.</span> <span id="s1349">It was nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">Q: By the way, would you have had any photos of you in that couturier wedding gown?</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">A: No, because the most horrible thing happened.</span> <span id="s1352">I had my camera, and I asked people to take pictures of us because we were going to send them to Greece, you know, here are the newlyweds.</span> <span id="s1353">And something happened to the film, and no picture came out.</span> <span id="s1354">Absolutely no picture.</span> <span id="s1355">It was devastating not only to me, but also to my parents, who were saying, “Send us wedding pictures, where are the wedding pictures?”</span> <span id="s1356">So I don’t have a single photo of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: So you have lots of photos of Sarah as a baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: I have photos of all the kids, yes.</span> <span id="s1359">Sarah as a baby, I used to send them to my parents.</span> <span id="s1360">When Sarah was six months old, I took her to Greece, and that was great.</span> <span id="s1361">It was -- because I can now understand how my parents felt, of me being so far away, and not being able to see me, help me.</span> <span id="s1362">Here I go through pregnancy, a baby -- a brand new baby.</span> <span id="s1363">If you were -- if I were to live in Greece, you know, they would be with me, or helping me in every step.</span> <span id="s1364">And here I was totally, totally, totally alone.</span> <span id="s1365">And it must have been extremely difficult for my mother, especially.</span> <span id="s1366">My father too, I’m sure.</span> <span id="s1367">You know, the United States wasn’t just available that much those days, tickets were extremely expensive, telephone calls were extremely expensive.</span> <span id="s1368">So this is not like the kind of thing you do now, like I call my sister every week.</span> <span id="s1369">But st -- you know, he -- it’s not a major expense, but those days it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">Q: What was happening in your sister’s life, at the time when you came to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">A: Well, my sister was married and had a son, he was -- Maurice was about 10 at the time.</span> <span id="s1372">Then in ’73, her husband died.</span> <span id="s1373">And she hasn’t remarried since.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q: So your parents, just at the time when you had left, they would be seeing a lot of your sister?</span> <span id="s1375">A: Oh yeah, yeah, they saw a lot of my sister.</span> <span id="s1376">And they lived nearby -- near each other, so you know, they would see each other, yes.</span> <span id="s1377">Then there were financial difficulties, the factory wasn’t going well.</span> <span id="s1378">My father started another factory in Athens, which was in -- in yarn.</span> <span id="s1379">Factory produced yarn, not material -- not cashmere any more, in order to supply Volos, the Volos factory.</span> <span id="s1380">But that didn’t go very well, and there were really financial problems, and constant problems with the bank, and the creditors, and this and that.</span> <span id="s1381">So eventually -- his health was bad, he was diabetic.</span> <span id="s1382">His health became bad, and financial conditions had changed, and so he lost the factory again.</span> <span id="s1383">So that was very hard for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">Q: They needed -- they needed you with Sarah in your arms.</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1386">And I think the fact that, you know, we had to leave again -- we stayed a couple of months in Athens with Sarah -- was probably harder for them, because now they had experienced their grandchild, and was taken away from them again, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">Q: Now how did you choose Sarah’s names -- is that how you pronounce it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">A: Sarah.</span> <span id="s1389">I used to say Sarah, and when Sarah went to the fir -- to first grade, she came home and she -- I -- I said to her, “Sarah, wash your hands, we’re going to have lunch.”</span> <span id="s1390">And she said, “My name is not Sarah, it’s Sarah.”</span> <span id="s1391">So she had become Americanized.</span> <span id="s1392">And -- so Sarah is named after Isaac’s mother, who perished in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1393">Maya, her second name is Thalia, which is my mother’s name, who also died, not in the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1394">And Nicole middle name is Julie, after Julius Hoffman, Dr. Julius Hoffman, who is the psychiatrist who delivered her at home, in my home, because she came too fast.</span> <span id="s1395">So everybody has meaningful name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">Q: I guess -- w-we haven’t even -- we haven’t even talked about Maya and her birth.</span> <span id="s1397">Perhaps you should give the full names and dates of birth of all three of your daughters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s1399">Sarah was born in New Jersey, on January 28th, 1960.</span> <span id="s1400">When she was almost a year old, we moved to California, to Santa Monica.</span> <span id="s1401">And then in ’62, the end of ’62, we moved back to Washington.</span> <span id="s1402">Actually, we moved to Washington, and remained in Washington since then.</span> <span id="s1403">Maya was born in Washington in -- on September 17th, 1963.</span> <span id="s1404">And Nicole was born on May 14th, 1966, at home, before I had time to go to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1405">And that was a big commotion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q: Yeah, you should -- you should tell the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A: Tell the story.</span> <span id="s1408">Well, it was a Saturday, thank God, so Isaac was home.</span> <span id="s1409">Now, my neighbors had told me that if I go to labor, I would call them, and they would take care of the older girls.</span> <span id="s1410">So when I woke up in the morning, the water broke, and I found out I -- I had contractions, so I-I timed them, and they were about 10 minutes apart.</span> <span id="s1411">So I woke Isaac up, and said to him, you know, “Take care of the kids.</span> <span id="s1412">Just give them breakfast or whatever, and I’ll go take a shower.”</span> <span id="s1413">Actually, I did call my doctor, and told him that I was in labor.</span> <span id="s1414">And he said, “Oh, 10 minutes, okay.</span> <span id="s1415">When the contractions are,” -- this was like early in the morning, like eight o’clock, or maybe earlier.</span> <span id="s1416">“When the contractions are about five minutes apart, come to the hospital.”</span> <span id="s1417">And I thought, five minutes apart, that’s a little too -- too close, but I didn’t say anything, he was the doctor.</span> <span id="s1418">So I went to the bathroom to take a shower, and I had some very strong contractions, so I said, I better lie down.</span> <span id="s1419">I don’t think I should take a shower.</span> <span id="s1420">So I lay down, and then things started happening very, very fast.</span> <span id="s1421">I mean, there were no five minute contractions between the 10 minutes.</span> <span id="s1422">And I’m feeling the baby is coming, and you know, what can I do?</span> <span id="s1423">I can’t make it to the bathroom, I can’t -- so I called Isaac, and I said to him, “Throw me a towel, I’m having a baby.”</span> <span id="s1424">So Isaac took the towel -- I had taken a shower at ni -- the night before, and threw me the towel -- gave me the towel, and he was in a total panic.</span> <span id="s1425">So he looks out of the window, and he sees my neighbor and good friend, and psychiatrist, Dr. Julius Hoffman walking his dog, and reading his paper.</span> <span id="s1426">So he opens the door, and he calls Dr. Hoffman, and he said, “Jules, Jules, Paulette is having a baby, what do I do?”</span> <span id="s1427">So he run to his house, which was next door, left the dog, came in -- I don’t know if he washed his hands, but came in and the moment he came in, the baby was halfway out.</span> <span id="s1428">So he delivered the baby, and he told me it was a girl.</span> <span id="s1429">I heard her cry once.</span> <span id="s1430">And Isaac called an ambulance -- oh no, he called the doctor, the doctor said, “My goodness,” you know, “when did that happen?</span> <span id="s1431">Bring her to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1432">Call an -- an ambulance and bring to the hospital immediately, I’ll meet you there.”</span> <span id="s1433">So meantime, when Dr. Hoffman took his dog back, he told his wife, “Paulette is having a baby.”</span> <span id="s1434">So she was alerted, and she came.</span> <span id="s1435">And I had called another neighbor, who had told me she would take care of the girls, and when I said to her, you know, “I-I’m in labor, and I’ll go to the hospital, do you think you can take care of Sarah and Maya?”</span> <span id="s1436">She said, “Sure, but how close are you, because I can hear you breathing very hard.”</span> <span id="s1437">I said, “Oh, I -- you have plenty of time.”</span> <span id="s1438">She said, “I’m giving my children breakfast, do I have time?”</span> <span id="s1439">I said, “Yes, you do, come afterwards.”</span> <span id="s1440">Well, she was here very fast, because she said she had a feeling she couldn’t wait for the children to have breakfast.</span> <span id="s1441">So the two women are here, and Dr. Hoffman, and the ambulance came.</span> <span id="s1442">The -- of course, you know, they check the baby, and me.</span> <span id="s1443">They put me on the ambulance.</span> <span id="s1444">And as we are going out the door, all of a sudden I said, “What happened to Sarah and Maya?</span> <span id="s1445">Tell them to come here and see their new sister.”</span> <span id="s1446">Isaac had forgotten about them.</span> <span id="s1447">He shoved them in her room, and she -- he said to him, “Stay there, and don’t move.”</span> <span id="s1448">So when he opened the door to see the two, to tell them to come out, both of them were huddled one next to the other, sucking their thumbs, poor things.</span> <span id="s1449">I mean, they were -- so m -- I asked to see them, so they came as I was going out the door on the stretcher.</span> <span id="s1450">I told them I was fine, and they looked at the baby.</span> <span id="s1451">And I told them that my neighbors, Mrs. Hoffman, and Mrs. Grossman’s going to take care of them.</span> <span id="s1452">Daddy would be back, I’d be back in a couple of days, and I’ll talk to them on the phone.</span> <span id="s1453">So off we go, an -- in the ambulance, and I don’t hear the baby crying, so I think she’s dead.</span> <span id="s1454">I was very worried.</span> <span id="s1455">So I kept telling Dr. Hoffman, “I can’t hear the baby cry.”</span> <span id="s1456">And he said, “You want me to pinch her?</span> <span id="s1457">She will cry.”</span> <span id="s1458">I said, “No, don’t do that, but is she alive, or is she not?”</span> <span id="s1459">“Yes, she’s alive, she’s breathing all right.”</span> <span id="s1460">So I go to the hospital, the doctor meets me right there at the entrance, he takes me down [indecipherable] emergency room.</span> <span id="s1461">He checks me out, he says, “Mrs. Nehama, you are in perfect health.</span> <span id="s1462">It’s Mr. Nehama who needs to be hospitalized.”</span> <span id="s1463">Isaac was in the ambulance with Dr. Hoffman, and he was holding the baby, wrapped in a yellow sha -- the yellow towel.</span> <span id="s1464">We have that towel, I gave it to Nicole.</span> <span id="s1465">But then I couldn’t see the baby, because they put her in isolation, in the intensive care, just to check her out.</span> <span id="s1466">And I thought she was dead.</span> <span id="s1467">So I keep asking, “Where is my baby, where is the baby?”</span> <span id="s1468">They said, “She is fine, she is fine.”</span> <span id="s1469">I said, “I want to see the baby.</span> <span id="s1470">I want to get up to see the baby.”</span> <span id="s1471">They wouldn’t let me get up, although I was fine.</span> <span id="s1472">Well, finally in the afternoon they let me get up, and I went by the nursery and there’s a woman who is sitting there -- standing there in front of the big window, and she said to me, “Did you have a baby today?”</span> <span id="s1473">I said, “Yes, how about you?”</span> <span id="s1474">“Yes,” she said, “I had it at home.”</span> <span id="s1475">I said, “I did, too.</span> <span id="s1476">Have you seen your baby?”</span> <span id="s1477">“No,” she said, “but I think my baby’s over there.”</span> <span id="s1478">And then I looked, and the nurse brought Nicole, or I pointed, and she brought her, you know, from the window, and somebod -- then in the evening I had her, and she came to the room, they brought her.</span> <span id="s1479">But it was a little worrisome, not being able to see her.</span> <span id="s1480">So those days you stayed in the hospital about five days.</span> <span id="s1481">So everything went well, thank God she was fine.</span> <span id="s1482">Last day of discharge the doctor got us, all the women, all his patients were about to be discharged, and he gives them instructions what to do, and what not to do.</span> <span id="s1483">So he introduces every single woman around this -- around the room, and he said, “And this is Mrs. Nehama, who sneezed and had her baby on Saturday.”</span> <span id="s1484">He used to call me the do-it-yourself girl.</span> <span id="s1485">He was funny.</span> <span id="s1486">But then I heard all sorts of stories.</span> <span id="s1487">I was at the grocery store one day, and I wrote a check, and the cashier said to me, “Thank you, Mrs. Nehama.”</span> <span id="s1488">And the woman behind me, she said, “Are you Mrs. Nehama?”</span> <span id="s1489">I looked at her, I didn’t know her.</span> <span id="s1490">I said yes.</span> <span id="s1491">She said, “You’re the woman who scared my husband to death.”</span> <span id="s1492">I said, “I don’t know your husband, who is he?”</span> <span id="s1493">Well, she says, “You don’t know him, but you scared him to death.”</span> <span id="s1494">I said, “What did I do?”</span> <span id="s1495">She said, “Di -- didn’t you have your baby at home?”</span> <span id="s1496">I said yeah.</span> <span id="s1497">“Well,” she said, “when you had the baby, I was seven months pregnant, and my husband wouldn’t let me get out of the house for two months.</span> <span id="s1498">He would call me every half hour.</span> <span id="s1499">He was so scared I would have the baby in the house.</span> <span id="s1500">You changed my life.”</span> <span id="s1501">So, there were funny things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">Q: It sounds like a -- it’s a great story, and it’s just a wonderfully happy time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">Q: Because it really shows the story that by then you had built a life here, and a community, and a family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">A: That’s true, that’s true.</span> <span id="s1506">I mean, life wasn’t easy.</span> <span id="s1507">It was lonely, for the most part.</span> <span id="s1508">It was hard.</span> <span id="s1509">I had missed my folks, you know, a family, although there was continuous communication, letters, and gifts, and all sorts of things sent back and forth.</span> <span id="s1510">It was still not here, so everything I had to do as a person, and as a wife, and as a mother, I had to figure it out, and do it myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">Q: In -- in sort of creating -- composing a life for yourself, what do you think was the hardest?</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A: Loneliness.</span> <span id="s1513">Just having to do everything by myself.</span> <span id="s1514">But also, knowing that I could manage it, I could struggle, but I could do it, and that’s rewarding to know, that I have succeeded in doing that.</span> <span id="s1515">I mean, I went to school here, I went -- I got my Master’s degree, I got a job.</span> <span id="s1516">I got a job in New York, as I was starting in International Social Service, when I was barely here, in the United States, so I -- you know, nobody shown me what to do, or how to do it, I -- I just had the motivation to -- to do it.</span> <span id="s1517">I was very lucky, because I think many times things fell on my lap, like this job at the International Social Service, it fitted me like a glove.</span> <span id="s1518">It was very familiar territory for me, working with adoptive cases from Greece.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Paulette Nehama.</span> <span id="s1521">This is tape number four, side A. We’re talking about the challenges you overcame.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1523">There were many, many challenges.</span> <span id="s1524">But I wanted to have a full life, and I wanted my children to have a full life.</span> <span id="s1525">And I was constantly trying to fi -- find ways to -- to learn.</span> <span id="s1526">I’m also in a great profession, that I can go into seminars -- I’m a social worker, I have a Master’s degree, and, you know, go into seminars and talking about different issues, it was great -- great for me, because I could s -- find out, and work on things that were concerning me in many ways.</span> <span id="s1527">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">Q: Now, Isaac would have been very engrossed in his work, which was fascinating work, but it would mean he’d have less time to be supportive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">A: That is true.</span> <span id="s1530">He also traveled a lot during the years he worked for the Apollo project.</span> <span id="s1531">He was traveling practically three days out of the five.</span> <span id="s1532">So that was fine, it was a very intense program for him, very exciting problem for him, but there wasn’t -- and there wasn’t that much time available for -- for doing things, although he did try to help.</span> <span id="s1533">Later on he would drive Nicole to piano lessons, or things like that.</span> <span id="s1534">But I think I was doing most of -- of the work in the house, and the responsibility with children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">Q: Did you set out with clear ideas of how you wanted the children, the girls to be brought up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">A: You never have a clear ideas when you are not a mother.</span> <span id="s1537">So you go with the flow.</span> <span id="s1538">I wanted my children to be whole people, not to be one sided, just geniuses, and educated, and scholars, but lacking in human -- human affairs, let’s say, and compassion, and things like that.</span> <span id="s1539">So I wanted them to be capable, responsible for themselves, autonomous.</span> <span id="s1540">At the time they were supposed to be autonomous.</span> <span id="s1541">And to have connections, not to be alone, because I was so alone, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">Q: What about wanting to give them some religious upbringing?</span> <span id="s1543">Was that important to you, going to synagogue, and teaching them about their faith?</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: I was conflicted at the time.</span> <span id="s1545">You see, when I came out of the Holocaust, I was sort of afraid to be identified as Jewish, and to -- for people to think that I was Jewish, I wasn’t sure how it would play, so out of my own anxiety, I didn’t really pursue for them to go -- for us to be members of a synagogue, or to be identified with Jewish causes at the time.</span> <span id="s1546">Now I regret that.</span> <span id="s1547">I hoped -- o-or I wished that things were different, and my attitude would have been different.</span> <span id="s1548">And -- but it’s a little too late, I mean, for me anyway, to teach them.</span> <span id="s1549">But certainly they did get some religious things from -- celebrating the holidays here, the high holidays, and things like that.</span> <span id="s1550">On high holidays we would go to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s1551">But I don’t think it was enough, I really don’t.</span> <span id="s1552">But I had a real fear at the time, of being identified a Jew, although I knew it was almost like being a kryptal Jew, because I would never deny that I was Jewish, or -- or I was married to a Jew, but there was a lot of anxiety about that, until I finally realized the Nazis are gone, you know, you have nothing to be afraid of at this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">Q: Can you think of any anecdote that explains that?</span> <span id="s1554">Th-That illustrates your concern?</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">A: Yeah, my daughter Maya was a swimmer, and she used to belong to the swimming team -- swim team of the Jewish social -- I’m sorry, Jewish Community Center in Rockville, in Maryland.</span> <span id="s1556">So she used to practice on a regular basis, and also they had races, like they had events, they would go to other Jewish centers for -- to compete.</span> <span id="s1557">So every time there was a race, the -- they would get a badge, and it was be sewn in the back of their jacket, or their sleeves, or t -- Maya had quite a few things on her jacket, and she was very proud of it, and I was very proud of her, because she was a good swimmer.</span> <span id="s1558">And I remember once, after I had sewn a badge on her -- most of these badges would say Jewish Federation, or Jewish this, or Jewish that.</span> <span id="s1559">They had the Star of David.</span> <span id="s1560">So they were definitely very Jewish badges.</span> <span id="s1561">She was going to go out with a friend to the mall to buy a present for another friend who had a birthday.</span> <span id="s1562">So the mother of the other friend was going to drive them there, and pick them up.</span> <span id="s1563">And it was a cool day, and Maya is ready to go, the car is waiting in my driveway, and she’s wearing this jacket.</span> <span id="s1564">And I said to her, “Maya, you cannot wear this jacket.”</span> <span id="s1565">It was full of badges.</span> <span id="s1566">And she said, “Why?</span> <span id="s1567">It’s cold out.”</span> <span id="s1568">I said, “No, Maya, you have to put a different jacket.”</span> <span id="s1569">And I literally sta -- stood in front of the door, because I wanted her to go change her jacket.</span> <span id="s1570">My feeling was that how can she go to a public place, and be seen as being a Jew?</span> <span id="s1571">I had this feeling that she would be lynched, that people will say horrible things, that people will do harm to her.</span> <span id="s1572">And that was unbearable to me, that my child will be hurt because she was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1573">But basically, what that was saying is, I was Jewish, and I was hurt because of that, when I was a kid.</span> <span id="s1574">So that was very difficult.</span> <span id="s1575">Of course, once I realized what I was doing, I let her go.</span> <span id="s1576">But she could not understand it at the time.</span> <span id="s1577">I explained to her later, when she came back.</span> <span id="s1578">But I remember s -- having this fear.</span> <span id="s1579">I actually saw her being hurt.</span> <span id="s1580">And that was unbearable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">Q: Had you experienced any anti-Semitism that led up to that?</span> <span id="s1582">Or -- I -- I understand that may -- essentially it was a scar from your wartime experience, but I wondered if you’d experienced any anti-Semitism in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">A: In the United States, no.</span> <span id="s1584">I have not.</span> <span id="s1585">In Greece, when I was in school, sometimes kids would tell me I crucified Christ, and I didn’t have a recollection of doing that.</span> <span id="s1586">So, I -- I would tell my mother that that’s what they told me, and she -- she would say, “Well, don’t listen to people like that,” you know, “people will say bad things about Jewish people, but it’s not true.”</span> <span id="s1587">No, basically I didn’t, but it was primarily of what I’ve heard, what I’ve read, that had caused me to -- to think in those terms.</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">Q: And when you were responsible for bringing your daughters up, did you talk a lot about your own wartime experiences, going in hiding and so on, or did you feel it was hard to discuss such things?</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">A: I didn’t talk much about it.</span> <span id="s1590">I -- it was hard for me.</span> <span id="s1591">It was much, much later that became comfortable talking about it.</span> <span id="s1592">It was something I -- I knew had to happen, but I had to move on.</span> <span id="s1593">And there were so many painful situations that I didn’t think I wanted to tell my children when they were young.</span> <span id="s1594">Course, now they are older, so it’s a different story.</span> <span id="s1595">But when I think about my grandchildren, I think, you know, how at the age of six or seven or eight, they can hear these stories.</span> <span id="s1596">Of course, you have to modify -- fy them a little bit.</span> <span id="s1597">I was talking with my grandson Max, who is six, and he was coming here because Isaac was being honored by the Holocaust Museum to light a candle.</span> <span id="s1598">One of the six candles for Day of Remembrance at the rotunda at the U.S. capital, on je -- what was it?</span> <span id="s1599">April 30th, 2003.</span> <span id="s1600">So Max and his mother came.</span> <span id="s1601">The others were too young, the other little boys.</span> <span id="s1602">And Ian and Maya came.</span> <span id="s1603">And I was asking Max why is he here, what -- what he’s going to see or hear, or why did he come.</span> <span id="s1604">And he said to me, “Well, because I know that Grandpa was with the partisans, and he had a gun, and he fought the Nazis, and I know that you were hiding in an attic.”</span> <span id="s1605">Now how did he get the attic I’m not sure, but -- because I was never in an attic.</span> <span id="s1606">I was in small rooms, but not in an attic.</span> <span id="s1607">“And -- and some people really hid you, and you couldn’t go out, you couldn’t go to school, and that must have been real nice.”</span> <span id="s1608">He really liked the fact I didn’t go to school.</span> <span id="s1609">So, I mean he is six, so -- I mean, he could absorb some of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">Q: Now, I’m guessing that you’re much more sensitive than -- than many others to any kind of prejudice or injustice.</span> <span id="s1613">D -- when you came, do you re -- do you have memories of thinking about the racial situation in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">A: [indecipherable] even when I was in Greece, I would read things, and I like poems that were written by ba -- black people.</span> <span id="s1615">One of the poems was, but I am black, but oh my heart is white.</span> <span id="s1616">And a -- I was always fascinated by -- by that, how people put such values on people they don’t know, or put such -- they’re so prejudiced about things they don’t know.</span> <span id="s1617">And people are people, you know.</span> <span id="s1618">They’re just good people, and bad people, and not so good people.</span> <span id="s1619">But it has nothing to do with color, or religion, or the shape of your eyes, or your skin color, or your hair color, or anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">Q: Did you become an American?</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">Q: And did you have a naturalization --</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1624">I became an American because I wanted to vote in the elections of -- when was it.</span> <span id="s1625">He was Goldberg -- who was it?</span> <span id="s1626">Humphrey, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">A: Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">Q: Hubert Humphrey.</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">A: Hubert Humphrey, I wanted to vote for Hubert Humphrey.</span> <span id="s1631">Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s1632">And Sarah came to the ceremony.</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">Q: Was that very moving?</span> <span id="s1634">What were your feelings?</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">A: I had mixed feelings, I must say, because part of the oath is that it tells you you have to abandon your country, and I still felt very Greek.</span> <span id="s1636">So I wasn’t quite ready to abandon my country, but I did not -- I did want to become an American.</span> <span id="s1637">So, for awhile I struggled with that, and s -- once, Isaac -- somebody -- we were at the gathering, and somebody said to me, “Paulette, where is home?”</span> <span id="s1638">And I said -- without even thinking, I said Greece.</span> <span id="s1639">And Isaac looked at me, and he said, “I can’t believe you.</span> <span id="s1640">Greece is home?</span> <span id="s1641">You live here.</span> <span id="s1642">You’ve been living here for 20 odd years.”</span> <span id="s1643">And it was -- it was strange for me that he would get angry with me for feeling that way.</span> <span id="s1644">But I think it was the fact that, you know, I had lived there, I had made connections there.</span> <span id="s1645">I spent my childhood there.</span> <span id="s1646">Now that I have grandchildren however, and I have roots here, I feel differently.</span> <span id="s1647">I feel now I belong here.</span> <span id="s1648">And it’s strange, but I still love Greece.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">Q: Do y -- it’s not possible to be a dual national?</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">A: I suppose it is, if you don’t serve in the army, or something like this.</span> <span id="s1651">But I don’t see, you know, what’s the purpose.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">Q: Besides, my question was cause I wondered if you found it deeply moving to become an American, and in fact, tell me what that means to you now, now that you have grandsons, and roots.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">A: Oh, I think it’s wonderful.</span> <span id="s1654">It’s -- it’s a wonderful country.</span> <span id="s1655">I think the freedoms you find in this country, you don’t find them anywhere in the world.</span> <span id="s1656">The fact that the place is so diverse also is -- to me, it’s very interesting, and very nice.</span> <span id="s1657">But it’s mostly the personal freedom, of being able to say you’re Jewish for instance, you know, which sometimes I couldn’t say it in Greece, although there were no people to hurt me, you know, this kind of thing.</span> <span id="s1658">Or to do things.</span> <span id="s1659">Sometimes we take this freedom a little too far, I think, but there’s no other country, I think, that’s -- freedom is the most wonderful thing to have, and you can find it here.</span> <span id="s1660">Also there’s another thing.</span> <span id="s1661">You have opportunities in this country, and if you are willing to work hard, you can do things.</span> <span id="s1662">Like for instance, I went to get my Master’s degree when I was 49 years old.</span> <span id="s1663">And I remember discussing this with a friend, and I said, “Well, you know, I have grown-up children, they’ll be going to college pretty soon.</span> <span id="s1664">I’m 49.</span> <span id="s1665">I don’t know if I can manage to -- to go get a Master’s degree, and he said -- she said to me, “Paulette, if you want to get a Master’s degree, go get a Master’s degree.</span> <span id="s1666">You’re going to be 49 whether you get it or not.”</span> <span id="s1667">And I never forgot that.</span> <span id="s1668">And I thought, if I lived in Greece, and I was 49, there wouldn’t have been a place for me to go and get a degree, even if I wanted to.</span> <span id="s1669">Even when I was talking to my friends in Greece, and I would tell them I’m going to college to get a Master’s degree, they would think I was sort of well, maybe she’s a little cuckoo at this late age, you know.</span> <span id="s1670">And to me this was wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">Q: Where did you go to get it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">A: I went to Catholic University in Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">Q: Now, when it was the time of your daughters to decide on careers, and pursue sort of advanced education, what do you think they gained from you?</span> <span id="s1674">You -- you know, even in going back to school at 49, you were something of a role model, I would think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">A: Yeah, I’m sure that that was important in their lives, you know.</span> <span id="s1676">Actually, Maya and I graduated the same year.</span> <span id="s1677">It was funny to have graduations within a couple of weeks apart.</span> <span id="s1678">You know, I’m going to school, my mother is -- is studying for exams, I can’t talk to you now.</span> <span id="s1679">Yeah, I think it was a role model, but I think they were -- they would have gone to school anyway, because they were motivated, all of them, and they wanted to go to college, and have a career.</span> <span id="s1680">So I don’t think it was the only model they had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">Q: Were you ever affected by the feminist movement?</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1683">I was affected by the feminist movement, but this is a traditional household, so a lot of the things that were going on were not totally, totally accepted.</span> <span id="s1684">I wanted my daughters to be women who could decide for themselves, who would have a voice, whether it was in a job, in a marriage, or in wherever.</span> <span id="s1685">I wanted them to be treated equally with men, not to be discriminated upon.</span> <span id="s1686">I wanted more for them than I wanted for me from the women’s movement.</span> <span id="s1687">And I think they are pretty much with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">Q: Do you think they see themselves as children of survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">A: I know Nicole thinks so, and probably the others do too.</span> <span id="s1690">There were times that this was difficult for them, because I remember when there were occasions that -- for instance, holidays were difficult in this family, because holidays is something that you have everybody around, and not everybody was around.</span> <span id="s1691">So it was always a feeling of loss, not necessarily, you know, a joyous holiday.</span> <span id="s1692">Things are mixed bags, often.</span> <span id="s1693">So I remember once, one of my daughters said, because I was trying to explain that, you know, both Isaac and I had difficult life, and she said, “Oh Mom, I’m so tired of -- of that.</span> <span id="s1694">Let’s have the holiday and enjoy it,” or whatever, you know, like okay, you had it, but why about us?</span> <span id="s1695">So I think she was -- I -- I forget which daughter it was, but I think, you know, to a certain degree they tolerated the difficulties, because they were part of the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1696">I don’t know that they’re -- I think Nicole is more closer to that than the others.</span> <span id="s1697">Sarah is too.</span> <span id="s1698">Well yeah, I think she is.</span> <span id="s1699">She knows the difficulties up to a certain point, but then she chooses not to linger on those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">Q: Why do you think Nicole is more affected?</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">A: Well, I think she stayed in this house longer, probably.</span> <span id="s1702">She is married to a Jewish person.</span> <span id="s1703">She has children, and -- boys, and she wants them to be Bar Mitzvahed, and for them to know about our lives, a lot.</span> <span id="s1704">And maybe the fact that she went to a Jewish camp, day camp, may have had something to do.</span> <span id="s1705">So, who knows?</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">Q: When you spoke of that holidays being difficult, not everyone was here, course your family was not here because of the -- you separated fro-from -- by, you know, vast distances.</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">A: Ocean.</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">Q: And of course, Isaac lost his -- his mother, so their -- a grandmother had died at Auschwitz, and their uncle Nehama.</span> <span id="s1709">Is that what you’re thinking of, the -- the actual, you know, family members lost?</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1711">Mostly family members.</span> <span id="s1712">But you see, in the past, when there was a holiday, all the family members will gather around, s-some relatives would come.</span> <span id="s1713">So it was a Bible kind of thing.</span> <span id="s1714">This time, I mean, you go through the motions sometimes, but you feel the lack of these people.</span> <span id="s1715">And Passover is a difficult time.</span> <span id="s1716">Isaac often reads the Haggadah from his father’s Haggadah, which is in Ladeeno.</span> <span id="s1717">Has both Hebrew, Ladeeno, and Greek.</span> <span id="s1718">So he reads passages that he remembers his father read on Passover.</span> <span id="s1719">And every time he reads them, you know, I get a chill in my back.</span> <span id="s1720">It just -- just, you know, brings tears to my eyes.</span> <span id="s1721">And I remember my father reading -- not Ladeeno, but you know, presiding over the Seder, and I know the last time I saw him it was Passover, because he was sick, and I had gone to Greece, I had taken Nicole with me, who was about three.</span> <span id="s1722">Sh -- he had not seen her -- grandchild.</span> <span id="s1723">So I took her with me.</span> <span id="s1724">And he was quite sick, but he sat at the Seder.</span> <span id="s1725">And I knew it was the last time I would see him.</span> <span id="s1726">He died shortly after.</span> <span id="s1727">He died in October of 1970.</span> <span id="s1728">And -- but his [indecipherable] he -- he was dress up, he put his clean, nice, press shirt.</span> <span id="s1729">You know, he was very presentable.</span> <span id="s1730">And [indecipherable] and my sister was there, her husband, and Maurice, my nephew.</span> <span id="s1731">So you miss these people, who were much a part of your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">Q: And the essence of those holidays, I guess your daughters are right, is the -- the family gathering.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">Q: And your -- and it’s not there.</span> <span id="s1735">I interviewed someone called Susie Schwartz, and she spoke of the -- her wish that there’d -- were another grou -- term for survivor, just because she -- she felt that she had been in hiding in a farm building in Holland, and her problem was simply with the fact that the -- the common stereotype, or presumption is that survivors survived Auschwitz, when in fact there are many different --</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">Q: -- shades and grades of suffering, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">A: That is true.</span> <span id="s1739">I mean, for a long time, I did not consider myself a survivor.</span> <span id="s1740">I consider myself that I lived through the war.</span> <span id="s1741">And the Holocaust, and the hiding was part of the war.</span> <span id="s1742">I remember I attended a workshop once in one of the conferences.</span> <span id="s1743">It was the American [indecipherable] Psychiatric Association to which I belonged.</span> <span id="s1744">And there was something on -- about survivors of the Holocaust, and I attended that, and the first thing I said is, can we make a distinction, who is a survivor?</span> <span id="s1745">Because they were talking -- I mean, it was very blurred to me, who is a survivor, and who is not?</span> <span id="s1746">So they said everybody who survived both the camps, and the war, and the hidden children, everybody was -- they lumped them all together.</span> <span id="s1747">And to that day, I never thought I was a survivor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">Q: But you think differently now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">A: Yes I do.</span> <span id="s1750">Yes, I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">Q: And it may be that with -- I don’t know whether you have any thoughts about how -- when you have reflected more.</span> <span id="s1752">You may feel differently.</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">A: Well, you see, the word survivor implies to a certain degree that you were a victim.</span> <span id="s1754">And I don’t like to feel victimized, but I was victimized, and so was my family, and Isaac’s family, and a lot of other people.</span> <span id="s1755">So it’s not an approp -- an inappropriate word to use.</span> <span id="s1756">But I don’t like the label of being victimized, because that kind of sets you in a mold, and in a pattern, that sometimes you can’t come out of it, and I don’t want that to happen.</span> <span id="s1757">In other words, I survived, I made it, I’m healthy, both physically and mentally.</span> <span id="s1758">And here I am.</span> <span id="s1759">I’ll be 70 years old in September.</span> <span id="s1760">It’s not a small achievement, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">Q: And you have a wonderful family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">A: Yeah, got a great family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">Q: But -- but what are the special -- out of your experiences, what would you have other Americans learn from what you have seen and experienced?</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">A: Well, I like people to -- to know that things like that can happen if we let governments, dictators, crazy people, do all sorts of things, and we do not do something about it.</span> <span id="s1765">That’s -- we -- the world belongs to everybody, and people are responsible for the world, and I think that we have a responsibility to -- to speak out, and not to let things happen, and to do our part.</span> <span id="s1766">I don’t know, maybe that’s a little -- but I do feel that, you know, I mean I want my friends to know that my life was different from theirs in many ways, and I think the ones who do know, respect it very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">End of Tape Four, Side A Beginning Tape Four, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">Q: -- of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Paulette Nehama.</span> <span id="s1769">This is tape number four, side B. I’m jumping to a new question, do you think that you were much more protective of your daughters because of your own experiences?</span> <span id="s1770">I mean, you mentioned that one incident with -- with the jacket, but I wondered if you were more fearful in -- in other ways, and in general?</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">A: I probably was, and I was aware of it.</span> <span id="s1772">So I tried not to inflict this on my daughters, because I didn’t want them to become fearful people.</span> <span id="s1773">And -- but I did have a lot of anxiety about it, their safety, a lot of it.</span> <span id="s1774">I just wanted to make sure that they were just okay.</span> <span id="s1775">Well, more than okay, actually.</span> <span id="s1776">So, I remember Maya had got a new job, a summer job in one of the ice cream stores.</span> <span id="s1777">I think it was called Swensen.</span> <span id="s1778">It was in Bethesda, an ice cream parlor, so she was a waitress there.</span> <span id="s1779">And she would come -- I mean, the -- the job -- the store closed at 12, they had to clean up, and I guess she would come home one or 1:30.</span> <span id="s1780">And I remember saying that I didn’t feel this was time for a young girl, driving by herself.</span> <span id="s1781">And Isaac, who is very reasonable at times, tries to put reason to everything, tried to convince me that, you know, it didn’t make any difference whether she came home at 12 or at 10, or at nine, because, he said, “She’s going to be in the car.</span> <span id="s1782">What difference does it make what time she comes home?”</span> <span id="s1783">And I said, “Well, what if she has a flat tire?</span> <span id="s1784">Where is she gonna find help at 12 o’clock at night?</span> <span id="s1785">You don’t know what can happen.”</span> <span id="s1786">But he said, “That can happen at nine o’clock as well.”</span> <span id="s1787">You know, this kind of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">Q: Now, were you -- were you mostly in agreement about disciplining the girls, and other child rearing practices, or did you have strong disagreements?</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">A: We had some disagreements.</span> <span id="s1790">Isaac was very strict, I was more lenient.</span> <span id="s1791">And that created some difficulty there.</span> <span id="s1792">But it all turned out good, finally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">Q: It takes awhile before you -- you can see, I’m sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">Q: Now, one thing we didn’t talk about was the family in Greece that sheltered you, provided a haven, and your maintaining ties with them, the Pavellas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">Q: How closely have you kept in touch, and did that go on constantly, or has there been a -- a reunion and a visit in recent times?</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">A: Well, for awhile after the war, we saw them periodically, like a couple of times a year, maybe more.</span> <span id="s1799">Then we saw them less often, I think, because they moved.</span> <span id="s1800">And then I came to the United States, so I had no idea where they were, and there was no other contact.</span> <span id="s1801">But I did find out through a friend with whom I was talking about the Holocaust one day when I was first in Greece, and I -- I gave her the -- I told her -- she asked me where did I hide, and with whom, so I told her the family was Pavella.</span> <span id="s1802">And that was about it.</span> <span id="s1803">Then the next day I get a call from this friend.</span> <span id="s1804">She said to me, “I didn’t want to tell you yesterday, but you’re going to receive a telephone call from Many Pavella.”</span> <span id="s1805">I said, “What?”</span> <span id="s1806">She said, “I didn’t want to tell you yesterday, because I wasn’t sure it was her, but I know the woman.</span> <span id="s1807">We work together.”</span> <span id="s1808">And she apparently called her, and ask her if they were hiding a family by the name of Moudzoukos.</span> <span id="s1809">And she said, “Yes, we were hiding them.”</span> <span id="s1810">And she said, “Do you remember Paulette?”</span> <span id="s1811">And she said, “Paulette, Paulette?</span> <span id="s1812">No, that was Paulexani.”</span> <span id="s1813">That was my name, my false name.</span> <span id="s1814">And anyway, she was very excited that I was in Greece, and wanted to talk to me, and see me.</span> <span id="s1815">But my friend, you see, didn’t want to disappoint me if this didn’t pan out, if -- you know, it wasn’t the same person.</span> <span id="s1816">And so the next day I got a call from Many, who was just ecstatic, she was very happy.</span> <span id="s1817">She wanted to see me, and she wants me to go to the house.</span> <span id="s1818">Unfortunately she was leaving for -- she was going to be out of the country, and by the time she would have returned, I was leaving for the United States.</span> <span id="s1819">But we kept in touch by corresponding, I sent her pictures.</span> <span id="s1820">And then the next year I went to Greece, my sister and I went to visit her.</span> <span id="s1821">We got in touch with them, and we visited them.</span> <span id="s1822">And then in ’97, I believe, or ’98, Many came to the United States.</span> <span id="s1823">She apparently studied in the United States, and I had no idea she was in this country, she went to Purdue University, and I had no idea where she was.</span> <span id="s1824">And anyway, she was being honored by Purdue, so then she decided to make a tour around the United States, and see some of her friends, and when she found out we lived in Washington, of course I insisted that she comes and stays with us.</span> <span id="s1825">So she came and stayed for a few days.</span> <span id="s1826">And it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s1827">We remembered all the past stories, and you know, our parents and everything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">Q: Do they -- did you learn new stories from them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">A: Actually, not too many new stories.</span> <span id="s1830">What I wanted to know from her is what it was like for them to hide us, and what it meant to them.</span> <span id="s1831">And that’s what I got mostly.</span> <span id="s1832">But she was the only one who knew we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1833">The children, the other two, Booly and Dimitris did not, because of their age.</span> <span id="s1834">So she was worried, of course, about you know, when we left in such a hurry.</span> <span id="s1835">And they were told that we went with some relatives or something, not clear answers, you know.</span> <span id="s1836">So there were so many questions, because you wouldn’t get straight answers from adults.</span> <span id="s1837">I think at my age anyway, and the younger a -- the younger children, Booly and -- and Dimitris’s age.</span> <span id="s1838">Because I think people were afraid that, you know, children go to school, talk -- I mean they went to school, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1839">They talk to friends, if a friend repeats something like this to a parent, and the parent is suspicious, and then, you know how it goes.</span> <span id="s1840">I mean, you had to be careful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">Q: Well, children might place the families at risk in their sort of innocence of the dangers, but you also suggest that for you as a child, not knowing may have heightened your anxiety.</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">A: Yeah, absolutely.</span> <span id="s1843">Even to this day, when I don’t know something I get very anxious, extremely anxious.</span> <span id="s1844">Knowing is power, you know.</span> <span id="s1845">So I remember some years ago, I had cancer, and when I heard the diagnosis, it was devastating.</span> <span id="s1846">And then when I pulled myself together, well the doctor explained to me I wasn’t going to die from it, I got all the information I could possibly get.</span> <span id="s1847">And I couldn’t stop reading books about cancer.</span> <span id="s1848">That was all I read, because the more I got, the better it was for me to ease my anxiety, although some of these books were telling you just horror stories about all what can happen, and it may have not been my situation, but you know, predicting that if this is this, that’s what happens.</span> <span id="s1849">So Isaac said to me, “I will forbid you reading another book about cancer.”</span> <span id="s1850">He had it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">Q: But in fact it was what empowered you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">A: Yeah, it did.</span> <span id="s1853">That’s what helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">Q: You know, I’m going back to your -- your role as a grandmother now, and your feeling that you want grandchildren to know about your lives.</span> <span id="s1855">But a -- have you thought also of what it seems they should know about your family’s history in Volos, and the -- the contribution that Jews made to the life of Greece over many centuries.</span> <span id="s1856">I mean, will that be part of your -- I mean there’s -- would seem there’s a proud heritage that was brought to a somewhat -- you know, a-abrupt and difficult stage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1858">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1859">I think that children should know, because this is part of their heritage, as you said.</span> <span id="s1860">And I think when people know their roots, and they know their own life, about -- I mean, they know about their parents, their grandparents, and if they know further than that, and about their communities, they are better -- they have roots.</span> <span id="s1861">They have better rooting, I -- as they call it, which I think helps them as human beings, because they feel connected.</span> <span id="s1862">You know, they feel the connection there from way back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">Q: You and Isaac had many commonalities in building a successful marriage.</span> <span id="s1864">Did you have any reservations when one of your daughters married somebody who was not Jewish, and m-maybe had -- you mentioned a British son-in-law.</span> <span id="s1865">Di-did that give you cause for concern, or really -- or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">A: A little bit.</span> <span id="s1867">At the beginning I was a little concerned, but I liked the man so much, and I thought he was such a good s -- man for my daughter, that this should not be an obstacle, if, you know, everybody was willing to cooperate in that factor.</span> <span id="s1868">And I remember -- so they had a dual ceremony.</span> <span id="s1869">It was at sen -- what’s it called?</span> <span id="s1870">Saint Columbus Episcopal -- Episcopal church.</span> <span id="s1871">But there was a rabbi present, so the two, the rabbi, and the priest -- priest, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">A: Both had a part of the ceremony, and I was reminding to my daughter that nobody trying to outdo the other.</span> <span id="s1874">They were very equal in their thing, and it was really a wonderful thing to have that, because it honored both families.</span> <span id="s1875">And obviously David’s family, you know, felt that there should be an Episcopalian marriage, and we felt that it should be a Jewish wedding, but we didn’t want this thing to become a -- a problem for them.</span> <span id="s1876">So they handled it very nicely, very nicely.</span> <span id="s1877">But I remember passing that church often, and saying to myself, how would I feel when my daughter gets married here?</span> <span id="s1878">And then I decided that I had to visit the church.</span> <span id="s1879">I had to go inside, and sit inside, and get the feel of it before the wedding.</span> <span id="s1880">Because I didn’t want to be breaking down on the day of the wedding.</span> <span id="s1881">And I did that a couple of times.</span> <span id="s1882">I went and sat.</span> <span id="s1883">And I became very comfortable.</span> <span id="s1884">It was fine.</span> <span id="s1885">And this is a very good marriage for them.</span> <span id="s1886">He is a wonderful guy, great husband, wonderful father.</span> <span id="s1887">So I have no reservations whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1888">And I remember, i-it was the first year they were married, and it was Christmas, and they were coming here, and Maya said, “Can we have a turkey?”</span> <span id="s1889">Because Christmas was always such a big thing for David.</span> <span id="s1890">You know, it was the first time he was away from his family, to a new country.</span> <span id="s1891">I mean, things were difficult for him as well, and I imi -- immediately, you know, empathized with him, because I came from a different country, and I was in a different place, no ma -- no matter how much you love your spouse, it’s still something you miss.</span> <span id="s1892">And of course I made the turkey, and -- and he was so happy.</span> <span id="s1893">He is a great guy.</span> <span id="s1894">And my other fellow, my Mike, Nicole’s husband.</span> <span id="s1895">Nicole’s si -- Mike is Jewish.</span> <span id="s1896">He is terrific.</span> <span id="s1897">His parents had -- live in Evanston, in Illinois.</span> <span id="s1898">He is from shi -- from there, too.</span> <span id="s1899">He grew up there, went to the same school Nicole did in Wisconsin, University of Wisconsin.</span> <span id="s1900">He is terrific.</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">Q: Well, we’d be remiss now if we didn’t mention Sarah’s recent marriage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1902">A: Sarah’s, yeah.</span> <span id="s1903">Sarah’s also -- she is not married to a Jewish fellow.</span> <span id="s1904">I’m not quite sure yet about this relationship.</span> <span id="s1905">It’s very recent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1907">Now, let me just finish up by asking about looking back, what do you feel are your greatest sorrows, sadness?</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">A: Now you make me cry.</span> <span id="s1909">There was a time that was very hard for me here.</span> <span id="s1910">Raising children, Isaac was working very hard, felt kind of isolated, although I did have friends.</span> <span id="s1911">And I had missed Greece.</span> <span id="s1912">I missed the blue skies, and the blue sea.</span> <span id="s1913">And I missed my family.</span> <span id="s1914">The great sorrow was my mother’s death, my father’s death.</span> <span id="s1915">And certainly, having gone through the Holocaust is a great loss, but it’s also a strength that you gain as a child, or as an adult, because you went through horrible things, and you know that you can survive things.</span> <span id="s1916">You can live through many difficulties.</span> <span id="s1917">And I’m a very patient person, and persevere.</span> <span id="s1918">But life is worth living.</span> <span id="s1919">Life is wonderful.</span> <span id="s1920">No matter what happens to you, there must be something in your life that is good about your life.</span> <span id="s1921">Life is precious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">Q: And then the greatest joys?</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">A: The greatest joys are my grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1924">I mean, they’re -- I can’t tell you how wonderful it is to have them.</span> <span id="s1925">And what an addition to my life and Isaac’s life has been.</span> <span id="s1926">I have to tell you about Ian.</span> <span id="s1927">When Maya announced that she -- Maya and David came here, and they told us they were expecting a baby, I was sitting on this chair, and I jumped up to the ceiling from joy.</span> <span id="s1928">I was so happy.</span> <span id="s1929">The next day, I was diagnosed with cancer.</span> <span id="s1930">And it seemed to me like why now?</span> <span id="s1931">Here I am in heaven.</span> <span id="s1932">I’m so happy, I’m going to have a grandchild, my first one.</span> <span id="s1933">Why am I gonna have cancer now?</span> <span id="s1934">I mean, I could have had it last year, two years ago, five years ago.</span> <span id="s1935">Why now?</span> <span id="s1936">It was just terrible.</span> <span id="s1937">But then, after the shock, I decided that I had to lead beca -- to live because I wanted to see that -- that grandchild.</span> <span id="s1938">And I wanted to see Maya go through her pregnancy and be there for her.</span> <span id="s1939">Nobody was there for me when I was pregnant, or when I had children.</span> <span id="s1940">I wanted to be there for her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">Q: It’s a good way to close.</span> <span id="s1942">I want -- want to thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1943">A: You’re welcome.</span> <span id="s1944">I thank you, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">Q: So Ian helped you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">A: So, I didn’t know it was Ian.</span> <span id="s1947">We didn’t know it was going to be a boy, and it was going to be a -- but, I was thinking of this grandchild constantly, and I wanted to be well, both for my daughter, and my grandson.</span> <span id="s1948">And I remember Isaac said something very nice.</span> <span id="s1949">Shortly after the diagnosis, I said, “I don’t understand, why is this happening now, that I’m going to become a grandmother?</span> <span id="s1950">I want to live to see my grandchild.”</span> <span id="s1951">And he said, “You will live to see this grandchild, and many more to come.”</span> <span id="s1952">And that was such a nice thing to say.</span> <span id="s1953">I remember when I was doing -- I was in radiation therapy, and it was very close to Maya’s delivery, I would s -- asked the rad -- the -- the doctor there, the radiologist, “Can I take time off when my daughter has her baby?”</span> <span id="s1954">And for the moment she thought it was an out of town daughter, so she would say to me, “I can’t let you stop radiation.</span> <span id="s1955">It doesn’t work that way.</span> <span id="s1956">You have to be here every single day except the weekend.</span> <span id="s1957">If your daughter has the baby the weekend, you’re gonna be lucky.”</span> <span id="s1958">So finally I told her that my daughter lived here, and I had to be there.</span> <span id="s1959">And she said to me, “We will make every effort.</span> <span id="s1960">We will schedule you for six o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s1961">We will schedule you for 10 o’clock at night.</span> <span id="s1962">Whatever suits you, to help you out, so you can go see your grandchild.”</span> <span id="s1963">But he was born the day after I finished radiation.</span> <span id="s1964">I think he timed it very well.</span> <span id="s1965">I was free, I was happy.</span> <span id="s1966">I wasn’t radiating anything.</span> <span id="s1967">And it was just great, was the greatest day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">Q: Your -- were telling me about returning to Greece.</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1970">Now I return to Greece every year.</span> <span id="s1971">My sister lives there, and I have lots of friends, and a nephew, and now he is a father, and about to become a second time father.</span> <span id="s1972">So my friends date from the Girl Scout days, from high school.</span> <span id="s1973">And I have two wonderful teachers that are probably in their late 80’s or 90’s that I see.</span> <span id="s1974">And every time I see them, it’s such a warm reception.</span> <span id="s1975">Last year I was in Greece, and they invited me to have coffee at a little coffee shop, two of them and a -- another good friend, who was also in the same school I was, but she was also in the Girl Scouts with me.</span> <span id="s1976">So actually she’s the first one I call when I go to Greece.</span> <span id="s1977">And we were talking about all sorts of things, and then I said to them, “How do you remember me from my school days?”</span> <span id="s1978">You know, I was 15 - 16.</span> <span id="s1979">And it was such a warm feeling for them to talk about me, that they thought I was a very sensitive child.</span> <span id="s1980">I -- I had a lot of humanity, one of them said it.</span> <span id="s1981">And that this was very apparent.</span> <span id="s1982">They both knew I had survived the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1983">Although I wasn’t terribly good student, I was good student in some of the -- in their class I was a good student.</span> <span id="s1984">One taught -- taught history, and the other taught psychology.</span> <span id="s1985">So I was very good in both classes.</span> <span id="s1986">I wasn’t good in math.</span> <span id="s1987">So, I mean such encouragement that I was really a worthwhile person when I was there.</span> <span id="s1988">And I kind of needed that, to hear it, that what was then, what is now.</span> <span id="s1989">Because sometimes there’s such a big gap between this ocean.</span> <span id="s1990">And then the one who is a historian, she sent me a Christmas card, and she said how happy she was to see me in Greece, and that she always remembers me with great affection.</span> <span id="s1991">And that what she remembers is, here again, my humanity, and she wishes my grandchildren have some of that, and that’s the best wish she can give me, which I think it’s very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">Q: This interview continues on tape number five, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">End of Tape Four, Side B Beginning Tape Five, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Paulette Nehama, on July the eighth, 2003.</span> <span id="s1995">This is tape number five, side A.</span> <span id="s1996">We were talking about your humanity, and I wondered to what extent do you think that was innate, or whether you were -- you had a deeper understanding because of your suffering of difficulties when you were in hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1997">A: I think the sensitivity was there from the beginning, because I remember it was, even as a very young child, I was sensitive to other people.</span> <span id="s1998">My parents were very humane, both of them, so this is something I grew up with, and I saw it.</span> <span id="s1999">But certainly, living through the Holocaust, and hiding, and seeing how people suffer, and deprivation that was going around, whether it was food, or clothes, or lack of freedom, this thing certainly had a major role in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">Q: Tell me the kind of -- we -- we talked about this to some extent before, but are there any stories or vignettes that you can share about that time after September 1943, when you went into hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">A: Oh sure.</span> <span id="s2002">One thing I remember very well is I think I told you about jumping the fence to go play with the little girl next door.</span> <span id="s2003">Another vignette at that house -- that was the second house we were hiding, in Kipserly.</span> <span id="s2004">My sister and I were sharing a room, it was actually a big room, and was divided as I said, with a screen.</span> <span id="s2005">My parents were on one side, and my sister and I on the other.</span> <span id="s2006">My sister used to tell me about a boyfriend she had.</span> <span id="s2007">She was 10 years older, so she had a boyfriend, and she loved him dearly, and of course, she couldn’t see him.</span> <span id="s2008">And she was telling me how much she missed him, and these kind of things.</span> <span id="s2009">So one day I saw the corner, there was a -- a florist, somebody who was selling violets, actually, not a florist, he was selling violets.</span> <span id="s2010">So I had a little bit of money my father had given me just to keep it, just to -- to make me happy.</span> <span id="s2011">I couldn’t use it anyway, since I wasn’t going out, but once again I went out to the corner, and bought her a little bouquet of violets and brought them to her.</span> <span id="s2012">And to me this was something to tell her that don’t be so sad, you know, that here are some violets.</span> <span id="s2013">And I remember she was very, very happy about that.</span> <span id="s2014">She wasn’t happy I left the house to go and do these kind of things, but it was something I remember with great fondness.</span> <span id="s2015">Unfortunate, she doesn’t remember it now.</span> <span id="s2016">And that’s -- that’s a little sad for me.</span> <span id="s2017">But I remember thinking, how can I -- what can I do to make her happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">Q: What happened to the boyfriend?</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">A: Oh I think they got together after the -- after the war was over, but then it didn’t last very long.</span> <span id="s2020">I think he had another girl or something like that.</span> <span id="s2021">I don’t know the details, I don’t remember the details, but I don’t think it lasted very long.</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">Q: So flowers would be one of those things that -- one of the pleasures that you would not normally have, but what about food during those -- that time in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">A: Well, I don’t remember particularly being hungry, but I don’t remember having a variety of foods.</span> <span id="s2024">Vegetables were usually the main thing, once a week maybe meats, or maybe not.</span> <span id="s2025">Eggs occasionally.</span> <span id="s2026">Lots of legumes, lots of beans and chick peas, and things like that, which were basically the staple.</span> <span id="s2027">Now after the war was over, we had coupons, and we could only buy food with these coupons.</span> <span id="s2028">We had to go to the grocery store, and depending who -- the number of people in the family, they would give us a certain amount of food.</span> <span id="s2029">Among them, a powdered soup which we used to call American soup.</span> <span id="s2030">It was powdered soup that had dry -- I mean, dry vegetables in there, and I remember there was barley, because I liked these little things that looked like rice, but they were not rice.</span> <span id="s2031">And you would simply add water, and boil it, and cook it.</span> <span id="s2032">And this was basically her main thing for quite awhile.</span> <span id="s2033">Then other things we ate was Spam, also we could get it with a coupon, and what else?</span> <span id="s2034">Oh, we ate potatoes instead of bread, because we didn’t have bread.</span> <span id="s2035">So it was like a small potato per person, and the soup, and that was a meal.</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">Q: And did the soup come from the United States?</span> <span id="s2037">A: Yes, I think it did, that’s why we called it American soup, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">Q: And were potatoes part of the Greek diet, normally?</span> <span id="s2039">A: Oh yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s2040">Greeks eat potatoes, lots of potatoes.</span> <span id="s2041">But the sizes of the potatoes were small.</span> <span id="s2042">You couldn’t have two potatoes if you wanted to, because there was a ration, so [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">Q: And how long did that, the coupons, the rationing last after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2044">A: Well, almost immediately after the war, in December of ’44 was the civil war started.</span> <span id="s2045">So it went on for two, three months, at least in Athens, near the villages, and up north it certainly lasted much longer.</span> <span id="s2046">So for that period of time, it was -- I mean, food was scarce.</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">Q: If we go back to hiding, are there any other stories that come to mind?</span> <span id="s2048">Any other memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">A: The other memory which came actually a few days ago when I was driving.</span> <span id="s2050">It was something in the street, something like a trash bag, or something, which I couldn’t determine from -- from far what it was, but there was definitely something there, I was thinking I must avoid this.</span> <span id="s2051">I thought for a moment it may be an animal.</span> <span id="s2052">It -- it reminded me that when a German was shot by Greeks, there would be a roundup of the neighborhood, and they would take all the men above 60.</span> <span id="s2053">And I remember one day we her -- heard the shots, and we couldn’t determine what it was.</span> <span id="s2054">But we looked from the window, and at the intersection -- the -- the house was almost in the middle of the block, there was something in the middle of that intersection.</span> <span id="s2055">We couldn’t tell whether it was a person that had been shot, and it was there, or anything else.</span> <span id="s2056">And my sister offered to go and look.</span> <span id="s2057">And I remember my terror of having her go to look, and what if she were caught?</span> <span id="s2058">If the Germans were around there, and would catch her?</span> <span id="s2059">And to this day when I see something in the middle of the street that looks bigger than a little something, I always have this image in front of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">Q: Do you remember whether it was the body of a person?</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">A: It wasn’t a body, no.</span> <span id="s2062">It was some kind of trash, I think, that has been kicked in the middle of the street, of the intersection.</span> <span id="s2063">But I mean, the agony, because we knew what was coming next.</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">Q: And did -- did those -- w-were there often roundups of that kind because the Greeks retaliated against the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">Q: And what -- what did you know of the behavior of the German troops in Athens towards the Greeks.</span> <span id="s2067">I mean were they -- did they -- did they behave well, or were there all sorts of horrors committed by them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">A: Towards the Greeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">A: Well, I didn’t see the horrors, except occasionally when I saw a German kicking an old man outside my window.</span> <span id="s2071">But I knew that there were things going on.</span> <span id="s2072">At times my parents will talk, and they will ti -- try to protect me, or talk somewhat in code, so I wouldn’t understand, but I could figure things out, and put things together, sometimes with great imagination, but personally, I mean, I didn’t see any other horrors, other than what I heard.</span> <span id="s2073">But, I mean, the Germans, everybody was afraid of them, because they knew that from one moment to the other, they would wrap things up and take people away, and off they go.</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">Q: Were there stories that your sister would share with you, or did she protect you as your parents did?</span></p> <p><span id="s2075">A: Oh yeah, I think they all protected me.</span> <span id="s2076">I was an overprotected child.</span> <span id="s2077">They all protected me, and in turn, I think I -- I was trying to -- to protect my parents and my sister by not complaining, not whining, not -- not asking for things I knew I couldn’t have.</span> <span id="s2078">So I was trying to -- to be rather quiet about things, because I knew they were upset to begin with.</span> <span id="s2079">I mean, I could tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s2080">Q: What was the impact of that on you, do you think that -- in your relationship, wa-was there any, particularly?</span></p> <p><span id="s2081">A: Well, I think my mother always was saying that I was -- I had a wonderful nature.</span> <span id="s2082">But I was very much -- I remember once there was the end of the war, it was right the days before that -- the end of the war.</span> <span id="s2083">We were still in hiding, but the atmosphere w-was such, because everybody was expecting something was going to happen.</span> <span id="s2084">I think the news we had heard, and the man of the house had come and was saying well, things are going to change in a day or two.</span> <span id="s2085">There were rumors.</span> <span id="s2086">All of a sudden we were sitting in the garden I remember, it was a -- a nice day, and I s -- I burst into tears, out of nothing.</span> <span id="s2087">I mean, I started car -- crying and sobbing, and nobody could understand what happened.</span> <span id="s2088">My mother thought a bee stung me, or you know, something happened.</span> <span id="s2089">And I just couldn’t stop crying.</span> <span id="s2090">So finally I remember the woman who was hiding us saying to my mother, “What happened to this child?</span> <span id="s2091">I mean, she never cries.”</span> <span id="s2092">And my mother said, “Well, maybe she has gone through a lot, and that’s as much as she can take.”</span> <span id="s2093">So -- but I was always keeping things inside, and not expressing too much.</span> <span id="s2094">First of all, I was told not to talk much, because they didn’t know to whom I was going to talk, and what I was going to say.</span> <span id="s2095">So this was instilled in me, and I understood it, that I shouldn’t talk much.</span> <span id="s2096">And this carried on, also, past my hiding years, because many times I remember I was always observant, but I wouldn’t talk much.</span> <span id="s2097">And people would say, well is she here, is she participating, or what?</span> <span id="s2098">So, it has carried to many, many years, yeah, even now sometimes.</span> <span id="s2099">I mean, I may be in a group of people, and I may have my own thoughts, but I’ll be the last one to express them.</span> <span id="s2100">If I’m asked specifically, I will.</span> <span id="s2101">But I wouldn’t jump in.</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">Q: You’d learned to be guarded?</span></p> <p><span id="s2103">A: Yeah, yes I did.</span> <span id="s2104">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">Q: Now, when you were in hiding, would there be any visits from old friends, or members of the Jewish community, or would it be very much an isolated time for your whole family?</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">A: The only time I remember somebody coming was the second house -- in the second house.</span> <span id="s2107">The person who had found that house for us, he was a -- a former general, but he -- he was retired, or maybe he was not, but anyway, he used to come periodically to see us.</span> <span id="s2108">And when the Germans came -- I mean, the Greek SS came to get my father, he was -- he who was -- it was my sister who notified him, and after they brought my father back, after he paid them handsomely, we went to his house.</span> <span id="s2109">He came and took us.</span> <span id="s2110">Again, he didn’t -- he took my father first, and then he took -- I don’t know if he came back for my mother, myself, and my sister, or if we went ourselves, but we went and spent a couple of nights there, so he could find another house for us to stay.</span> <span id="s2111">So he was the only one I remember visiting, nobody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">Q: I just wanted to make sure that we’ve got the order correct here.</span> <span id="s2113">So you -- you were -- these were the moves you had, you were in one place, and then when there was a threat, and your identities were at risk, you moved to the second place, and in between, you had the two weeks with the elderly gentleman, and his housekeeper?</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">Q: And it was really two main places of hiding, except --</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">A: There was a third one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2117">Q: Aha.</span> <span id="s2118">Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2119">A: Yeah, well after the second house, when the Greek SS were watching the house, and they burst in one day, saying they want the people to -- to measure the -- the gas, or something like that -- and got my father.</span> <span id="s2120">They brought him back several hours later after he paid them.</span> <span id="s2121">He had some gold coins, gold pounds sewn around his waistband, and that’s why they brought him back, but they -- they warned us that we had to leave within an hour, or two hours at most, because they couldn’t guarantee anything.</span> <span id="s2122">When my father was gone, my si -- mother and my sister decided to notify this friend, this general, and my sister jumped over the terrace, to the next house, who was a -- also a family friend, a judge.</span> <span id="s2123">He was a judge, I believe he was in the Supreme Court, but I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s2124">So he notified them, and from there they called this general, who came to -- there was a market, a big market near the house we were staying in Kipserly, and he went to that market, so he could see the house.</span> <span id="s2125">So he was pretending to look at the eggs, and to make sure the eggs were okay, you know you usually look at them in the sun to see whether they are rotten or not.</span> <span id="s2126">And -- so he was pretending to look at eggs, and so he could see whether there was anybody coming or going in the house.</span> <span id="s2127">The moment he saw they brought my father in, and when he saw these guys leave, he came to the house, and he took my father to his house.</span> <span id="s2128">And then, either he came back for us, or we went back, within -- it wasn’t within walking distance, but we definitely walked it.</span> <span id="s2129">And then th -- this family found another place for us.</span> <span id="s2130">We stayed with them I think two nights.</span> <span id="s2131">There were two children there, and -- a boy and a girl, and the parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s2132">Q: Now who was it who took your father for questioning?</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">A: The Greek SS.</span> <span id="s2134">Greek SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">Q: And they were --</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">A: They were working for the Germans.</span> <span id="s2137">They were paid by the Germans.</span> <span id="s2138">And of course, if they would bring Jews, they would get paid more.</span> <span id="s2139">So their job was to find Jews in hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">Q: What do you know about the -- how many of them there were, and to what extent they collaborated with the Germans?</span> <span id="s2141">They obviously could be bribed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2142">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2143">They collaborated with the Germans.</span> <span id="s2144">They -- they were not that many, but the ones that were -- were -- certainly afterwards some of them were sent to prison for life.</span> <span id="s2145">A couple of them were executed.</span> <span id="s2146">Others left the country.</span> <span id="s2147">They couldn’t survive in the country any more, having done what they’ve done.</span> <span id="s2148">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">Q: Do you know what condition your father was in when he came back?</span> <span id="s2150">Was he very shaken?</span></p> <p><span id="s2151">A: Oh my God, he was shaken, absolutely shaken.</span> <span id="s2152">Absolutely shaken.</span> <span id="s2153">And of course, having even the money he had, you know, that left us with very little money.</span> <span id="s2154">The -- the rest of the money was -- some other coins -- I mean, not coins, pounds, British pounds, gold, that my mother had sewn around her bra, and my sister had also sewn around the bra.</span> <span id="s2155">I was too little to have a bra, so they couldn’t put any coins on me.</span> <span id="s2156">Besides, they didn’t trust me.</span> <span id="s2157">So, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2158">Q: So throughout that time in hiding, the whole time the other three members of the family always had this money on them, hidden in their clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2159">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s2160">Yeah, that’s right.</span> <span id="s2161">And I remember my mother sewing it so elaborate, and so carefully, you know, so none of it will slip out.</span> <span id="s2162">It was like individual little pockets for each -- for each pound.</span> <span id="s2163">I still have one golden pound my father gave me years later because I was asking if he could give me one I wanted for a souvenir, and I’m never going to cash this.</span> <span id="s2164">I -- I just wanted to keep it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2165">Q: What about jewels?</span> <span id="s2166">I mean, was there anything else that they sewed into their clothing, or indeed had with them?</span> <span id="s2167">We talked about possessions --</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">Q: -- but I wonder what other valuable things --</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">A: No.</span> <span id="s2171">I think the jewels were either given away or put away.</span> <span id="s2172">My mother had a diamond ring, which was her engagement ring, but she wasn’t wearing it.</span> <span id="s2173">So I don’t know where she kept it.</span> <span id="s2174">But that one I know she -- she had, because she always thought she can sell it.</span> <span id="s2175">She didn’t sell it.</span> <span id="s2176">There were no other jewels.</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">Q: Do you know what happened to these things we talked about?</span> <span id="s2178">Some of the paintings, some of the possessions like the painting that was not returned, but I mean, was jewelry or other possessions every reclaimed by the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s2180">I remember my mother had the pearl necklace which was short, but it was what women wore those days.</span> <span id="s2181">And I have it now.</span> <span id="s2182">And that I remember was one of her precious things.</span> <span id="s2183">My mother didn’t wear an awful lot of jewelry.</span> <span id="s2184">So maybe she gave a few things to friends for safekeeping.</span> <span id="s2185">I don’t remember having safe deposit boxes those days, and things like that in banks, you know.</span> <span id="s2186">So, I -- I’m not sure how much was saved.</span></p> <p><span id="s2187">Q: Did your father talk about what had happened during that Greek SS questioning?</span> <span id="s2188">Course, he may not have shared it with -- with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2189">A: Yeah, I could hear again my sister and my mother talking, and also the man of the house, Andonis, but here again, I was sent out of the room, as usual.</span> <span id="s2190">Story of my life.</span> <span id="s2191">So, I could -- even though -- I mean, I could hear a little bit, but I couldn’t hear very clearly what happened.</span> <span id="s2192">Basically they told him that they wanted money, and un -- unless they had money, they were going to bring in the -- the SS.</span> <span id="s2193">Was as simple as that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2194">Q: And luckily he had enough to pay them off.</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">A: Luckily he had, yeah, he was a little hefty around the waist, so that took a few extra pounds.</span> <span id="s2196">I mean golden pounds.</span></p> <p><span id="s2197">Q: And then that day, he moved to the friends house.</span></p> <p><span id="s2198">A: Yeah, we went to the Padzopoulus house.</span> <span id="s2199">So -- and I’m sure it was very dangerous for them.</span> <span id="s2200">And I remember how shaken the lady, Mrs. Padzopoulus was, for us being there, for what happened to us.</span> <span id="s2201">She wasn’t sure whether a -- anybody had follow us on the way.</span> <span id="s2202">I remember the dinner.</span> <span id="s2203">Obviously she hasn’t planned for four more people.</span> <span id="s2204">She had zucchini stuffed with rice, which is a common Greek dish.</span> <span id="s2205">And she had put one zucchini per person for the two men, for my father and her husband.</span> <span id="s2206">Half a zucchini for herself and my mother, and a smaller zucchini for the children, the three children and my sister.</span> <span id="s2207">But I remember that half zucchini, with a lot of tomato sauce around it, in a large plate.</span> <span id="s2208">And it was just about a bite, or maybe two bites, three bites at most.</span> <span id="s2209">And that was it, there was nothing else.</span> <span id="s2210">I mean, people didn’t have a lot of stuff.</span> <span id="s2211">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2212">Q: And these people were all Greek Orthodox Christians --</span></p> <p><span id="s2213">A: Greek Orth -- right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">Q: This family and the judge you mentioned next door?</span></p> <p><span id="s2215">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2216">Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s2217">And of course the family we were hiding with, the Viyas family, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2218">Q: And then they found -- you were with them for a night or two, and then moved on to a new place.</span></p> <p><span id="s2219">A: To a new place in the -- the region of Gizzi.</span> <span id="s2220">And there was a family, there were the parents and one -- one daughter.</span> <span id="s2221">She was younger than my sister, so she must have been about 18.</span> <span id="s2222">17 - 18, some like that.</span> <span id="s2223">Very nice people, all of them.</span> <span id="s2224">I remember the -- the mother, Mrs. Catina, she was so good to me, you know, because I -- I was always the youngest, so they all thought -- were treating me very nicely, all of them.</span> <span id="s2225">So she would make something special, like maybe she would make a little cookie, and give it to me, but nobody else will have it, or things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2226">Q: Do you know how common it was for sheltering families to have been discovered, and their lives put on the line through what they were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2227">A: I only heard of one family, that they had been taken to prison, but they had not been shot, or something.</span> <span id="s2228">But I know it was something that everybody feared, because that was well known that can happen.</span> <span id="s2229">But I personally don’t know of anybody other than this family.</span></p> <p><span id="s2230">Q: What would -- what would a day be like at this stage in hiding?</span> <span id="s2231">I mean, do you remember whether anybody sort of tucked you in at night, or told you stories?</span> <span id="s2232">How would you pass the days?</span></p> <p><span id="s2233">A: Tucked me in -- I think I would say good -- good-night to my parents.</span> <span id="s2234">Well, by then I was like 11, right?</span> <span id="s2235">I would say good-night to my parents and give them a kiss.</span> <span id="s2236">I always did, that was a ritual, a good night ritual, and good morning ritual, too.</span> <span id="s2237">It -- I think sometimes my sister will give me a kiss and just make sure I was tucked in, but not always.</span> <span id="s2238">But she would look after.</span> <span id="s2239">Tell me stories, no, I don’t think anybody told me stories, including my grandmother.</span> <span id="s2240">When I was much younger, I wanted her to tell me stories, because everything I heard was that grandmothers tell stories to their grandchildren.</span> <span id="s2241">And my grandmother -- my grandmother wasn’t educated, she had gone up to six -- to -- to fourth grade, but she was a very intelligent woman.</span> <span id="s2242">She would say to me, “Well in the summer you cannot tell stories, because your clothes smell.</span> <span id="s2243">It’s too hot.”</span> <span id="s2244">So that didn’t register very well with me, but anyway, she said it, I thought it must be true.</span> <span id="s2245">Then in the wintertime, you know, grandmothers tell stories by the fireplace.</span> <span id="s2246">Well, it was too hot to be near the fireplace, so she couldn’t tell any stories.</span> <span id="s2247">Things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2248">Q: Would there be any observing of Jewish rituals?</span> <span id="s2249">I just wondered if your parents at this time might seek solace in rituals, or religious observances, or whether in fact they’d be so frozen through anxiety, they may have been unable to do anything very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2250">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s2251">I think that was the case.</span> <span id="s2252">They may have been praying privately, but you couldn’t say anything about being Jewish, anything that would just even give the slightest suspicion even to the people you were hiding, you know.</span> <span id="s2253">The people that were hiding you, actually, although they were kind people, and they knew you were Jewish, you couldn’t do anything -- or at least we.</span> <span id="s2254">I can’t say for everybody else.</span> <span id="s2255">But the thing was that you don’t do anything to -- to arise any suspicion, or to make things different, so people will say oh, they are doing things differently.</span></p> <p><span id="s2256">End of Tape Five, Side A Beginning Tape Five, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s2257">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Paulette Nehama.</span> <span id="s2258">This is tape number five, side B. Your parents also at this time, or most of this time in hiding, could not speak in confidence.</span> <span id="s2259">I mean, you were sharing quarters.</span> <span id="s2260">They could not even whisper together, I assume, at night, and say how do you think Paulette is doing, or what --</span></p> <p><span id="s2261">A: Well, I was asleep, so I couldn’t hear if they did, other than the time that I could hear the German words out of my window when my head was covered with a blanket, I was -- I was asleep the rest of the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2262">Q: I was just thinking of the fact that they would really -- there’d be little --</span></p> <p><span id="s2263">A: Little privacy --</span></p> <p><span id="s2264">Q: -- privacy for them to confide.</span></p> <p><span id="s2265">A: Yeah, probably there was little privacy.</span> <span id="s2266">But you know, I would go out in the yard, the backyard was rather secluded, you know, there were trees around.</span> <span id="s2267">So whether they talked then or not, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2268">Q: Do -- have any other memories come to mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s2269">A: Yeah, I remember the two of them, my father and mother were playing cards, they were playing pinochle.</span> <span id="s2270">I remember them both smoking so much, the room was so foggy because of all that smoke.</span> <span id="s2271">Was one cigarette after the other.</span> <span id="s2272">Those days we didn’t know much about cigarettes, you know, but it certainly did something for them, because they were so anxious.</span> <span id="s2273">My mother took -- my father didn’t have much to do, because the man of the house was -- you know, had gone to the base, he was in the Navy, as I said before.</span> <span id="s2274">And my mother would help with the cooking, or she will do the cooking, the woman will do the shopping.</span> <span id="s2275">So my mother was a little more busy than my father.</span> <span id="s2276">Now you asked me before how I would pass my day.</span> <span id="s2277">I remember my mother tried to teach me how to embroid, and my mother was excellent in embroiding.</span> <span id="s2278">She has done beautiful pieces, and I have some of her pieces, which I treasure.</span> <span id="s2279">But I just didn’t have the patience to do that.</span> <span id="s2280">I mean, I couldn’t sit quiet, and just trying to put a little -- my needle in the little hole there, and get pleasure out of it.</span> <span id="s2281">It was the most boring thing for me.</span> <span id="s2282">So I wasn’t particularly interested.</span> <span id="s2283">And a little bit of knitting was more to my liking.</span> <span id="s2284">But I wasn’t very good at that too.</span> <span id="s2285">So these things didn’t really attract me, or just, you know, give me any particular pleasure in doing.</span> <span id="s2286">So most of it, as I said, I had two books that I’ve read, and then I got ahold of this weekly mag -- I think it was either weekly or monthly children’s magazine, which was called, The Development of Children.</span> <span id="s2287">But they had some wonderful stories in there.</span> <span id="s2288">So I read -- some of them were a continuation, you know, so you would wait for the next.</span> <span id="s2289">I think, now that I think about it, I think Mrs. Padzoupolus would send me this magazine -- the woman whose house we went after they got my father, the general’s house.</span> <span id="s2290">Somehow her children had it, and then after they would read it, they would -- I don’t know how I got it, because I don’t know whether they mailed it, whether the man of the house would go to their house and get it, I have no idea.</span> <span id="s2291">But I know that I had it, and it was wonderful, because it was like a four page little newspaper, you know, that I could read from the beginning to the bottom, and it was -- it was good.</span> <span id="s2292">I knew some of these things so much by heart.</span></p> <p><span id="s2293">Q: You know, you would be 11, but you -- you spoke -- you have spoken often about your dolls, and were you still playing and fantasizing a lot with your doll or dolls?</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">A: Oh yeah, I had a doll that her name was Ellie.</span> <span id="s2295">It was one of these plastic dolls, but you know the ones that they break, you know, lo -- those days we had these dolls, how did they call them?</span> <span id="s2296">We used to call them bone dolls, but often their legs will come off, and -- or their hands will come off, and then there was a piece of elastic collecting the two.</span> <span id="s2297">I had an uncle who used to fix them beautifully for me.</span> <span id="s2298">And this doll, she -- she didn’t have hair -- I mean, her hair was like part of the -- of the material the doll was made, that she had like two braids on the side.</span> <span id="s2299">And she was small, very small.</span> <span id="s2300">And -- but my mother and my sister had made me clothes for this doll out of very small pieces of things, or -- I remember a little blue jacket with a little white handkerchief, you know, in the pocket.</span> <span id="s2301">And I just loved that ra -- I loved dressing my doll, and playing with her.</span> <span id="s2302">Yes, I -- my doll was -- probably saved me, it was my companion, my confidant.</span></p> <p><span id="s2303">Q: Would this doll fit in your pocket?</span> <span id="s2304">Was it really tiny, that small?</span></p> <p><span id="s2305">A: No, it wouldn’t fit in my pocket, maybe it was a little bigger than my pocket, but not tiny - tiny.</span> <span id="s2306">However, I had this doll with me, somehow it survived.</span> <span id="s2307">And I kept it, it was on my bed after the -- the war was over, and I got married, I brought it to the United States, and I had it with me in California, and one day Sarah opened the drawer and got it, and she dropped it, and the head broke, and that was the end of Ellie.</span></p> <p><span id="s2308">Q: So th -- so that that doll was very important?</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">A: Yes, that doll was very important.</span> <span id="s2310">In fact, now I remember.</span> <span id="s2311">After we left the first -- first house, and before we went to the second one, when I stayed with this older gentleman, they came to pick me up -- my sister came to pick me up, the couple that helped us find the second house gave me a doll, but I didn’t like that doll at all.</span> <span id="s2312">She was very ugly.</span> <span id="s2313">And I remember saying thank you, you know, and -- but I never played with that doll, never.</span> <span id="s2314">I-It was -- it -- it wasn’t a -- a beautiful doll, you know, something that appealed to me at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2315">Q: Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2316">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2317">I mean, here you think, you know, a child -- here I’m giving a child a present, she doesn’t have anything, and I just didn’t like that doll.</span></p> <p><span id="s2318">Q: I wonder what was going on that you hadn’t bonded with that doll.</span></p> <p><span id="s2319">A: I don’t -- she was a rag doll, and I didn’t like her face.</span> <span id="s2320">I didn’t think she -- I didn’t like her face.</span> <span id="s2321">Who knows, I liked my little Ellie.</span> <span id="s2322">But Sarah took care of that, my daughter Sarah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2323">Q: Now tell me more about your sister.</span> <span id="s2324">Maybe you should remind us of her full name, because we haven’t mentioned her by name for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s2325">A: Yola, her name was Yola.</span></p> <p><span id="s2326">Q: What was her full name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2327">A: Yolanda, but we call her Yola.</span> <span id="s2328">Of course, during the occupation, she was Yanna, like Joanne.</span> <span id="s2329">My name was not Paulette, it was Paulexani, they used to call me Polly, or sometimes Sandy.</span> <span id="s2330">So everybody had a different name, and different last name.</span> <span id="s2331">So I got used to the Polly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2332">Q: Would your -- your real names ever pop out, or -- or y --</span></p> <p><span id="s2333">A: No, never, never.</span> <span id="s2334">Once, actually, come to think of it, my sister and I had gone for a walk.</span> <span id="s2335">It was dusk, and as we were walking, we encountered a friend of mine with her mother, from Volos, who called, “Yola, Yola.”</span> <span id="s2336">And we -- Yola just pushed me, and she said, “Don’t answer, keep walking.”</span> <span id="s2337">So we kept on walking as if we didn’t know them, because if somebody else was around, you know, it would have been -- and her daughter who -- who was my friend, unfortunate she died, she remembers that, and i -- she told me, she said, “And I told my mother, don’t call them, they don’t want to be recognized.”</span> <span id="s2338">But it was, you know, such a -- a wonderful thing of seeing somebody you know, and you don’t know what’s happening to these people, you immediately say hey, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2339">Q: And they would not be Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s2340">A: No, they were not Jewish, no.</span> <span id="s2341">But they were friends from Volos, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2342">Q: And other times it could have been such a wonderful meeting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2343">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s2344">So even if you knew anybody, you didn’t ne -- have these freedom to -- to greet them, you know, to embrace them, to -- to recognize them, you know.</span> <span id="s2345">You had to keep going, as if they were strangers.</span> <span id="s2346">It was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2347">Q: What was life like for your sister after the end of the war, and have you talked about how each of you were -- I assume you do, about -- feel that your lives were affected by this experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s2348">A: Oh there’s no doubt our lives have been a -- affected.</span> <span id="s2349">Obviously they’ve been affected differently.</span> <span id="s2350">Yola was 20 at the time, I was 10.</span> <span id="s2351">So you know, she had a better grasp of what was going on.</span> <span id="s2352">And my parents included her, while they didn’t include me, in all sorts of preparations, or you know, discussions, because of her age.</span> <span id="s2353">I think when the war was over, I think Yola, who -- who got married in ’46, was -- that was shortly after the war.</span> <span id="s2354">But still, you know, the remnants of the deprivation were still with us.</span> <span id="s2355">So she -- she just wanted everything.</span> <span id="s2356">She wanted the nice house, and lot of clothes, she -- she just felt that she didn’t have those things, and she had to make up al -- for all these things.</span> <span id="s2357">So -- and I -- I just didn’t particularly care.</span> <span id="s2358">I was a little bit of a tomboy.</span> <span id="s2359">There were difference.</span> <span id="s2360">I mean, we’re different people.</span> <span id="s2361">Our personalities are like day and night.</span> <span id="s2362">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2363">Q: And there -- there could be factors, and I wonder if you’ve talked about the fact that you were -- you were younger, and you were protected, but you’ve already talked earlier about your anxiety over what you didn’t know, and your sister would have a slightly more active role, because she’d be involved in the planning.</span> <span id="s2364">And she’d be protecting you, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s2365">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2366">Q: -- she’d be a caregiver to some extent.</span></p> <p><span id="s2367">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2368">Q: Which, either role could be more damaging.</span></p> <p><span id="s2369">A: That’s true.</span> <span id="s2370">I mean, she -- she definitely protected me and she treated me like her little sister, you know.</span> <span id="s2371">So I didn’t have to know everything, but I think they probably thought the less I know, the better off I am.</span> <span id="s2372">From my perspective now, if -- I mean, if any of my grandchildren were involved in a situation, I would have the same concerns about telling them everything, you know, I mean, at this age.</span> <span id="s2373">Although they are much younger, they are six and seven, the older boys.</span> <span id="s2374">So, you know, you’re -- but I think they could have said a little more, at least from my perspective, to -- to calm me down.</span> <span id="s2375">The fact that don’t worry -- that you say don’t worry, everything will be all right, will -- will be okay, wasn’t enough to -- to make me stop worrying, because there was nothing concrete.</span> <span id="s2376">The don’t worry, it’s a very vague kind of thing.</span> <span id="s2377">Don’t worry, but what if, you know, something happens, or what if that happened.</span> <span id="s2378">The only thing, surprisingly, that gave me a lot of comfort, was a plan we had to escape, particularly from the second house in -- in Kipserly.</span> <span id="s2379">This was the house that had that fence, the one I jumped to go to this little girl’s house to play with.</span> <span id="s2380">And I remember we had a plan in place that should the Germans come, they would certainly come from the front, or -- we could all go to the backyard and jump the fence, and by then we would be to the next block.</span> <span id="s2381">So by then we could run or do something.</span> <span id="s2382">How -- we never put that plan in effect, actually we never need it -- needed it.</span> <span id="s2383">But it gave me comfort that there was something we could do, something concrete that I was involved in, because they -- they told me what to do, and in fact we had a little bundle of a few clothes, you know, that we could take if we had time.</span> <span id="s2384">But the thing was that we had to leave right away, and jump the fence, and that will take us through the yard of the next people, to the next block.</span> <span id="s2385">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2386">Q: Did you keep that bundle ready?</span></p> <p><span id="s2387">A: Yeah, that bundle was ready.</span> <span id="s2388">That bundle was ready always.</span> <span id="s2389">Couple of changes of clothes, and that was it.</span> <span id="s2390">Maybe my doll, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2391">No, my doll wasn’t in there, because I always had it with me, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2392">Q: And where did you keep the bundle?</span> <span id="s2393">I mean, was it at the end of your bed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2394">A: It was under the bed, yeah.</span> <span id="s2395">It was under the bed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2396">Q: Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2397">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2398">Q: And your sister s -- eagerly went on with life and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2399">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2400">Q: -- indulging her love of clothes as elegant as could be put together.</span></p> <p><span id="s2401">A: Yeah, yeah, she -- she is a beautiful woman.</span> <span id="s2402">She always dressed very elegantly.</span> <span id="s2403">I mean, her husband was very willing, when he could, to get her the best things.</span> <span id="s2404">So she became a very well-dressed lady, you know, and I think she got a lot of pleasure out of it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2405">Q: And brought pleasure, to be fair.</span></p> <p><span id="s2406">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2407">Q: Now, when did she meet her husband, and tell me about their wedding, and I -- and -- and the impact of that on family.</span></p> <p><span id="s2408">A: I think she met him through -- through a friend.</span> <span id="s2409">Freddy was the cousin of the friend who took me in when I went to Montreal.</span> <span id="s2410">I remember when I got engaged to Isaac, I lived with a family in Montreal for six months, until my visa was ready for me to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s2411">Well, Joe Calderone was the name.</span> <span id="s2412">His mother and father were friends of my parents.</span> <span id="s2413">Joe was a cousin to Freddy, okay?</span> <span id="s2414">So Yola was very friendly with Joe and his wife, his current -- I mean his wife, and you know, they used to -- to be together in gatherings, and that’s where she met Freddy.</span> <span id="s2415">And they made it in ’46, which was still very shortly after the war, and you know, I mean, things were not that well yet, you know?</span> <span id="s2416">We were still -- had financial problems.</span> <span id="s2417">The factory wasn’t -- was just beginning to -- to work.</span> <span id="s2418">But it wasn’t producing what it did before the war, certainly not.</span> <span id="s2419">And -- but yeah, everybody was very happy.</span> <span id="s2420">When she got married she had a wedding gown, and -- and I was happy, and I told Freddy that I’m glad that he is marrying my sister, because I can have a -- a new dress for the wedding.</span> <span id="s2421">So he always remembered that, he thought it was really cute.</span></p> <p><span id="s2422">Q: The first new dress in how long, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s2423">A: Oh, four years, five years, some like that.</span> <span id="s2424">I used to get Yola’s dresses, and my mother would hem them, but you know, there is a 10 year difference, so you can imagine the hem was like another dress almost, plus she would take it in, and my dresses were always kind of loose, and hanging, and I never liked them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2425">Q: That makes me think of the -- a question about how would your f -- parents dress in the time in hiding?</span> <span id="s2426">Would they maintain very dignified style of dress, even though clothes would get shabby and well worn?</span></p> <p><span id="s2427">A: Oh yeah, I mean, I remember my father always wearing a vest, a shirt and a vest, of course no tie in the house.</span> <span id="s2428">And my mother always wore a -- a housedress, or a skirt and blouse, some like that.</span> <span id="s2429">We didn’t have a lot of clothes with us, so when -- since we didn’t go out, you know, we didn’t need to have anything.</span> <span id="s2430">Now that we’re talking about clothes, there’s something else.</span> <span id="s2431">After the war was over, and I think it was after the civil war in ’44, there was help that had come from the United States, you know, in -- relief.</span> <span id="s2432">And among them, there was what we used to call UNRRA, UN -- United Nations Relief Agency.</span> <span id="s2433">And they were distributing clothes.</span> <span id="s2434">So I needed a coat, and my mother took me to get a coat.</span> <span id="s2435">So we looked through the different bins, or thing, and she came up with a brown coat that was down to my ankles, really long, and I didn’t like it, but it was wool, and it was warm, and she wanted me to have it, because it was winter.</span> <span id="s2436">I cried, and cried and cried, because I just didn’t like this coat.</span> <span id="s2437">I wanted something else, but everything else was either too small for me, or too big for me and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2438">So finally I ended up having that coat, but here again, she had to hem it to make it approximately my size.</span></p> <p><span id="s2439">Q: What -- what a contrast.</span> <span id="s2440">I think of the -- the daughter of the head of the c-cashmere making factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s2441">A: [indecipherable] having -- having -- a friend of mine tells me a wonderful story which brings tears to my eyes.</span> <span id="s2442">She was two years old when she and her parents went to a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2443">She -- the parents were Spanish citizens, so they went to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s2444">Now when the -- which was supposedly a little better treatment than, you know, the other camps but still, was a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2445">When the war was over, and they came out, they went to -- to France, or to Italy, I think, to -- to a center until they will be relocated.</span> <span id="s2446">So -- no, to France, I think they went.</span> <span id="s2447">And they had coupons to go buy clothes, to department stores.</span> <span id="s2448">So her mother, and Lola’s -- and my friend Lola, went to a department store to get clothes.</span> <span id="s2449">And as they were going up the stairs, there was a mannequin of a child with a blue coat, and she fell in love with that little blue coat.</span> <span id="s2450">So they talked to the saleslady and they gave her the coupon, and she brought out a very dark looking coat.</span> <span id="s2451">And the little girl said, “I don’t like this coat, I like that blue one.”</span> <span id="s2452">And she said, “No, this is not for you.”</span> <span id="s2453">And she started crying.</span> <span id="s2454">Then the manager came, and he said, “Why is she crying?”</span> <span id="s2455">“Well,” she said, “because she wants that coat.”</span> <span id="s2456">“Now that coat costs a lot of money.</span> <span id="s2457">The ones we have set aside are these.”</span> <span id="s2458">And they were the ugliest things you could think.</span> <span id="s2459">I mean, dark colors for little kids, and things like that.</span> <span id="s2460">So he said, “It’s all right, the little girl can have the light blue coat.”</span> <span id="s2461">So he took it off the mannequin, and put it on my friend.</span> <span id="s2462">And I thought it was such a moving story.</span> <span id="s2463">And she was happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2464">Q: It is a wonderful story.</span></p> <p><span id="s2465">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2466">I mean, here comes humanity, you know?</span> <span id="s2467">I mean, it’s these tiny little things that make the difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s2468">Q: Now your sister -- I just wanted to get a sense of her subsequent life -- her husband died young.</span></p> <p><span id="s2469">A: He died at the age of 60.</span> <span id="s2470">He died in 1973, of colon cancer.</span> <span id="s2471">He worked with my father.</span> <span id="s2472">I think I told you that they tried to -- to start another factory in Athens that made yarn, because they had such difficulty bringing yarn from England, and they thought it would modify, I mean, what they produced.</span> <span id="s2473">So this factory -- I mean, he was able to -- to get some partners, and he did go for awhile, but then, here again, it was difficult, and hard to get materials and things like that, so the factory wasn’t going very well, and Freddy decided to -- to work elsewhere, which was a big shock for my father, because he was counting on having his help.</span> <span id="s2474">So -- but they didn’t quite agree on how to manage the factory, and Freddy went elsewhere.</span> <span id="s2475">So -- but he worked with my father until -- I think when I came to United States in ’58, he was still working with my father.</span> <span id="s2476">He probably left about 1960 -- in the middle of 60’s, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2477">Q: Did that remain a rift between them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2478">A: A little bit, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s2479">A little bit.</span> <span id="s2480">It was very disappointing to my father because he thought that with hard work -- you know, my father was always somebody who would come up under horrible circumstances, and Freddy saw no -- no future to -- to this factory.</span> <span id="s2481">So I don’t know who was right, or who was wrong.</span> <span id="s2482">They probably both were right, from their own perspective, you know?</span> <span id="s2483">[indecipherable] cause a lot of pain.</span></p> <p><span id="s2484">Q: How old would your mother be at the end of the war in 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s2485">A: She was 45 years old.</span> <span id="s2486">She was born in 1900, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2487">Q: And tell me about -- let’s talk about your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s2488">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2489">Q: We haven’t really talked about her since, except as she -- her life is sort of interwoven with -- with yours.</span> <span id="s2490">We did talk about her activities and charitable involvement in Volos, before, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s2491">A: [indecipherable] she was quite a lady, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2492">Q: -- but tell me more.</span></p> <p><span id="s2493">A: Well, my mother was a very quiet person.</span> <span id="s2494">She was the eldest of three daughters, Julia and Anna.</span> <span id="s2495">And I think she was quiet, but she was also a little bit like me, or I was like her, you know.</span> <span id="s2496">She was very sensitive, but not very outgoing.</span> <span id="s2497">But she had a tremendous warmth, that people remember her.</span> <span id="s2498">And everybody says, even now, that she was a grand dame, like a lady, a real lady.</span> <span id="s2499">There’s another vignette that I have to tell you, because that describes her.</span> <span id="s2500">Many years ago, Yola and I went back to Volos.</span> <span id="s2501">And we went around the place where our house was, which doesn’t exist any more, has become apartment buildings.</span> <span id="s2502">And we were walking through the neighborhoods, it was the first time I went back to Volos since I left Volos, since I came to the United States.</span> <span id="s2503">That was in the -- ’74 - ’75 -- 1974 - ’75, approximately then.</span> <span id="s2504">Yola had been to Volos before.</span> <span id="s2505">And I think there was a lecture also, that we wanted to go.</span> <span id="s2506">So I was telling Yola that I always remember my mother will take me to a pastry shop called the Swiss.</span> <span id="s2507">And I always remember the owner there, you know, talking to me, and giving me a little piece of pastry, or a cookie, or something.</span> <span id="s2508">So Yola says, “Well, we’re gonna go that way anyway, so let’s stop.”</span> <span id="s2509">So we went, the sign still says the Swiss.</span> <span id="s2510">And we go in, and the store is the same, nothing has changed, you know, it’s a narrow store, you know, the -- you know, all the pastries, and all the breads there, and it’s a fairly young man, a young man who recognizes Yola and says, “Yes, I remember you, you were here before.”</span> <span id="s2511">He is the son of the owner.</span> <span id="s2512">And he says, “Well, my father comes here every day.</span> <span id="s2513">He is 90 years old, and he sits there.”</span> <span id="s2514">In -- in the corner is this old man, you know, asleep on a chair, and with his cane.</span> <span id="s2515">And he goes -- [indecipherable] “Here is my sister who lives in the United States.”</span> <span id="s2516">“Oh,” he says, “I have to tell my father.”</span> <span id="s2517">So he goes over and he -- he wakes his father up, and he says, “Father, you know who this is?”</span> <span id="s2518">And he says, “This is the Moudzoukos daughters.</span> <span id="s2519">This is Yola, and this is Paulette.”</span> <span id="s2520">And the man -- for a moment he was trying to wake up.</span> <span id="s2521">He gets up from the chair, shaking, and he embraces me, and he starts crying.</span> <span id="s2522">He says, “I remember you.</span> <span id="s2523">I remember your mother, what a lady she was.</span> <span id="s2524">I remember bringing you here.”</span> <span id="s2525">I mean, it was such a moving moment.</span> <span id="s2526">And then in the evening we went to the lecture, and this woman recognizes Yola, and then she tells me -- Yola says, “This is my sister, Paulette.”</span> <span id="s2527">Says, “Oh Paulette, I was thinking of you a few days before.”</span> <span id="s2528">She is a photographer, a professional photographer.</span> <span id="s2529">And my mother, once a year, or twice a year, she used to take me to the studio to take my picture.</span> <span id="s2530">In Greece there is, before Easter there’s a carnival, it’s the four weeks of carnival.</span> <span id="s2531">So children have parties, and they get dressed up in all sorts of costumes.</span> <span id="s2532">So every time I would have a costume, my mother would take me out to have my picture.</span> <span id="s2533">And this woman tells me that she is moving her studio from where she were, to a new place, and she was going through old negatives, and she found some of the negatives of me, and she was wondering wha -- End of Tape Five, Side B Beginning Tape Six, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s2534">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Paulette Nehama.</span> <span id="s2535">This is tape number six, side A.</span> <span id="s2536">We were talking about the photographer, and her photos, and -- that she’d come across in Volos.</span></p> <p><span id="s2537">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s2538">Yeah, so she was wondering what happened to me.</span> <span id="s2539">She knew I had gone to -- to the United States.</span> <span id="s2540">So she said to me, “I will send you the negatives, because there’s -- some of them you may want to have them, you know, I don’t need them any more.</span> <span id="s2541">These were from 1930-something.</span> <span id="s2542">But I never got them because I was leaving the next day, and she didn’t send them.</span> <span id="s2543">So I never got them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2544">Q: To what extent -- I want to hear more about your mother, but to what extent have you kept in touch as a family with Volos?</span></p> <p><span id="s2545">A: We have a cousin in Volos, who is the president of the Jewish community there.</span> <span id="s2546">His name is Raphael Freseese.</span> <span id="s2547">And he is related -- he is third cousin, I think, or some like that.</span> <span id="s2548">He is related because I think his grandmother was married to my grandmother’s brother.</span> <span id="s2549">I think that’s the relationship, and I remember his grandmother, a nice, wonderful old lady who would always bless me to become a bride, for her to see me a bride.</span> <span id="s2550">Lovely woman.</span> <span id="s2551">So, anyway, he has written a book about the Jewish community of Volos, which he send me, and I correspond with him occasionally.</span> <span id="s2552">Actually, the holidays I sent him a card, he sends me a card.</span> <span id="s2553">I spoke to him on the phone a couple of times when I was in Greece.</span> <span id="s2554">When I go to Volos I see him.</span> <span id="s2555">I think it was in 1975, or ’74, there was a letter came from the Jewish community, they were going to have a 50 year reunion of the Jewish community of val -- of Volos, of the people who left Volos, because a lot went to the United States, a lot went to Israel, or other parts of Europe, or Athens.</span> <span id="s2556">So they were gathering everybody to go for this reunion, and I went with my sister.</span> <span id="s2557">And it was -- it was such a nice thing.</span> <span id="s2558">The first thing when you entered there, you know, they had pictures of all of Volos, the old Volos I remember.</span> <span id="s2559">And there are pictures of my father, my grandfathers, the -- my father and grandfather was the president, my gra -- yeah, my grandfather, his father, the president of the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s2560">So there are prominent, big pictures of them, right on a panel.</span> <span id="s2561">The factory is very prominently displayed, since he was one of the biggest employers there.</span> <span id="s2562">And then the connections.</span> <span id="s2563">You know, people remember me as a little kid.</span> <span id="s2564">I mean, I left Volos when I was 10.</span> <span id="s2565">Here I’m an old woman, I mean, grown up woman, you know, married with daughters of my own, and th-th -- there is that warmth, you know, of -- of the then, to the now.</span> <span id="s2566">It comes through, it just comes through.</span> <span id="s2567">So we had a wonderful two day affair, because then we -- the next -- they had the Shabbat dinner.</span> <span id="s2568">The women had cooked, and it was at the synagogue, it was service of course, and then the dinner.</span> <span id="s2569">And the next day there were service Saturday morning, and then they took us by bus to a place to swim, and then to have dinner, and then we went to one of the villages up in Pilion.</span> <span id="s2570">And at night there was a reception.</span> <span id="s2571">So it was a very nice connection.</span></p> <p><span id="s2572">Q: How diminished was that Jewish community?</span> <span id="s2573">I mean, would it have -- would it be half the size of what it was, or a third of the size?</span></p> <p><span id="s2574">A: Oh yeah, right now there are about a hundred people all together.</span> <span id="s2575">Yeah, hundred -- 110 at most.</span> <span id="s2576">It wasn’t a very large community, but I think about 27 percent of that community perished.</span> <span id="s2577">And then, after the war, the ones who returned, returned to practically nothing, and they -- they left Volos because there was hardly anything for them left, or to do.</span> <span id="s2578">There were not jobs, so a lot of them left to go to the United States, or to Israel, or to Athens.</span> <span id="s2579">So -- but that Jewish community is so small, but so connected.</span> <span id="s2580">It has excellent relationship with a larger Volos community, there is mutual respect.</span> <span id="s2581">Recently there’s been a memorial that has been done there, and I mean, people live together very nicely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2582">Q: More so than in Athens, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s2583">A: I think so, because it’s a smaller place, you know, and they know each other.</span> <span id="s2584">There’s great respect for each other, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2585">Q: Did your parents -- they continued in Athens after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2586">A: Yes, we continued living in Athens, but we would go to Volos in the summer, because the factory was still there, and my father was, you know, working there.</span> <span id="s2587">And in the wintertime he would commute from Athens to Volos.</span> <span id="s2588">Once when we were in Volos, one summer, he -- he got a heart attack, and then he wasn’t able to work for awhile.</span> <span id="s2589">And I remember Freddy came to -- to Volos -- my father started -- helped start a -- build a -- a small airport in Volos, because Volos had no airport.</span> <span id="s2590">So the first plane that landed was a tiny, little plane that had Freddy, and a cardiologist, and Yola.</span> <span id="s2591">They came to look after my father.</span> <span id="s2592">So it landed on -- the first plane that landed in that airport, isn’t that interesting?</span> <span id="s2593">And it was tiny plane.</span> <span id="s2594">Then a few days later, Freddy remained in Volos to take care of the factory, and everything, and Yola and I left to go to -- to Athens, because she had a child by then, she had Maurice.</span> <span id="s2595">And I remember my first flight, you know, in this tiny little plane, and the pilot is totally incompetent, and I thought he was going to land in a roof in Athens, or someplace, I mean, he is going that close.</span> <span id="s2596">It was such a tiny little place, I mean, I was really scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s2597">Q: And that would have been what, 1949, or something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2598">A: That was either ’40 -- let’s see, she was married ’46, it was probably ’50, 1950 - ’51.</span> <span id="s2599">Yeah, because her son was born 1950, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2600">Q: And your father tried to get the -- was it Leviathan-Moudzoukos factory going again --</span></p> <p><span id="s2601">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2602">Q: But that didn’t -- ultimately did not work out?</span></p> <p><span id="s2603">A: It worked for a short period of time, but he -- the much more diminished -- wa -- first of all, the machinery was all destroyed, you see, and they had to replace that, or part of that.</span> <span id="s2604">The machinery was German machinery, and it was brought from Germany before the war, so this was very good machinery.</span> <span id="s2605">It just didn’t have the -- the means, the financial means, you know, to buy new machinery, to get the whole thing started.</span> <span id="s2606">It was very hard.</span> <span id="s2607">But my father was a fighter, you know, he wasn’t -- a very kind man, very kind man.</span> <span id="s2608">He couldn’t stand people being hurt.</span> <span id="s2609">He was a very good employer, and I hear that now from people, that he was an excellent employer.</span> <span id="s2610">He was also involved in city affairs, I mean he was in the city council, he was in the Jewish community, of course, he was -- he was a pillar of the society.</span></p> <p><span id="s2611">Q: And now let’s go back to your mother, and continue to tell me her story from the 1940’s on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2612">A: Okay, well the world was hard for her.</span> <span id="s2613">Living in other people’s houses was hard for her.</span> <span id="s2614">My father wa -- my mother was always very clean, her house was always very orderly.</span> <span id="s2615">She had excellent taste.</span> <span id="s2616">So for her to be at somebody else’s house, it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s2617">She -- I mean, she had no other choice, you know.</span> <span id="s2618">And before we went into hiding, during the Italian occupation, when we had lived in the villages of the mountains of Pilion, here again we were renting a room, or two rooms from somebody else’s house.</span> <span id="s2619">So that was hard for her, too, you know, to be in a village, here is this lady who is -- she wasn’t spoiled, I want you to know, I mean, she was -- she was a woman who had a good life, but she wasn’t spoiled.</span> <span id="s2620">So, you know, these things did take some toll, I think.</span> <span id="s2621">But I think the hardest thing for her was when we lost the factory, a lot of her -- of friends, who at least appeared to be friends during the good times, just disappeared.</span> <span id="s2622">And that she never forgot, that was a trauma for her, that the friends that she had helped, and friends that she was counting on, and has been to their house, they have been to her house, kind of discarded us because they were not -- they didn’t have money any more, for awhile.</span> <span id="s2623">So that really traumatized her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2624">Q: They weren’t really friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s2625">A: That’s what I kept on telling her, because she used to say to me, “Don’t count so much on your friends.”</span> <span id="s2626">And I would say, “What?</span> <span id="s2627">My friends are wonderful.”</span> <span id="s2628">You know, this kind of thing.</span> <span id="s2629">She’d say, “Well, they are wonderful until things change.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2630">Q: So that she lost some of her faith in humanity?</span></p> <p><span id="s2631">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s2632">I think she did.</span> <span id="s2633">The war did that, her friends did that.</span> <span id="s2634">And it was a constant struggle, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2635">Q: How important was she to your father, and to his state of mind, did he count on her utterly?</span> <span id="s2636">Was his mood dependent on her support?</span> <span id="s2637">What was their relationship like?</span></p> <p><span id="s2638">A: Yeah, I think my mother catered a lot to my father, because he -- he had diabetes, so she always took good care of him.</span> <span id="s2639">I mean, she would -- those days they used to weigh things, because you know, you have to eat a certain amount of carbohydrates, and a certain amount of protein, I think.</span> <span id="s2640">But this became her responsibility of taking care of him in this way.</span> <span id="s2641">And she would weigh everything.</span> <span id="s2642">I remember he loved cherries, so the season of cherries would come, and they would count like eight cherries on the little plate, and he would say, “What is this, eight cherries?</span> <span id="s2643">Bring the bowl of cherries here.”</span> <span id="s2644">And she would freak out, say, “But these are weighted.”</span> <span id="s2645">You know, so it was like the joke, we weigh things and he -- he would sneak a few other cherries, you know, from the bowl.</span> <span id="s2646">So yes, but he did count on her support.</span> <span id="s2647">She was very supportive of him, she was always there for him.</span> <span id="s2648">I mean, they had a very close relationship.</span> <span id="s2649">But she begun to get depressed, and I think she had great difficulty overcoming this depression and slowly with every more d -- every difficulty that came along, it was harder for her to come on -- to overcome this.</span> <span id="s2650">So I guess she slowly started withdrawing, and withdrawing more and more.</span> <span id="s2651">Then she had -- her appetite was diminished.</span> <span id="s2652">She also had a problem with saliva, she couldn’t produce enough saliva to chew her food.</span> <span id="s2653">And I don’t know if this was the result of a dental procedure that she had, or not, I -- I -- I’m not quite clear, I don’t remember, actually, at this point.</span> <span id="s2654">But she -- she had lost saliva, so she couldn’t chew her food, and it was very painful.</span> <span id="s2655">And she started losing a tremendous amount of weight.</span> <span id="s2656">Then she was put on medication and on some vitamins, and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2657">Q: And what ti -- at what -- what age would she be -- or what -- in what years was this taking place?</span></p> <p><span id="s2658">A: I think -- the depression, you know, was -- was -- it was there but not very prominent in the 50’s.</span> <span id="s2659">I think towards the -- the end of the fift -- probab -- probably after I left, I think things got worse, because also the difficulties with the factory became much more.</span> <span id="s2660">There were a couple of clients who had big orders, and they cancelled them because they had financial problems and couldn’t -- couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s2661">So that, of course, affected our financial situation.</span> <span id="s2662">So, I think she got tired, and she just didn’t want to fight any more.</span> <span id="s2663">And I left in ’58, so I’m sure that my leaving was something, you know, difficult for her.</span> <span id="s2664">She always hoped to be able to come and visit me, and see me in my new place.</span> <span id="s2665">She wasn’t able to do that, my father’s heart condition and diabetes were not doing too well, plus all the financial difficulties, you know, couldn’t -- they couldn’t afford the trip.</span> <span id="s2666">It was that simple.</span> <span id="s2667">So I think that certainly made her upset, and unhappy, in addition to everything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s2668">Q: Did she see lots of -- of your sister, Yola?</span></p> <p><span id="s2669">A: Oh yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s2670">Yola was always there for her, and she used to take her to doctor, or take her places, you know, and things like that.</span> <span id="s2671">So yeah, Yola was always there.</span> <span id="s2672">And of course, Maurice, her -- her little grandson who was there, who was a great pleasure to her, yes, much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2673">Q: I wish you’d had wedding photos for her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2674">A: I wish that too, I think she -- she was upset, and I was upset I didn’t have any wedding photos.</span> <span id="s2675">But I took Sarah there when Sarah was six months old, and she just -- that was in 1960.</span> <span id="s2676">Sarah was born 1960.</span> <span id="s2677">And she just loved her.</span> <span id="s2678">Sarah was a very feisty baby, very, very light, very small baby, but my goodness.</span> <span id="s2679">A friend of mine who had her baby with Sarah, we put them both in a playpen.</span> <span id="s2680">She said to me, “I thought my child was retarded compared to yours.”</span> <span id="s2681">Cause she was moving, she was in constant move and action.</span> <span id="s2682">And she was just great, and I think that did a lot of good to her to -- to have her there.</span> <span id="s2683">But then we left, we came back to United States, so here she was left empty handed again.</span> <span id="s2684">So that was hard for her.</span> <span id="s2685">And she freaked out when I -- I said to my mother, “I’m going to send a case of Gerber baby food for Sarah when I come.”</span> <span id="s2686">And she said, “What?</span> <span id="s2687">You’re going to feed your child food from the can, or from a jar?</span> <span id="s2688">Is that what you do in the United States?</span> <span id="s2689">We never did things like that.”</span> <span id="s2690">I said, “Well, everybody here uses this kind of food for babies.”</span> <span id="s2691">“No,” she said, “when you come here, we’re gonna cook for the baby.</span> <span id="s2692">We’re have -- I bought a meal, I’m gonna mush everything.”</span> <span id="s2693">So she cooked for her, everything was hand -- I me -- puréed, and prepared the way she knew how to do it, yeah.</span> <span id="s2694">That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2695">Q: The best.</span></p> <p><span id="s2696">A: The best.</span> <span id="s2697">She -- right, the best.</span> <span id="s2698">She was a great caretaker, great caretaker.</span> <span id="s2699">She was -- they had fun with Sarah.</span> <span id="s2700">They borrowed a playpen, so we will put her in the middle of the living room, you know, and we’ll enjoy her just playing around.</span> <span id="s2701">And that was great for them.</span> <span id="s2702">I’m -- I’m so glad that she saw at least one gr-grandchild, because she died in 1962, so she had not seen Maya and Nicole.</span> <span id="s2703">My father saw all three, because a year after my mother died, I went with Maya.</span> <span id="s2704">Maya was a year old then.</span> <span id="s2705">And also my grand -- my nephew was being Bar Mitzvahed, so we went.</span> <span id="s2706">So he saw them.</span> <span id="s2707">And then when he was quite sick I took Nicole, who was about three.</span> <span id="s2708">And he saw Nicole, too.</span> <span id="s2709">So he saw all three grandchildren.</span> <span id="s2710">It’s hard when you’re that far away, yeah.</span> <span id="s2711">My mother died in 1962, and by then she was quite broken, quite depressed, quite desperate, I guess, so she committed suicide.</span> <span id="s2712">Which was a terrible [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2713">Q: How did she -- how did she die?</span></p> <p><span id="s2714">A: She committed suicide, she took an overdose of something called belladonna, which is -- it’s a stimulant, a heart stimulant.</span> <span id="s2715">They don’t use it any more, because it’s so powerful.</span> <span id="s2716">I was in the United States, so I learned it from the unites -- here.</span> <span id="s2717">And I was not able to go to the funeral, because we lived in California at the time, Sarah was a baby, she was like two years old, I mean she was -- I couldn’t leave her with anybody.</span> <span id="s2718">And so -- we didn’t have the money also to -- you know, to travel from California to Greece.</span> <span id="s2719">So, it was -- you know, when I went back in ’63 with Maya and Sarah, Sarah was three, three and a half, and Maya was one at the time, or before one.</span> <span id="s2720">She celebrated her first birthday in Greece.</span> <span id="s2721">That was like a year and a half after my mother had died.</span> <span id="s2722">Everybody came to the airport, my sister, my father, and my aunts.</span> <span id="s2723">Friends of mine came, and my friends told me later that they wanted to be there to greet me because they knew that since my mother wasn’t there, they didn’t want me to feel the void, which I did feel the void.</span> <span id="s2724">But you see, I lived in her house -- actually it wasn’t the same house that I left to come to United States from, because after my mother died, and my father moved to -- to a smaller apartment near my sister.</span> <span id="s2725">So I’ve never been to this apartment before, but I was still looking for her.</span> <span id="s2726">So it was like I was grieving for her, two and a half year -- one and a half years later, where everybody was finally coming to terms a little bit with it.</span> <span id="s2727">And it was a very awkward kind of situation because it -- although it wasn’t the same house, this was the same furniture, the same pictures, all these kinds of things.</span> <span id="s2728">And she wasn’t there, you know?</span> <span id="s2729">It was -- it was a difficult visit, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2730">Q: Your -- your grief would be greatest and theirs was beginning to heal, I suppose, by then.</span></p> <p><span id="s2731">A: Well, I didn’t begin to heal like 20 years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s2732">Q: No, I meant that the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2733">A: Oh, the other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s2734">Q: -- you’d -- you’d not been able -- such a pity you’d not been able to be with them to grieve together.</span></p> <p><span id="s2735">A: Oh, that’s right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2736">Q: And then they would be coming to terms with losing your mother at that time when you went back and were confronting it perhaps most fully.</span></p> <p><span id="s2737">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2738">That’s right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2739">Q: What was going on in her life when she died?</span> <span id="s2740">I mean, were there -- was it just a gradual sliding into greater depression, or was there something else that wer -- was happening that made her feel she didn’t want to go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s2741">A: Yeah, I think it was a gradual depression.</span> <span id="s2742">I think -- I think that she saw no future to anything.</span> <span id="s2743">You know, I think depression -- and we are talking about clinical depression, we are not talking about just having the blues, it -- if it’s not addressed, that’s how it -- it ends up.</span> <span id="s2744">And those days, you know, people didn’t understand depression, I think they don’t understand depression even today in many ways.</span> <span id="s2745">Greece is not a -- a place where people, you know, understand these kind of things.</span> <span id="s2746">Certainly nobody in the family understood the enormity of it.</span> <span id="s2747">I think she did see a doctor, who maybe put her on antidepressants or something, but that was shortly before she died.</span> <span id="s2748">So, it was not a long therapy before that.</span> <span id="s2749">You know, she just didn’t have -- she had lost the -- the zest for life.</span> <span id="s2750">Everything seemed to be just enormous for her, even if I would say, well, can my friends stay for dinner, and this was a friend she knew, and somebody, you know, she didn’t have to particularly make something special, it seemed like it was too much for her.</span> <span id="s2751">Or they had to move from one apartment to the other because the lease expired and this man was raising the price.</span> <span id="s2752">And that was a tremendous thing for her, to -- to have to move again.</span> <span id="s2753">To -- to pack, to organize.</span> <span id="s2754">I mean, she had moved many times in her life, so things become enormous all of a sudden.</span> <span id="s2755">I mean, the slightest thing becomes enormous.</span> <span id="s2756">And I think she just couldn’t deal with any of that any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s2757">Q: Did she talk about her -- I mean, did she leave a note, ho -- I mean -- how do you know that she committed suicide?</span></p> <p><span id="s2758">A: She left a note -- well, first of all, you know, all these pills were missing from -- from the bottle, and the bottle was next to her bedside.</span> <span id="s2759">Her -- she left a note, but it wasn’t found until a month later, or something like this, which was a note left to my father and to my sister.</span> <span id="s2760">And basically she was telling my father that, you know, what are we waiting -- I mean, what does life have to offer us any more?</span> <span id="s2761">We -- our children are married, they are taken care of.</span> <span id="s2762">You know, there’s nothing really to hold us here any more.</span> <span id="s2763">And another thing she was telling Yola is to take care of me, because I’m her little sister, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2764">Q: So sad, depression, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2765">A: It is sad, yeah.</span> <span id="s2766">I was reading her last letter to me a couple of days ago, which I received in California after she died.</span> <span id="s2767">Because she died April 11th, and I think this was written like the eighth of April.</span> <span id="s2768">And I was trying to di -- I’ve -- I’ve read that letter many times, because I’m trying to -- to determine what is in this letter that I could have deciphered that she was suicidal.</span> <span id="s2769">And there is nothing in that letter that -- all she says is that now she’s eating a little better, she has a little more appetite, that Yola takes her to the doctor, that she is glad I’m not there to -- to -- to see all the difficulties my father is going through -- she’s still protecting me.</span> <span id="s2770">And she talks a little bit about the future, like, you know, send me a picture of Sarah or something like that, which is, you know, like looking forward to something, right?</span> <span id="s2771">Although she says in the note that there’s nothing to look forward to.</span> <span id="s2772">Maybe three days before she had not decided to end her life, who knows?</span> <span id="s2773">But I’ve read -- I’ve read that letter over and over trying to -- I’ve taken -- it took me a long time to come to terms with this, I’d say 20 years.</span> <span id="s2774">It’s a long time.</span> <span id="s2775">And as I said, I’m in a wonderful profession that I can have access to all sorts of material.</span> <span id="s2776">I’ve gone to s-seminars, to workshops, I mean, conferences.</span> <span id="s2777">And I always, for a long time, when I was trying to resolve this, I was getting into workshops that had to do with suicide, because there, you know, I mean there is a variety of workshops, and some of them had to do with suicide.</span> <span id="s2778">Aftermaths of suicide, survivors of -- of people who have suicided.</span> <span id="s2779">Professionals who survived the suicide of a client.</span> <span id="s2780">You know, all sorts of things.</span> <span id="s2781">So, i -- I was almost like drunk when I was getting all this material, which I have really read, and studied, and thought about, and worked at it.</span> <span id="s2782">And you know, i-it’s something that sticks with you.</span> <span id="s2783">It doesn’t -- it’s -- because it’s not a -- a natural death, it’s not a death that, you know, like somebody gets old and dies.</span> <span id="s2784">It’s just horrible to deal with.</span> <span id="s2785">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2786">Q: How have you come to terms with it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2787">A: I think by going to these workshops, and by -- by reading a lot.</span> <span id="s2788">I didn’t talk about it for almost 20 years, so that was, I think -- then I decided that I needed to go to therapy and resolve it, so that’s what I did.</span> <span id="s2789">And this woman was extremely helpful.</span> <span id="s2790">We talked a lot about my mother.</span> <span id="s2791">She asked me, because I was telling her I was -- End of Tape Six, Side A Beginning Tape Six, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s2792">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Paulette Nehama.</span> <span id="s2793">This is tape number six, side B.</span> <span id="s2794">You were telling me how you found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2795">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s2796">I had an aunt who lived in New York, and I think my brother-in-law called her to call Isaac, because they didn’t know our telephone number in California.</span> <span id="s2797">And she called Isaac at the office to tell him.</span> <span id="s2798">They didn’t call me direct to tell me.</span> <span id="s2799">So Isaac came home early, and then he asked me to sit down next to him, and he said, “I have to tell you, Mother died.”</span> <span id="s2800">And when he said Mother died, I thought he was talking about his mother.</span> <span id="s2801">And I’m thinking, why is he telling me his mother died, she died, you know, in the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2802">Why now he tells me this?</span> <span id="s2803">I know, and I said, “I know.”</span> <span id="s2804">You know, like I was trying to figure it out.</span> <span id="s2805">He said, “No, not my mother, your mother died.”</span> <span id="s2806">But he -- he said nothing about suicide.</span> <span id="s2807">He told me that she died, and you know, it was something I just couldn’t grasp, I just couldn’t get in my head.</span> <span id="s2808">So it took me a couple of days to absorb it.</span> <span id="s2809">Then I got a letter -- then I called home.</span> <span id="s2810">And I think it was -- you know, your mind gets kind of blocked in situations like this.</span> <span id="s2811">Because I called, and it was after the funeral, so I spoke to my father, and my father said, “We lost Thaliki,” -- Thalia was my mother’s name.</span> <span id="s2812">Thaliki is like a diminutive.</span> <span id="s2813">And he said, “We lost Thaliki,” and here I’m thinking, you lost her, why don’t you look for her?</span> <span id="s2814">You know, why don’t you go find her, call the police or something.</span> <span id="s2815">I didn’t tell him that, but that was the thought that went through my mind.</span> <span id="s2816">So it was -- it was very differ -- difficult to be that very far away.</span> <span id="s2817">And then my sister sent me a letter, I asked her to -- to tell me what happened, and she sent me her -- a long, long letter, with all the details, which I brought it to therapy, and wrote it -- I mean, read it there.</span> <span id="s2818">And that was quite earthshaking and w -- and I was trying to avoid reading that in therapy, and -- because the letter is in Greek, so I told my therapist I cannot do it, it’s in Greece, you want -- Greek, you don’t understand anything.</span> <span id="s2819">Said, “That’s all right, you will translate.”</span> <span id="s2820">Which of course I did.</span> <span id="s2821">It was a very hard session, she cried, too.</span> <span id="s2822">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2823">Q: And the distance would be so -- so painful, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s2824">A: Oh, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s2825">It was -- it was hard, because you know, I couldn’t communicate other than a letter that used to take 10 days to arrive.</span> <span id="s2826">And phone was not so -- you know, nowadays you can call, and it doesn’t cost that much.</span> <span id="s2827">Those days, I mean, phone calls to Greece were very expensive, and I think we talked a couple of times on the phone, I spoke with my father, with Yola.</span> <span id="s2828">And everybody there were thinking how am I gonna cope with being alone here, and not having a support system.</span> <span id="s2829">So that was -- then on top of that, two days later, Isaac came to Washington because he had an interview with Bellcom.</span> <span id="s2830">And this was prearranged of course, and that interview was important, so he left and he came here.</span> <span id="s2831">And while he was gone, I got a call from a teacher of mine who happened to be in New York.</span> <span id="s2832">She had no idea my mother died, but she called me just to say hello, and to say how are you doing.</span> <span id="s2833">And I’m saying to her -- she’s calling from new -- from New York, and I’m saying, you know, my mother died, and there are tears coming down [indecipherable] poor woman, I mean, she didn’t know what to do over the phone.</span> <span id="s2834">So -- but that’s -- it was a point of connection with somebody I knew, that I could tell some.</span> <span id="s2835">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2836">Q: Which you needed so desperately, I -- I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s2837">A: Right, right, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s2838">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2839">Q: You must have thought about this a lot, but do you think there was any connection that we can draw between the Holocaust and your mother’s sufferings, hiding, losing almost everything, and her depression and death, or do you think that perhaps -- no, you tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2840">A: Well, actually, I don’t know, because there are a -- a lot of people who -- who went through the Holocaust and did not commit suicide.</span> <span id="s2841">So, you cannot pin it just on that.</span> <span id="s2842">I think there are many factors that go into something like this.</span> <span id="s2843">It’s not only one thing.</span> <span id="s2844">You cannot say that it was just because of that, but certainly it has played -- I mean, the war and the Holocaust have played a major part in her lowt -- outlook to life.</span> <span id="s2845">So, you know, it’s not one thing, but it definitely did have something to do with it, yeah.</span> <span id="s2846">But here again, there are lots of people who have gone through difficulties, or maybe even harder things, and still are alive.</span> <span id="s2847">So, part of it is her make-up, I think.</span> <span id="s2848">You know, there isn’t a single answer.</span> <span id="s2849">There is no single answer, and that’s the hardest thing in dealing with that, that you can’t find an answer to say, well, I’ll pinpoint that this was it.</span> <span id="s2850">There isn’t.</span> <span id="s2851">It’s a combination of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2852">Q: Now you told me about therapy when -- and -- and reading the letter from your sister telling you of your mother’s suicide, but what was it that helped you come to terms with it?</span> <span id="s2853">Was it just accepting it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2854">A: Yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s2855">That it was her decision, although this is not a decision I would choose for myself, because I don’t want to leave this kind of legacy to my children.</span> <span id="s2856">But here again, I’m a different person, other factors go into my life, so who knows?</span> <span id="s2857">I think time has also something to do with it.</span> <span id="s2858">Education about the subject has a lot to do with it.</span> <span id="s2859">And I really have researched the subject in any possible way.</span> <span id="s2860">I once thought of running a group of people who survived the suicide of someone.</span> <span id="s2861">And then I decided maybe I wasn’t ready to do that, because i have to be a little more detached from it, and I didn’t feel I was that detached yet, when I wanted to do the group.</span></p> <p><span id="s2862">Q: Tell me about the areas that you have focused on in your work.</span> <span id="s2863">We really -- we’ve really, in these hours of interviewing, we talked about your early work in Athens, and we’ve mentioned here and there your social work, but we’ve not addressed it in any detail.</span> <span id="s2864">We talked about your interview too, when you were -- before having your first baby, when you might have returned to doing more work then, but so we -- le -- let’s go back and have you pick up how you resumed your career, as the girls were growing up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2865">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s2866">Okay, well, as I said, I worked for the International Social Service in New York for a short period of time, a few months, which was a job I liked, and fitted me like a glove, it was perfect, because it was dealing with Greek adoptions, and people I knew from Greece I had to communicate with.</span> <span id="s2867">Anyway, well after Sarah was born, I did not work any more.</span> <span id="s2868">I -- and after the other children were born I stayed home.</span> <span id="s2869">I was involved in Brownies, and maybe school activities and things like that.</span> <span id="s2870">Actually I did work in the evenings, when I think Nicole was in kindergarten, for Garfinkels -- part time -- this was my part time job.</span> <span id="s2871">And it was primarily because I needed to do something, and I needed to do something very part time.</span> <span id="s2872">But I -- I could start exploring other things.</span> <span id="s2873">But I always wanted to go back to social work, because this was a field that always interests me.</span> <span id="s2874">I mean, I’m interested in people, and their lives, and what makes them tick, and what’s -- how they conduct their lives, what’s in their lives, what influence their lives.</span> <span id="s2875">So, I had a Bachelor’s degree from Greece, from Pierce College, which was an American school.</span> <span id="s2876">And I knew I couldn’t do very much, but when Nicole went to first grade, I -- I thought seriously of getting a job in social work.</span> <span id="s2877">And somebody told me about the Jewish Social Service in Rockville, that they were looking for a social worker at the department of aging, I think.</span> <span id="s2878">And I called, and verified that indeed they did need somebody, asked me to send my resume, which I did, and they called me back, they wanted me to go for an interview, which was terrific.</span> <span id="s2879">Well, I did go to the interview, but I went a day earlier than the interview was scheduled, like I was not anxious, I guess.</span> <span id="s2880">And then I realized when I’m there, because the receptionist looks at [indecipherable] says, “You know, I don’t have you down for today.</span> <span id="s2881">I think your interview’s tomorrow.”</span> <span id="s2882">I’m protesting, I said, “No, no, it’s today at 10 o’clock.”</span> <span id="s2883">And then I realized I’m wrong, but then I’m thinking if I tell them I’m wrong, they’ll never hire me.</span> <span id="s2884">So anyway, the assistant director who was to interview me, Marty Moss was his name, he -- he said to me, “I thought this interview was tomorrow, but anyway since you’re here, I have 10 minutes because I have to go into a meeting.</span> <span id="s2885">Let’s just discuss a few minutes of what is available, and what you can do [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2886">And maybe we’ll have to have a second interview at one time.”</span> <span id="s2887">Well, he’s telling me that the opening is at the Department of Aging in the Jewish Social Service.</span> <span id="s2888">Now, I know nothing about aging.</span> <span id="s2889">I’ve never worked with older people, I don’t know what to do with them.</span> <span id="s2890">I want to work with children.</span> <span id="s2891">Anyway, I said okay.</span> <span id="s2892">And then I get a call from the chairperson of the Department of Aging to go for a second interview.</span> <span id="s2893">And I’m thinking, do I really want to work with older people?</span> <span id="s2894">I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s2895">But anyway, it was an entrance.</span> <span id="s2896">So I think the question that really, she asked me, was -- I had done some volunteer work for the Jewish Community Center, we were doing some kind of a woman’s day, and I had chosen the older women, and I had done, you know, some -- a presentation about it, and gathered material, and we had the show, a -- a fashion show for older women, you know, because we felt they were neglected in the fashion, things like that.</span> <span id="s2897">Which went very well, actually.</span> <span id="s2898">And I was telling her about that, and she said, “You’d be perfect for the department”.</span> <span id="s2899">And I’m thinking, you don’t know -- I don’t either, I don’t know anything.</span> <span id="s2900">But anyway, they hired me.</span> <span id="s2901">And I was excited, and I thought well, I’ll learn.</span> <span id="s2902">If I don’t like it, I can always leave.</span> <span id="s2903">So that was how I started, and once I started working with older people, I just loved it.</span> <span id="s2904">I found it so rewarding.</span> <span id="s2905">You know, here I was, always wanted to work with children, and now I’m finding the other end of life more interesting, actually, and very rewarding.</span> <span id="s2906">So it was great, it was a great team to work with.</span> <span id="s2907">It was a good a -- very good agency, very good camaraderie and professionalism.</span> <span id="s2908">And I enjoy every minute of it, and I stayed there.</span> <span id="s2909">I think I started in ’74, and stayed until 1990.</span> <span id="s2910">That’s a long time.</span> <span id="s2911">And while I was working there -- I always wanted to do therapy, and I had taken some courses, and then while I was at the Jewish Social Service, the -- my department chair said, “Paulette, you’ve got to get your Master’s degree.</span> <span id="s2912">You are doing things that Master’s degree social workers are doing, but we can’t pay you as a Master’s degree social worker.”</span> <span id="s2913">So finally I thought about it, and thought about it, and I’ve never been to an American university, I was 49 years old.</span> <span id="s2914">So when I told a friend, I said, “I’m 49, how am I gonna go to school?”</span> <span id="s2915">She said, “You’ll be 49 whether you go or not, just go.”</span> <span id="s2916">So finally I talked it over with Isaac, I said I would need a lot of help.</span> <span id="s2917">This was a time that Maya had started driving, and she said, “I’ll help, I’ll help, I’ll do all your [indecipherable] driving for you.”</span> <span id="s2918">So everybody pitched in and I did go to school.</span> <span id="s2919">They accepted me as an advanced standing student because of my experience with social work.</span> <span id="s2920">They waived ce -- certain courses the first semester, and they waived field placement the first semester, because I was still working for the Jewish Social Service part time.</span> <span id="s2921">So my first year was much lighter than the other students here.</span> <span id="s2922">Second year was harder, I had to -- to quit working for the Jewish Social Service, because I couldn’t handle everything, because I did have a field placement, and I had an excellent supervisor.</span> <span id="s2923">It was in a psychiatric clinic, a community psychiatric clinic in Witten.</span> <span id="s2924">And I got excellent experience, I had a wonderful supervisor, Meedul Shore.</span> <span id="s2925">And of course I had the classes, you know, I had to go to school, and plus the family.</span> <span id="s2926">Sarah was already in college, Maya and Nicole were home.</span> <span id="s2927">So it was hard writing papers, I’ve never written a paper in this country.</span> <span id="s2928">I mean, I’ve written papers in Greece, but they were different.</span> <span id="s2929">It was a little hard, because as I said, this was a new experience for me.</span> <span id="s2930">I didn’t even know how to use the library.</span> <span id="s2931">I had to ask how to use the library.</span> <span id="s2932">It was a lot of work, an awful lot of work, but I loved every minute of it, because I felt I was doing it because I wanted to do it.</span> <span id="s2933">And I graduated with a Master’s in 1991.</span> <span id="s2934">And I went back to the Jewish Social Service, and -- but at the time they had a part time job only available, and they said, “Come, it’s part time, if something opens as full time, we’ll get you as full time.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2935">Q: I was just going to ask your -- your Master’s degree is in -- is it --</span></p> <p><span id="s2936">A: Social work</span></p> <p><span id="s2937">Q: -- social work at Catholic University?</span></p> <p><span id="s2938">A: Uh-huh, right, yeah.</span> <span id="s2939">1991.</span> <span id="s2940">And while I was working for the Jewish Social Service, my supervisor at the community psychiatric clinic, called me one day, and he said, “You know, there is a psychiatrist who is looking for a social worker to work for him to do intakes.</span> <span id="s2941">Are you interested?”</span> <span id="s2942">And I said, “I’m interested, but I’m not leaving Jewish Social Service.”</span> <span id="s2943">So he says, “I’ll have him call you.”</span> <span id="s2944">So he calls me, and he says he’s looking for a social worker to do his intakes.</span> <span id="s2945">Intakes are, you know, you -- you g -- see the person for the first time, you collect all the information, and then you give it to him, and then he determines the treatment and this kind of thing.</span> <span id="s2946">But it’s an elaborate process, I mean, the interviews have to be quite long, and to understand the problem, and this kind of thing.</span> <span id="s2947">So when he called me, I was leaving for Arizona the next day.</span> <span id="s2948">It was one of Isaac’s retreats.</span> <span id="s2949">So I said to him, “I’m leaving for a week.”</span> <span id="s2950">He said, “Send me your resume, and then we’ll talk when you come back.”</span> <span id="s2951">I came back, he said, “Come and see me.”</span> <span id="s2952">So I went to see him, we -- he decided to hire me.</span> <span id="s2953">So I was working for him part time, and I stayed with him 11 years.</span> <span id="s2954">I was working both at the Jewish Social Service, and with him.</span> <span id="s2955">His name is Aaron Burger, he is in Silver Spring, very nice man.</span> <span id="s2956">So that was a very good experience, too, because he is a good supervisor also, and a very good -- good friend, also, he became.</span></p> <p><span id="s2957">Q: Ho-How would you split your time, how many hours would you work at each place?</span> <span id="s2958">A: Well, since I was working half time at the Jewish Social Service, actually I would go -- I would work one evening for him, and I would see four or five people, once a week.</span> <span id="s2959">Then I would, on my days off from the Jewish Social Service, I would go to his office, and see people.</span> <span id="s2960">But he also gave me some people from -- for treatment, some cases that didn’t require his skills, you know.</span> <span id="s2961">And then, when I quit Jewish Social Service in 1990, because Isaac was retiring, and I -- we were thinking a lot about traveling to Europe and all that kind of stuff, I left Jewish Social Service, and continued working with him for -- until after Ian was born, and then I told him I wanted to spend time with my grandson.</span> <span id="s2962">And that was it.</span> <span id="s2963">Which he fully understood, and -- because he has grandchildren of his own.</span> <span id="s2964">And I’m friends with his wife, and his daughter, we became quite good friends.</span> <span id="s2965">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2966">Q: How did you feel about your career?</span></p> <p><span id="s2967">A: I love my career.</span> <span id="s2968">And now I’m working -- for awhile I didn’t work, after I left Dr. Burger, but then I worked for -- also part time as a contract worker for a company called Aging Network Services, which is located in Bethesda.</span> <span id="s2969">They’ve been in business for 20 years.</span> <span id="s2970">It’s run by two social workers, and they needed a Master’s degree social worker to supervise social workers who do care managers, and do care management.</span> <span id="s2971">Coordinating services, and seeing families, and this kind of thing.</span> <span id="s2972">And I’m still with them, very part time, but I love doing it.</span> <span id="s2973">I mean, I -- I do enjoy my career, my career is just the best career for me, anyway.</span> <span id="s2974">It’s great.</span> <span id="s2975">Once I was thinking that I may want to change careers at times, because sometimes people’s problems become too big, and you wonder how good you are at it or not, in helping.</span> <span id="s2976">But I think this was a phase I had gone through, so I decided to take a catering course, cause I love to cook, and I thought well, maybe I’ll do that professionally.</span> <span id="s2977">But I did take the course, I got the certificate, I enjoyed the course, but I haven’t opened a catering thing.</span> <span id="s2978">Isaac wasn’t too happy for me to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2979">Q: Maybe you’ll -- well, you must have thought about this, but it almost seems as if all these different strands, or yarns, life experiences come together to make you -- or to equip you to do one thing very well.</span> <span id="s2980">And maybe you’ve -- maybe you’ve -- maybe you see that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2981">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2982">I think, you know, your past experiences, I mean your history, your past history informs your present, right?</span> <span id="s2983">And I think I am who I am because of my past experiences, and my make-up, of course, but yes, I’ve learned through my experiences.</span> <span id="s2984">And I think my work relates very well to my experiences of other people.</span> <span id="s2985">Because somebody was asking me what are the major things that you understand about a client.</span> <span id="s2986">And I said, “I understand culture, and different culture.</span> <span id="s2987">I understand suffering.</span> <span id="s2988">I understand hardships.</span> <span id="s2989">I understand moving away from a country, and from family, and going to another country and starting to make a life there.</span> <span id="s2990">I understand loneliness, lonesomeness.</span> <span id="s2991">I understand raising children, I understand having a husband and working with him, and you know, with his difficulties, and all that kind of stuff.”</span> <span id="s2992">So I understand these things.</span> <span id="s2993">Somehow I -- they come instinctively now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2994">Q: You’re still -- your -- you’re not in regular employment at the moment, but you are still d -- doing what seems to be very important work, still arranging, and organizing, and making things happen.</span> <span id="s2995">I base that on you having mentioned getting performing artists t-to perform regularly for the elderly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2996">A: Seniors.</span> <span id="s2997">Yeah, this is volunteer work.</span> <span id="s2998">I mean, my work for the Aging Network Services is -- is paid work.</span> <span id="s2999">I’m a member of WPAS, or Washington Performing Arts Society, the women’s committee, and the women’s committee has several subcommittees.</span> <span id="s3000">And one of the committees I co-chair with another woman, is called Enriching Experiences for Seniors, that started about 10 or 12 years ago.</span> <span id="s3001">And what we do is we bring local artists to senior centers, nursing homes, assisted livings, recreation centers for senior adults.</span> <span id="s3002">What we do is just we coordinate these things.</span> <span id="s3003">You have to coordinate the center, find the activities director, the date, coordinate the artist, and the days they are available to do this kind of things.</span> <span id="s3004">And also provide the volunteers from the women’s committee who go to audit the performance, because this way they give us feedback on the artists and the interaction between the -- all the people and the artists, so we’ll know whether to hire them for next year or not.</span> <span id="s3005">This is a free program to the community -- I mean, the seniors don’t pay anything for this.</span> <span id="s3006">WPAS has a budget for the senior program.</span> <span id="s3007">And that’s what I do in addition to working for the gala, which is a [indecipherable] event, fundraising event, or the auction, or the embassy adoption program, which is another women’s committee program, where embassies adopt school, and the -- for the semester, or for the year, and the children study about that particular country.</span> <span id="s3008">And I usually choose Greece.</span> <span id="s3009">So the children -- the school that chooses Greece, and the embassy, I’m the liaison between the two of them.</span> <span id="s3010">So we go -- the representative for the Greek embassy, or the other embassies go to the school, talk to the children about it.</span> <span id="s3011">The children study about Greece, and work with the teachers, we work with the teachers, and then at the end of the semester, they put up a presentation, the embassy invites them for -- for cookies and juice, or whatever.</span> <span id="s3012">And they give a presentation to the ambassador, or the staff members of the embassy.</span> <span id="s3013">And then we take the children to a Greek restaurant, so they can taste a little food.</span> <span id="s3014">These are sixth graders, they are 12 years old, and they are wonderful.</span> <span id="s3015">This -- I mean, 50 embassies participate in this -- in this program, and it’s a fantastic program for teachers and children.</span> <span id="s3016">The teachers love this program because the children learn so much through that program about the other countries.</span> <span id="s3017">And it’s very educational, it’s a fun program, it’s just great.</span> <span id="s3018">So I love doing Greece, as you understand.</span> <span id="s3019">Last year there were -- the Greek embassy was between ambassadors, so they didn’t have time to participate in the program, so they were not there.</span> <span id="s3020">So I did the embassy of the Bahamas, which was also a nice experience, you know, and I went to a school pretty far away in someplace -- I think it was northeast Washington.</span> <span id="s3021">And the wife of the ambassador came to the school, they had -- they invited the children to their embassy of the Bahamas.</span> <span id="s3022">They had the presentation, they provided lunch at the embassy, from the whole class.</span> <span id="s3023">It was a good experience.</span> <span id="s3024">I mean, to -- to -- somehow I feel that, you know, just doing Greece every year kind of limits me to other countries, because people tell me wonderful things about the embassy of Israel, you know, and Thailand or other countries.</span> <span id="s3025">But I love Greece, so I’ll do anything to promote Greece, and to -- and teach children about it.</span> <span id="s3026">There is so much.</span> <span id="s3027">And next year it’s going to be an important year because of the Olympics, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s3028">Q: Have you ever thought about the similarities between your mother when she -- End of Tape Six, Side B Beginning Tape Seven, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s3029">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Paulette Nehama.</span> <span id="s3030">This is tape number seven, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s3031">A: Seven.</span> <span id="s3032">You were asking?</span></p> <p><span id="s3033">Q: You d -- I was -- I was thinking back to your mother in Volos, and her community activities, and thinking of things that you are doing in your new community, maybe following in a family tradition.</span></p> <p><span id="s3034">A: Oh sure.</span> <span id="s3035">They’re different things, but yes, the sense of community was very strong in my family, and giving to the community.</span> <span id="s3036">My mother volunteered, there was a Jewish organization in Volos, a women’s organization, she volunteered that -- there.</span> <span id="s3037">She volunteered at the orphanage in Volos.</span> <span id="s3038">There was an orphan -- not a Jewish orphanage, an orphanage in Volos, and sometimes she would take me with her.</span> <span id="s3039">And I loved going with her, and talking with the children there, but I was also petrified that if my mother and father were to die, I would end up in that orphanage.</span> <span id="s3040">I was so scared of that, of them dying and me being in the orphanage.</span> <span id="s3041">And I remember when I had this visit in Volos, when it was like the 50 year reunion I was telling you, Yola and I had taken a taxi to go to the Jewish cemetery, because our grandparents are buried there.</span> <span id="s3042">So as we are passing, the driver -- the taxi driver says, “And here is, on the left is the orphanage.”</span> <span id="s3043">And I said to him, “Stop!”</span> <span id="s3044">And he scratches on his brakes, and he stops the taxi.</span> <span id="s3045">And he said, “What happened?”</span> <span id="s3046">I said, “Stop, I want to see this orphanage.”</span> <span id="s3047">It seemed so small to me.</span> <span id="s3048">I said, “Is this the same orphanage that was here?”</span> <span id="s3049">“Oh yeah,” he said, “nothing has changed.</span> <span id="s3050">They just painted it, but it’s the same thing.”</span> <span id="s3051">It looked so tiny.</span> <span id="s3052">I mean, I remember it like a big place, with a big yard.</span> <span id="s3053">It’s -- it’s so funny when you see things as an adult, and how you see things as a child, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3054">Q: What has happened to all the family members?</span> <span id="s3055">Tell me, as we wind down to a conclusion about your -- your m -- mother and your father’s siblings, and where they are now, or where the f --</span></p> <p><span id="s3056">A: Yeah</span></p> <p><span id="s3057">Q: -- what happened to the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s3058">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s3059">As I told you, my parents were first cousins, so my father was the second child, and first son.</span> <span id="s3060">There were five children in his family.</span> <span id="s3061">His mother was the eldest of seven children.</span> <span id="s3062">My grandparents had seven children, two girls.</span> <span id="s3063">First one, my paternal grandmother, last one my maternal grandmother, and there were boys in between.</span> <span id="s3064">So there were five children in my father’s family.</span> <span id="s3065">Abusta was the eldest, my father was the second, there were two girls, and Saould, or Sauld was the youngest, who was born in 19 -- I think he was born 1909, or 1910.</span> <span id="s3066">So he was like an afterthought.</span> <span id="s3067">He was much younger compared to the other siblings in the family.</span> <span id="s3068">Well, none of them are alive.</span> <span id="s3069">They all went to hiding in different places.</span> <span id="s3070">My fourth aunt, the fourth child in the family was the only one who survived until 1976, I think.</span> <span id="s3071">She came to the United States.</span> <span id="s3072">She was adopted by an uncle, the brother of -- of her mother, who was married, and they couldn’t have any children.</span> <span id="s3073">So Connie used to go to their house, and they had her there, and they played with her, and they loved her, they absolutely were in love with her.</span> <span id="s3074">And they decided to come -- to go to Teriester first.</span> <span id="s3075">So they asked if they could take her along.</span> <span id="s3076">And they did, and then they decided they wanted to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s3077">I mean, the uncle, and his wife.</span> <span id="s3078">So they went back to Greece, and I don’t know if it’s an official adoption, whether there were papers of adoption taken.</span> <span id="s3079">But somehow it seems like the family, or the parents, anyway, decided to -- to let her go with the uncle, because they felt she will have a wonderful life in the United States, and not in Volos.</span> <span id="s3080">So she came to the United States, and she didn’t know she was adopted until much, much later in life.</span> <span id="s3081">She was an adult, I think, when she found out about that.</span> <span id="s3082">She got married, and had a son, whom I see, Bob Guburbon.</span> <span id="s3083">My aunt died in, I think, ’70 -- let me see, no, she must have died in ’76 or ’77, yeah, in Florida.</span> <span id="s3084">And her husband died a few years later.</span> <span id="s3085">I see her grand -- h-her son, often.</span> <span id="s3086">This aunt, Connie, send us care packages after the war was over, with food, with clothes.</span> <span id="s3087">She would send fancy party clothes for me, and they looked so funny, because you know, I mean, here I didn’t have any clothes, and I had a -- an organza dress, old dress.</span> <span id="s3088">And she would send some cans, I mean, chocolates.</span> <span id="s3089">And she once sent shoes for my father.</span> <span id="s3090">I remember they were so huge.</span> <span id="s3091">I mean, my father was a tall and big man, and these shoes were tremendous for him.</span> <span id="s3092">I mean, he couldn’t wear them.</span> <span id="s3093">And she sended a teddy bear for me.</span> <span id="s3094">So I always remember her, you know, for doing these things.</span> <span id="s3095">Of course, I met her when I came to the United States.</span> <span id="s3096">But I mean, she had never met her siblings.</span> <span id="s3097">She was in touch with them.</span> <span id="s3098">I don’t know if she was in touch with them before the war, but after the war, I mean, she came through with sending care packages.</span> <span id="s3099">And then, of course, they were corresponding with -- ‘scuse me -- with my father, and he was the one who would tell the news, you know, t-to -- to his sisters.</span> <span id="s3100">And my Aunt Julia corresponded with her, because Julia had come to the United States to visit her son who was studying, and has seen Connie.</span> <span id="s3101">Now, my father’s younger brother, Saul was hiding in somebody’s house, I think the name was aseema -- Aseemomeetees.</span> <span id="s3102">And there were two daughters and a son, maybe two sons.</span> <span id="s3103">And he fell in love with the oldest daughter, and she with him.</span> <span id="s3104">Saul was a handsome, beautiful man.</span> <span id="s3105">And after the war was over, they kept on seeing each other, and dating each other, and they wanted to get married, but of course she was Christian Orthodox, and the rabbi wouldn’t marry them, she had to convert.</span> <span id="s3106">So she took all the lessons that she needed to do to convert.</span> <span id="s3107">But then there was a little detail which I don’t remember now, and they decided they were gonna go to France, and get married in Paris.</span> <span id="s3108">So they did go to Paris and got married, and came back to live in Athens.</span> <span id="s3109">And she knew more about Jewish holidays than any of us did.</span> <span id="s3110">My mother didn’t know them, and she would call -- Deena, was her name.</span> <span id="s3111">Deena would call my mother and say, “Do you know that today is,” such and such a holiday.</span> <span id="s3112">My mother would say, “Oh, really?”</span> <span id="s3113">I mean, we observed the big holidays, but not the little ones.</span> <span id="s3114">And Deena knew everything.</span> <span id="s3115">And -- but unfortunately, a few months later, in 1950 -- I think they married ’49, or beginning of ’50 -- or ’51 I think it was, he got cancer, a brain tumor.</span> <span id="s3116">And they went to Paris and he had surgery and died.</span> <span id="s3117">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s3118">It was devastating.</span> <span id="s3119">He was 40 or 41, very young.</span> <span id="s3120">A life, you know, just got done so young.</span> <span id="s3121">And of course Deena was totally, totally devastated.</span> <span id="s3122">Now, many years later she remarried, but she divorced, this marriage didn’t go that well.</span> <span id="s3123">Then many years later she married somebody who was living in the United States, in Florida, so -- a -- a -- a Greek, but I think he -- he was Greek American, or someth like that, and he went -- they -- they lived in Florida.</span> <span id="s3124">She couldn’t stand it, she didn’t like Florida, she didn’t like America.</span> <span id="s3125">So she divorced him too, and she went back to Greece, and now she -- she lives alone.</span> <span id="s3126">When I go to Greece she comes and sees me.</span> <span id="s3127">She -- she is very warm, very lovely.</span> <span id="s3128">I went to -- to volunteer nursing school at the Red Cross in Greece with her sister, her younger sister.</span> <span id="s3129">So we were both volunteer nurses at the Red Cross hospital, and we took the classes together.</span> <span id="s3130">So I haven’t seen her sister for a long time, but Deena, she was a lovely, lovely woman, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3131">Q: Sad story that she --</span></p> <p><span id="s3132">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3133">Q: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s3134">A: It’s sad.</span> <span id="s3135">It’s sad that they were -- sad for her.</span> <span id="s3136">I mean, here it was the love of her life, and he died almost -- less than a year after they were married.</span> <span id="s3137">And for the family, you know -- I mean, for my father it was devastating.</span> <span id="s3138">Actually, Saul was a very rambunctious young man, and when he was -- I think at the age of 13, he came to live with my mother and father, because he had diabetes, and somehow wouldn’t adhere to any program, and my grandmother had very hard time controlling him, or managing him.</span> <span id="s3139">So her blood pressure would go very high, and they were very worried about my grandmother.</span> <span id="s3140">So my father said, “Let him stay with us.”</span> <span id="s3141">And somehow my mother was much more able to -- to work with him, and he loved my mother, he absolutely adored her.</span> <span id="s3142">And he stayed with them, he lived with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s3143">Q: So you were -- he was very close to your family anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s3144">A: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3145">Q: And do the -- your -- your father lived for many years after your mother’s death --</span></p> <p><span id="s3146">A: Eight years.</span> <span id="s3147">Eight more years, but he was a broken man by then.</span> <span id="s3148">I mean, he wa -- her death was devastating to him.</span> <span id="s3149">His health started -- well, his health was not so good before that, but it started deteriorating.</span> <span id="s3150">He had the heart problems, he had diabetes, which was from a long time before that.</span> <span id="s3151">He had arteriosclerosis, which started manifesting, you know, and some -- some brain damage, you know.</span> <span id="s3152">Forgetfulness, and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s3153">So -- and he wa -- he was bitter.</span> <span id="s3154">He was bitter.</span> <span id="s3155">Not too many friends came to see him.</span> <span id="s3156">So he was again like he was a forgotten man, he was somebody special and very much sought after in his younger years, because of his position and his powerful connections and everything else.</span> <span id="s3157">And then now that he needed to have a lot of people around him, you know, they will come once in awhile to visit, and that was about it.</span> <span id="s3158">So he -- he was lonely, very lonely.</span></p> <p><span id="s3159">Q: And your sister would -- the -- the burden of caring for him would fall on Yola?</span></p> <p><span id="s3160">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s3161">This is something that I really regret, because I was so very far away, and you know, I couldn’t do much.</span> <span id="s3162">She took very good care of him, and she was like the care manager, you know, did everything for him.</span> <span id="s3163">Took -- would visit him every day, will talk to the doctors, make arrangements with doctors, and things like that, yeah.</span> <span id="s3164">Yeah, she was -- she took excellent care of my parents.</span> <span id="s3165">And I think she resents it a little bit that I was so far away and could not help, that she had to go through that by herself.</span> <span id="s3166">And maybe my job of taking care of older people, has something to do at some point with my need to take care of my parents.</span> <span id="s3167">You know, lots of unconscious things go around.</span> <span id="s3168">Can’t decipher every single thing, but I’m sure my choice of work is not incidental, you know, it’s medi -- meaningful, and it relates to my need to do something I didn’t do.</span> <span id="s3169">You know, I mean, they needed care, and she was there for them, I wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s3170">Q: I wonder to -- to what extent you see the period in hiding as a formative influence that in some ways has shaped your life?</span> <span id="s3171">I mean, what -- to what extent do you think that’s -- that is so?</span></p> <p><span id="s3172">A: Well, I think it’s in balance with my life at this point.</span> <span id="s3173">I think it’s -- it’s one experience that I wouldn’t have had if the war had not happened.</span> <span id="s3174">I think my life would have turned out to be totally different.</span> <span id="s3175">Carefree, you know, affluent.</span> <span id="s3176">Totally different life.</span> <span id="s3177">But I certainly don’t regret my life.</span> <span id="s3178">I think it was a good life in many ways, because it brought me to the point I am now, close to 70 years of age, where I think I have become a very strong person, a very compassionate person, a person who cares about people.</span> <span id="s3179">A person who -- who enjoys life.</span> <span id="s3180">I mean, I remember a friend of mine once, who has a house at the beach, had invited me, and then we decided at the spur of the moment to go to a -- to an orchard, or to -- to a farm nearby, and pick up peaches.</span> <span id="s3181">And I remember giggling, and just laughing, and enjoying picking peaches.</span> <span id="s3182">And she looked at me, and she said, “Paulette, I never knew you would get such a thrill out of something so simple, you know, such a very simple kind of thing.”</span> <span id="s3183">Incidentally, when we were, during the Italian occupation, I used to go and pick up fruit, you know, climb the trees and pick up peaches, or cherries.</span> <span id="s3184">And of course I would eat the cherries, and I got sick, because I would love them, and you know, then my stomach will hurt.</span> <span id="s3185">So maybe that reminded me a little bit of that, but it was such a pleasure to do things, to do anything.</span> <span id="s3186">I mean, I love being outdoors, looking at the blue sky, and -- or watching children, see them grow.</span> <span id="s3187">That’s the biggest joy for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s3188">Q: I think we’ve come to the end of our --</span></p> <p><span id="s3189">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3190">Q: -- hours of interviewing --</span></p> <p><span id="s3191">A: That’s [indecipherable] thank you for [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3192">Q: -- and -- and really, on behalf of the museum --</span></p> <p><span id="s3193">A: -- appreciate --</span></p> <p><span id="s3194">Q: -- yeah, but I’d like to -- like to thank you for --</span></p> <p><span id="s3195">A: And I thank you, too.</span> <span id="s3196">Thank you so very much.</span> <span id="s3197">This has been just wonderful.</span> <span id="s3198">I appreciate it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3199">Q: And this now concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Paulette Nehama.</span></p>
