in Auschwitz, in the gas chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: How did you find that out?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: I didn’t have to, I knew it right away, because they were taken already that time, in big ma-masses, to -- to Auschwitz, especially the older people, are going right away and the younger people were partly in -- in army camp, with the Slovak army, or -- or just hiding when -- on -- in the partisans, you know, the Russian underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: But was there ever a point when someone said to you, I saw your parents on a transport to Auschwitz, or I saw your parents in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: No, no, no, not at all, but I knew, because of their age.</span> <span id="s32">And they are beautiful people, tha -- that’s -- it was a big disappointment when I heard about them.</span> <span id="s33">It happened very suddenly.</span> <span id="s34">They just came at night and they took them out from bed and s -- loaded them up on trucks and I never saw them any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: Where, exactly, were your parents when they came, and who exactly came?</span> <span id="s36">A: The -- The Slovak and the Germans.</span> <span id="s37">The Slovak police, the local police, under the control of the German military, or SS, whatever you want to call it.</span> <span id="s38">They came, but I was hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: And where were your parents when they came?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Home, in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s41">We were that time already in the ghetto, and every night there were transports going.</span> <span id="s42">On the beginning we didn’t know what it -- where we going and what will happen, but then it came out, slowly seeped through that they go, actually, to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Now, in your first interview, you mentioned several times that you were in hiding.</span> <span id="s44">Do you know where you were in hiding at that point?</span> <span id="s45">Were you in the underground in the woods, or were you in that reservoir?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: I was -- Yeah, that was just for a shol -- short while, in the reservoirs we were hiding.</span> <span id="s47">Then the -- a few weeks we were hiding in a small workshop, at a building place.</span> <span id="s48">And then I was in a -- in a house, private house, where the -- the woman made out of it, a little hotel, like a little inn, with food and everything.</span> <span id="s49">She knew that -- who we are.</span> <span id="s50">She -- She knew that we were Jews.</span> <span id="s51">She was from -- from Morava, it’s a part of Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s52">Very decent old woman.</span> <span id="s53">She knew who we are, but she said, “I have papers that they are not Jews.”</span> <span id="s54">We were on false papers, and we were hiding there, but not too long.</span> <span id="s55">They caught us there.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Where was your sister -- well, first of all, please tell us your sister’s name.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Frederica Diamant.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: And at that point -- well, where was your sister?</span> <span id="s59">Was she living with your parents in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s61">My sister left in ’39, for a -- for a -- for England.</span> <span id="s62">You know, as a -- as a domestic.</span> <span id="s63">That was the only way how -- how girls could disappear.</span> <span id="s64">And she was during the whole war there, during the blitz.</span> <span id="s65">And came back the first commercial airliner, she came back and took me to her -- with her to Prague.</span> <span id="s66">She came to Bratislava where we live and then she took us -- she took me to Prague with her, and we lived for five years in Prague.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: What -- Why -- Can you tell me a little bit about the decision of your parents to send your sister to England?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: There was a young man who wanted to marry her, and he said if she comes to England, he will marry her.</span> <span id="s69">But she came to England and he didn’t marry her.</span> <span id="s70">So, it was a big disappointment.</span> <span id="s71">He was a very good looking engineer and from a good house, but he changed very much, he was very selfish and he married then, much, much later, my cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: So it wasn’t -- Was there any thought about the trip, that it could prevent your sister from being caught up in the -- in the -- the war, in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s74">No, no.</span> <span id="s75">She would have stayed, who knows what would have happened?</span> <span id="s76">The same as with all the others.</span> <span id="s77">One -- One young girl, a cousin, was -- was taken with her mother, and they never came back.</span> <span id="s78">My grandmother didn’t never came back.</span> <span id="s79">My relatives, about 55 relatives with children, they never came back, not at all.</span> <span id="s80">And it was very hard.</span> <span id="s81">Then, I can start you to tell from -- from the concentration camps, when we got freed.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Let’s begin there, when you are -- I want to move into the post-war period.</span> <span id="s83">These are the last days or weeks of the war, and if you can remember the last concentration camp you were in, and what the Germans told you when you had to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: We were in the -- in the last concentration camp was Ber-Bergen-Belsen was the last one.</span> <span id="s85">It was a -- a nice, clean camp, but we didn’t like it, because you didn’t get food there.</span> <span id="s86">And then, when it came to get free, they make -- they made up appelles and told us to -- to march in five rows, out from the camp.</span> <span id="s87">We saw that th-the Russians were ni -- near already, because we saw at night the flares, the red flares all over in the -- in the -- in the -- far.</span> <span id="s88">But still they w -- are far -- they were far enough that we couldn’t be free right away.</span> <span id="s89">But then the Germans commanded us to go out of the camp, but before we went out from the camp, they took us to a le -- a warehouse where they had s -- piles of -- of -- of Care packages -- American ca -- packages, which they never gave us, they thr -- were meant for us and they never gave us these packages.</span> <span id="s90">But then they told us everyone has to take two packages on his back and marching out.</span> <span id="s91">So we’re marching and marching and marching.</span> <span id="s92">We didn’t know where we are going, we didn’t know nothing, they didn’t tell us.</span> <span id="s93">And then they stopped near a river, at lu -- at noon time and we were so thirsty and hungry that we run to the river and drank the water and th -- and the food from the packages.</span> <span id="s94">That was a big mistake, because we got all very sick.</span> <span id="s95">Very sick.</span> <span id="s96">And, well the rule was always, when we were marching, that the SS was in the back, and you know, who couldn’t march, was shot.</span> <span id="s97">But we were there in this -- this river, near a village, and the Wehrmacht, the regular army came there, they heard that we have packages, Care packages, that we should give them cigarettes.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: The Wehrmacht is the regular German army?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: The regular, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: The German army?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Right, not the SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: But the SS was wa -- was watching us and they were with us there and it was always their rule, who couldn’t march will be shot dead.</span> <span id="s104">And me too, my feet were worn out from the marching.</span> <span id="s105">I had wooden soles and the top was -- was reenand [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s106">And I was all bloody, my feet.</span> <span id="s107">But I had to march, otherwise they would have shot me dead.</span> <span id="s108">So the only rest was at this river.</span> <span id="s109">But from that water what I drank from the river, and -- and the food [indecipherable], I -- I was so sick that I couldn’t get up any more.</span> <span id="s110">When they said, “March, march,” the SS, I couldn’t get up.</span> <span id="s111">No, I was counting really, that I will be dead soon.</span> <span id="s112">But, the last moment came this -- these Wehrmacht people with their carriage -- with a horse driven carriage and said to the SS, “No more shooting.</span> <span id="s113">This is the end of the war, there is no more shooting for you.</span> <span id="s114">You get lost.”</span> <span id="s115">So they got lost.</span> <span id="s116">They marched everybody who could march, marched, Who not, stayed there.</span> <span id="s117">And they came, the Wehrmacht, with a -- with a -- a horse driven carriage, with tea and they gave everybody tea, who was there, the sick people.</span> <span id="s118">And then they told us they will arrange something with the village people, they should hide us or something.</span> <span id="s119">And we didn’t believe it, but it was so.</span> <span id="s120">They took us to the village, on these horse driven carriage -- horse driven carriage and the -- they demanded we should give them soap, the peasants.</span> <span id="s121">And they put us in a pig pen overnight and then every morning we had to give them a piece of soap, as long as we had it.</span> <span id="s122">But then, when we ran out of soap, they told us, “Don’t worry, don’t worry, we will arrange something for you.”</span> <span id="s123">What will be the arrangement?</span> <span id="s124">They are going, transports like ours, marching from other camps and on one, they were carrying these little carriages, the prisoners, they were the -- the -- all the packages and everything, what they took with themselve, the kapos and the SS, they were pulling it.</span> <span id="s125">And this -- these peasants were so [indecipherable] that they told -- arranged really, to put me as a sick man on the carriage, that they will pull me, and I will give them only cigarettes.</span> <span id="s126">So they were pulling me, pulling me, I was very, very sick, sitting on -- o-on that pail of -- of -- of packages and every time they ask me, “Can I have a cigarette, can I have a cigarette?”</span> <span id="s127">So I gave them always some cigarettes, a-as long as I had them.</span> <span id="s128">I remember it was Chesterfields and -- and Lucky Strikes and -- and they were crazy about it.</span> <span id="s129">That was like -- like money.</span> <span id="s130">And then, suddenly I was so sick that I lost my conscious.</span> <span id="s131">And I think so I was in a coma.</span> <span id="s132">And when I woke up, I was lying in a ditch near the -- near the road.</span> <span id="s133">And I felt very bad, I could ca -- I couldn’t get up.</span> <span id="s134">So I was lying there and lying there and I had all kind of visions.</span> <span id="s135">[indecipherable] with I am dying and I see a tunnel, a white tunnel and on the end is -- is very white light and I will get to that tunnel, to the end of the tunnel, I will be gone.</span> <span id="s136">So I kept back and I didn’t let myself go and waited.</span> <span id="s137">So, just to get out from this ditch, I -- they were evacuating the Germans from all over, with peasants with carriages and so on, with horse driven carriages and I wanted to stop them, they should take me with -- with them.</span> <span id="s138">No, nothing.</span> <span id="s139">Then on the end everything trickled out already, no more refugees there, because the Russians wa -- were af -- a few kilometers away, just.</span> <span id="s140">So, I said, “I will try something.”</span> <span id="s141">I picked myself up and ran on this -- the road and [indecipherable] the horse at the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s142">And they were crying, the Germans.</span> <span id="s143">A old cappela said, “I cannot take you with me, th-the -- the horse will not take us.”</span> <span id="s144">I says, “You have to take me to that -- at least to the next village.</span> <span id="s145">I don’t want to die here in this -- in this ditch.”</span> <span id="s146">So, they agreed and I was sitting in the back and they took me really to the next village.</span> <span id="s147">The next village on the road, on the main road, there was the SS just digging out, and -- and the prisoners like me, they’re just looking around beca -- SS and everybody.</span> <span id="s148">So, then I saw that they are -- they were starting to run, the -- the Germans, yeah.</span> <span id="s149">Th-The SS.</span> <span id="s150">And they left us there.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: At what moment did you begin to realize that you were free?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: That moment already, that -- that’s why I was lying there in the -- in the ditch, I knew.</span> <span id="s153">But I was so, so weak, that I -- I didn’t want to believe it, you know?</span> <span id="s154">That it can happen.</span> <span id="s155">There, at the -- at the roads -- the SS run away and left us there, and mostly -- there was a big, old restaurant, a inn.</span> <span id="s156">Very old one, at the road.</span> <span id="s157">And everybody around into that -- into that restaurant and the women from concentration camps already, they were cooking themselves there, on a big, big stove, yeah, a -- a wooden stove.</span> <span id="s158">And I was very cold, I sit down to this -- to the stove and wan-wanted to warm me up a little bit at the stove.</span> <span id="s159">And a woman said to the other woman, “Give this old man a little warm soup.”</span> <span id="s160">I was 22 - 23, you know?</span> <span id="s161">So, I got the soup, it was very good, it warmed me up a little bit and they -- they took me to -- to the big ballroom, where the ballroom was like a hospital, where all around, th-the edges around the whole ballroom was straw, and on the straw, people are lying there.</span> <span id="s162">Who can walk, walked, who couldn’t walk, died there.</span> <span id="s163">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s164">And so the women came there, they saw me sick, they brought me soup and then we see [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s165">Then, after awhile, they heard th-the bombing, the Russians.</span> <span id="s166">So they run away further, yeah?</span> <span id="s167">After the -- the SS, they run.</span> <span id="s168">Wherever they could run, they were running.</span> <span id="s169">And I was there, sick, and I couldn’t move.</span> <span id="s170">And I -- I heard all of these Russians were very close.</span> <span id="s171">They were bombing already.</span> <span id="s172">And I knew if I stay in that restaurant there, it was right on the road, that will not be good.</span> <span id="s173">They will demolish that.</span> <span id="s174">So, I picked myself up, on m-my four, and crawled about 150 feet or so, deeper into the village.</span> <span id="s175">And th-there was a peasant place and they were not there, the peasants, it was empty.</span> <span id="s176">I went into a room, I saw a big bed, with a big down cover.</span> <span id="s177">I lied down into the bed, covered my-myself completely over my head with that big down, and forget about everything.</span> <span id="s178">I was in a coma, right away.</span> <span id="s179">I don’t know how long I was lying there.</span> <span id="s180">And -- But suddenly, I hear somebody’s in the room.</span> <span id="s181">And I look up, I see the -- the ceiling was on my bed, yeah, and an old woman was crawling around there.</span> <span id="s182">And when she saw me, she got scared and ran.</span> <span id="s183">I told her that, “You don’t have to run.”</span> <span id="s184">I knew she was German, yeah, and a peasant.</span> <span id="s185">I told her, “You don’t have to run.</span> <span id="s186">I am a sick man, I can’t even move.”</span> <span id="s187">“Oh, I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s188">I am sorry, I am sorry.</span> <span id="s189">I will -- I will give you food, I will give you everything.</span> <span id="s190">Just leave me alone, yeah?”</span> <span id="s191">I said to her, “All right, I -- I am not doing you nothing.”</span> <span id="s192">“I will c-cure you,” she said.</span> <span id="s193">I’ll -- I tell you something, she did.</span> <span id="s194">She did.</span> <span id="s195">She gave me certain things to eat what really started to bring me to my feet.</span> <span id="s196">But, it was a long time until I really got to my feet.</span> <span id="s197">And in st -- meantime, the rations came in and I was again in a coma, covered up, and suddenly he pulls -- a Russian soldier pulls the cover from me and holds the -- the carashneeko on me.</span> <span id="s198">So, I said to him, “What do you want from me?</span> <span id="s199">I am a -- I am a old man, a sick one.”</span> <span id="s200">And he looks at me.</span> <span id="s201">“Where are you, where are you?</span> <span id="s202">How -- What are you?</span> <span id="s203">Who are you?”</span> <span id="s204">I said, “I am from -- from the camp out, I am from Czechoslovakia.”</span> <span id="s205">“Oh, we are old friends, we are good friends, Czechoslovakia with Russia, yeah?”</span> <span id="s206">So, he leave -- he left me alone, luckily.</span> <span id="s207">What that happens -- Every day happens something else with the Russians.</span> <span id="s208">For instance, a officer took a room next me and he told me -- he brought one -- one night, a whole bunch of bottles with wine -- wine bottles, and told me, “You don’t let nobody in.</span> <span id="s209">If a soldier comes, tell him the officer said nobody can come into his room.”</span> <span id="s210">But, I was just a sick man, I couldn’t just give him the message, whoever came, right?</span> <span id="s211">Then, right away, a plain soldier came, half drunk already and -- and went into his room.</span> <span id="s212">I yell at him, “Don’t go there, th-the officer says nobody is supposed to go there.”</span> <span id="s213">“Oh, you will tell a Russian soldier, yeah?”</span> <span id="s214">And went down and took all his bottle.</span> <span id="s215">And when the -- when the officer came home, saw what happened, yeah, he took out his [indecipherable] and put it here, to me, yeah.</span> <span id="s216">Said to him, “Look, what [indecipherable] what would I have done?</span> <span id="s217">I couldn’t stop him.”</span> <span id="s218">Yeah.</span> <span id="s219">But I think so he caught him.</span> <span id="s220">And I don’t know what he -- what happened then.</span> <span id="s221">For instance, one day they brought me a bicycle.</span> <span id="s222">Yeah, a good boy, a Czechslovak, yeah, yeah, you’re our friend.</span> <span id="s223">He brought me a bicycle.</span> <span id="s224">Next day he comes, “Can I borrow it?”</span> <span id="s225">Never saw it any more.</span> <span id="s226">Or, he brought me -- One brought me a movie projector, a very nice one.</span> <span id="s227">And one days they took, you know, everything and he wanted to -- I should show him how that works, but we had no electricity, so I couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Did you feel protected by the Russians, or apprehensive about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: I was apprehensive, because -- because I didn’t know -- I couldn’t figure them out.</span> <span id="s230">For instance there was -- Then, it came out that in the -- during this -- this whole time, they were hiding this German family.</span> <span id="s231">There were three women, young women and six children, little children.</span> <span id="s232">And when I saw this, I couldn’t be bad to them, I couldn’t -- I couldn’t -- I could have gone to the German -- to the Russians and tell them, “Take them away.</span> <span id="s233">I want to live here, or so I want this for myself.”</span> <span id="s234">I would have gotten it, because not just that, we -- later, a Russian officer came to me and asked me my profession and so on.</span> <span id="s235">And he sa -- he told me, “If you stay here, I will make you the director of the electric plant of this area.”</span> <span id="s236">I told myself I don’t know.</span> <span id="s237">I was very leery about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Just a couple more clarifications.</span> <span id="s239">Do you remember the date, about, when this was happening?</span> <span id="s240">What time of year, the date?</span> <span id="s241">And also, where -- where were you, exactly?</span> <span id="s242">A: I was -- The village, it was a little village called Wiperov.</span> <span id="s243">Should I spell it?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: W-i-p-e-r-o-v.</span> <span id="s246">And that was the nearest big town.</span> <span id="s247">The hospital was in Rerbel.</span> <span id="s248">Was called -- Th-The -- The town was called Rerbel.</span> <span id="s249">And when I started with him to wa -- to talk, with this officer, he gave me a prescription to that hospital, they should check me out.</span> <span id="s250">And he said when the -- When they will check me out all right, he will put me as the director of the area hosp -- no, puwr -- power plant.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: S-So this is in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: Yeah, that’s was all in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: And do you remember when it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: That was on the end of the war, ’45 already, yeah.</span> <span id="s255">I think so, in Ma -- March or A-April, something like that.</span> <span id="s256">But I stayed about two -- two or three months more, because I was too weak.</span> <span id="s257">But I got ra-rations from the Russians.</span> <span id="s258">And I could coo -- practically go to -- to them and -- and whatever food I wanted, I could confiscate it.</span> <span id="s259">They -- They met -- gave me certain papers, that I could do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: And why -- Why were there -- Tell me a little bit more about the German family that these certain Russians were hiding.</span> <span id="s261">Were -- Were all Germans supposed to be rounded up at that point?</span> <span id="s262">I mean, wa -- who di -- who were they hiding them from?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: From the soldier, from the plain soldiers, they were the most dangerous, because they had no -- no cur -- scruples to rape the women and everything.</span> <span id="s264">There was a wo-woman with me there, ya -- a young woman, very pretty, she had just a baby, and the Russian come and -- the [indecipherable] drunk Russian comes in at night and wants to rape her.</span> <span id="s265">I -- I tell him -- I spoke a little bit Slavic, so I told him, “What do you want from this lil -- from this woman?</span> <span id="s266">She is sick, she’s just had a baby.”</span> <span id="s267">“Oh, you don’t tell a -- a Russian soldier what he [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s268">We will come and we will hang you.”</span> <span id="s269">You never argue with them.</span> <span id="s270">They came -- They came one day, as I say, “You are a co -- collaborating with the Germans.”</span> <span id="s271">I said to him, “I am collaborating with the Germans?”</span> <span id="s272">I says, “You must arrive by accident, yeah?”</span> <span id="s273">So -- But they were really very nice to me.</span> <span id="s274">They knew everything and -- and the children were loving me.</span> <span id="s275">Uncle Franz.</span> <span id="s276">Uncle Franz, because I -- I was still going on my false papers.</span> <span id="s277">Now I was -- My papers were Frantisha Pleshko.</span> <span id="s278">Yeah, Franz Pleshko, and they called me Uncle Franz, Uncle Franz.</span> <span id="s279">They love me, because I brought them -- I went out and I brought candy or something, always something I brought them.</span> <span id="s280">And then, in the village, the -- the bakery was done -- was with the Russians collaborating, and the -- they guy -- the head baker was a Slovak from my hometown and because of that, he gave me every day, two, three pieces of -- of fresh bread, which was there, like gold, that time.</span> <span id="s281">So I could buy anything and everything I wanted for food.</span> <span id="s282">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: What was that like, finally, to be able to eat enough food every day?</span> <span id="s284">There’d been years that you hadn’t been able to.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: There were -- They were, later, sure.</span> <span id="s286">But, for instance, there were two teenagers hiding in a -- in a attic, and what could I do?</span> <span id="s287">I wouldn’t tell the Russians, yeah, that they are hiding there, so I supply them with food.</span> <span id="s288">Two young girls, Germans, yeah.</span> <span id="s289">So, naturally, if -- if -- if the Russians found out, they wou -- could have killed me.</span> <span id="s290">But I couldn’t do otherwise.</span> <span id="s291">I -- We were always talking in the camps, “Oh, when we come out from the -- from the camp, we will kill all the Russians.</span> <span id="s292">Ah, that’s just talking.”</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: [indecipherable] the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Yeah, the Germans, I mean.</span> <span id="s295">Sorry.</span> <span id="s296">That we will kill the -- the Germans.</span> <span id="s297">It doesn’t work like that.</span> <span id="s298">You cannot do it, you -- it’s not in you, yeah?</span> <span id="s299">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Did that surprise you, that -- that you didn’t want revenge, ri-right after liberation, that -- that these Germans actually were people to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: No, it didn’t, because, as I came out, I felt like a human being, and -- a sick human be-being.</span> <span id="s302">There was one nurse who helped me on my feet, too.</span> <span id="s303">And she was sick too.</span> <span id="s304">By accident, she came there, too.</span> <span id="s305">And then, there -- there came trucks and buses from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s306">They were going through, they were picking up all the -- all the refugees and that guy in -- in the bakery, yeah, the -- told me, “I will send you back with the next transport.”</span> <span id="s307">I said, “Okay, sure.</span> <span id="s308">I want to go home.”</span> <span id="s309">“You just tell my parents that I -- that you’ve met me, that I am here, I am all right.”</span> <span id="s310">He had a pretty good life there, with the river Russians.</span> <span id="s311">With those, they -- they needed him, he was a -- a -- the most important man in the town.</span> <span id="s312">The baker, right?</span> <span id="s313">So, I -- One night, a bus came through, a repatriation bus from Prague.</span> <span id="s314">And he came running and told me I should -- I should go.</span> <span id="s315">I was always packed.</span> <span id="s316">So I run, said good-bye th-the famil -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: -- and high boots, I -- I looked like a monster, you know, from another age, or something.</span> <span id="s318">No, then, the -- the -- the -- that super gave me a materads, I can sleep in a empty apartment, whats -- the materads we gave him before we left, an-and -- and apartment was my grandmother’s apartment, yeah.</span> <span id="s319">Used to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: And it was empty?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s322">Empty, because the -- the so -- it wasn’t too elegant, not elegant enough for the -- for the Slovaks, yeah?</span> <span id="s323">It came out -- well, I don’t know if you know the history what -- how -- what happened with Czechoslovakia that time.</span> <span id="s324">Yeah, the Slovaks [indecipherable] their own president, their own autonomy.</span> <span id="s325">And the Czechs had their autonomy and Hitler was in between, yeah.</span> <span id="s326">The Slovak president was Kissel.</span> <span id="s327">He was the best -- He was a priest, a high priest, and he was best friends with Hitler, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s328">And, in Prague, there was -- there were the [indecipherable] the president was Gotowards.</span> <span id="s329">So, the whole thing was mixed up.</span> <span id="s330">Besides, I had already after me, the military, working camps and everything.</span> <span id="s331">But that make me just stronger, because we had there food.</span> <span id="s332">That was in the -- that way, but we had to work very hard, then we got food there.</span> <span id="s333">But, yeah, when I came to Bratislava, I want to just -- to go further.</span> <span id="s334">He gave me something to eat, the -- the super --</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: This is the superintendent of your building?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Gave me something to eat.</span> <span id="s339">My favorite, favorite food.</span> <span id="s340">I don’t know how he even knew.</span> <span id="s341">It was noodles with -- with walnuts -- crushed walnuts and -- and su-sugar.</span> <span id="s342">I was crazy for sugar.</span> <span id="s343">That -- I don’t know, that’s something had to do with -- with my system.</span> <span id="s344">I was crazy everything was sw -- wa-was sweet.</span> <span id="s345">But, that was not the main point, just saying that was my first night called home, but it wasn’t home.</span> <span id="s346">Then I went to --</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: But -- But it wasn’t home?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: It wasn’t home, just for a -- for a night.</span> <span id="s349">For a night there.</span> <span id="s350">They told me -- the superintendent tells me, “You have to look for your -- for your family.</span> <span id="s351">They may be here, I heard that they are here.”</span> <span id="s352">Huh?</span> <span id="s353">So, where can I go?</span> <span id="s354">I went to the Jewish dis -- no, to the Jewish bureau where they had the names and -- and listed everybody who came home.</span> <span id="s355">So, I found out that two of my cousins, girls, are here and the -- their address.</span> <span id="s356">So, I came to them, they were happy to see me, and I knew that their father was killed by the Germans.</span> <span id="s357">I didn’t want to tell them.</span> <span id="s358">I just said I didn’t know where they are, what wa -- I know, because it happened in -- in my camp, in -- in -- yeah.</span> <span id="s359">And one of my -- my good friends from Bratislava, he was with them, so he told me that.</span> <span id="s360">But he was luckily -- he survived.</span> <span id="s361">Lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: So -- So you consciously decided, I don’t think I will tell them this right now, the cousins?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: You decided -- You didn’t tell them what happened, you decided that it -- it wouldn’t be good idea right then?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s366">I didn’t want to take nobody who I knew that they are -- wa -- were killed.</span> <span id="s367">I didn’t want to tell nobody, so maybe they had some hopes, at least for awhile, they had some hopes.</span> <span id="s368">I knew my parents will never come back.</span> <span id="s369">But then, I got a letter from my sister there.</span> <span id="s370">She was in London still, and she had a very good job.</span> <span id="s371">She was the secretary of the UNRRA.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: The United Nations --</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Right.</span> <span id="s374">Relief.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Relief, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s377">In London.</span> <span id="s378">And she came with him, home to Prague.</span> <span id="s379">H-He was very well-to-do.</span> <span id="s380">He was a -- He had a publishing company in Prague, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: She worked for a British UNRRA official, or a Czech --</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: No, no, Czech.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: -- UNRRA official?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: Czech.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: And she worked for him, and in Prague, or -- or anywhere, was very hard to get a apartment.</span> <span id="s387">He got her a apartment and she could take me in.</span> <span id="s388">So I was in Prague for awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Was it difficult to leave Bratislava?</span> <span id="s390">Did -- Did you want to stay there, since that was home?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: It was home, and it wasn’t any more, home, because my parents were not there, nobody was there.</span> <span id="s392">Eight -- 80 -- no, 55 relatives were gone.</span> <span id="s393">My grandmother -- We had a beautiful, big family there, with children and everything.</span> <span id="s394">That’s all gone.</span> <span id="s395">My favorite cousin is gone, yeah?</span> <span id="s396">A beautiful girl, and -- and my only wa -- my own cousin was left, he was in the British navy.</span> <span id="s397">He got out in ’39, too.</span> <span id="s398">He got to Israel with a Yugen allia.</span> <span id="s399">I don’t know how you know -- how you say that.</span> <span id="s400">Young people allia.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: They go -- They make a choice to go to Israel, is that it?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: No, no, no, they didn’t give them a choice, but they -- they just made it before it got --</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: -- closed up.</span> <span id="s405">So, he was a young boy, 16, when he left home, in a kibbutz.</span> <span id="s406">And when -- when my sister came to Bratislava, I didn’t recognize her.</span> <span id="s407">She was beautiful.</span> <span id="s408">She was like a real English lady, dressed up good.</span> <span id="s409">What I didn’t see for a long time, yeah.</span> <span id="s410">And she took me with her to Prague, in her apartment and I lived in Prague.</span> <span id="s411">I found a job as a electrician and a maintenance man in a big department store.</span> <span id="s412">And, it was all right, but I was still sick, and weak.</span> <span id="s413">So one of my -- my -- my relatives, had a farm in Slovakia, not far from Bratislava.</span> <span id="s414">She took me in and [indecipherable] you have to cure yourself, first.</span> <span id="s415">You have to be healthy.</span> <span id="s416">I think so -- She has two daughters, I think so she had -- she told [indecipherable] match.</span> <span id="s417">But it -- She was very nice -- very nice people and the best food you can imagine, for sick people.</span> <span id="s418">[indecipherable] Yeah, country food.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: Before we go on, I just want to take you back for a minute.</span> <span id="s420">Can you remember -- Tell us a little bit about what that meeting was like with your sister, for the first time in so long?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: Well, it was crying, it was more crying than anything else.</span> <span id="s422">My sister was -- was thinking all the time she was in London, about her family.</span> <span id="s423">She had a big crate with -- with all the saved up materials for -- for suits, for wa -- her father, for me, for -- for the mother, for everybody, she had all kinds of save ups, and the whole sewing machine, and for me, a bicycle, and -- and things like that.</span> <span id="s424">Nobody did that.</span> <span id="s425">She was so for her family.</span> <span id="s426">She lived only for the family.</span> <span id="s427">And what -- She was pretty much alone in Prague, so that’s why she took me there.</span> <span id="s428">And I found a job, but not for long.</span> <span id="s429">My cousin from -- came from Israel.</span> <span id="s430">He was in the British navy during the war, and he came and demanded from the Slovak government, his -- his sl -- father’s store, yeah.</span> <span id="s431">Th -- Because they were all -- all in -- in Slovak hands, and when the Jews came back, this -- whoever came back, had to give -- they had to give back that store.</span> <span id="s432">So, we had the -- Then my cousins couldn’t stay there and take over the store, so he -- he gave me the full -- this --</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Control?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: Yeah, the fi-fi -- the full fla -- freedom to do whatever is necessary for the store and be th-the storekeeper.</span> <span id="s435">It was a very beautiful store.</span> <span id="s436">It was a wholesale electr -- electronic and electric, and we had about 15 employees.</span> <span id="s437">So it was a quiet, nice thing.</span> <span id="s438">And it was in the same house what belongs to my cousin.</span> <span id="s439">It was the -- the -- the -- built for it.</span> <span id="s440">So I -- I had a idea about these line, so I took over.</span> <span id="s441">And they wouldn’t have given that -- that -- nobody, only me, because they liked me.</span> <span id="s442">Just me, I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s443">They told me, “You cousin, we will not l -- l -- give back this store, only to you.”</span> <span id="s444">I had a idea why, because it was too soft, probably, o-on them.</span> <span id="s445">So, I had a pretty good time that -- from that on, because I had a very good salary, and every two weeks I was traveling to Prague, and contacts with -- with -- with big companies.</span> <span id="s446">I bought materials, and -- and -- and radios and all -- all kind of things.</span> <span id="s447">So, it came very goo -- very good.</span> <span id="s448">I had pre-war contacts and I had a pre-war -- after the war contract with -- with the Czechs, with -- in certain factories.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Here’s a question.</span> <span id="s450">What was the atmosphere like for y -- for a Jew?</span> <span id="s451">Had things calmed back down?</span> <span id="s452">And what -- what were relations like with the Slovaks, who had helped the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Ha, ha.</span> <span id="s454">They didn’t like it at all.</span> <span id="s455">They didn’t like the Jews at all, because they were afraid that the Jew take everything back, what they had, because they stole anything and everything during the war.</span> <span id="s456">They had furnitures, they have paintings, they have all what -- what the Jews had, they are -- they were hiding.</span> <span id="s457">So, naturally, they were very disappointed when the Jew came home.</span> <span id="s458">But, for the Jew, the most important was to get back on their feet, yeah.</span> <span id="s459">So they didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s460">So when I came, for instance, to the -- to the store the first time, they were very apprehending, what the hell you call that.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Apprehensive?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s463">Ver-Very much so, and one -- one of the girls, secretaries, said, “Hawahow -- Why did you come back?</span> <span id="s464">Why didn’t you stay there?”</span> <span id="s465">Yeah?</span> <span id="s466">I says, “Next, you could go there.”</span> <span id="s467">I told her, “Next, you should be there.”</span> <span id="s468">Ah, well.</span> <span id="s469">We had fighting and fighting and on the end, she fall in love with a Jew, yeah.</span> <span id="s470">And my secretary fall in love with me, yeah.</span> <span id="s471">I was -- What happens, these girls were -- were all engaged to doctors, and all -- all kind of things, in other towns.</span> <span id="s472">And they didn’t go -- because of us, they didn’t want to get married, because they had a pretty good life with us, yeah.</span> <span id="s473">I had plenty money, I could -- I could take them out to restaurants, [indecipherable] so -- so you have company, always.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Were you ever afraid?</span> <span id="s475">Were you ever afraid again, the way you had been during the war, that -- that something bad could happen to you, simply because you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s477">I wasn’t afraid.</span> <span id="s478">They just didn’t like us, and if they could have killed us, maybe they would have killed us, too.</span> <span id="s479">But, no, we were home there.</span> <span id="s480">We made a life.</span> <span id="s481">We were born there, we were home there.</span> <span id="s482">These -- These bastards, they didn’t even --even a pension.</span> <span id="s483">Nothing in a pension.</span> <span id="s484">I worked for years there and I -- not even a pension, nothing, nothing, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: Who didn’t give you a pension?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: The Slovaks, Slovaks.</span> <span id="s489">I went there to school.</span> <span id="s490">My parents were living there for -- for -- for centuries, yeah.</span> <span id="s491">And -- And no reparation, any kind, from the Slovaks.</span> <span id="s492">I heard that some -- some got now pension, 30 dollars a wee -- a month or so.</span> <span id="s493">I didn’t even -- even ask for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: At this point, as you’re beginning to get back on your feet, are -- are you ever thinking about the camps, or things that you saw?</span> <span id="s495">Are you watching for -- listening, for instance, to the Nuremberg Trials?</span> <span id="s496">A: Oh sure, sure.</span> <span id="s497">We knew -- We knew everything.</span> <span id="s498">We were very -- very good informed, always.</span> <span id="s499">Even during the war, we were -- we were watching that NBC, or what was that, yeah, London.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: BBC.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: And, we were listening.</span> <span id="s502">Every night.</span> <span id="s503">I remember even when we were to -- to -- taken already to the ghetto, we were listening in the coal bu-bunker of the store.</span> <span id="s504">We had a little radio and so we -- so we knew what’s going on, but we were just praying they should bomb them out good.</span> <span id="s505">And then they bombed at us, later, but a little bit too late.</span> <span id="s506">But, in meantime, after the war, we started to -- I started to have a pretty good life.</span> <span id="s507">I was a -- the busine -- business manager there and I made trip [indecipherable] to my sister in Prague and -- and bought materials and that wa -- that time was the Black Market, I could sell very good, I could bring food.</span> <span id="s508">If I got -- If I brought food from Slovakia, which was easy, they had everything, I got a radi -- a few radios for it.</span> <span id="s509">And bartering, all kinds of bartering was going on.</span> <span id="s510">But then, afterwards, when I lived in Bratislava, slowly, all the young boys and girls came together.</span> <span id="s511">Because mostly we don’t -- we didn’t have any more parents, and not even relatives, mostly.</span> <span id="s512">So we started to do our own life.</span> <span id="s513">Well, everybody was working, everybody was doing something and most of them have pretty good jobs, because they were experts, very good experts.</span> <span id="s514">I -- I had a very good friend, he was in the store, a electronic engineer, a -- a genius, yeah.</span> <span id="s515">So, we had a good life.</span> <span id="s516">We went from one restaurant to the other, because where else can we go, right?</span> <span id="s517">And then, we got a couple of girls together too, so we were a nice company always.</span> <span id="s518">Every night you have -- you going somewhere every night.</span> <span id="s519">We went to the -- together for dinners and one day si -- two of -- of these girls were our secretaries th -- later.</span> <span id="s520">The -- The other girls, right, the first ones what I was tal -- talking about, they went back and married the doctors.</span> <span id="s521">Smart.</span> <span id="s522">I remember my -- my girlfriend that time, she went to -- to the -- to that Tatra mountains, there was sanitoriums, and yeah, and she married a very well-to-do doctor.</span> <span id="s523">And the other one, who was very good with my cousin, and my cousin came home, she married there, too, a dentist, I think.</span> <span id="s524">So my -- my cousin wanted to marry, but he picked the wrong girl.</span> <span id="s525">I told him not to marry that girl, because she was twice or three times married.</span> <span id="s526">And I told him, “You don’t need that.”</span> <span id="s527">Yeah.</span> <span id="s528">So, he listened to me that time, [indecipherable] he made other mistake.</span> <span id="s529">So, we were there, living pretty good, going out a lot and I met my wife, yeah.</span> <span id="s530">She was from the same town as most of these girls, these secretaries, and I liked her right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: What?</span> <span id="s533">What was?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: It was -- It was Vas, V-a-s.</span> <span id="s536">Ilsa.</span> <span id="s537">She was young and pretty and I wanted to marry, because I saw what’s going on in the -- in the -- the country, everything turns Communist.</span> <span id="s538">So, instead -- instead of Fascists, we had Communists.</span> <span id="s539">So what’s -- what’s the difference?</span> <span id="s540">I saw what’s coming, what’s going.</span> <span id="s541">I wanted to get out.</span> <span id="s542">So everybody tried to get out, but not everybody could make it.</span> <span id="s543">So, a lot of people -- a lot of friends went to Australia.</span> <span id="s544">Few friends went to Canada.</span> <span id="s545">And my wife wanted to go, before she met me, she wanted to go to America, she had here a aunt.</span> <span id="s546">And -- But the -- the aunt, that time, you had to had a affidavit.</span> <span id="s547">You had to have some money to let you in, and that we didn’t have, so -- no dollars.</span> <span id="s548">So, but she found a doctor from the same town what my wife live, but he lived in America and had already a practice, so he got affidavit for them -- for my wife.</span> <span id="s549">But, until we got that -- until she got it, wel -- that time, I wasn’t married yet, until s-she got it, they didn’t -- it was closed, the -- the Czech border was closed.</span> <span id="s550">No -- No possibility for nobody to get out.</span> <span id="s551">So, she married me, and I told her -- sh -- she says she will marry me if -- if I go out.</span> <span id="s552">I says I wanted to go out, because even illegally, I would have gone out, that -- that time with the Hagannah, to Israel, because that was the only place where I could go without -- without any -- any papers.</span> <span id="s553">So, she [indecipherable] and we will go to -- to Israel.</span> <span id="s554">But my sister and her mother, who lived in -- in -- in Lucheness, that [indecipherable] town, didn’t want we should go in the war to Israel.</span> <span id="s555">That was in ’48.</span> <span id="s556">We shouldn’t go to -- to there.</span> <span id="s557">So, we should wait at least a year til -- til the war will be finished.</span> <span id="s558">So we both -- my sister took us in, we married and my sister took us into her apartment and we lived there a year together, until we went to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: At this point then, did you leave the s -- the store, your cousin’s store?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: Yeah, because the Communists took it over.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: The Communists took over the stores, all the stores, and they wanted to make me a manager of the store, but I didn’t want it any more.</span> <span id="s563">I didn’t want to, I knew that will not last there.</span> <span id="s564">But then, for one year, they took out -- they took the store, the Communists and because I didn’t want to, I had to leave the store, yeah.</span> <span id="s565">So, I went to Prague and through my old connections, I found a factory and I was working -- I got the job there, from a old director was there, I -- I got a pretty good job as a -- as a designer -- mechanical designer.</span> <span id="s566">And the wa -- the -- that was -- the plant was already under the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s567">The head -- head honcho was -- was a old Fascist.</span> <span id="s568">[indecipherable] Fascist, he was a Communist.</span> <span id="s569">He was a -- the commissar, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: What -- What made you feel that you didn’t -- you no longer had a future in your country?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: Oh, when the Communists came in.</span> <span id="s572">I -- I see the wa -- I don’t want to be again a Communist.</span> <span id="s573">And if you want to stay there, you have to be a Communist, because it came to me, right?</span> <span id="s574">I was there about a year and -- and they send out forms -- forms to fill out, I want to be in the party, I want to be a Communist and yeah, all kind of.</span> <span id="s575">And the -- this -- this other friends there, in the company, he knew -- they knew me, they said to me, “Why do you want to be a Communist?”</span> <span id="s576">“We have to be it, because we have our families here and children, everything.</span> <span id="s577">But you don’t need it, get out.</span> <span id="s578">Why don’t you get out?”</span> <span id="s579">And then I -- I took applications and got out.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: T-Tell us more about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: Illegally or legally to Israel.</span> <span id="s582">It was simple.</span> <span id="s583">I’ll tell you, was simple.</span> <span id="s584">Yeah.</span> <span id="s585">Now, during the time when we were already planning to go to Israel, my wife was -- was trying to put together the papers.</span> <span id="s586">It wasn’t easy.</span> <span id="s587">If you wanted to take -- Every item you wanted to take to Israel, you had to have a -- a paper, [indecipherable] to -- to have it knowledged yeah, from the government.</span> <span id="s588">And all our money what we had -- what we could get together, we wanted to buy all kind of things what we could use in Israel.</span> <span id="s589">Like for instance, a work -- a workshop.</span> <span id="s590">I wanted [indecipherable] tools, things like that, that I will use, something to do in Israel.</span> <span id="s591">And that was going on for months.</span> <span id="s592">She was going every morning in -- standing in line, standing in line.</span> <span id="s593">And then her mother and -- and my sister, they were still there.</span> <span id="s594">Well, we said to them, her mother, that we will bring her out to Israel.</span> <span id="s595">My sister didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s596">She has a good job with the director.</span> <span id="s597">Even -- Even there, he was then -- then working for the government, I don’t know what job, and she still was his secretary.</span> <span id="s598">And, he had a wife who was a -- a publisher.</span> <span id="s599">They were -- were very rich people, even after the war.</span> <span id="s600">Had a beautiful apartment and everything, but he found them a very good apartment for -- that -- I used that apartment sometime, I was a bachelor, I had -- from here, a apartment.</span> <span id="s601">He -- He was take caring, you know, was a take care for -- for all these apartments where -- where the Nazis were go -- where they were collaborating with the Nazis, other people.</span> <span id="s602">For instance, there -- there was a -- a countess who was collaborating with the Germans and they put her in jail after the war.</span> <span id="s603">And he was in charge of this -- of this apartment.</span> <span id="s604">He let me one use, and that was the countess.</span> <span id="s605">Geez, I had a terrific time, and a beautiful ho-house, beautiful house, a -- where the consulates were, all the consulates were there.</span> <span id="s606">And we had parties there with all my friends, and food.</span> <span id="s607">We had friends who -- who had friends in the -- in the -- in the country, yet, so they had food and everything.</span> <span id="s608">So we had a pretty good time in Prague, too.</span> <span id="s609">But, as I say, that was already later, and my wife was already married with me, that -- that was already gone.</span> <span id="s610">But she was trying to get the papers.</span> <span id="s611">And we got together a crate, a big crate of very important things -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s613">This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Michael Diamond.</span> <span id="s614">This is tape number two, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s616">So we got together a big crate of very important tools, and the -- that was sent ahead to Israel.</span> <span id="s617">And then a few bags of -- of o -- o -- of other important things, what we can take with us on the way.</span> <span id="s618">So, there was a big transport to Israel.</span> <span id="s619">We tried to get on it, it was one of the last real transports to Israel.</span> <span id="s620">The tr -- We were going to the border with a special train and then down to Naple, and -- and a ship to Israel.</span> <span id="s621">On the border, on the Czechoslovak border, we had to stop with the train and there was a finance control, everybody, all the papers, everything.</span> <span id="s622">When we were standing there, the -- there c -- there came a finance policeman and asked the papers from us, what we are taking, if we have the -- the okay for it.</span> <span id="s623">So, showed him the papers, he looked at me and he said, “You have here things what is -- you cannot take to Israel.”</span> <span id="s624">I said, “I have the papers for it.”</span> <span id="s625">Yeah, because those were new things, new -- new tools.</span> <span id="s626">Yeah, it was new tools, but I had the papers on it.</span> <span id="s627">Spent a lot of money for that.</span> <span id="s628">He -- He didn’t say nothing, he just turned, puts -- puts the -- the paper in his -- his pocket in his uniform and -- and left.</span> <span id="s629">He didn’t say nothing, but we were standing there, the whole train was standing there, yeah, and -- and everybody was checked out.</span> <span id="s630">And then -- then suddenly they call me down to the -- to the station that, “How come you -- you have this and this materials taking with you?</span> <span id="s631">That’s not legal.”</span> <span id="s632">I said, “I have the papers, and I wouldn’t have bought it if I wouldn’t have known that that’s not legal.</span> <span id="s633">Everything is legal if they let you -- let you use it.”</span> <span id="s634">So, “Y-You cannot go nowhere.”</span> <span id="s635">The whole str -- The whole train had to s-stay there and wait.</span> <span id="s636">I don’t know for what we was waiting.</span> <span id="s637">Finally, I got the idea.</span> <span id="s638">I said, “Oh, I remember, that fa -- that finance, that policeman, he puts these -- these papers into my -- into his pocket, and he left, he didn’t tell me nothing.”</span> <span id="s639">And said, “He’s not here, he’s not here,” they said.</span> <span id="s640">I said, “Where does he live?”</span> <span id="s641">“In the village.”</span> <span id="s642">I said, “Can I go to the village and find him and -- and ask fo -- for these papers?”</span> <span id="s643">“Okay.”</span> <span id="s644">But I had to pay him, yeah.</span> <span id="s645">So I went, in the [indecipherable] I found him and -- and a -- we were standing there about two hours, the whole train, waiting just for me.</span> <span id="s646">Can you imagine that?</span> <span id="s647">And Ilsa, my wife, was on the train and she was shaking, yeah, over what will happen.</span> <span id="s648">She didn’t see me, she didn’t know what happened to me for two hours there.</span> <span id="s649">Now, that finally we got through that, we did after -- after that, and we are going down to Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: Did the guy give you the paper?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s652">We found the paper.</span> <span id="s653">We found.</span> <span id="s654">I -- It cost money, too.</span> <span id="s655">Everywhere we went to -- to -- to shmear.</span> <span id="s656">And we are going through Vienna.</span> <span id="s657">In Vienna we were already thinking, now it doesn’t look so -- so well.</span> <span id="s658">Too many people, too much travel.</span> <span id="s659">Maybe it would be better to stay in Vienna and they should put us in a -- in a camp, you know, for refugees, refugee camp.</span> <span id="s660">But, Ilsa was afraid, Ilsa was so afraid from camps.</span> <span id="s661">She has Auschwitz behind, yeah.</span> <span id="s662">So, she was 16 years al -- old when she was taken from Auschwit -- from -- from her town to Auschwitz, yeah.</span> <span id="s663">And I didn’t want to stay then there.</span> <span id="s664">Besides, the crate with -- with our all possession was going already, yeah, with us.</span> <span id="s665">So, we stayed on the train, we stopped in Florence, we s -- yeah.</span> <span id="s666">And we were -- we still could have gotten out, but the Italian didn’t want to let us out.</span> <span id="s667">It was closed, the whole train was closed.</span> <span id="s668">Finally, after I don’t know how many days we were on that train [indecipherable] already, we s -- we were going to Naple, we were going the ship to Israel.</span> <span id="s669">Oh, we go -- the train was going into the port, right almost to the -- to the ship, but when we came there, we saw far, a big -- this cruise ship, a big one, a beautiful cruise ship.</span> <span id="s670">Ah, we were glad, ah, we will go with this cruise ship, we will go to Israel.</span> <span id="s671">Suddenly they tell -- tell us, everybody out, [indecipherable] down -- were stairs down.</span> <span id="s672">“What?</span> <span id="s673">Where are we going?”</span> <span id="s674">It was standing there, a tiny, little ship, a tiny little boat, it used to be a yacht for 16 people and -- a steamboat, a old steamboat, you know?</span> <span id="s675">A yacht.</span> <span id="s676">And we were 250.</span> <span id="s677">250.</span> <span id="s678">When we saw that, we were really scared stiff, all of us.</span> <span id="s679">In this we will go on the -- on the big ocean?</span> <span id="s680">We were afraid, na -- but we are there already, we couldn’t turn back.</span> <span id="s681">Nothing was -- could any more be done.</span> <span id="s682">So, we couldn’t find a place where to sit down on that ship.</span> <span id="s683">There was nothing where you could -- could wash yourself.</span> <span id="s684">Toilets were fi -- overflown.</span> <span id="s685">There was just one, big room downstairs, like a -- like a student room, with bunks.</span> <span id="s686">But nobody could stand it down, there was no air, there was the toilets overflowned.</span> <span id="s687">I couldn’t stay there, no.</span> <span id="s688">I said, “Let’s get up, back.</span> <span id="s689">We will be outdoors on the ship, wherever we can.”</span> <span id="s690">And what we did, we found a boat, you know, a -- a rescue boat, and we made there our apartment.</span> <span id="s691">That was our apartment.</span> <span id="s692">We are one year married, one year married.</span> <span id="s693">So -- But we had good friends there still.</span> <span id="s694">We’re -- We’re -- We’re far now from everything, like young people, you know, we had fun.</span> <span id="s695">And we had food with us, so it wasn’t bad, because the food, the general food in Israel was terrible.</span> <span id="s696">That’s -- That’s the national food is -- is lebadia and sh -- and black o-olives, yeah.</span> <span id="s697">That’s the national food.</span> <span id="s698">So, you have on the ship, going, I think so about five day or -- or seven days, we were supposed to go with the ship.</span> <span id="s699">Luckily, the weather was good.</span> <span id="s700">It was in July, July ’49.</span> <span id="s701">So, on the ship we were with friends and -- and -- but the trouble was, we couldn’t wash, we couldn’t go to toilets and anything.</span> <span id="s702">So, luckily there -- there was a young man [indecipherable] who was a engineer, he was the ship’s engineer.</span> <span id="s703">Very intelligent, German speaking, yeah, from Jewish parents, from Israel.</span> <span id="s704">He wa -- He had the technion, and he was a professional engineer, a ship’s engineer.</span> <span id="s705">The captain was a very good looking young man, he was a Armenian, yeah.</span> <span id="s706">And Armenians don’t have the best -- best reputations.</span> <span id="s707">So one day they -- they call us, we should come up to the captain, one -- one evening.</span> <span id="s708">Well, well, what does the captain want with us?</span> <span id="s709">So, we come up and he said to me, the captain, “You leave your wife here, and you just disappear, or if you don’t want t-to -- to get lost, we will drop you overboard.”</span> <span id="s710">Yeah, the captain said to me.</span> <span id="s711">So, they had a party there and they wa-wanted to -- Ilsa, not me, yeah.</span> <span id="s712">Not me, they wanted Ilsa there.</span> <span id="s713">Luckily, this German young man, the engineer, he was there too, and he saw what’s going on.</span> <span id="s714">He said to me, “You just get out, you get out.</span> <span id="s715">Don’t worry about Ilsa.</span> <span id="s716">I will arrange [indecipherable].”</span> <span id="s717">Oh, okay, I went out and he really, he -- he pushed her out, too.</span> <span id="s718">So, we -- we -- everything was all right.</span> <span id="s719">And he was so nice now that we gave him always something to eat, that engineer.</span> <span id="s720">Salamis, we had good stuff, good cheeses with us.</span> <span id="s721">So we gave him and he let us always to use his -- his cuvina.</span> <span id="s722">He had his own [indecipherable] there.</span> <span id="s723">So, washing [indecipherable] wash ourselves, I was there always.</span> <span id="s724">He was very nice.</span> <span id="s725">Now, we come finally, after so many days, I don’t know how many, I was sick, yeah.</span> <span id="s726">Because that [indecipherable], it was nothing.</span> <span id="s727">A old, Greek ship.</span> <span id="s728">A old, Greek ship, and something -- what was already in mothball, you know, where they throw out already.</span> <span id="s729">And we came to Haifa.</span> <span id="s730">Now, thank God we are in Haifa, yeah?</span> <span id="s731">Israel, Israel, Israel.</span> <span id="s732">People st -- they came out, they kissed the earth.</span> <span id="s733">I was very cautious about.</span> <span id="s734">I had too bad -- too many bad experiences.</span> <span id="s735">So, there came trucks, and everybody go on the trucks.</span> <span id="s736">Fill up the trucks, we have hand packages and -- and so on, and -- but the -- the main things were already there, you know, the crates.</span> <span id="s737">So, everybody was going on the trucks and they were going one after the other.</span> <span id="s738">As they were filled up, the other one, the next one.</span> <span id="s739">And I didn’t want to go on these trucks, because I had a agreement with my cousin who -- who was a Israeli, yeah, who was there, that he will pick me up and he will arrange everything for us, now that we don’t have to be in a camp or something like that.</span> <span id="s740">I wait, we wait, we wait til the last truck -- they didn’t let us stay there any more [inaudible].</span> <span id="s741">We go on the truck and we go.</span> <span id="s742">Where are we going?</span> <span id="s743">To a curranteen, to a camp.</span> <span id="s744">We were very upset, were very upset, especially Ilsa.</span> <span id="s745">“What?</span> <span id="s746">Again to a camp?</span> <span id="s747">We just came out wa -- from camps, and again to a camp?”</span> <span id="s748">“Nah,” I said to her, “don’t worry, it will be different.</span> <span id="s749">It’s not -- that’s a Jewish camp.”</span> <span id="s750">Yeah, okay.</span> <span id="s751">So we were going, and on the way, on the street, on the main street in Haifa, my cousin is running after the truck, I see him.</span> <span id="s752">When we stopped at the red light, he came to us and said, “Don’t worry about nothing.</span> <span id="s753">I will pick you up.</span> <span id="s754">I will pick you up from the camp.”</span> <span id="s755">Okay.</span> <span id="s756">At least he knew I am there and he knew he was late.</span> <span id="s757">So, we came to Kiriat Eliaza.</span> <span id="s758">That’s a camp near Haifa, very close to Haifa, all -- outskirts of Haifa.</span> <span id="s759">That was a old army camp, the British, with a round roof -- a rounded up roof, with -- with a steel roof, you know, and the barracks, one after the other.</span> <span id="s760">Came there, and when we saw that, we were very upset.</span> <span id="s761">And that was good, because they put us into a regular barrack.</span> <span id="s762">Most of the people who were there longer, they were already in tents.</span> <span id="s763">And the heat baking on us, naturally.</span> <span id="s764">But somehow took it, because we had there friends, and we have together fun.</span> <span id="s765">We made fun from everything.</span> <span id="s766">It’s just like in the army, in the army too, we were making fun from everything, from the saddest things.</span> <span id="s767">And so we stayed there about a few days and my cousin came and said he cannot take us out, yeah.</span> <span id="s768">Maybe for one night he can take us out.</span> <span id="s769">He took us out, he got some paper, he took us out from the camp and he took us to a restaurant.</span> <span id="s770">He wanted to show that in Israel, they have everything, yeah.</span> <span id="s771">Good restaurants and this and that, yeah.</span> <span id="s772">And entertainment, except I couldn’t sleep in his apartment.</span> <span id="s773">We couldn’t sleep in his apartment.</span> <span id="s774">His landlady said if he -- if we will sleep there, she will throw him out.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: I-In -- In Haifa.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: But why?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: Because they ar-are afraid about -- that somebody who would -- who would confiscate their house, their apartment.</span> <span id="s779">It was very, very few apartments available, only -- only a lot of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: But why wouldn’t the landlady want you to be there?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: Because we are strangers.</span> <span id="s782">He -- He and me -- He -- That was his apartment, he paid for it, and a lot of money, but she -- he couldn’t have friends or -- or relatives with him in that apartment.</span> <span id="s783">They were afraid we will confiscate it or something will happen, you know?</span> <span id="s784">So, one night we were there, illegally.</span> <span id="s785">The house -- The housekeeper didn’t know.</span> <span id="s786">So I saw that that’s -- this makes no sense, the whole thing, get me a job.</span> <span id="s787">[indecipherable] look for a job, I didn’t hear nothing.</span> <span id="s788">Now, in the camp was -- around the camp was a fence, a wire fence.</span> <span id="s789">And people cut out their holes an-and everybody who was looking for a job went with the bus, yeah, through this hole out and with a bus to Haifa, to look for jobs, but there are no jobs.</span> <span id="s790">Finally my cousin comes up with a job for -- a three day job.</span> <span id="s791">Yeah, as a electronic engineer, yeah.</span> <span id="s792">Three days after that, the -- the -- the manufacturer, who -- who was that other foreman said that, “We cannot keep you here longer than three days, because the others, we have to give some work, too.”</span> <span id="s793">Yeah, so they give them the work.</span> <span id="s794">And then I met a -- his place, he had electro -- a radio and -- and appliances, he had a store, a small one.</span> <span id="s795">And there was a friend from Bratislava and he said to me, “You want the apartment, I know about the apartment, what is out in the country, in Afulla.</span> <span id="s796">It’s called Mercavia, a village.”</span> <span id="s797">It was a village there and a -- and a nice, big kibbutz there, Mercarvia.</span> <span id="s798">So, I said to my -- “I rather go out somewhere, but have a apartment,” because if you stay longer in -- in the camp there, then they send you to a steady camp for unemployed people, somewhere in the -- in the -- in the Negev, or where, yeah, and -- in a tent, and you can stay there, as the guest of the government.</span> <span id="s799">So we didn’t want that, so I said, “I’d rather go to a village and do whatever I can do, but be free.”</span> <span id="s800">So, one day we picked ourselves up and went to the village and we had five da -- five pounds with us, that was all, that we paid out for the crate a-and they brought us the crate and my cousin gave -- borrowed me 30 pounds for the -- for a one year, I had the apartment.</span> <span id="s801">It was a old farmhouse, which belonged to a old Jewish woman, who lives on the Carmel, but for us that was good enough that village there.</span> <span id="s802">We had an apartment of -- consisting of s -- seven windows and two doors.</span> <span id="s803">A outhouse, was far out.</span> <span id="s804">Water was there, with showers and everything, was in the backyard, which was very dangerous, with -- full of -- with snakes, yeah, and then -- and wild f -- wild things, yeah.</span> <span id="s805">So we didn’t even go there.</span> <span id="s806">Then, the neighbors were very nice.</span> <span id="s807">Those were young people and they told Ilsa the ropes.</span> <span id="s808">She sh --She told them -- told Ilsa, th -- the wife, Dolly, I remember what -- how to do everything, yeah, in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: So she taught Ilsa her job?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s811">Yeah.</span> <span id="s812">We didn’t have money, we didn’t have a penny.</span> <span id="s813">But she arranged, for instance, a loan in the food store, in that [indecipherable], that we got whatever we -- we needed, yeah.</span> <span id="s814">And she -- they guaranteed it.</span> <span id="s815">So -- And Ilsa made her a few dresses, Ilsa is a seamstress, so she made few dresses for her.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: When you got to Israel, and as you began to get settled, how -- how were you received?</span> <span id="s817">Did people know that you were survivors of concentration camp?</span> <span id="s818">Did they ever ask you about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: They were not much interested.</span> <span id="s820">Everybody wa -- has his own story and they were not much interested because most everybody was somewhere, yeah.</span> <span id="s821">Everybody had a story.</span> <span id="s822">So, they were just interested thr -- to make a living.</span> <span id="s823">That was the most important, to make a living.</span> <span id="s824">And that was very hard in Israel.</span> <span id="s825">That’s not finished yet, what I want to tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: So we -- we -- when I -- The only thing is, to look for a job.</span> <span id="s828">That -- That’s the -- the basic, always.</span> <span id="s829">I couldn’t get a job.</span> <span id="s830">Then, we have, for instance, delivered ice, because there were no refrigerators, that was too expensive, so we had a icebox.</span> <span id="s831">And -- And we got, every second day, delivered a piece of ice, because that’s you need there, because it was too warm to keep the food.</span> <span id="s832">And the -- the -- the iceman was a Romanian, and I speak with him Hungarian, he spoke Hungarian.</span> <span id="s833">So I asked him if he knows a job for me.</span> <span id="s834">He said, yes, he heard they need a electrician in the hospital in Afulla.</span> <span id="s835">And she said, well, it’s four miles from where we were.</span> <span id="s836">“Oh, very good.”</span> <span id="s837">So, I told it -- When we told it to Dolly, our neighbor, she said, “Oh, I know the director of that -- the hospital, the personnel department in the hospital.</span> <span id="s838">But, I give you some tips.”</span> <span id="s839">She said -- She said to me, “You take Is-Ilsa with you, first of all.”</span> <span id="s840">But she didn’t say why, what.</span> <span id="s841">We were so naïve that time, ah, terribly.</span> <span id="s842">And [indecipherable] she says, “When you go there, look for a job, take Ilsa with you.”</span> <span id="s843">That’s all.</span> <span id="s844">So I -- We were going one morning to that hospital, and came to a man, we were talking.</span> <span id="s845">He said, “Oh, I have a job for you.”</span> <span id="s846">“All right.”</span> <span id="s847">And he said, “And I have a job for Ilsa too.</span> <span id="s848">Ilsa can sew here dresses for -- for the -- for the nurses.”</span> <span id="s849">“Oh, okay, very fine.”</span> <span id="s850">And really, we did that, yeah.</span> <span id="s851">I was electrician.</span> <span id="s852">I -- It was a very hard job because I cou -- they -- I had to be there in emergencies and at night and any time of the day and -- and -- and any time.</span> <span id="s853">So -- And Ilsa was working for the nurses.</span> <span id="s854">And then he had a wife, who wanted dresses, too, [indecipherable] but they -- he wanted first of all, we should stay there as steady, we should live in the camp -- in the -- in the dormitories, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: Of the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: We should stay there.</span> <span id="s859">I would, but Dolly -- Dolly told us he is the biggest skirt chaser in the world, that man.</span> <span id="s860">He wa -- Don’t trust him at all.</span> <span id="s861">So, [indecipherable] was that.</span> <span id="s862">Now, when he saw that he cannot get us, then he just cha -- switched to a other man -- friend of his, gave him the job and I was out of job, yeah.</span> <span id="s863">Wa -- One way it was good, because it was a very hard job.</span> <span id="s864">I -- Wa -- The bicycle what I got in the crane, I had to use to go to work, over fields, open fields and they were full with hyenas, and they were running sometimes after me and I had to kick them in the -- and push them around.</span> <span id="s865">And they were very ugly anyways, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: Hyenas?</span> <span id="s867">A: Yeah, hyenas.</span> <span id="s868">And -- Because that was a shortcut, I had to go there, near the -- near the garbage pail, you know, from the hospital.</span> <span id="s869">And they had there what to eat, so they were full with -- with hyenas there.</span> <span id="s870">So I had to really be careful how I got to the hospital.</span> <span id="s871">Every night, every -- every morning.</span> <span id="s872">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s873">So, finally, the job was over.</span> <span id="s874">I didn’t have what to do.</span> <span id="s875">So, I -- I asked in the village if they have something to do for me.</span> <span id="s876">And there was a man from Czechoslovakia, a [indecipherable] man.</span> <span id="s877">I had [indecipherable] him, he was a very nice man, very nice people, very noble people, I -- I heard about them.</span> <span id="s878">A-And he said, “I can give you only one job what I have.</span> <span id="s879">To -- To repair these machines on -- and so on, for -- for the farm -- the farm machines, to repair.”</span> <span id="s880">I said, “All right, I will try.</span> <span id="s881">What can happen?”</span> <span id="s882">I tried.</span> <span id="s883">There wa -- The workshop was in -- in one of the silos, you know, the -- where they -- they put the corn and everything.</span> <span id="s884">The workshop was in one of the silos and there was full with rice.</span> <span id="s885">Full with rice, the whole -- the whole silo.</span> <span id="s886">And I had to work that time that I used to threw the -- the -- the tools into the -- into the rats.</span> <span id="s887">I -- I saw that will not last too long.</span> <span id="s888">But in meantime, I still worked it, and fixed up a old tractor, a very old tractor, who was already obsolete.</span> <span id="s889">I fixed it up and -- and they used it.</span> <span id="s890">So, they liked it very much and they right away they had other jobs for me.</span> <span id="s891">But I -- I said -- I saw that that’s going to not work out.</span> <span id="s892">So I -- In meantime, I hads works -- I had work done in two fields.</span> <span id="s893">An apartment in Haifa and -- and to get out on my quota, to America.</span> <span id="s894">Because that’s -- we did already in Czechoslovakia, we just didn’t pursue it, because we -- it’s -- there was no quota.</span> <span id="s895">When we came to Israel, right away, Israel.</span> <span id="s896">So what’s going on?</span> <span id="s897">I wanted to try again.</span> <span id="s898">I went to the consulate in -- in Tel Aviv [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: What do you mean, when you saw what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: What -- What’s a --</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: You said, “When we got to Israel, and we saw what was going on.”</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: Yeah, I mean, what’s going on, there are sha -- ho -- hard life is in Israel, and -- and wa -- what’s trouble you can have and no f -- no -- no jobs or nothing.</span> <span id="s903">We were not the only one.</span> <span id="s904">A lot of people ca-came from all over and they didn’t have jobs and the government stil -- wasn’t prepared for that.</span> <span id="s905">So, it was -- it was very hard for everybody.</span> <span id="s906">So -- But I got, first of all, through a friend, I got a apartment from the government.</span> <span id="s907">It was one room, one -- one room, one bathroom and a little kitchen.</span> <span id="s908">So that was already terrific.</span> <span id="s909">It was in the Haifa Bay.</span> <span id="s910">It was from Haifa, about -- about one hour or so with the bus.</span> <span id="s911">And we had in Haifa my cousin there, and some other friends, so that was already ger -- big things, yeah.</span> <span id="s912">We got the apartment, finally, with a key.</span> <span id="s913">When I came home, you know, there was [indecipherable] heaven, I remember.</span> <span id="s914">Oh, and -- and -- and we came there to work.</span> <span id="s915">Again, we need some jobs.</span> <span id="s916">My sister had about hundred dollars in America, whi -- some friend owed her or something.</span> <span id="s917">So she wrote a letter that she would send it to me.</span> <span id="s918">About hundred dollars.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: This is tape number two, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: So, we got the apartment, bu-but we didn’t have the jobs again.</span> <span id="s922">So, my do -- my sister had in America, somebody who was sending us hundred dollars, and for that, I had a idea what to do, to produce s-some children’s bicycles.</span> <span id="s923">I -- I like the --that to do and I had for that the skills and the tools.</span> <span id="s924">So, I started to manufacture them, but it didn’t work out, because there were other companies, there were too many for a little job.</span> <span id="s925">The people didn’t have the ta -- money to buy a bicycle for a kid.</span> <span id="s926">So, it didn’t work out.</span> <span id="s927">Ilsa was in meantime working already like a seamstress, because in these places, there were no ready-made things, clothing, only khakis, yeah.</span> <span id="s928">O-Or -- Or you have a seamstress to do it, from material.</span> <span id="s929">So Ilsa was pretty handy, she really kept us going, and I found a friend who was just leaving for Australia.</span> <span id="s930">He had it.</span> <span id="s931">He was there a longer time and he -- he -- he didn’t want to stay in Israel.</span> <span id="s932">So, then I got in company with him.</span> <span id="s933">He had tools and he knew how to work mechanical.</span> <span id="s934">He was a -- He was a locksmith and he knew a lot of technical things.</span> <span id="s935">So we made a company to make steel windows, to produce steel windows.</span> <span id="s936">We did that for awhile, but again, bad luck, because they g -- the materials were very, very expensive, and there was only with governments, these -- only the government could -- could give you materials.</span> <span id="s937">So, we were too small to get materials from the -- from the manu -- fr-from the government, so you couldn’t get material otherwise, so we had to drop it.</span> <span id="s938">He went to Australia, and I stayed there, again [indecipherable] a job, but I was looking to work at my cousin’s there.</span> <span id="s939">He had this store there and once in while, to help him out.</span> <span id="s940">So, then, what happened?</span> <span id="s941">After that, I got always from Ilsa, the -- the information that’s -- that going to America will be a possibility, but we have to work a lot on this.</span> <span id="s942">And I couldn’t, because I had to look for a job, to make a living.</span> <span id="s943">Finally I found a old friend from Bratislava, who is leaving for Australia, and he said to me, “I can give you my job.”</span> <span id="s944">“What job?”</span> <span id="s945">“I am working in the -- in the electric plant in Haifa, in the head office, I -- I -- as a designer, mechanical designer.</span> <span id="s946">Can you do it?”</span> <span id="s947">I said, “Sure, I can.”</span> <span id="s948">Came in, was a beautiful, big office.</span> <span id="s949">The -- When they heard that I can speak German, their -- their -- their chief doctor -- engineer, was a German Jew, right away he took me, just because I spoke German and because I knew the -- the work, too.</span> <span id="s950">So I got a job for six years.</span> <span id="s951">Good benefits, everything.</span> <span id="s952">It was a normal job, yeah.</span> <span id="s953">And I -- I -- A lot of privileges, very good, very good job.</span> <span id="s954">But that time already we have worked so far with the American exit, that we almost had already the -- the quota filled up, almost.</span> <span id="s955">But the papers were going up and down, up and down and one paper, on the end already, we had already everything done, they stopped us, because they found on my -- my -- no, wha -- the doctor found something with -- with my lung, something on my lung, just a spot.</span> <span id="s956">And that time, they were very exact about these things, so they se -- had to send it to Paris, my x-rays.</span> <span id="s957">All over, the whole body x-rays.</span> <span id="s958">And it was two or three months until I got back the papers, okay.</span> <span id="s959">We got okay, and we looked for the next ship, yeah, to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: A-At that point, you had a good job.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: W-Why did you still both want to go to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: Because I rather would have gone to United States than to stay in America -- I mean, Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: I have a -- We had, first of all Ilsa.</span> <span id="s966">Ilsa beat everything, she wanted very badly to come to America.</span> <span id="s967">I didn’t, because I had nobody here, only Ilsa.</span> <span id="s968">I didn’t even dream to come to America, only Ilsa always dreamed to go.</span> <span id="s969">She wanted to go first here to school.</span> <span id="s970">She wanted to be here.</span> <span id="s971">She had very good -- Her mother is here, her sister, yeah.</span> <span id="s972">And the mother wanted to come here.</span> <span id="s973">Mother came to Israel with us, and her -- f-first of all, and then, before -- she left sooner, so the mother was already here and -- and the aunt and e-everything.</span> <span id="s974">So they wanted us, we have to come out, we have to come out.</span> <span id="s975">So, came out.</span> <span id="s976">First of all, I was very disappointed because they always told me America is everything straight and good.</span> <span id="s977">And I saw that a lot of people came to America without sweating it out, and they came to America and -- and were not the best people, the best material what America should have taken in.</span> <span id="s978">Yeah, they were all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s979">I -- I knew that time, that there is not everybody perfect.</span> <span id="s980">A lot of Communists they took in that time, too.</span> <span id="s981">And so, we went fi-finally to America.</span> <span id="s982">We had already one daughter, Nomy, three years old, and s-so we packed up everything.</span> <span id="s983">We sold whatever we could se-sell.</span> <span id="s984">I remember I bought a camera, a Leica, that was my idea always and I -- I don’t know, some -- some money we took with us, but not much.</span> <span id="s985">But, nothing we -- was missing.</span> <span id="s986">We came on a beautiful ship.</span> <span id="s987">We had a -- a stormy ocean, and we all were very sick, but otherwise, it was luxury already.</span> <span id="s988">I don’t know, I was running with -- with Nomy on the bo -- deck of the ship, because I don’t -- didn’t want her to be sick.</span> <span id="s989">And Ilsa was so sick that she was laying in bed day and night without moving.</span> <span id="s990">So, finally we got to America.</span> <span id="s991">When we saw the Statue of Liberty, we were all excited and -- and -- and crying and everything.</span> <span id="s992">Everybody on the ship, that was a real immigrant ship, oh, that was a ship, yeah.</span> <span id="s993">And finally, we came to America, my a -- my aunt took us in and then they rented apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: Your aunt?</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: No, Ilsa’s aunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: Ilsa’s, okay, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: I had nobody here.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: Right, right, just checking.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: Yeah, and her mother, they were living together already.</span> <span id="s1000">And they were both seamstresses on Fifth Avenue and -- and -- and Park Avenue there, they always working, and they wanted Ilsa should work there with them.</span> <span id="s1001">So Ilsa worked as a seamstress too, for -- for a -- quite awhile, even then, in New York.</span> <span id="s1002">We came to New York.</span> <span id="s1003">And me, I got a job in two weeks.</span> <span id="s1004">I didn’t speak English.</span> <span id="s1005">I got a job because the company where -- where they hired me, there was some old engineers who spoke German.</span> <span id="s1006">I spoke German, but I spoke -- I knew the technical word in English because -- because I worked in the -- in Haifa, in the head office, yeah.</span> <span id="s1007">So I had to know all the technical language and everything.</span> <span id="s1008">So I was there.</span> <span id="s1009">In two weeks, I got a job, 75 dollars a week.</span> <span id="s1010">But I tell you something, for us that was money.</span> <span id="s1011">And the second or the third week, I got already 140 dollars a week.</span> <span id="s1012">And so on and so on.</span> <span id="s1013">In one year, I had triple those, or four times as much as -- as from the beginning.</span> <span id="s1014">And I have all the companies here what I work.</span> <span id="s1015">It was really some resume, if you would see that resume.</span> <span id="s1016">Then, the last job -- yeah, the last job was in the World’s Trade Center, on wa -- 94th floor, Hayward Robinson, yeah.</span> <span id="s1017">And I worked a lot in field, too.</span> <span id="s1018">And I worked there for over 10 years, 94th floor.</span> <span id="s1019">It’s the suda -- the same building as -- as that bomb scare was, what was bombed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: You -- Were you there then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: No, luckily [indecipherable] was here already, I was retired.</span> <span id="s1022">I retired there after 10 years, and when the children wanted we should come over here, we should si -- retire here, we came and we stayed.</span> <span id="s1023">We had a very nice house in the Poconos, in Pennsylvania, but we sold it and bought here this apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: Can you talk a little bit about the importance of work?</span> <span id="s1025">I mean, of course work is important, you have to provide for your family, but I wonder if it didn’t have another importance as you were putting your life back together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: What do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: Th-Tha-That actually having a job and working, was a way to get back on your feet literally, but also emotionally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: Yes, yes, right, right.</span> <span id="s1029">Ev-Every time I got a job, it was emotional, and -- and was very important.</span> <span id="s1030">That puts me I -- actually on my feet.</span> <span id="s1031">I love to work and -- and especially if I could work in my line, it was very important and I really appreciate that -- first of all that -- that there were available jobs here, and that you could make a living here.</span> <span id="s1032">Nowhere in the world you can make a living like right here.</span> <span id="s1033">Any-Anybody -- Anybody with any skills, because you have every sk -- every skill here.</span> <span id="s1034">So it was really very important to come here.</span> <span id="s1035">I would have never achieved that in -- in Israel, never.</span> <span id="s1036">Couldn’t have -- Couldn’t buy a refrigerator, I remember, yeah.</span> <span id="s1037">When my -- my -- I mean Ilsa’s mother came to Israel, we didn’t have where to put her down, so what we did, we built, illegally, a little -- little room for her and the kid.</span> <span id="s1038">It was so small and hot, my God, this -- this -- the sand, that’s was -- our first apartment in Israel was in the sand, in the -- in the desert, really.</span> <span id="s1039">And -- And we were at the beach, at the -- at the water, at the bay and I -- [indecipherable] once almost we drowned [indecipherable] with Ilsa.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: Even when you got to Israel, there was still this feeling that you weren’t settled, because you wanted to come to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: Do you remember a time when, after you had gotten to the United States, that you looked around and you thought, okay, I’m finally settled?</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: We -- We had no choice -- We would have no choice.</span> <span id="s1044">We would have settled in Israel, if not -- if not these -- came by that we got the okay to go to America.</span> <span id="s1045">E-Everybody who had something like that was jumping on it, because it was very nice if you were a idealist.</span> <span id="s1046">I was a idealist once upon a time, but when you have a family and when you want something more of your life and I thought I had enough of -- o-of bad things in my life.</span> <span id="s1047">I want already a normal -- normal, good life.</span> <span id="s1048">That’s all.</span> <span id="s1049">I had the skills, I had the know-how, everything, and my wife, too.</span> <span id="s1050">So why shouldn’t we have finally a little normal life, yeah?</span> <span id="s1051">We had terrible lives, because it’s not just what I am telling you now, but in between and before that and all that, that’s -- it -- it’s unbelievable what -- what people go through.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: Can you talk a little bit about when you got to the United States, when and if you decided to become a citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1054">Well, it’s -- that was -- naturally, we wanted to be citizens.</span> <span id="s1055">We were -- The first thing was a gr-green card, and -- and to be a full-fledged citizen.</span> <span id="s1056">We didn’t wait to -- We didn’t wait to ge-get to do it.</span> <span id="s1057">And m-my mother-in-law and -- and the aunts, they were all for it, naturally.</span> <span id="s1058">They -- They wanted right away we should be citizens as soon as possible.</span> <span id="s1059">And we didn’t speak English and they will know I don’t peak -- speak good, but Ilsa was speaking much better and -- and faster.</span> <span id="s1060">And -- But we -- we found our way.</span> <span id="s1061">In New York, you have to find your way.</span> <span id="s1062">And then I helped even more, when the Russian immigrants came.</span> <span id="s1063">I helped them a lot, in my office.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: They -- They were engineers who -- who were -- was engineer.</span> <span id="s1066">They didn’t know American standards and things, so I had to show them everything, and I helped them, a lot of them.</span> <span id="s1067">A lot of them I helped.</span> <span id="s1068">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: Did you -- mm-hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: Was -- I had a very nice life because I have pictures where I was looking -- overlooking all New York, yeah, 94th floor.</span> <span id="s1071">It was ra -- straight with the -- with the Empire State Building.</span> <span id="s1072">So, it was really ideal place, or we were looking down a-at the port, we saw the -- the ships, yeah, and the cruise -- the cruisers going.</span> <span id="s1073">It was really a beautiful place to work.</span> <span id="s1074">And a lot of restaurants and things.</span> <span id="s1075">I remember one anniversary, we were on the 107th floor in the -- in the World’s Trade Center, with Ilsa, having a nice dinner.</span> <span id="s1076">It was really freedom, what we were looking for.</span> <span id="s1077">And even today, we cannot complain.</span> <span id="s1078">Our children are nice to us, and have a comfortable house, so I cannot complain, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: You married a survivor.</span> <span id="s1080">How important was that to you, that -- that your wife be someone who’d had an experience similar to yours?</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1082">I -- I looked for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: I looked for it.</span> <span id="s1085">I could have married -- I had girlfriends in Prague, they would have married me, not -- not Jewish and they would have married me, but I kept it ri -- ri -- reserve, always, that I have t -- I owed something to life, because I was saved, so I -- I have to save somebody.</span> <span id="s1086">Ilsa would have married, very easily.</span> <span id="s1087">She was pretty, and -- and -- and intelligent.</span> <span id="s1088">But, it came out all right, thank God.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: You said that you kept -- that you had to save someone.</span> <span id="s1090">Could you speak a little more about that?</span> <span id="s1091">Did -- Did you feel that you and Ilsa saved each other in some way?</span> <span id="s1092">A: No, you don’t feel like that, but that time, I felt like that, that I have to do that.</span> <span id="s1093">And I owed something to life that I should marry a nice, Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s1094">She wasn’t even Jewish, re -- Ilsa is not so strict Jewish, that -- that -- that would have matter -- mattered that she wouldn’t have, saved -- married a Jewish boy.</span> <span id="s1095">But you see, somehow the feeling, they stay with you.</span> <span id="s1096">And I felt that -- that I -- it -- it would be proper.</span> <span id="s1097">I lost so many -- so many relatives, so many children, yeah.</span> <span id="s1098">I should be productive, [indecipherable] should be doing the right thing.</span> <span id="s1099">That’s what I thought, doing the right thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: What is that?</span> <span id="s1101">What is doing the right thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: That’s what I’m saying, that I married her and not somebody else.</span> <span id="s1103">I could have married 10 girls.</span> <span id="s1104">Firsa -- First of all, she was ideal for me, the background and everything.</span> <span id="s1105">I knew it, I had enough experience t-to to [indecipherable] it so, I knew that will -- that will work, and she knew it e -- too.</span> <span id="s1106">Then you have the feeling what’s right and what’s not right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: When you had your two daughters, and as you raised them, how and when did you begin to tell them about your experiences in the Holocaust, particularly in the camps?</span> <span id="s1108">A: Well, they knew that, they knew that.</span> <span id="s1109">They heard it long time before, yeah.</span> <span id="s1110">Even in Israel, so everybody in Israel was some kind of a -- a refugee from something.</span> <span id="s1111">But she was a little -- a little girl and when we came here, no connection any more, yeah, with these things.</span> <span id="s1112">She -- They know that we -- what’s our background, but they have a different life, they have a normal life.</span> <span id="s1113">Why would they want to know that?</span> <span id="s1114">Nomy doesn’t want to see even that tape, doesn’t want to see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: No.</span> <span id="s1117">No.</span> <span id="s1118">And I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s1119">Because she’s afraid, she’s afraid.</span> <span id="s1120">She knows.</span> <span id="s1121">She knows everything, but she’s afraid.</span> <span id="s1122">And Karen, my -- my younger daughter, she’s not -- not really Jewish, what I wanted to be [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1123">She made her own life.</span> <span id="s1124">First of all, she married a non-Jew, and -- and I was brought up that way, so I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s1125">So, but I couldn’t tell her what -- whom she should marry.</span> <span id="s1126">And it didn’t work out.</span> <span id="s1127">If she would have done what I told her to do, and whom to marry, sh -- it would have worked out, I’m quite sure.</span> <span id="s1128">But, she’s not unhappy, and that’s -- that’s fine with me.</span> <span id="s1129">Everybody makes his own life.</span> <span id="s1130">I didn’t -- I wouldn’t like to get through again, all these things what I went through, not any more.</span> <span id="s1131">Even if I would be with twen -- 30 or for -- 40 years younger, I wouldn’t like to go through that.</span> <span id="s1132">No, you can’t, because that started long time before.</span> <span id="s1133">Such a beautiful country where I come from.</span> <span id="s1134">Life was very good there, except -- except --</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: Except what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: Like this -- people -- people were bad.</span> <span id="s1137">There you have the Hungarians, there you have the -- the Slovaks, there you have the Poles, bad, bad.</span> <span id="s1138">I don’t know why, makes no sense.</span> <span id="s1139">They just drink it with the mother’s milk, yeah.</span> <span id="s1140">Why, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1141">An-And the Catholics, they didn’t have right to do that, what they did.</span> <span id="s1142">They should have stopped it.</span> <span id="s1143">Did you hear something like that, the priest should be [indecipherable] of a -- of a Fascist country, friend of a -- of the biggest Fascist in the world, yeah.</span> <span id="s1144">Well, there are such abnormal things in this life, unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1145">And then the -- But there were always some people who were really nice, really nice.</span> <span id="s1146">You didn’t have something like that, for instance, this old woman, when I was hiding underground, that -- that she would protect you.</span> <span id="s1147">Was a old woman alone, she protected us, a whole bunch of -- of -- of boys.</span> <span id="s1148">That we wa -- got caught, that’s a different story, you know.</span> <span id="s1149">I -- I think so, I told -- I -- I told it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">Q: Yeah, you did tell that story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: What are your thoughts about what is happening in Yugoslavia now?</span> <span id="s1153">For instance, even this week, we’re seeing the United -- well, NATO, along with United States, bombing, and -- and there’s ethnic cleansing going on.</span> <span id="s1154">What -- What kinds of thoughts does that bring up for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: The same thing, the same thing, the same -- it’s a holocaust, it’s a holocaust, except shorter.</span> <span id="s1156">Th-The Germans stretched it too long, yeah.</span> <span id="s1157">This here, he doesn’t wait, he just rounds them up and then kills them off.</span> <span id="s1158">I don’t know how the world can look at it.</span> <span id="s1159">They shouldn’t let it go.</span> <span id="s1160">Everybody who is not helping us to do that, to stop them is -- is -- is guilty, cause that’s a sin, really.</span> <span id="s1161">It’s the biggest sin.</span> <span id="s1162">People with the children, and old people there is, yeah.</span> <span id="s1163">And what will be next?</span> <span id="s1164">Next, if -- if they -- the -- they win it, will be the same thing.</span> <span id="s1165">Same thing.</span> <span id="s1166">I’m just afraid whoever wins this war, will do the same to the other guy, always.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: S-So what lessons can be learned from your experience with the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s1168">What lessons did you learn?</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: If people don’t change it, th-th-th-th -- that history repeats themself.</span> <span id="s1170">But [indecipherable] good, not good.</span> <span id="s1171">Even the children, they -- they change, yeah.</span> <span id="s1172">They can have today the holocaust a-and have children, everything, and then they will do it to the others ones.</span> <span id="s1173">They -- They do it to each other.</span> <span id="s1174">They don’t think about it from one day to the other, that today you do it to me, I do it to you.</span> <span id="s1175">And that’s what is happening.</span> <span id="s1176">Tha-That’s what happening with the World War One.</span> <span id="s1177">You do -- It -- It started to roll, it couldn’t be stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Michael Diamond.</span> <span id="s1180">This is tape number three, side A. Following on the question we were just speaking about, Yugoslavia and Kosovo, and lessons to be learned from the Holocaust, but did you yourself, personally, learn anything from your experience, when you think back over it and you think back about how it shaped you?</span> <span id="s1181">What -- What did you learn?</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: I can see ahead of time things coming and going.</span> <span id="s1183">I know -- I see the consequences of everything.</span> <span id="s1184">E-Even -- Even this whole thing is a -- the consequence of World War Two.</span> <span id="s1185">And who -- whoever is stronger, wins, not who is right or wrong, who is stronger.</span> <span id="s1186">If -- If a guy like that Milosevitch can tell -- tell us, the whole world, yeah, he will do what he wants to do, and he is doing what he wants to do, so there is no -- there is no way to -- to stop somebody.</span> <span id="s1187">And s -- it’s -- it -- the other thing, it’s like Hitler was.</span> <span id="s1188">But there we can ha -- we can have an excuse, we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1189">Well, they da -- see what’s going on, and they are not together, all these countries.</span> <span id="s1190">That time, there was no allies, really, when Hitler started.</span> <span id="s1191">That came just mu-much later, when everything was ra -- was finished already.</span> <span id="s1192">Here they have it, a long time, he should be long time branded as a -- as a murderer.</span> <span id="s1193">A long time.</span> <span id="s1194">I wonder that the whole world can look at it and -- and not decide, really, to -- to hit him on the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1195">And the Russian, I don’t know about the Russians [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1196">They just don’t like that like that we are -- have the allies.</span> <span id="s1197">I think so that’s -- that’s most of ho -- of it.</span> <span id="s1198">But otherwise, they know what -- what -- what it was, they had it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: A-After you left Israel, and then came here, have you ever gone back to ches -- Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: No.</span> <span id="s1201">I wouldn’t go.</span> <span id="s1202">I couldn’t look at their eyes, these people.</span> <span id="s1203">Because they hate me ag -- still they hate me, no matter what.</span> <span id="s1204">I never did them nothing, an-and they hate me, so what can I tell you?</span> <span id="s1205">I have there some friends now, who went back, but they don’t like it.</span> <span id="s1206">Nobody likes it, still.</span> <span id="s1207">Still the same thing.</span> <span id="s1208">People don’t change.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Q: What about here, in the United States?</span> <span id="s1210">Do you ever experience anti-Semitism here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1212">I don’t expect nothing, yeah, but I didn’t, no.</span> <span id="s1213">I mean, I know people are not hundred percent, but I -- I don’t feel bad.</span> <span id="s1214">I -- I don’t feel bad.</span> <span id="s1215">I feel pretty comfortable.</span> <span id="s1216">Not everything is hundred percent, as I say.</span> <span id="s1217">Sometimes I am -- I am very angry if -- if people -- if -- you know, o-our religion, th -- if -- if they don’t behave like they should.</span> <span id="s1218">But I cannot -- Everybody had his own nature.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: What would be an example of that, when you’re angry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: If, let’s say, a -- things like -- like this Monica, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: Monica Lewinsky?</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: Yeah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: That makes me angry, yeah.</span> <span id="s1225">Why a little Jewish girl, stupid, can do something like that and is doing something like that.</span> <span id="s1226">If I was to be her parent, I would give her a good [indecipherable], believe me.</span> <span id="s1227">Couldn’t do it to me.</span> <span id="s1228">And then I -- I get angry at politicians, if they stick their noses in things what’s not their business, and so on, I don’t like it.</span> <span id="s1229">I don’t to -- like -- like to be pushy.</span> <span id="s1230">I never was.</span> <span id="s1231">I had -- And there are some people who think they have to dominate the whole world.</span> <span id="s1232">So, that’s all.</span> <span id="s1233">I can see one thing, the less you -- less you push around, better you ove -- you have a quiet, reasonable life.</span> <span id="s1234">That’s what I dreamed o-of, always.</span> <span id="s1235">I made it.</span> <span id="s1236">Nobody made it for me, I had to do it you -- ourself.</span> <span id="s1237">So my wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">Q: You know, one thing that we didn’t ask you about in the first interview, was the role of religion in your household when you were growing up, and I wonder if you could talk a little bit about that, when you were younger, and then perhaps, maybe now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">A: No, the religion didn’t count much, that much.</span> <span id="s1240">But, they -- they made us to suffer.</span> <span id="s1241">They made us suffer.</span> <span id="s1242">We -- We Jews had one -- this family and a ra -- a normal life, and everybody else tried to squeeze us.</span> <span id="s1243">That was always in Europe.</span> <span id="s1244">In every -- every -- every religion.</span> <span id="s1245">There’s always a religion, but it shouldn’t have been.</span> <span id="s1246">Some were very bad, some were really very bad anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s1247">I don’t know why, where they took it from.</span> <span id="s1248">The relig -- The Jews didn’t give them even a reasons, because they were doing their own business.</span> <span id="s1249">But jealousy, and all these things bring out the worst from people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">Q: So now, you say that religion wasn’t -- didn’t have a big role when you were young, but what about when you got married, or now even.</span> <span id="s1251">Does it -- Does your faith play a big role in your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1253">I feel very comfortable.</span> <span id="s1254">And so Ilsa.</span> <span id="s1255">We have no -- no feelings for -- for -- that we would be cheated or -- or that we would be hated, no.</span> <span id="s1256">We feel very comfortable.</span> <span id="s1257">I cannot say nothing.</span> <span id="s1258">Some people are really very nice.</span> <span id="s1259">Like here, we have neighbors who will help you if you need them.</span> <span id="s1260">I fi -- We try not to use nobody, yeah, but if you need them, they are here.</span> <span id="s1261">They’re nice.</span> <span id="s1262">And those are simple people here, nothing -- nothing overwhelming.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">Q: I want you to think back to the -- that whole period when you were on the run, this is when you -- before you were captured, you were in hiding and then you were in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1264">And you talked a lot about that you had an instinct for survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q: That you would -- you would --</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: -- rip a root out of the ground and eat it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: Yeah, yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: When you think ba-back on that, where did that come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: Good -- Good background.</span> <span id="s1272">Good background, very s -- very strong background, a healthy background.</span> <span id="s1273">I was, at least.</span> <span id="s1274">If that wouldn’t have come, I would be t-today a young man, if that not -- this is -- this lousy sicknesses and things wheth-whether -- I had t-to go through.</span> <span id="s1275">I would be much stronger, and so Ilsa.</span> <span id="s1276">Ilsa has had edema.</span> <span id="s1277">You know what’s edema?</span> <span id="s1278">The water.</span> <span id="s1279">She -- Through -- Through her arm, she almost died, yeah.</span> <span id="s1280">A young girl, 16 years old, and she ca -- and she was cold, and her mother, I ha -- a real hero, you know, her mother.</span> <span id="s1281">She pulled them -- one pulled the -- out the other.</span> <span id="s1282">They were both in -- in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1283">And she was so sick, she was a dead -- she almost died.</span> <span id="s1284">Now, I was there too, I know.</span> <span id="s1285">It wa -- I -- I was as -- how can I say it?</span> <span id="s1286">Like on the -- on the string.</span> <span id="s1287">Just -- Just a hair, like a hair string.</span> <span id="s1288">Very, very dangerous situations.</span> <span id="s1289">And somehow, I wasn’t upset, I wasn’t afraid or something.</span> <span id="s1290">Somehow I felt that -- had always the feeling I will survive it.</span> <span id="s1291">I remember I told my parents, when they were worrying about the children, yeah, my sister and me, I always told them, I have the feeling we will survive it.</span> <span id="s1292">And I was smart enough to survive it.</span> <span id="s1293">But it was a -- as I say, you had to think what you are doing, too.</span> <span id="s1294">It was not easy to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">Q: In your every day life now, how often do you think about that time, or what makes you think of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">A: The news, the television.</span> <span id="s1297">I watch carefully the news and I have perfect knowledge of their intentions, of intentions and -- and -- and history.</span> <span id="s1298">Actually, I lived history, you can say -- you could say that, yeah.</span> <span id="s1299">I didn’t want to stay with the Communists, I could have stayed with the Communists.</span> <span id="s1300">All our -- my friends, many friends stayed there, but they told me, “You will stay here for the -- for a -- other centuries?</span> <span id="s1301">Y-You stupid, you do that.</span> <span id="s1302">You have no sense.”</span> <span id="s1303">I said to him, “Why are you staying?”</span> <span id="s1304">“Ah, my mother, my wife, my children.”</span> <span id="s1305">Well, well, weet -- weet.</span> <span id="s1306">To do something, to -- you have to have a will.</span> <span id="s1307">You cannot just let [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1308">You have to have a will.</span> <span id="s1309">I was hiding, for instance, yeah, when I tha -- jumped to -- out from the window, yeah.</span> <span id="s1310">I remember the next time I was caught, a young girl came to me and said, “I know you, you jumped last time also, in the window.</span> <span id="s1311">If you save me, I will be your -- your slave,” she said to me, “if you save me, if you help me to get out.”</span> <span id="s1312">I said, “I cannot get out myself, how could I he-he-help you?”</span> <span id="s1313">Beautiful youn -- young girl.</span> <span id="s1314">We were there, rounded up.</span> <span id="s1315">[indecipherable] there.</span> <span id="s1316">SS guy walking up and down there, up and down there, yeah.</span> <span id="s1317">Apartment house, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: D-Do you have nightmares about your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: Sometimes, yeah.</span> <span id="s1320">I don’t know, most my -- my -- my dreams are from a old, big city, in an old, big city.</span> <span id="s1321">I am looking for somebody, I am -- I am fighting with somebody.</span> <span id="s1322">The trouble is, sometimes I hit my wife.</span> <span id="s1323">It can happen.</span> <span id="s1324">Once in awhile, it happens.</span> <span id="s1325">I fight.</span> <span id="s1326">And -- And now it’s a little better, but it used to be that I broke the table, yeah, the night table I broke.</span> <span id="s1327">Fell down from bed, all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s1328">Here I have a gash.</span> <span id="s1329">I remember I fell.</span> <span id="s1330">I was fighting with the -- with the table, with the night table, and fell down and fell on this, I have here, a -- a little this [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">Q: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">A: And this, that cut me very bad, a very deep, deep gash.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">Q: I want to go back to probably, I guess you got here in 1956 - ’57, to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">A: ’56.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1336">D-Do you remember some of the reactions you had to what was going on in the United States?</span> <span id="s1337">For instance, in the 50’s, Joseph McCarthy was ig --</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1339">I heard about it, sure I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: What -- What -- What did you think of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: Crazy, crazy.</span> <span id="s1342">He -- He hated the Communists, okay, you hate the Communists, but h-he was making Communists ou-out of people who were -- who were not and didn’t have to become Communists.</span> <span id="s1343">It was ridiculous.</span> <span id="s1344">Now -- Now you have that Starr, doing the same, yeah.</span> <span id="s1345">I mean, you can always compare, [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1346">I had experiences with -- with the Hungarians when they came, you know, when they had that revolution.</span> <span id="s1347">But again, they -- they were not -- not good.</span> <span id="s1348">I protected them, I -- I hired them, yeah.</span> <span id="s1349">They ask me, the company, if they have enough education, if -- if they are -- well, I said “Yes, they have good ed-education, but I didn’t [indecipherable] you they are bad.”</span> <span id="s1350">They took, for instance, money from the company and -- and disappeared, yeah.</span> <span id="s1351">Or advance money the company wanted to give them, things like that, all right.</span> <span id="s1352">That’s what I know their character.</span> <span id="s1353">They are very talented with the character, yeah.</span> <span id="s1354">S -- Always depends on the character, not even on -- on -- on -- on money, nothing.</span> <span id="s1355">Money cannot buy character.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: I-In the McCarthy era, y-you thought it was crazy, were you ever worried or concerned that -- that you could become a target of that kind of investigation?</span> <span id="s1357">I mean, or -- you know, wrongly or rightly so, you could be thought, “Well, he’s a foreigner, he probably has Communist ties.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: Yes, I -- I was thinking about it, many times, and I was afraid it shouldn’t escalate, because that was not normal wha-what he was doing, was really abnormal.</span> <span id="s1361">And the whole world was laughing at it.</span> <span id="s1362">It was a -- It was a show, it was a show.</span> <span id="s1363">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1364">They are always find somebody, somebody comes up, which you cannot control.</span> <span id="s1365">I mean, it’s all -- it’s a free country and something can happen like that?</span> <span id="s1366">Can a -- Can a prosecutor just do what he wants, yeah?</span> <span id="s1367">In this country -- there are a lot of things what I don’t like in this country.</span> <span id="s1368">But, if you compare it with other countries, it’s heaven -- it’s heaven.</span> <span id="s1369">Everybody has a possibility to live -- to make a living.</span> <span id="s1370">I see these young immigrants come in here, with no education, with nothing, and they are making a living, so the -- so the -- so what’s wrong with this country, yeah?</span> <span id="s1371">I -- I would say they should be more selective, they live somebody here.</span> <span id="s1372">I -- I remember it was so hard for me to come here, I will never forget it, very hard.</span> <span id="s1373">And, if I would have paid off some lawyer, I would have been long time ago here, already, not suffered, because it was suffering.</span> <span id="s1374">Every -- Every evening when news, it came from -- from Tel Aviv, yeah I was waiting for what -- what’s going on?</span> <span id="s1375">What’s this a -- still missing this, still missing that, still missing [indecipherable] I -- it was so hard.</span> <span id="s1376">And then, when I -- when we got it already, I was really in seventh heaven, because I knew it was America, at least I -- I thought I knew.</span> <span id="s1377">I won’t say it’s perfect, but it cannot be perfect, people are not perfect.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">Q: A-At what point did you begin to feel safe and at home here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">A: Right away.</span> <span id="s1380">Right away, except the language.</span> <span id="s1381">The language, I -- it took me three months t-to learn th -- so far -- I mean a kitchen language, but I di -- wasn’t worry about it, yeah.</span> <span id="s1382">I didn’t feel bad about it.</span> <span id="s1383">I -- you know, it will come the time, I will get to everything.</span> <span id="s1384">The main point, I have a job, and that’s what everybody’s looking, everywhere, yeah.</span> <span id="s1385">The Communist people, they have no idea about English and they will never speak English, yeah, and get a job, whatever job what makes a living, yeah.</span> <span id="s1386">I don’t know how is that possible.</span> <span id="s1387">No other country can do that.</span> <span id="s1388">It’s very, very funny, to think that -- that you can get a job any time you want.</span> <span id="s1389">Look, you can see it written out, job.</span> <span id="s1390">If I would have had that in Israel, I would have probably stayed there, right away, if I would have had it, okay.</span> <span id="s1391">Nobody has it right away in Israel.</span> <span id="s1392">It’s very hard to -- to -- to have jobs, a good job in Israel.</span> <span id="s1393">No, these Russians are coming, there are millions of Russians, they want to come to Israel.</span> <span id="s1394">It will not be easy, because they -- they -- they think themselves superior, first of all, and they -- that’s -- that jobs are coming to them, that their apartment is coming to them because they are sup -- used from the Communists, yeah, that they get everything.</span> <span id="s1395">But, what little [indecipherable] that you get it, that’s it.</span> <span id="s1396">Not only they come to Israel, they want all -- all jobs and they want a -- a apartment.</span> <span id="s1397">But when I came there, what I got?</span> <span id="s1398">A blue eye.</span> <span id="s1399">Yeah, it wasn’t easy, but there were nice people in the -- I can say, some people were.</span> <span id="s1400">They helped us, our neighbors there [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1401">It was a -- this -- for-foreman, a -- construction business.</span> <span id="s1402">And she was a housewife, very nice, very pretty.</span> <span id="s1403">And they had two little children, I -- I remember -- I -- I was [indecipherable] save the little child from a snake.</span> <span id="s1404">That’s -- It’s a li-little child, yeah, like that, she wanted to grab the -- the -- the snake, on -- on the porch.</span> <span id="s1405">On the porch.</span> <span id="s1406">Then I came on the porch, and that was a poisonous snake.</span> <span id="s1407">Then I kill it.</span> <span id="s1408">I co-could s-save her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">Q: Mr. Diamond, is -- is there anything you’d like to say that I haven’t asked you about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">A: No, I think so [indecipherable] that’s it.</span> <span id="s1411">I am sorry, I don’t know what -- would you like to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">Q: No, I just -- I always ask that.</span> <span id="s1413">I -- I will ask one -- one more question, I guess it’s this.</span> <span id="s1414">As people who actually lived through the Holocaust get older, th-there will be a time when we won’t be able to sit and talk with people who actually experienced this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">A: Ye-Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">Q: What do you want people to take away, and to remember.</span> <span id="s1417">Wh-What do you want?</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">A: They shouldn’t -- They just shouldn’t forget it, there exists something like that.</span> <span id="s1419">Because people like to -- tend to -- to forget about everything what’s not pleasant.</span> <span id="s1420">I see it right now, where I go -- we go in sometimes to the Jewish -- how do you call it?</span> <span id="s1421">For the sin -- seniors.</span> <span id="s1422">For the seniors.</span> <span id="s1423">We go sometimes and -- and they don’t want to -- even to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1424">Not interested.</span> <span id="s1425">I don’t know, if they are not interested in that, then what -- what are they interested in?</span> <span id="s1426">[indecipherable], it can happen to them.</span> <span id="s1427">You never know.</span> <span id="s1428">Nobody is safe from that, nobody is safe.</span> <span id="s1429">Okay, so they are right, they are here in -- in America and they don’t have to -- to d-do anything they don’t want to, but I wouldn’t like them to forget it.</span> <span id="s1430">It’s very important, especially the kids.</span> <span id="s1431">The kids, because if the old ones don’t -- don’t want to remember, don’t want to know, they don’t want to know, that’s all.</span> <span id="s1432">I think the children, you can only expect them to go to these places and see on their own eyes, that -- that -- what horror was this.</span> <span id="s1433">Can you imagine my parents?</span> <span id="s1434">If I think about it, beautiful people, very good.</span> <span id="s1435">I -- I have pictures from everything.</span> <span id="s1436">Beautiful, elegant people, really a gentry, my father was, and my mother was 50 years old, beautiful woman, talented, everything, yeah.</span> <span id="s1437">So, to make life so cheap, yeah, that shows you tha -- doesn’t mean nothing.</span> <span id="s1438">You see -- You see it on the pictures here, life doesn’t mean nothing, right?</span> <span id="s1439">It’s just, it’s a horror, what’s going on with people.</span> <span id="s1440">Little, beautiful children, nice, nice race, everything.</span> <span id="s1441">You expect something like that, let’s say, somewhere -- somewhere deep in Africa, over there.</span> <span id="s1442">But you don’t expect in the civilized world, something like that.</span> <span id="s1443">They’re supposed to be civilized.</span> <span id="s1444">You see what nice housing -- what nice -- how nice roads and everything they had, they are civilized, but you cannot, with something like that.</span> <span id="s1445">You don’t mean nothing, you are a fly.</span> <span id="s1446">It’s very, very humiliating, it’s very humiliating that what can happen to -- to the rest -- to a -- to a -- to a people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">Q: Wh-When you’re treated like that, like you’re nothing, like you’re a fly, after it was over, how did you regain your dignity, your feeling that you were worth something?</span> <span id="s1448">A: Yes, I felt it, but only for myself.</span> <span id="s1449">I didn’t want to -- to tell it to nobody.</span> <span id="s1450">I -- I had the -- the power, the will.</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">Q: You had -- You never lost it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1453">No, that’s it.</span> <span id="s1454">And that’s all my background, first my -- first the background from home, second, I -- I had some rough experiences, and I knew that you have to go through with it.</span> <span id="s1455">Now, for instance, like that army there, that was some place, too, yeah.</span> <span id="s1456">Working in high snow, in -- in -- in -- in -- on the roads, in the high mountains, was minus 30, minus 40.</span> <span id="s1457">Yeah, was always terrible.</span> <span id="s1458">I-I live.</span> <span id="s1459">I will find ways to survive.</span> <span id="s1460">You see, if I wouldn’t have picked myself up and caught that -- that horse by -- by the -- by the [indecipherable] I would le -- I wouldn’t survive.</span> <span id="s1461">I wouldn’t survive at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">End of Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">Conclusion of Interview USHMM Archives
