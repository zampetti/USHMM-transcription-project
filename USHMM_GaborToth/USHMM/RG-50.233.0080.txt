Abstract Nathan Magier was living in Bedzin, Poland with his mother, father, and two brothers when the Germans invaded. He recalls several days of bombings. His brother was sent to a camp and Nathan never saw him again. Nathan was put to work on various labor projects before being sent to the ghetto. While in the ghetto, he was separated from his father and never saw him again. When the deportations to the camp started, he hid in a wall with his mother, but brought her out when soldiers searched the ghetto. “‘Til today, I eat my life out. I eat my life out because I took her out from the attic.” In 1943, he was sent first to Birkenau and then to Auschwitz. He worked as a tailor in Birkenau, and in Auschwitz he was put to work outside the camp. He escaped from Auschwitz and joined the underground resistance where he was wounded. He joined the Russian Army, but deserted and was arrested for deserting. He married in Italy, and went to Montreal, Canada in 1951. He came to the United States in 1955. At the time of the interview, he lived in Lake Hiawatha, New Jersey.

Anthony: So your father’s side was strict, they were orthodox?
Nathan: Very orthodox.
Anthony: Your mother was more modern?
Nathan: More modern, was more—so my father was very modern in our home. As a matter of fact, if I have to tell you the truth, my mother didn’t get along with my father’s side. I find out now here in the United States about my mother and my father. My grandfather’s very happy to marry for my mother from my father’s side. I mean the sisters already were against her. My grandmother, she was a very strict, very religious person. [Female voice: And your mother wasn’t]. My mother wasn’t.
Anthony: So they objected to your mother because she wasn’t religious enough?
Nathan: But, I mean, they were happy. What’s true is true, my mother wasn’t very happy. She never went to them but they all came to my mother, though. My father has brothers and sisters, 13, a very big family.

Nathan: All in Bedzin.
Anthony: So you had a lot of--?
Nathan: Well no, our family name in town was very well-known. All the people know us even in the United States and Canada. My grandmother comes from—she had a title on my father’s side. A title like, you know. I forget in Yiddish how they call her. Like “caballero” in Italian, you know, something. She had a title in Yiddish. They were very respected people. They had very big business. My father come from a very wealthy family. We make lots of charities.
Anthony: Is this because of the furniture factory?
Nathan: No, no. That is from my father’s side. They were very big wholesalers, but were very respected people. We help lots of people. Not to brag about it, you know, people in Poland used to be Jewish people, beggars. They used to come to my grandmother, she was like a soldier, she was bitchy, excuse my expression, but she is. Some of them, they used to come two, three times. Understand?
Anthony: Yes.
Nathan: But she got all laid down enough charity money for them, everybody. Even the Christians, they used to come. She was a very educated woman.
Anthony: Your grandmother?
Nathan: Yes, she spoke Russian, Polish, German, of course Yiddish and Hebrew, you know. In those days a woman in Poland in that time, very few were educated. She was a very educated woman. I don’t know if you know Polish history. Poland has the greatest, biggest illiterate people in the world. That was Poland until Cuszevesky (?) (95) came into power. Then it was a law. I don’t know today, but you see very few women know how to read and write. My mother know how to read and write.
Anthony: What kind of school did your mother go to?
Nathan: Well, I do not remember that where she went. This I really don’t remember. I don’t know even my father. I was just a kid, do you understand? My mother used to go to school, she was a teacher for poor people. She was very-- [Female voice: very active in school.] Very active. She was a very good-looking woman.
Anthony: I can see in the photo.
Nathan: I can remember like today, she used to have long hair, she was a good singer.
Anthony: Your mother was a singer?
Nathan: Yes, a very modern type. Completely different. My father’s side, they were all very educated, but different type. They didn’t talk much, but if somebody laughed, they were very serious people; you understand?
Anthony: Yes, yes.
Nathan: She met my uncle here months ago, but the same time, well I am very well-known. If you were to ask people in the United States who come from our town, we were very well-known. We used to have big orchards, miles and miles of orchards. My grandpa’s-- Anthony: Your father’s parents?
Nathan: Father’s. They didn’t know what to do with the money. Thank G-d I had everything in Poland. I had in Poland, America. Not America in the United States, Thank G-d we had everything. My mother, we had two maids, one was sleeping, one used to come. I don’t want to talk about it.
Anthony: How did your mother and father meet?
Nathan: Well, this I don’t know. I found out, you see, in the United States, They are talking about my mother. My father went to the army, he don’t lose my mother.
Anthony: He was in the Polish Army?
Nathan: Polish Army and he didn’t want to lose my mother. When he went to the Army, he got my mother, he didn’t say nothing to his father, nothing because they didn’t let him. They went and they got married.
Anthony: So they eloped?
Nathan: They were good after that but it looks like, you know--. My mother never forgive them, they always came to us, because we were living—see like I live here, I have lots of land, you see that?
Anthony: Yes.
Nathan: I always like to live in the suburbs, because that’s how I was brought up. Next was a river. We have lots of tree, we have a terrific life.
Anthony: So your father had his own house and his own land?
Nathan: See this house really belonged to one who was a very big shot in the coal mines. He didn’t want to sell it. We never owned it—he gave that to us—we paid him. Mostly private. Private, he won’t sell it. He liked my mother, he liked my father. There were very few people in Poland who talked Polish. When they needed something, they came to my father’s factory; my father used to help them, so we got the house and we lived there by ourselves. He didn’t want to sell it. I was born in that house. At that time they didn’t go to the hospital, they used to come to the house and deliver the women -- they were midwife. I was back in Poland after the war. This is on now, everything what I’m talking here?
Anthony: Sure.
Nathan: Oh my gosh. I didn’t want to say that. I was thinking you were asking that. I didn’t want to say the story about it, this about my father—story—and mother. This, I wouldn’t like that, you understand? I’m talking that to you. If you can cancel that--.
Anthony: Sure, sure. Now your mother, what languages did she speak?
Nathan: Polish.
Anthony: Just Polish?
Nathan: And my father. Sometimes they talked Yiddish with my father, but we did not know a word in Yiddish.
Anthony: You didn’t? As a child you didn’t know Yiddish?
Nathan: No, very little. But my grandmother, my father was very touchy about it, my mother. My grandmother used to call us “goyim.” You know what means that? Christian type. My mother was very touchy, because we didn’t know how to talk Yiddish.
Anthony: Your mother was Jewish?
Nathan: Oh yes, a good Jew. She was a good Jew, but that had nothing to do with it. She was a very good Jew. Only she was modern because—now I’m scared to talk, because— Anthony: Don’t worry. How--?
Nathan: You see my mother used to have polished nails and lipstick. At that time from my grandmother, my father’s side, she used to say only whores wear that because she was very modern, she was so educated.
Anthony: It was a generation gap between your grandmother and your mother?
Nathan: Yes, as a matter of fact, my father’s sister lived in Breslov (now Braslaw), in Germany and all around. So she was the only one who would tell her off. She would say “Ma”, in Yiddish, “Mama, you are not living in modern times.” Saturdays she used to come from Germany, she used to come direct to me. She was—.
Anthony: It’s even more modern.
Nathan: My aunt in Germany, she was, how you call that, very rich—[Say the name. Editor’s note: all bracketed comments from female voice?] Presnek (187) in Brezlov. He was a multi-millionaire. After Germany come in, they looked out for him—remember they throw out the Jews from Germany, she was born in Poland. So they came back and took her; after Germany invaded, they knew exactly where she lived. They took them right away—Hitler. She has only one daughter. She was a beautiful woman, she was 6’6”, my father was too 6’6”.
Anthony: That is how tall he was?
Nathan: Yeah. All my family—they all tall from my family. My grandmother was so little, and my grandfather was very tall and she had 13 kids. She was like a soldier. [She had to be with13 kids.] Oh yes, she was a terrific woman, very-- Anthony: How many brothers and sisters did your mother have?
Nathan: She has three brothers, two brothers they were in Germany and one, where I found out after the war, because I was thinking he was in Russia. He was a-- His name was Romek. (181) They didn’t hear from him for many years, because something happened in the family. He took himself over. I remember the picture—he was a Cossack.
Anthony: Your older brother was named after him?
Nathan: No, my oldest brother, my ______ (183) [The oldest brother was named--] Anthony: Named after him?
Nathan: I think so. I don’t know because his name was the same name, but I didn’t hear from him, years and years. He picked himself up and he left the house after a dispute when he came back from the war or Russia, I don’t remember exactly, but I found out after the war. He left money in the house, so her sister lived in France, my mother’s sister, and what my grandmother did, she give all the money to her sister as dowry and they gave his money away. When he found out, he got mad, and he left the house and they never heard from him. I found out when I was in 1980, I was in Israel? Or ’81 or ’80, I don’t remember. I went to see my uncle, my mother’s brother and I ask about him. He told me no, he was in Hamburg, Germany, married a German Christian. So I may have some cousins there too. Germans, we don’t know what’s what. But my mother’s family was a different type, especially at that time, you know. So that’s how I found out – he told me, he lived in Hamburg, Germany and that his wife was a Christian German.
Anthony: What kind of schools did you attend?
Nathan: I attended Polish elementary school. I went to St. _____ (199) school. Do you know St. ______ school?
Anthony: So you went to public school?
Nathan: Public school.
Anthony: Were you also sent to Hebrew school?
Nathan: Well, no, I went to Hebrew school, but I had a problem. My father told me. You see, when I was a kid, I am a very nervous person since a kid, so we didn’t went to Hebrew. I was already acquired as a Jewish thing, you have to know how to make with the Kaddish, prayers, and like with T’fillin. You know what T’fillin is?
Anthony: Yeah, yeah. When you say the prayers.
Nathan: So my father told him, to the teacher, he say, look, he’s a good kid, but remember, he doesn’t know how to talk in Yiddish. You have to have patience with him. My brother had more patience, I was a hot temper -- [You still are].
Anthony: Still is?
Nathan: Yes, and how, very hot. So when he started he went to Hebrew School, he talked to me, I didn’t understand him, so he used to beat me. You know, they have a stick, and he didn’t teach me. Not only that, I couldn’t stand his smell, from the stinking from bad odor in the mouth. So one day, I told him I couldn’t take it. I ran out and took a _____ (218). He came up and he went to my father and said “What happened?” My father said, “Listen, I know him, if he done that, you must have done something. He wouldn’t do that, for nothing. And that’s it. I didn’t went any more. I finished. ____________ (228) That’s all. Then during the war came a private in the house, because I was supposed to have a Bar Mitzvah, I know. So he teached me. I had a problem with him, too. But I know how to read in Yiddish, I mean Hebrew. I learned. That was the problem. We weren’t that religious, but we had holidays, Passover, all the holidays. As a matter of fact, every holiday came Passover everybody had new suits, everything. It wasn’t so easy in Poland. But I got to my father, we were thick. My mother wasn’t religious, but she kept up the tradition.

We had a team, _______ (236) was the top team in our city, but when it used to come in to the national – when they watched the game, they used to come in with knives, the Poles. When they used to come to our stadium, they were a little bit scared. But when they used to come in to the national soccer, from our town, the team, I remember, number ______ (243), the best players used to come in. As a matter of fact one brother lives in Ireland.

If somebody comes for charity, he gave it. But everybody wants him to be a party member, but he was a straight man, he doesn’t--. [He didn’t want to belong to anything.] No.
Anthony: No political parties?
Nathan: No, no, he wasn’t that type. He was a very respected man in our town, in our neighborhood. He was a very powerful guy. He can knock out six, seven guys like that.
Anthony: He was a big guy?
Nathan: Not only him, but the whole family. You see, once in a while, they used to get mad, because where we used to live there used to be a castle across, ______ (263) castle and I know my father, when he used to get mad because I know what he can do, but he wouldn’t do it.

Nathan: Taller than that. All the brothers and sisters – all tall people.
Anthony You mentioned anti-Semitism when you were playing soccer. How was it in school? Did you have anti-Semitic…. ?
Nathan: No, we went to school it was a private school, run by the Jewish community. ______(279). You have to pay for it. There were some families, they could go, but if they could not afford to pay, the community took care of them. That was—there were some Christians going, but mostly people who could afford to pay, private school. It was a public school – [semi-private], semi-private, yeah. You understand?
Anthony: So it was a Jewish school, partially supported by public money?
Nathan: Yes. There was other schools what really from the city town, but this school you have to pay.
Anthony: And that’s the only school you attended before the Germans came?
Nathan: Yeah.
Anthony: Do you remember anybody in your family talking about Hitler and the Nazis? Did anyone pay attention?
Nathan: Well, they were talking. It started already in 1939, when our town, the Polish became the Nationalist Party. They used to call them INDEKI (?) (296), the International Polish Party, anti-Jewish movement. But here were lots of Poles, Christian, whatever, against it. I meant but that’s how it started. It started when Hitler started to go into power in Germany. Then by us we know everything – we knew about it.
Anthony: Being close to the border with Germany, you must have seen refugees coming from Germany?
Nathan: Well, I tell you, I was too young about it. I didn’t know too much about it. I know when my aunt came – when they chased her out of Breslov, today it’s called Braslaw, (317). I remember that because they used to talk, they used to tell him to sell the--. He has lots of houses. She was a ______(309) in Germany. Very rich person. That’s how I find out.

Nathan: Who?
Anthony: One of your mother’s siblings came from Germany? The one in Braslaw?

Nathan: That was my father’s side. See that was her sister, Blima.
Anthony: Was one of your mother’s?
Nathan: No, no.
Anthony: No one lived in Germany?
Nathan: No. We didn’t know that maybe she knew about her brother, but I don’t think so, she knew it about. I told you his name was Romek, like my brother. I find out now in 1980, when I was in Israel, I asked about him, if they know something about the brother. But they never talk about him. So that’s how I find out, when I was in Israel.
Anthony: Did anti-Semitism affect your father’s business?
Nathan: No. As a matter of fact, there were working Christians by my father. My father was a very likeable person. He was a very generous person. Everybody wants to work for him. My father was the type; it doesn’t matter you can be Jewish, you can be Christian, as long as you were a good man, a good worker, it didn’t make a preference. That was my father. Still, the Jewishness was there. But we were brought up different.
Anthony: Were there any Germans living in Bedzin before the war?
Nathan: You see, when the Germans came in, most of them they came Post Deutsch (?) , because that was ______(337), you know?
Anthony: Yeah, it used to be part of Germany.
Nathan: Part of Germany. But they weren’t so bad. There were some, you know. They used to say wait, when Hitler comes, they will fish you out of the water. They used to say that. They were expecting, they want the Germans to come in because this way they could take everything away from the Jews. You understand?
Anthony: Geremania Indenta (?) (356). This was German Indenta, as far as the Nazis were concerned. Now, what were you doing when the war began?
Nathan: When the war began?

Nathan: No, I started smoking very early.
Anthony: And you still grew to be tall?
Nathan: Yeah. My father noticed that I was pale. I had just started smoking, I was young. We used to get our pay, everyday.
Anthony: So you worked?
Nathan: [Allowance]. No, I didn’t work, allowance.
Anthony: You got an allowance?
Nathan: Allowance. I took the allowance and I bought cigarettes.
Anthony: Secretly?
Nathan: Secretly. See they built a house, a new house—in the front they didn’t finish it yet. When the war broke out, when they start to bomb, we were in the basement. There was a neighbor there and everybody was smoking. My neighbor says to my father, why don’t you give him a cigarette? He gave me a cigarette. He gave me cigarettes, but still I couldn’t smoke in front of him. So we moved in the big basement because that building wasn’t finished, you know. Through, there was a hole and I went to the other basement and I smoked the cigarette. I never forget that.
Anthony: So this is what you were doing when the Germans attacked?
Nathan: Yeah, when the neighbor told him. We were there. My father knew I smoked before that. He caught me once.
Anthony: Before the war he caught you?
Nathan: He caught me. I was sitting on the steps and I smoked. I have a mark even today. [He gave you such a smack]. Smack, he busted me. He was a good-natured guy.
Anthony: And he was bigger than you? So you were more afraid of your father catching you smoking than the German invasions.
Nathan: Yes. So that’s what happened. The Germans were there three, four days they bombed. And I remember his name was, I forgot the name, I know the son, Vishop (?) . It was about five, six houses away; he was so happy. He went around and said now the German______ (384). My father didn’t say nothing he was a very ______ (386). I never forget that. And the Polish Army used to be in our house, on the windows they put sand. They were looking for the Germans coming and where we live across was the castle. And around the castle were big walls. That guy, that anti-Semite, he was happy because the Germans were coming in. He went to the river, running around, he was drunk too, he was shot by the same people, by the Polaks. And he crossed and went up from the “bouta”, no shelters, they used to call that. They shot him in the legs. That time they used to have bullets, boom-boom bullets, you know the--?
Anthony: Yeah. Why did they shot him?
Nathan: Because it used to be a curfew. They knew he was there, they know maybe he was a German. Our backyard was there, next to the river. They took him and shot him. His leg, busted like that. So one of my father’s neighbors said that his son whose name was Schlomo, his oldest son. You see, you have that, what you said before. I never forget that. After a few hours, he died.

Anthony: Were you on the streets when the Germans came into Bedzin?
Nathan: Yes. We were talking German.
Anthony: And what was your impression when you saw these German soldiers?
Nathan: Well, we were very scared. I remember that. There was police, one I forgot the—Schmitznik was his name. He used to shoot people like nothing, dogs. We had a dog we gave it away to somebody who used to deliver to us coal, you know. Not to be shot the dog, it was heartbreaking, so we gave it to someone in another town. We give it to these people who deliver us years and years, we know them. They used to deliver to us coal. I used to go once in a while with my friends to see it, go to ______ (462) that’s about six kilometers. We walked, we didn’t take the streetcars. We went, and I went to see him, and he kept him in the stable, he even had little puppies. I used to go two or three times sometimes a month. His name was Azza. He was a beautiful animal, we love him. My mother didn’t give that dog even to wash the maid, she wash it. In the winter time she used to put him in the, how you call it, way back ______ (473) not to get a cold. She kept him near the furnace till he dries out.
Anthony: Your mother treated the dog like a baby?
Nathan: Why, he used to sleep with me.
Anthony: The dog slept with you?
Nathan: In my bed, I took him to bed. He was clean like a whistle. We loved animals.
Anthony: What about your younger brother, Szmulek?
Nathan: He was a young kid. Let me explain you something of my brother. When the war broke out after that, you see, the bridge near Chivel (483) was one wooden bridge, the second one of ______ (484). Near us was a wooden bridge that was knocked off. So they took me and my father to rebuild the bridge, especially my father, was a powerful man, you knew that, no. During the war, the war started end of August or September, something like that.
Anthony: September 1st.
Nathan: Something like that I remember it was already on the cool side. I worked very hard, you know, to build the bridge, and my father and all the Jews.
Anthony: The Germans made you do this?
Nathan: The Germans, yes, that’s who. My brother was very tall, he was a big guy.
Anthony: Szmulek?
Nathan: Yes. Four times they lost important ______ (502) from the German side that left everything open. I never forget that. We had a storm, about 12 feet of snow. Poland snow snows every day. And they took us, we didn’t have no more food, to clean the snow, and my brother went with me to get a little soup to bring in home.
Anthony: This is your brother Szmulek?
Nathan: Yes. He went to “Bointon” (?) (511). Bointon is bitter in Poland. It was so cold that poor kid lost a piece of ear and a piece of nose and came back. Never go anymore because he was--. I was young too, but he was two years younger than me. I used to go the second shift, again three o’clock, used to come home with the trucks open, very cold. The truck, the Germans didn’t have gasoline, they used to burn it by coal and wood, the truck used to go. And I used to go from 4:00 to midnight to bring home another soup. My father had ulcers, very sick so they used to come, we used to know somebody, he used to be in the Jewish community, they started off Judenmaster that means in English--.
Anthony: The “elder”.
Nathan: No. Jewish leader. He was engineer; he was related to us and he used to exchange and I used to go for my father because I was big. So, I made two shifts to bring other soup home. My father never went because he had stomach problems, he had ulcers, he was very sick.
Anthony: Your brother, you wanted to be a soccer player?
Nathan: Yeah.
Anthony: What did your brother, your younger brother want to be?
Nathan: Well, I don’t know. He was a big sport. We used to tease him; he was a boxer because he had a nose with no bone.
Anthony: No bone in his nose?
Nathan: No. We used to call him a boxer because he had a flat nose.
Anthony: But he wasn’t a boxer?
Nathan: No. He was young, we was just kidding around. You see the picture there, you see his nose looks normal. I used to kid him. I used to be proud of him to show all my friends. I took his nose to flatten it right to the face. So we used to call him boxer, he was a very strong kid though. Yes, a very good kid.
Anthony: And he attended the same school that you did?

Anthony: It was after your brother was taken away?
Nathan: I was only alone. But after that, when they opened up the ghetto, we hide our mother. They make-- they call all the Jews to go out and they selected. We were worried about my mother and we build in the attic, double wall. So we hide my mother and I went with my father. We didn't worry because we got the papers and I was--.
Anthony: Your mother didn’t have a pass?
Nathan: Women didn't have a pass, no. So we hide my mother and I went with my father. They took away my father from me and they let me out.
Anthony: What happened to your father?
Nathan: They took him away.

Anthony: The Germans did this?
Nathan: Yes, and I lost my father.
Anthony: You don't know whether he was put on a transport?
Nathan: On a transport, sure. They took him away, that’s all.
Anthony: So now, it's just you and your mother?

Anthony: During these months, were you forced to wear armbands?
Nathan: Yeah, we were all the time, Jewish.
Anthony: Jewish, the star.
Nathan: Yeah. I had a police hat only when I was to go there.
Anthony: “Astellajela” (?) (216)?
Nathan: Yuda, yes. We used to always wear that. My mother was a very gutsy woman. She used to get out from the ghetto. Dress up and everything.
Anthony: She would leave the ghetto?
Nathan: Yes. She would ______ the stores to shop and everything. I was awfully scared. I used to scream at her. I didn’t want to lose her early. She used to go there was no ___ (224). I remember once she brought in a rabbit, brought it up and everything. We didn't have rabbit before but you know--.
Anthony: She bought a rabbit in the market?
Nathan: I remember like it was-- my mother was a modern woman. She worked on fish, everything, vegetables. She want to sneak out and I didn't know. My father, he was scared but she didn't say nothing. She just ______ and to go. We didn't have to worry. We thought we worked for German. We wouldn't have to worry, comes a Jewish word like that. Yiddish. As a matter of fact, people, my mother, when the Germans come in see my father was a big, powerful guy. My father was a big chicken. He don't know what ______ ( 237) you understand what I mean? I think he was such a good chicken was because my mother, as soon as German come in, used to, after shul-- Anthony: The Germans would come to the--?
Nathan: No, no they said to come in the district identification. Christians or Jews. We went, the office was there in the castle that was not far from us and my mother says for us to change the names. Because our names were German, change completely to Polish name and go another town. My father didn't want to because his sisters and brothers and mother you know. My mother want to go.
Anthony: So your mother wanted you to get false ID's and get Christian names and go somewhere else?
Nathan: Yeah, because we didn't have to worry, comes out a Yiddish word, because we didn't know how to talk in Yiddish. Even the Christians and the Jews said that. Says why don't you do that? My father was a chicken. We didn't have to worry because you know most Jewish in our town, were mostly, all talked Yiddish to everybody. Understand what I mean? That's why my mother used to get mad at my father when he used to come visit my grandma, she used to throw us the fish in a counter.
Anthony: About your mother?
Nathan: It was really-- No, for the kids. My father was touched, this is ______(260). Because we didn't know how to talk in Yiddish. First of all, we would have majority, all friends are Christians. We were brought up different. You understand where I'm jumping from one into another with our stories. [So your father was afraid to have false papers?] He didn't want to do that because we would--especially— Anthony: So your mother was the gutsy one in the family?
Nathan: Yeah, well, she-- Let me explain you something. Even now, I'm Jewish but nobody takes me for Jewish, even in this country. Taken for Italian or British or French. Weren't any type Jewish, the way we were brought up, understand? [You could mingle with the rest of the Christians.] Yes, so that's why everybody says, why don't you do that? My father didn't want. I bet you, we would survive. My mother was a very gutsy woman, very intelligent, very open-minded. So was my father-- [And you had good friends.] We had good friends too.
Anthony: You mentioned you had Christian friends? Did they help in any way?
Nathan: Well, some of them did. Some, they were scared too. This is not so easy.
Anthony: I know but I mean you would have been able to get false ID's from a friend?
Nathan: Yes because we didn't have no papers there. They just ask you and you give them the name. Nothing, you don't have to show nothing. They give you the ID's, the Germans. So there was no problems because we find out before. My mother went to do it-- she find out do you need papers? Certificate? --nothing. You go there, you just give your name and they give you identification card. [Like the British did in ______ (286)]. You understand me?
Anthony: Now after you moved into the ghetto, would this have been possible? Because once you're in the ghetto, you're Jewish.
Nathan: We were Jewish, sure. I mean even before the ghetto, we were Jewish.
Anthony: I know, but I mean once you're in the ghetto, the Germans know that you're Jewish.
Nathan: Yeah, want to go out, you have to--; only the Jews were there, there were no Christians because they took all the community was the coal miners' community. Was one-family homes and they had a card that issue from the coal miners. Brick houses, nice, beautiful section for the coal miners what Goldman (295) give it to them. They were over there with the ghetto. But then I still hate myself, ‘til today, because maybe my mother would survive and I didn't let it. [When they took you out from the ghetto, at the end.] From the ghetto, when they start to c______ (301) everybody, they used to be Judenrein. Judenrein were the killers of the Jews, finishing the last Jews. We were the last Jews; they used to work most of them. Some, what they call, jobs. So my mother end up in the attic. I and my father make a double wall with somebody else. Was hot, always was hot, very hot summer. We had a neighbor had a factory, who was in our house. The neighbor called that-- took the family in those one-family homes, in the ghetto. But that him, he had a factory from chocolate. The German took it over, and he was as a foreman there. He was always two, three deep sort of baskets with large basket with chocolate. He wasn't allowed but he was smuggled out. Even was his factory but the Germans, you know, took over. So him and me and my mother were there, we brought the chocolate up. No water, nothing. I was hiding with my mother. The other one, they couldn't make it, they went out. My mother didn't. Was so narrow, alone. [The others surrendered.] The others surrendered; I couldn't see my mother. We ate chocolate-- (328). I was sitting in my mother's lap and I couldn't see anymore. I couldn't see my mother get shot to death. So I start to scream. Took her out-- Anthony: You took your mother out?
Nathan: Yeah. She didn't want to go. That's how it clears up that they took us.
Anthony: So they caught you in the street when you went out?
Nathan: Yeah, they didn't shoot us but they took us, the German, and sent us out. I was sitting on my mother's lap, on her feet for two weeks.
Anthony: When you were hiding?
Nathan: It was so hot. [______ (339) because at the end they raised everybody.] I am still guilty. When they took us on the train--.
Anthony: So they put you and your mother--?
Nathan: My mother was a good-looking woman.

Nathan: Yeah. We were all covered up and he told her, mother, where we go. [The German] Yes, the SS man. My mother had three kids but she look like a young girl. My mother says to me, we would all be better off. (356) I didn't believe that. I didn't know too much about it, nobody knows where we go. I didn't let her jump.
Anthony: You didn't let her jump?
Nathan: No.
Anthony: From the moving train?
Nathan: The moving train because it sits so fast and slow down. She was ready. I was so-- the Germans, they stay on the-- [Railroad]. You know between the trains.
Anthony: She would have done this at night?
Nathan: At night, yeah. It were at night, she was ready. I said I couldn't see how to jump. ‘Til today, I eat my life out. I eat my life out because I took her out from the attic. I didn't let her jump. She was a very powerful woman, and I never forgive myself. When it came to Auschwitz selection, took my mother one side, took me from other side. They ask me, what's your profession? So I says, I'm carpenter. How old you are? Twenty-four. I wasn't 24.

July or August, was very hot. My mother want to run away too; go during the night, and I didn't let her. She said, let's go and I didn't let her. I saw next that he was dying. A young guy, about 20, 22. They didn't tie him up, they just pull the trigger. I didn't want to see that -- my mother -- they pull the trigger, you understand? They took away my brother from my hand and my father -- my father was scared of me. He said--. [Scared for you.] Anthony: Scared for you, not of you.

I was skinny until a few years ago; I was very skinny. So they used to call the skinny men, musclemen. But I saw they need tailors. So they ask who is tailor. So they take me to work and transfer someone else. Was very fast in those days. I remember something but I go back after that. So I say, I finish and then I come to other thing, I remember something.
Anthony: Okay.
Nathan: With tailors, I see they select guys no scars, nothing. You had little bit, they wouldn't take you. Big guys, I was big but not big like they are. Of course, I was skinny but-- We stay there naked and near the clothes, we still had private clothes. Only mark it down with red, red mark, political prisoner, understand? We put the suits on the side and we stay naked. So they selected somebody likes. So I saw from 50 or 60, they pull out one and go one side. Big guys, healthy guys.

Nathan: Joined them. Maybe I was lucky to join them. But I didn't know how to hold a needle in my life. But anyway, when I joined them, they put us in a barrack and I suffered, three days, four days. They bring water and a piece of bread. As soon as the bread comes out, was like a piece of glue. But one day, two days, three days, four days, they notice us. Each day I says what the heck I got here? I was ready to jump the block and go on back. I wait finally, eight days or nine days, or something like that, they let us out. They give us fresh clothes, not to wear it and we marching to shave and wash and put us to showers. I was still in Birkenau because not far away was the crematorium. Nothing, they shave us, shower and still those clothes what they gave to us, they throw it away. It was smelling from disinfection; they give us fresh clothes. After that, we stay there, we stay almost two days there, in the barrack there. But I never forget that. Everybody was sleeping tired. I was the youngest one. I woke up when they steam the water, they boil it, and I was looking for good luck. What I find, leaves of tobacco and I was smoking already.
Anthony: Smoking again?
Nathan: Sure. I took paper and find it when I pass out. I give it. I didn't know how to hide it for that they would give anything for it, diamonds, anything you wanted. But we were there, we had nothing. So I find it and I hold it. Know something? When they transferred us to Auschwitz after that; I got that tobacco to Auschwitz. If they catch me, they kill me. Big bones of tobacco, that high. I put it a stripper, I put it around. I came to Auschwitz with tobacco.
