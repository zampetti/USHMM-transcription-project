SCOTT III</span></p> <p><span id="s10">Question: Now, I've got a form we just try to follow.</span> <span id="s11">So if you would state your full name and the address where we are, which is 145 Auburn Street, and then date of your birth.</span> <span id="s12">And your full name is?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Answer: All right.</span> <span id="s14">Well, I'm William Alexander Scott the third, and I was born 15th of January 1923.</span> <span id="s15">And we are presently in the office of Atlanta Day World at 145 Auburn Avenue.</span> <span id="s16">My father William A: Scott II, was the founder of the paper, in 1948, August 3rd.</span> <span id="s17">At the time -- the time that I passed --</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: At the time I went through Germany, I was with the Third Army, 183rd Engineer Combat battalion.</span> <span id="s20">I was attached to a corps, and I was reconnaissance sergeant and photographer, and pertains to this story with this unit.</span> <span id="s21">And as I have been reminded, the day that Buchenwald was overrun, it was April 13th, 1945.</span> <span id="s22">And my headquarters -- I was in the headquarters company battalion.</span> <span id="s23">It was at Eisenhower, and our company was scattered throughout the area around Eisenhower.</span> <span id="s24">And the Army issued an immediate order for any man within access to Buchenwald to go to it before anything was really moved.</span> <span id="s25">We spent about an hour and a half trying to find if we were going the direction by various MPs.</span> <span id="s26">And we felt that this was a misrepresentation, that there was no such thing as a Buchenwald atrocity camp, as we had been shown in some indoctrination theater.</span> <span id="s27">And you might note that possibly a number of troops in that area had been shown this film even before we got into Germany.</span> <span id="s28">And we didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s29">So it had taken us about an hour to find the place.</span> <span id="s30">We thought maybe they were just fooling us again, and it would be not worth trying to find.</span> <span id="s31">Finally we found it.</span> <span id="s32">And as we approached the entrance, we looked at the outside.</span> <span id="s33">We said, "Well, this place isn't what they said it was."</span> <span id="s34">And I might call for a minute --</span></p> <p><span id="s35">[Break in recording.]</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s37">There.</span> <span id="s38">I think we're back on now.</span> <span id="s39">So this was amazing.</span> <span id="s40">You had seen some --</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: We had seen what they term at that time, as I recall, orientation sessions.</span> <span id="s42">We would get some pictures of -- and some film, actually, of what was supposed to have happened in Germany before we got there in the late '30s and early '40s up until the end of the war.</span> <span id="s43">And we just didn't believe what we had seen, and as I recall it, we was driving around into the entrance.</span> <span id="s44">And I still said, "This place is nothing."</span> <span id="s45">It looked almost like federal penitentiary here in Atlanta from the outside as we approached it.</span> <span id="s46">And then as we turned in the gate, we saw a number of the small wooden structures that housed the prisoners.</span> <span id="s47">And I later found out that Buchenwald had been a correctional penitentiary, you might say, similar to the federal pen, prior to the confinement of prisoners of war, Jews, but mostly they were Jews there.</span> <span id="s48">And there were -- as we began to go in, and people were just milling around ____.</span> <span id="s49">I was, as I said, a photographer also with my unit and I took some pictures of some of the ____ still in the incinerators.</span> <span id="s50">And then I took pictures of a pile of bodies that were still outside the windows of the incinerators, and ____ trucks to take out some of the ____.</span> <span id="s51">Actually these were kids maybe range of about 12 to up, and some of the ill -- wounded or ill, you might say, or injured people, who were still alive there.</span> <span id="s52">And we were told that about 30,000 were killed in the two weeks just before we got there.</span> <span id="s53">And there were only 20,000 left of the Jews that were held there.</span> <span id="s54">And we noticed about a thousand or so people in a wide fenced area it seemed to be in pretty good shape, as compared to the other 20,000 we walked among.</span> <span id="s55">And they were showing us some of the things that happened, and we said, "Well, what about those people?</span> <span id="s56">Are they --" we were in the spring -- pretty healthy looking, and we were told that they were Russian prisoners and that the Germans had been afraid to really do anything to them.</span> <span id="s57">And two -- we felt two of the SS troops had remained there too long, because just as we moved in, they were trying to move out.</span> <span id="s58">And they were running.</span> <span id="s59">They were caught.</span> <span id="s60">And these two men were taken into a basement.</span> <span id="s61">I did not go into it myself, because I just was just -- I think walking around in sort of a daze.</span> <span id="s62">I was about 22 at the time, and some of the men in my unit came back and told me that there were about six of us that got there, I think, at that time, that these two SS troopers were beaten to death by the inmates who were still able to raise a fist, and one or two of the Americans might have knocked him down.</span> <span id="s63">He said each time he got knocked down, they got back up to attention.</span> <span id="s64">He stood to attention, until he couldn't get up no more.</span> <span id="s65">And I still sort of wandering around in some part of the barracks, and I was shown possibly -- I was in a barracks almost similar to the one that was shown on the holocaust film of the last year, some of the things that were done would not be believed really, even by saying it, because I understand people say this was all prefabricated in their response to what they saw in the holocaust, but ____.</span> <span id="s66">I have even developed an attitude sometimes that sometimes if you say some things that are done, I don't know whether it helps to stop it or if it might even cause some people of unbalanced mentality to repeat it.</span> <span id="s67">And I don't know what the answer is to what we ran into in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s68">As a matter of fact, it gave me a different attitude, a perspective, I suspect, on some of the ideas that we had always heard, and that is that one of the best ways to get away from the -- this type of attitude or functioning by humans was to become more educated.</span> <span id="s69">And here we were in a country that we had always been lead to believe was one of the most educated and literate nations in the world, producing great scientists, far advanced in art, literature, having great names of music, classical music: And it came up -- well, after I saw what I saw, possibly the worst crimes that you could imagine humans committing and this was done, I don't know in what -- in what was the conclusion of how they arrived at an idea that this should be done, but it just lead me to have a reevaluation of this whole notion of what we refer to as literate and education, because I don't think I was -- been unique in this really in my -- because as I say, I was just sort of moving along with the tide and not really thinking a great deal about it at that time, but since I've been back -- and this was over 30, 35 years -- 34 this spring -- I had been an interested observer, not necessarily a casual observer of the idea that would relate to education and how we use people.</span> <span id="s70">And I know during this World War II, my unit was comprised mainly -- I started out with really as a photographer at an air base squadron at Tuskegee, AlabamA: And incidentally at Tuskegee it was the training for black pilots.</span> <span id="s71">About 1,000 were actually given wings at this institution.</span> <span id="s72">It really was not at Tuskegee Institute as much as it was an air field near there.</span> <span id="s73">Tuskegee is no more an air field now.</span> <span id="s74">It's named for General Chappie James.</span> <span id="s75">I was there for my first six months in the Army.</span> <span id="s76">And the Army started what they call specialized training program, ASTP, in '43, and it came through and tested individuals.</span> <span id="s77">And I said, "You know, maybe I'll try it."</span> <span id="s78">Because they were offering a little commission if you complete the particular program you can get into.</span> <span id="s79">And after two more weeks of testing in North Carolina at A&amp;T College, I ended up in Howard University in Washington D.C. I completed the program along with six individuals, a pilot.</span> <span id="s80">Six of us completed the program, and really two-thirds of the time -- a 300 group.</span> <span id="s81">But we were called and told instead of commission, we would be given PFC commission.</span> <span id="s82">They changed the program, and we were sent to organize an engineer combat battalion in Mississippi, and that's really how I ended up, you might say, going into the phase that I did.</span> <span id="s83">I ended up getting some more training in camera FLIR at engineering school in Balfour Virginia, and went overseas with this unit after.</span> <span id="s84">The fellows really were ready to eat nails.</span> <span id="s85">They had 14 weeks of infantry basic training before we joined them in Mississippi, and they had 14 weeks of engineering -- engineer combat battalion basic training -- and they did not get past it.</span> <span id="s86">And a number of them were from Philadelphia and New York, they were east coast youngsters.</span> <span id="s87">One was me, who a reconnaissance sergeant, I was only 19, junior ground.</span> <span id="s88">And getting back to the whole reference to the idea of education, a number of them were classified as illiterates prior to coming into the service, but with the intensive demonstration training in the short period of three months, they were using highly educated equipment of destruction, but very effectively.</span> <span id="s89">And at the same time, some of them even developed improvements, innovations on some of the firing mechanisms on one of the machine guns we were training with.</span> <span id="s90">And I think in my own conscience mind I was beginning to develop some thoughts and surfaced later and that is the whole idea of how to evaluate a person, and as to dealing with them effectively and honestly.</span> <span id="s91">And I -- recent years, some educators might be familiar with people who have come up with this whole approach of reconsidering our whole educational framework here, in particular from the ground up, and it -- we may be losing some of our more innovative minds through credential requirements.</span> <span id="s92">And our country, of course, was founded by a number of what could be really termed unqualified individuals to date.</span> <span id="s93">And even we're beginning to see -- there's more on our television specials -- individuals who have contributed a great deal to expansion of the human condition dropped out of school.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: At an early age.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: More recently the one was Einstein.</span> <span id="s96">I guess, I'm getting away from --</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Let's go back to the time where your unit reached Europe.</span> <span id="s98">Did you go to -- where England?</span> <span id="s99">To France?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: Actually, when I first got to Europe, I got there by way of Liverpool on a ship that carried 14,000 troops, this was the U.S.S. America, and I think it was called the West Point at that time.</span> <span id="s101">It was our largest ocean liner.</span> <span id="s102">It wasn't the United States.</span> <span id="s103">It was the AmericA: And we took five days to cross.</span> <span id="s104">We were unescorted.</span> <span id="s105">We zigzaged from Boston to the North Africa direction and swung north to England.</span> <span id="s106">And the -- getting off the boat at Liverpool at night -- and we -- I can remember being greeted by some of my fellow American soldiers on shore, and they were saying, "Oh, Black Joe," as we were coming down the gangplank.</span> <span id="s107">And then we got on a train and went on to a little place called Fordingbridge, which was sort of southwest of London and just below Salisbury.</span> <span id="s108">And from there we had an opportunity to get our equipment together and take a couple of weekend passes to London.</span> <span id="s109">I think I got to London about six weekends, and contrary to what some people were lead to believe, I don't know why our OWI, this was Officers of War Information, misrepresented participation of my unit and a number of other units I know.</span> <span id="s110">I happened to have run into an individual who was an OWI guy.</span> <span id="s111">I ran into him when I was a student at Howard University.</span> <span id="s112">I ran into him again in London, and it was a weird situation.</span> <span id="s113">I ran into him a third time in Merced, but in London he decided he wanted to do a feature on me because he was a son of a publisher of a newspaper that my father printed here in Atlanta for Des Moines, Iowa, called the Iowa Observer.</span> <span id="s114">And he got the photographer to shoot me, and this was about the first weekend or second weekend I was in London.</span> <span id="s115">And about the fourth weekend, he let me see a copy of the picture and the news release that was attached to the back of the picture or printed on the back of it, really.</span> <span id="s116">And it said, "Here Sergeant Scott is sitting in a warehouse getting ready to get material and equipment to ship over to the continent, to the fighting men on the continent."</span> <span id="s117">And I said -- and I said, "Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s118">This isn't true."</span> <span id="s119">I said, "What's this?"</span> <span id="s120">He said, "Well, this is the only thing that they would allow me to print."</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: And I said, "Well, we getting ready to get on the boat ourselves."</span> <span id="s123">And we went over across the channel.</span> <span id="s124">And we got off at Le Havre.</span> <span id="s125">We went up through Le Havre.</span> <span id="s126">The forces had moved on in, and we were able to go up to get off at Rouen, as I remember it.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: This was, what, in July?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: No, this was late --</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: August?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: This was in the fall.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Fall?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Because we had got in -- fall of '44.</span> <span id="s133">And we were – I guess this might have been by November.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: Because we got out, and we actually camped in the woods near Rouen about 38 or 40 kilometers outside somewhere, and my unit was self-contained motorized.</span> <span id="s136">We had -- all of our companies had their own transportation, but we were immediately incorporated in the supply for units being assigned to various Armies.</span> <span id="s137">Mine was a freelance engineer combat battalion, and we got all of us to join the Third Army, which was headed toward Dijon.</span> <span id="s138">But at ____ during the night, we got an MP motorcycle that came in and gave us new orders.</span> <span id="s139">And instead we headed north to ____ in Metz.</span> <span id="s140">This was in north France, heading towards the battle of the boards, which brought ____ the Third Army headquarters.</span> <span id="s141">We talked with the driver for our battalion commander, after he went to the Third Army headquarters and reported for assignment to one of the corps.</span> <span id="s142">And our battalion commander was just a 28-year-old West Point, and all of us, as I say, were young.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: He was a white guy?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s145">Actually, all of the officers in my unit were white, except three black one officers.</span> <span id="s146">And the battalion commander was a real straight soldier.</span> <span id="s147">He was a West Point man, valid, talented young person.</span> <span id="s148">I would say not valid but intelligent young person, and fair in his attitude toward dealing with his troops.</span> <span id="s149">And he even set up a procedure for reduction in grade, which really wasn't necessary.</span> <span id="s150">I guess it wasn't – I don't know whether it was standard Army procedure or not that an individual who is to be reduced or recommended for reduction had an opportunity to choose counsel in the Army.</span> <span id="s151">But, anyway, in talking with the driver, we found out that somebody in the intelligence -- we don't think it was General Patton -- wanted to know why our unit, which had come so highly recommended, was black.</span> <span id="s152">They thought we were white.</span> <span id="s153">We were so highly recommended.</span> <span id="s154">And they wanted to reassign our designated activities.</span> <span id="s155">And our battalion commander said, "No way.</span> <span id="s156">We were trained for this job, and this is what we're going to do."</span> <span id="s157">And we move out a couple of days, and right up to within a few kilometers of Bastogne, which had been surrounded, and we were about 1:30 at night, and we could see all of this trace of fire and everybody running all around us.</span> <span id="s158">And we were wondering what was going on, because we hadn't been apprised of all of the action.</span> <span id="s159">We thought we were going toward one direction.</span> <span id="s160">We changed that overnight.</span> <span id="s161">Reems it gets to 2:00.</span> <span id="s162">It was stalled for a moment, but the driver told us that there was terrific excitement around the Third Army Head Quarters, because they thought there were German paratroopers and others dressed in American uniforms all around the areA: So it occurred to us that -- this is in the aftermath of everything -- that maybe this was one of the major shifts in the change in policy toward black troops, because as we moved in to Arlon, which was about 25 miles south of Bastogne, we saw, and I recall this, a young black driver of a Jeep.</span> <span id="s163">And I think it was a 578, the way I remember it, femto unit, and we weren't aware of it.</span> <span id="s164">Usually, you know, some of the units around, but he said that he had left his unit at Bastogne.</span> <span id="s165">They were surrounded at Bastogne.</span> <span id="s166">And we said, "What's going on?"</span> <span id="s167">And they said, "Well, the Germans are overrun everything."</span> <span id="s168">And then our battalion commander, as I said, he was ready -- and we even come to say that he was going to Dijon in the next war, after World War II.</span> <span id="s169">He had us, as soon as we move into Arlon, as I said, about 1:30 in the morning -- to drive north toward Bastogne and do our designation of rigging oil and checking bridges and the status of the road work that needed.</span> <span id="s170">And I went with two captains and another sergeant, George L. Johnson.</span> <span id="s171">George was a fellow, who we can recall, he says he doesn't drink and neither did I, but we got into the Ryan Valley, and he had to drink what they considered greatest champagne in the world.</span> <span id="s172">And I can recall him just saying, "I'm a good boy."</span> <span id="s173">And he's well tanked.</span> <span id="s174">But, anyway, George and I and the two captains went up towards Bastogne.</span> <span id="s175">We saw this trace of fire again and clothes and spickets, and we said, "Well -- we're looking at a map --" this road is where we should turn to our left going southwest just before we got to Marlange, which was about 19 kilometers south of Bastogne.</span> <span id="s176">And the trace of fireworks still are visible to us.</span> <span id="s177">We were start swinging southwest on a curve in a road we were on.</span> <span id="s178">There was snow on the ground at that time in the moonlight.</span> <span id="s179">And as we rounded the curve, we were on a stretch maybe about 1500 yards -- 1500 yards -- no, 1500 feet, maybe -- maybe thousand feet, and we come across the bridge that we marked on our map, but as we approached this bridge, we were stopped.</span> <span id="s180">We went -- one weapons carrier, if I remember correctly, it was large enough for four.</span> <span id="s181">Well, it had gotten so cold, and I -- we'd been traveling all day to get into that area, and I had been one who was really adverse to cold weather, I had taken off my boots, and I had wrapped my feet in newspaper.</span> <span id="s182">And I wrapped both feet in a lot of newspaper, then I wrapped two blankets around each foot, because that was the only way to get warm.</span> <span id="s183">And the two officers got out and were met by the sergeant, and he was talking with them for -- our two officers -- for a long time, and finally I'm nudged by Sergeant Johnson and I said, "Look, find out what the story is," I said, "because we'd be sitting here all day."</span> <span id="s184">And Johnson went up and introduced himself, and this sergeant that was standing guard on this bridge, opened up.</span> <span id="s185">He said, "Well, sir, I tell two officers --" he said, "We have got a trap sitting back over there in the woods.</span> <span id="s186">And we've got several little small guns trained down this road, because according to our information no other Americans were able to get by and they were surrounded at Bastogne, and you were coming from the direction of Bastogne."</span> <span id="s187">He said, "Only reason we didn't shoot you all out when you came around the curve is because we felt we had no time if you got five or 600 yard -- five or 600 feet closer, that we can stop you and block up the roads.</span> <span id="s188">But we just waited since nothing was behind you until you got this close, but you still -- you came this close to being blown out.</span> <span id="s189">And then you reveal everything."</span> <span id="s190">But we found out after that that there was a great deal of confusion, and wherever a black American was visible, it sort of stabilized the confusion in that immediate short period of time.</span> <span id="s191">And I later found out that that -- in that whole area of operation there was another unit commanded by a Morehouse graduate, who was at Morehouse when I was a senior in high school just across campus at Atlanta University Laboratory High School in 1941, and I had been on the news in Louisiana around Polk -- Camp Polk, and DeRidder, Louisiana, and we ran into this unit.</span> <span id="s192">It was an anti-tank company commanded by George Bubba Mitchell, and Mitchell was given a citation by this in the Stars and Stripes.</span> <span id="s193">And, again, the Army, I guess, they -- the guys of security or something -- sort of misrepresented a little bit.</span> <span id="s194">They did say -- they gave his name, and they gave his fact that he was a track star in college and had used that to a great deal to knock out four Panzer tanks with these 57-millimeter pee shooter.</span> <span id="s195">And the way they described him as having done it is to knock the tracks off.</span> <span id="s196">Because he couldn't stop the track with that big gun, he knocked the tracks off and immobilized them, run around the sides and plant chargers underneath.</span> <span id="s197">And his unit was mark in Luxembourg, Belgium area around Bastogne.</span> <span id="s198">And I talked with a person who was to have been at Bastogne, and I did not know until even in recent years that the airborne divisions had a black battalion of airborne paratroopers.</span> <span id="s199">And they were at the areA: And I have a copy of a book that was printed about black tank regiment that was at the lead of Patton's operations 76, the first tank graduate, which they lost about half of their men.</span> <span id="s200">And they actually had, as I remember reading this book, 33 battle stars, which is like more -- we only have three -- I only got three, but they supposedly had 33.</span> <span id="s201">And they printed this record on the journal printing press after we moved into Germany.</span> <span id="s202">And my -- at the time, my liberation -- they were asking my rank, my unit was, as I said, engineer combat battalion.</span> <span id="s203">We maintained bridges.</span> <span id="s204">I would drive over a corps area, and sometimes with a corps intelligence officer.</span> <span id="s205">I drove over to the area because on an occasion I was the only photographer available in the corps.</span> <span id="s206">And I took pictures of some citations of men in other units, because they couldn't get another photographer.</span> <span id="s207">And I developed a process for my film on the field in bags.</span> <span id="s208">And on one occasion, I did get into an engineer topographical unit in Bastogne, after activity had gone beyond Bastogne and started into Germany.</span> <span id="s209">And I was just a bug size, it has often occurred to me, and maybe I'm due some back pay, because I was supposed to be a technical sergeant, staff sergeant.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">[Audio cut out.]</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: The day you got into Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: And whatever you could recall about the condition of the prisoners, how they responded to you, identified the Russians as they turned out, who were not quite so bad off, and then the actual inmates of that prison, who really were in pretty bad shape.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Well, actually they wanted to let us see what had been done to them, the inmates at Buchenwald, that you go back and look, I did skirt around saying actually what happened to some of the inmates.</span> <span id="s215">I know in northern Luxembourg, just before going into Germany, we had gotten some Christmas packages after the bulls were stopped and turned around.</span> <span id="s216">And we got a chess set, and I learned how to play chess.</span> <span id="s217">And when we got into Buchenwald, just a few weeks later, we saw some of those prisoners who were just seemingly, we thought in a trance, playing chess.</span> <span id="s218">And I later realized that they weren't in a trance, this was the only thing that blotted out everything around them.</span> <span id="s219">They were in a -- they was in another world, when you really develop and are capable of understanding it and playing it, but this is what some of them were doing with their body exposed and sores, just running out.</span> <span id="s220">And -- but some of the things they did -- we did see what has been referred to as quite often the Bitch of Buchenwald lamp shades.</span> <span id="s221">We saw some of the lamp shades that were made out of the human skins.</span> <span id="s222">From in the business -- we had tattoos -- and what she liked -- she thought it was cute to have a lamp shade made out of -- and we had, as I guess, as black Americans had known some things were considered inhuman.</span> <span id="s223">But I don't know if I've ever been -- well, I know I've never been exposed to anything like what we saw in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s224">I've seen some photographs, again, and I say sometimes photographs can tell a story, but actually seeing something --</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: You mentioned the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: I ___ ___ that.</span> <span id="s227">I have photographs.</span> <span id="s228">As a matter of fact, I still have one or two that I took of some of the kids -- well, this is a picture I took of myself in Arlon, and this is a picture of some of the units that some of the people were staying at.</span> <span id="s229">And this is one picture of a line of people crying out.</span> <span id="s230">This is where some of the kids were.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: This is at Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: All of these.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: Here are the GIs?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: The prisoners still in their striped --</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: -- striped uniforms.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: And this is a picture of an old high school classmate of mine.</span> <span id="s239">This is probably the principal of Atlanta Laboratory High School.</span> <span id="s240">He finished high school here in '41, and we ran into one another in Marlange.</span> <span id="s241">I often felt I was lucky to be back, because I was so happy to see him.</span> <span id="s242">And he had remained on the beach for two weeks, when he was just -- two weeks.</span> <span id="s243">He got off about a week or so after D-Day, and he said it took him about two weeks to get off the beach and most -- a number of his friends were killed because they jumped on silver mines and everything.</span> <span id="s244">And we had a reunion there.</span> <span id="s245">I took a picture of him here with two young Belgium girls who were reluctant to get in the picture with him because -- they said, "Suppose the Germans come back again" -- because this was just after we had stopped them and turned around in Marlange.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: They were that afraid of the Germans and retaliation?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: And they didn't want their picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Did he survive the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s250">He came home, and he wrote a book called Beaver Slide, and I know he's living in New York now.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Is it about his experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: It was a combination, I think more than just a war, it was about Atlanta, and I never saw the book.</span> <span id="s253">But he wrote it.</span> <span id="s254">He wrote it, and he told me about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Beaver Slide?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Beaver Slide.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: And what was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: His name is William Albert Robinson, I call him War.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: That's an amazing photograph.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: And I took this photograph.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: We'd love to put it on a slide, because I have another purpose coming here, to see if you would come on television and talk about Buchenwald and talk about your experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: This is one of the photographs that I was able to save here.</span> <span id="s263">Most of the photographs I had to turn in.</span> <span id="s264">As a matter of fact, I had to turn in all of the negatives, and my principle -- I had duplications on a rare occasion, but this is the box for my camera I used old 45 speed graph.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: That tells a story right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: But, as I say, I just -- I don't know how you could explain Buchenwald except that this made me a little leery about rejecting any man based on credentials or based on familiar aspect or attire.</span> <span id="s267">In other words, I tried to write a little poetry in the direction of discouraging that area of clanism.</span> <span id="s268">We have this all over our society.</span> <span id="s269">In other words, I was at a school and our colors were maroon and white, when I'm talking about clanism, I'm talking about seeing c-l-a --</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: Not the K?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: Not the K clan.</span> <span id="s272">But I'm thinking in terms of what's going on in the island of Tibet or Spain, where you have really the same race, but they have various clans, and this has always been, you got your colors.</span> <span id="s273">And I've often said that during the 60s, I kind of got the feeling of what the individuals who were rejected by society, referred to as hippies, were trying to say.</span> <span id="s274">That they did not want any identity with anything, other than to just -- we are just a part of the total picture with no identity.</span> <span id="s275">And then they suddenly faded from this activity to the extent I felt that in their conscious, or if it was a conscious, that all of a sudden they had become a clan themselves.</span> <span id="s276">That they, in other words, they had to dress this way to look like the hippie, then you're not alone.</span> <span id="s277">Then you're another group.</span> <span id="s278">Then that failed again.</span> <span id="s279">So I don't know how you can get away from that, other than that maybe you don't emphasize it so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: What -- what did you think as you got into that Buchenwald camp?</span> <span id="s281">For example, you mentioned that there were so many Jews in there.</span> <span id="s282">Did they tell you --</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: Well, actually, yeah, we were told they were Jews were -- catch it, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Did you realize there were other people in there too?</span> <span id="s285">A: No.</span> <span id="s286">This was the thing, we thought it was mostly Jews, when they told us these were German --</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: Russian --</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Russian prisons, but there were a few individuals.</span> <span id="s289">And I think this individual right here was a German criminal who had been imprisoned before in the mass inclusion of us.</span> <span id="s290">And so some of the -- the way we understood it, men like this, some of them had been allowed to have women put in the cells with them.</span> <span id="s291">And these women would be their play toys for a while, and then they would be taken out and killed and some others would be put in.</span> <span id="s292">Some of them -- I don't know about if this individual participated because the prisoners might have beaten him to death had he been one to participate in that activity.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: It's interesting that he only has a pair of shorts on.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: He was in pretty good shape.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: A lot healthier than this type of person, who starved to death.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: We saw several walking around like that, and they evidently had not stepped on anybody's toes, but these people who were survivors couldn't do much anyway.</span> <span id="s297">They were –</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Could you see that there was any feeling at all in their faces, or was that --</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Well, they were -- there was emotion.</span> <span id="s300">It was emotion, and the kids were waving when they were walking.</span> <span id="s301">There was a line, they were waving because I was taking pictures and smiling, but the emotion was there, because they wanted us to see.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: What it was like.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: I saw one display of some of the activities of the, you might say, the medical lab where a brain had been sliced.</span> <span id="s304">A man had been sliced down the middle.</span> <span id="s305">So his brain had been put face to the glass, so he can look into this crevasse.</span> <span id="s306">This whole thing in one piece, it was like taking a -- I don't know what type -- we were wondering what type of instrument they could have used to make a clean cut, seeing no raggedy edges.</span> <span id="s307">And you can just look right into the brain of the person that had been cut up.</span> <span id="s308">And I might as well sit and talk about some of the things.</span> <span id="s309">They took us into one of these barracks, just showing us something that was really more sadistic -- I won't call it sadistic because sadism is supposed to be the torture of a loved one.</span> <span id="s310">I don't know what kind of torture you call it.</span> <span id="s311">But the men were actually castrated, and their testicles were put into preservatives.</span> <span id="s312">And their names were put on and labeled and put on the shelf in the back, and it -- [Audio cut out.]</span> <span id="s313">___ in Belgium, we went straight and a man's leg was practically severed by a 50 caliber machine gun off a plane, and I went in to take pictures of it.</span> <span id="s314">But I put my camera aside.</span> <span id="s315">I guess I really wasn't up to shooting those --</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: -- those types of things.</span> <span id="s317">But you all had seen war, really.</span> <span id="s318">You had seen men killed and died, but, yet, when you got to this Buchenwald thing, it was different?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Did you see the crematorium?</span> <span id="s321">Did --</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: We saw the incinerators.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Did you see the gallows?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: No.</span> <span id="s325">Actually, I guess, after I went through the incinerators and the baths where they had some showers, they said this is where some of them were taken to die.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Those were the gas chambers?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: Well, showers.</span> <span id="s328">I guess, they converted them.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: They looked like showers?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: They looked like showers.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: But you saw --</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: And I went back through to see some of the things I talked about.</span> <span id="s333">And then the fellows tried to get me to go where they had taken these two SS troops, and I said, "Well, I think this is my end.</span> <span id="s334">I'll just wait until we get ready to go."</span></p> <p><span id="s335">[Audio cut out.]</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: Other points, for example, did you see any other camps beside this one --</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: No, Buchenwald was the only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: You all moved on through.</span> <span id="s339">And did the men change?</span> <span id="s340">How many of them saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: To tell the truth, I don't know whether we ever talked about it a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: What was your reaction?</span> <span id="s343">What happened when you went back?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: I don't know whether I really got as sick as some people might have gotten.</span> <span id="s345">I just don't know.</span> <span id="s346">I know -- I look back on it sometimes, I said, "I think I was stupid in some respects toward certain things like death, the face of it."</span> <span id="s347">But I know I ran across the look of the dead German soldier in the forest near there, and I could have been blown away, because there had been talk to us from training all the time about booby traps.</span> <span id="s348">As a matter of fact, we lost two officers who decided when we were in northern Luxembourg that they were going to pick up a German Riegel mine, and our unit was responsible for taking mines out of certain areas.</span> <span id="s349">But we were to use a particular mine disposal company, a platoon really.</span> <span id="s350">It was just a small unit, and these two officers wanted to demonstrate to themselves how intelligent they were, I guess, because they didn't -- they took this Riegel mine and put it back in the station wagon and took it to one of the sites, one of the companies, and we had been ordered not to pick up any mines anywhere, just blow them in place, if we couldn't get them to the special unit there.</span> <span id="s351">They were properly told to move on by the officer in charge of that particular site, that unit.</span> <span id="s352">And they moved to another site, and that officer told them to move on from that one.</span> <span id="s353">And the driver of the truck said when they moved on about 150 yards away, they told him to stop.</span> <span id="s354">And when they told him to stop, he got out and walked to the front of the vehicle, because he was aware of the danger too, and he got about 50 feet in front of the vehicle, and he heard the two officers talking, one said to the other, "Don't do that, because --" and the other one said, "Well, if I do, won't --" and that was all.</span> <span id="s355">They said both of them were blown, one of them beyond recognition.</span> <span id="s356">One didn't find much of his body, because it was a Riegel mine that was for tanks put in about 350.</span> <span id="s357">But now as far as the attitude, I went into the Army at age 20.</span> <span id="s358">And I -- I guess I have been familiar with the number of forms of discrimination that blacks were subjected to.</span> <span id="s359">I've lived all of my life in the south.</span> <span id="s360">I was born in Johnson City, Tennessee, but I moved to Atlanta in 1928 from Shreveport, LouisianA: And I can remember in my early days, I think I was even seven years old.</span> <span id="s361">I was slapped by a policeman.</span> <span id="s362">I can remember thinking that he did it for my own protection, because I was running along the side of a truck that was throwing confetti out, and I thought it was candy.</span> <span id="s363">But when I got into this engineer combat battalion, we had a variety of quiet officers.</span> <span id="s364">And as I said -- say, our battalion commander was only 28, we had some that were 40.</span> <span id="s365">I guess a 40-year-old person to me looked like an old man.</span> <span id="s366">We had one -- we had three Jewish officers, and this is when I began to find out that they were subjected to discrimination, pressures, even in our own Army, even though I didn't know it at first.</span> <span id="s367">And it was three different types of individuals.</span> <span id="s368">Although, all Jews, one was a medical officer, and one was a company commander, one of the line companies, one was an intelligence officer in my section.</span> <span id="s369">I was in the S2 section of the company, and there were three different types of individuals.</span> <span id="s370">The S2 officer, was a real nice, easygoing, submissive person, and he was treated in a very disrespectful manner by his peers.</span> <span id="s371">And we often said that our peers would have to go fly a kite if they treated us the way he was treated.</span> <span id="s372">But he accepted it.</span> <span id="s373">And the line company officer would not have accepted it, if he didn't have to come into that type of situation, because he was responsible for the activities of the battalion.</span> <span id="s374">The other officer was a doctor.</span> <span id="s375">So they couldn't give him any fight because he was assertive --</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: Medical --</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: -- in his own position.</span> <span id="s378">So I ran into three different types of persons in the same ethnic classification, and not until that Army experience, did I realize consciously, that I recall, in my life that they were subjected to pressure.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: The same discrimination, so much like --</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: Discrimination.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: -- when you came home?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: When I found out that from a friend who had been in Atlanta until World War II.</span> <span id="s383">He had been in the service also, and he moved back to Atlanta from New York.</span> <span id="s384">And he eventually came to work with us.</span> <span id="s385">And we were just talking about various experiences, and he was telling me that I was just a little behind in my knowledge because he had finished high school here in Atlanta in 1926 or something, and had gone to NYU in New York.</span> <span id="s386">And he could recall that the American track team, which blitzed with Jesse Owens for the '36 Olympics, had two Jewish dash men that they would not allow to participate because the Germans didn't want them and they didn't allow them to participate.</span> <span id="s387">So we discriminated against Jews, and I didn't know it.</span> <span id="s388">He told me he knew it, and he knew the people that were on the team.</span> <span id="s389">And he -- well, it just reminded me of a lot of things that were going on, and, plus, I know that a lot of people don't remember that Germany, even though Owens was the big story, Germany won in 1936 Olympics for the country.</span> <span id="s390">And I can recall when we did go through Germany, we got all the way over -- my unit did -- finally, all the way past Nuremberg to Postbauer, which is south of Nuremberg really, and -- before we turned around -- and the war was over.</span> <span id="s391">And we came back up to the industrial area around Dusseldorf, when we went into some of the homes of some of the German citizens, they were just reaching out, friendly.</span> <span id="s392">And a number of them, which surprised me, would pull out scrapbooks and programs from the 1936 Olympics.</span> <span id="s393">And I saw some of the most beautiful color photographs of Jesse Owens, and these books, they wanted me to see this, of Owens with other German track people and just letting me know that --</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: He was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: And he appeared in the particular prints that I saw, to be the center of attention of the German athletes, and there seemed to be a genuine show of respect for him, because, like I say, he had a fantastic fluid motion.</span> <span id="s396">And the other runners had been brave, but his motion was just fluid, just a technique.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Do you think the German citizens knew about places like Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: I don't know whether all of the citizens -- just like in this country, people still would not believe certain things were going on.</span> <span id="s399">I know when you say I talk about atrocities -- and we have reports just recently in the news of people – inhuman treatment of animals, but I have looked back through our newspaper files over the years.</span> <span id="s400">And I've even participated in some of the reports that we have where Roy Wilkins, as a youngster, in 1931 dressed in overalls and walked down the Mississippi levee investigating what was termed peonage conditions of farm workers in Mississippi.</span> <span id="s401">And some of the reports that he got out were not believed, even in this country, and sometimes people don't know.</span> <span id="s402">But it's hard to say.</span> <span id="s403">People sometimes tend to support ideas to -- or support individuals who would institute certain practices that they might not do themselves, but they might let somebody else do it.</span> <span id="s404">And I don't know whether they actually know it, but there's a sort of a sneaking suspicion sometimes that things are going wrong.</span> <span id="s405">I don't think that the Germans could do what they did without it being leaked out.</span> <span id="s406">Now, the Germans might not have believed it, just like we didn't believe it when we were going in, even though we had these pictures shown to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Did they ever say where the pictures came from?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s409">I think we were told about some of the places, Auschwitz, all of the camps, but Buchenwald, I don't think we even heard much of it before we even got there.</span> <span id="s410">And this was to my way of thinking, when I look back on it -- I often think that Patton -- I saw the movie Patton, which I thought was a very powerful movie, but at the same time, looking at it from a black perspective, if you might allow this -- I saw that we were strangely absent and we were there.</span> <span id="s411">And I later found out that we were there more than I realized, and particularly after seeing the movie Patton, the fact that it was cut off.</span> <span id="s412">The movie did not go to what I call Patton's climatic experience.</span> <span id="s413">Patton was characterized as a sensitive person, a man who did say at the end that he had lived 200 years too late, because war had become so horrible.</span> <span id="s414">It wasn't a Jones activity.</span> <span id="s415">In other words, to him, he would have liked to have lived in a time where war was almost a matter of honor, rather than a matter of just brutality, where -- possibly you might know the story of the French fighting the slaves in Haiti.</span> <span id="s416">According to the Haitian historians and some French, who were familiar with what happened, the French were just slaughtering their Haitians in the uprising.</span> <span id="s417">But the Haitians were so -- fighting so valiantly that they called a moratorium on it and gave the slaves battle field citations, because they didn't have any --</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Weapons.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: And any formality for citing themselves.</span> <span id="s420">So the French say that these men are fighting so valiantly, we'll have to cite them for bravery.</span> <span id="s421">And then when they did it, the slaves realized that they were being stupid to be chopped up like they were.</span> <span id="s422">And they spotted the -- did a little reconnaissance work while they were being cited, and they blew up the French ammunition supply and then sort of incapacitated them because they were outnumbered.</span> <span id="s423">But getting back to --</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Patton.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: Patton's experience, you never heard from Patton after that.</span> <span id="s426">He passed by our unit periodically.</span> <span id="s427">As you saw, he'd go and visit all of these companies.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: All white --</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: What -- he would have a Jeep in front and a Jeep in the rear.</span> <span id="s430">And he was in the middle Jeep.</span> <span id="s431">When he passed by you a few times in Luxembourg and Belgium, he'd pause just to let you know he was on the scene.</span> <span id="s432">After Buchenwald, you never heard from Patton anymore, to my knowledge, until he died.</span> <span id="s433">And it just ran through my mind, and I think that as through others, that maybe he just allowed himself to die.</span> <span id="s434">I don't want to say he committed suicide, but he might not have gotten out of the way of a truck or something.</span> <span id="s435">In the movie it tends to give the idea -- I didn't see this particular -- he was the target of an assassin.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: That was made up.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s438">You just don't know, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: He was something else.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Yeah, because, actually, I look at -- I was down in Merced -- never did get through telling about my battalion commander wanting to be general in the next war.</span> <span id="s441">We were taken back up or given orders to go to the Dusseldorf area in an apparent occupational capacity.</span> <span id="s442">But after two weeks there our battalion commander said we were moving out.</span> <span id="s443">And we were -- find ourself in a convoy to Merced.</span> <span id="s444">And the war was still going on.</span> <span id="s445">We got to Merced.</span> <span id="s446">We get the scuttlebutt from our driver again that we were down in Merced without orders, because how the commander wanted to get into the action in the Pacific, and he didn't want to be hamstrung with an occupation.</span> <span id="s447">So this time he ran a file to the command, they said, "Okay, no orders."</span> <span id="s448">We just bust this outfit up, and I ended up with a unit -- a different unit called a 1333rd Engineer Regimen going to the Pacific on their way to Panama Canal.</span> <span id="s449">About half the men in my unit ended up coming back to the states.</span> <span id="s450">Well, I got on a boat, another big boat, 6 -- over 600 people on it, I think it was the U.S.S. Grant, originally the cruise ship of the Constitution -- or the Constellation, and we had 8,000 on that ship.</span> <span id="s451">And it ended up going through the Panama Canal, and we were about two weeks out of the Panama Canal when the first atomic bomb was dropped.</span> <span id="s452">So we were kind of happy, because we already considered we were on our way for the invasion of Japan, because they piled 2,000 troops on this ship and we were unescorted.</span> <span id="s453">We were traveling at a max, we understood, could get up to 32 knots, and we zigzagged on out.</span> <span id="s454">After the second atomic bomb was dropped, we were almost sure we were going back to the United States, and we didn't.</span> <span id="s455">And we ended up anchored at Enewetak group on Yap Island group on a little island called Maug Maug, which was a recreational island.</span> <span id="s456">And we were allowed to get off the boat once a week to go ashore on this recreational island, which had nothing but Coca-Cola stacked up and beer stacked up around a baseball diamond.</span> <span id="s457">It was just that large, and we understood that there had been about less than 100 natives on that island that had been taken off and placed elsewhere.</span> <span id="s458">And this was to be used as a recreational island for the U.S. Armed Forces.</span> <span id="s459">And we anchor off that island for 22 days.</span> <span id="s460">And I was on that boat for a total of 65 days.</span> <span id="s461">And I stood up to eat three meals a day.</span> <span id="s462">And I swore I'd never do it again in my life.</span> <span id="s463">But one of the things that -- while we were anchored off that island for 22 days, some men were just stir crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Yeah, because the war had ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: And they didn't want to do anything.</span> <span id="s466">So I was lucky enough to get off the boat every day, and I was also lucky that I learned to play chess.</span> <span id="s467">And I was enthusiastic about it.</span> <span id="s468">In over 8,000 troops about 100 of them played chess all day, every day.</span> <span id="s469">So I was beaten across the Atlantic into the middle of the Pacific before I started winning, and I was able to win a few after a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: That's a marvelous story to let your mind -- you had brought out some other units.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: No.</span> <span id="s472">This is nothing, but some of the material I had with this -- these are some photo prints of paintings.</span> <span id="s473">I actually got into painting, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: These are your paintings?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Yeah, I had planned to --</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: How old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: I did these in -- I was 30.</span> <span id="s478">I had two children, and my children were becoming finger painters, and I wanted to show them the difference between finger painting and oil colors.</span> <span id="s479">So I got me a canvas and started painting, and it was sort of a spontaneous painting in that respect.</span> <span id="s480">But at the same time, I had taken art in elementary school and in high school from a man who later -- who was also an art teacher and painter himself at Atlanta University and ended up in NYU in the village for 30 years and one of the most prolific painters.</span> <span id="s481">I was familiar with it to a degree.</span> <span id="s482">This was one of them I call, "Gifts for a Friend."</span> <span id="s483">I started out with some other idea before I finally ended up with that.</span> <span id="s484">And all of these were painted in a moment of hot weather, and I had arts festivals for the first five years out there.</span> <span id="s485">That was called "Informal" or "Without Formality."</span> <span id="s486">And some other people call it "People Charming," and that's "Despair."</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: Isn't that something.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: That's -- this is "Man Without Hate," I call that one there.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Isn't that something.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: And some of these are 16 --</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: Do you still paint?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: I haven't painted since the '60s.</span> <span id="s493">And that was "The Man with the Green Eyes."</span> <span id="s494">Actually that particular picture is a blow-up of another painting that I did, "Mankind Being Engulfed in an Atom Cloud."</span> <span id="s495">I had three or four little faces like that.</span> <span id="s496">I had to pull one out, and then I said, "I paint a larger."</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Just seeing --</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: And that sort of came --</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: Did you think then that these atomic explosions wouldn't bring an end to the world?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: No.</span> <span id="s501">I never have.</span> <span id="s502">I don't know -- I don't know whether I thought it, because I -- I'm science oriented in my attitude, and to tell the truth, when you talk about nuclear power today, you consider it to be a little -- if you pull nuclear power, a lot of people want to say that this is always a war connotation, but I'm for it from a point -- I call that one "Despair," he's reaching out for it, but he's bending away from it.</span> <span id="s503">In other words, he's aiming for it hard, and he's reaching for it, but he's rejecting it.</span> <span id="s504">He's bending back.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: And the black background?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Well, that's sort of --</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: Those are really --</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Containment, because I had one that I didn't find, it was called "A Victim in the Victim."</span> <span id="s509">They're both contained in a -- they're both encased in the same cocoon.</span> <span id="s510">The victim and the victim.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: This is one of the things we've had people tell us about guards in the prison camps, that they were trapped.</span> <span id="s512">In the sense, when we say that the victims were dehumanized, it was really the guards and the people who did these awful things who were not human.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: That's why -- I've had some experiences with MPs in the Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Or even segregation and brutality in our own society.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: Right.</span> <span id="s516">I call that one "Introvert."</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: I like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: There's one more.</span> <span id="s519">That one is one -- I call that one "Frustration Rebuffed."</span> <span id="s520">I wasn't able to give the -- that's one of the last ones I painted, about third attempt at painting an idea, an individual realizing his beginning, life is a struggle, and end results.</span> <span id="s521">Of course, this is nothing unique.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: But you've got the -- the thought is there.</span> <span id="s523">It's interesting.</span> <span id="s524">These are amazing.</span> <span id="s525">Have you kept your paintings?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: I think I have most of them.</span> <span id="s527">They weren't very good paintings from the point of view of quality of life.</span> <span id="s528">I didn't wax them or varnish them as I should have.</span> <span id="s529">And that one is "Prelude."</span> <span id="s530">I just call it "Prelude."</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: Isn't that amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: And that was "Plea to the Eternal," "Plea to the Eternal" it goes, but I've even written a little poetry.</span> <span id="s533">I know that I suggested in that -- in my "Plea to the Eternal" I approach not as an unborn, but as a son, which has a slightly different meaning.</span> <span id="s534">This one is one of the last ones I painted.</span> <span id="s535">I was beginning to get away from my intensity.</span> <span id="s536">That one I call "Yellowstone."</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Is that a bear?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s539">Have you ever been through Yellowstone?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: I've flown over it, but I've never been down into it.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: I tell you a million of them down there.</span> <span id="s542">And these colors are --</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: Are the --</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: The colors are -- if you see the springs, the warm water.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: But did Buchenwald have anything at all to do with your paintings?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: I don't know if I was thinking about Buchenwald that much, but it has to have impact in some respects that you're going through that areA:</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: That experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Yeah, but some of these ideas I had been trying to get a friend of mine to paint, because he had technique, talent.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: To capture --</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: But I wanted to have -- I had the idea, the words, but if I were doing it daily, I think I couldn't given justice to the ideas.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Well, let me go to this business about our television show, because there really is an effort to let you say what you want to during that.</span> <span id="s552">It's only 27 minutes.</span> <span id="s553">It's just a regular half hour show, but I was wondering, maybe, if we brought these on at the end of it at least, or someplace, and if you had a pool you wanted to, because you, as a human being, is really what the story is.</span> <span id="s554">And your experience in the war and at Buchenwald is a universal thing that we share, but this is universal too.</span> <span id="s555">It's purely at your option, but I do think these are extremely interesting to -- in fact, if I had time, I'd love to sit down and just discuss the '60s with you and the kinds of travail and anxiety and stress that were coming through.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: These were painted from '55 to '60.</span> <span id="s557">I started in '54, maybe, with this one.</span> <span id="s558">This one, "Man Without Hate," and then I think I came up with --</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: These really are interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: Those were a little early too.</span> <span id="s561">I have two others, one I call "Infinite Between and the Inner Cycle."</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: And I could give an appendage.</span> <span id="s564">We have other individuals here in AtlantA: I told you I was at Tuskegee.</span> <span id="s565">I'm a member of a group called the Tuskegee Airmen, which has a local chapter.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: You know, there's a book out.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: Yes, I have a copy of it.</span> <span id="s568">As a matter of fact, I'm selling them.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: I just ordered one.</span> <span id="s570">Oh, you are.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: Called "The Lonely Eagles."</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: I got this one from the military book club.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: Oh, yeah, an officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: Four months ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: An officer wrote one on the black pilots, but I have one written by the Tuskegee Airmen themselves.</span> <span id="s576">As a matter of fact, I was looking for that to bring to let you see, because the 99 Pursuit Squadron and 332nd have a reputation and a record that no other pursuit squad had in the world.</span> <span id="s577">They never lost a plane to any of the fighter pilots.</span> <span id="s578">They escorted, and they were given a Presidential citation in '45, near the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Well, they also did such things as flying off that Angio Beach end, I think it was the 99th that was assigned to fly off that beach end, which was unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: Actually, they train on a field similar to that in Tuskegee.</span> <span id="s581">They had a little small dirt field.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: Just to get out of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: And they used to do this in their training, take off in an old P47, lift the pressure on the wheel, dip one wing to the left and let one wheel come up and dip the other wheel and let the other wheel come off the ground.</span> <span id="s584">And that was one of their practices.</span> <span id="s585">One or two of them were killed in training, but as I say, they did graduate 995 pilots.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: I'd love to order a copy.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: All right.</span> <span id="s588">Well, I have several more left.</span> <span id="s589">As a matter of fact, I had been keeping them in my car.</span> <span id="s590">I'll look in my car, and see if I have one this morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Could we copy these photographs?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: I can copy them and let you have copies.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: That would be great, because we'll also put them on slides, and if you will come on, we'll have the slide show.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: Do you have a photo unit at your school?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: We use the medical school's X-ray equipment.</span> <span id="s596">It works.</span> <span id="s597">We have students who --</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: I was in the photo lab.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: And also that picture of you, because I think that's a -- that's an excellent -- if we can -- if we can get that to come out, to get a photograph of you, to let people see your own growth and your own change and how you were that long ago, but I think that --</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: Well, actually I did -- I don't –</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: Well, we're --</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: 147 pounds --</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: We're going to tape the first shows on the 23rd of April of this month at night over at Channel 5.</span> <span id="s604">They're doing all of our -- they're giving us professional -- professional quality support.</span> <span id="s605">So if it were possible for you to come over --</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: -- that evening -- if not, I can give you a later date, because we're going to do two shows a night for four different evenings about two weeks apart.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: April the 23rd, that's Monday night.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: Yes, sir.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: That will be all right.</span> <span id="s611">I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: I'll write you a note, and then if we can pick up these copies, I'd go ahead and have --</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: The slides.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: -- the slides made.</span> <span id="s615">So that's the best way to get them on the television screen.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: And we'll just show them on a television screen, and then you can explain or describe in whatever order you want to.</span> <span id="s618">But I do think –</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
