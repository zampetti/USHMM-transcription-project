Same here, nice to meet you.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Can you give me your name that you were born with and where you were born and when, please?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: Right.</span> <span id="s17">I was born Carola Stern in 1925, March the 8th.</span> <span id="s18">No, March the 8th, right.</span> <span id="s19">In Nieder- ohmen, Germany.</span> <span id="s20">And my father's name was Meier Stern.</span> <span id="s21">My mother's name was Hedwig Stern, and we lived in Nieder-ohmen for many, many years before -- my parents were both born there.</span> <span id="s22">My grandparents were born there, and I believe my great grandparents were born there.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: You had a sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: I do have a sister, yes.</span> <span id="s25">She was just about 15 months older than me, and we lived very happily in Nieder-ohmen.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Tell me what you father did for a living.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: My father was a cattle dealer and so had been my grandfather before him.</span> <span id="s28">And my father had sisters and brothers who more or less helped in this field.</span> <span id="s29">And then my grandfather was getting older, my father took over.</span> <span id="s30">So we had cattles, and we had everything.</span> <span id="s31">We had chickens and we had goats and we had a marvelous time, especially when we were young.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">And we had eggs and we raised potatoes, and we had a whole farm.</span> <span id="s33">We were actually farmers.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">01:03:01</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: So including cattle and animals?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: Including cattle, yes.</span> <span id="s37">We had a stall with cattles where my mother reluctantly went in the morning to milk the cows.</span> <span id="s38">It was a little shtetl, and we had people who helped.</span> <span id="s39">And we were farmers, just like anybody else in Nieder-ohmen.</span> <span id="s40">There was never any difference; we were Jewish, but we didn't feel it.</span> <span id="s41">We were Germans first.</span> <span id="s42">Jews were secondary -- nobody bothered with this religion.</span> <span id="s43">And since my father was a veteran of World War I, he was very well liked.</span> <span id="s44">Very well liked.</span> <span id="s45">And whenever someone had a problem in Nieder-ohmen, my father was sure to solve it.</span> <span id="s46">We called him later on the Kissingerof Nieder-ohmen.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: And do you remember any particular thing, problem that came up that he solved?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Well, there were problems with marriages.</span> <span id="s49">One wanted a divorce from one another, so they would come to my father and ask him could he talk to this one and that one.</span> <span id="s50">My father did, and he usually solved everything.</span> <span id="s51">He was very well liked.</span> <span id="s52">So was my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: And tell me about your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: My mother was about 13 years younger as my father.</span> <span id="s55">So we looked upon my father as the head of the house, and my mother was one of us.</span> <span id="s56">She was a young girl.</span> <span id="s57">She always has been, and as we grew older, she sort of looked for guidance towards us, to my sister and me.</span> <span id="s58">And we became sort of like three sisters.</span> <span id="s59">She was quite young, she was still our mother.</span> <span id="s60">I mean I wouldn't say when it came to disciplining us, she was the head of the house.</span> <span id="s61">She knew just what to do, but basically we grew up together with our mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: If your mother was 13 years younger than your father, do you know approximately how old they were at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: My mother was 20.</span> <span id="s64">She was 19 when she got engaged, and my father must have been 32.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">And my mother, and then she got married at 20 when my father was 33.</span> <span id="s66">And from the same village, it wasn't unusual.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: It wasn't?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: No, it wasn't unusual.</span> <span id="s69">And they were very much in love, I was told.</span> <span id="s70">My father, everybody thought that, “Why would he marry such a young kid?”</span> <span id="s71">But my mother was in love with him, I heard that and I seen that.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: So this was a very warm household.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: Very warm household, right.</span> <span id="s74">But we did -- our grandparents lived with us.</span> <span id="s75">And my father had a sister who was retarded.</span> <span id="s76">She lived with us, too.</span> <span id="s77">So it was a big house, but it was a happy house.</span> <span id="s78">My mother took care of the retarded sister, who, who,, really was never older than 11, let's say.</span> <span id="s79">You know, mentally.</span> <span id="s80">And we grew up with her, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">01:06:01 And we had a dog, and, we were just one happy family.</span> <span id="s82">We never had any problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">1 Henry Alfred Kissinger</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Did you milk the cows, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: I tried.</span> <span id="s86">It didn't help me.</span> <span id="s87">But what I did, we had a dog.</span> <span id="s88">And whenever my mother punished me, I would go out.</span> <span id="s89">The dog was never in the house, that didn't happen in Germany.</span> <span id="s90">Dogs were kept outside, so, therefore, I went outside.</span> <span id="s91">If she punished me, I went outside and ate with the dog.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: And ate with dog?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: I ate with the dog.</span> <span id="s94">And my mother would always catch me, and she would say, "Why are you eating the dog's food?"</span> <span id="s95">And I would just say, "Well, the dog didn't want it."</span> <span id="s96">And I ate it, and, you know, grew up healthy.</span> <span id="s97">Didn't bother me a bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Was this dog a real pet for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: It was -- he sort of was my friend, you know.</span> <span id="s100">He walked after me wherever I went.</span> <span id="s101">And, you know, in Germany where we lived, we had an outhouse.</span> <span id="s102">We didn't have a toilet inside, so the dog was right next to the outhouse.</span> <span id="s103">So every time we went there or stayed there a little while, the dog would scratch on the door.</span> <span id="s104">“It's enough already, come on out.”</span> <span id="s105">So the dog was part of our family, we loved him.</span> <span id="s106">And his name was Flock.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Flock?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s109">Strange name.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: And what about friends?</span> <span id="s111">Were you . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Well, I had lots of German friends.</span> <span id="s113">I had little kids who played with me, and went to school with me and we were -- sometimes one of my friends would go with me to synagogue, and I went with her to church.</span> <span id="s114">My mother told me I shouldn't kneel down because that's not in my religion, so I didn't.</span> <span id="s115">Nobody bothered, I don't even think they did kneel down.</span> <span id="s116">Because I was always told, I remember that from way back.</span> <span id="s117">But, but I went to church Sundays and she went to synagogue on Saturdays.</span> <span id="s118">We were really close friends, and she's still alive.</span> <span id="s119">And she was happy that I did that for her, and I was happy to have her.</span> <span id="s120">I never wanted to let her go, why let her go on Saturdays and why would she let me go on Sundays, you know?</span> <span id="s121">But it changed, it changed in 1933.</span> <span id="s122">It changed a lot.</span> <span id="s123">This particular friend didn't change too much, but I had one girl which really was my idol.</span> <span id="s124">She was extremely intelligent, and she was a little redhead and she was very cute.</span> <span id="s125">And we played together, and at one point she said to me, "You know, Carola, I can't play with you anymore."</span> <span id="s126">And I said, "How come?"</span> <span id="s127">She said, "Because you're a Jew."</span> <span id="s128">I said, "What is that?"</span> <span id="s129">She said, "Well, have you heard of Hitler?"</span> <span id="s130">I said, "Yes, because every morning they used to say Heil Hitler.</span> <span id="s131">And,, but why can't you play with me anymore?</span> <span id="s132">Why?"</span> <span id="s133">She said, "Because my father told me that you're Jewish, and Gentile children, Aryan kids can no longer play with the Jewish kids."</span></p> <p><span id="s134">01:09:08 And her father had gone to school with my mother, and they were the best of friends.</span> <span id="s135">And that was very, very hard for an eight-year-old, you know.</span> <span id="s136">It felt very strange that suddenly -- and then the whole group disappeared.</span> <span id="s137">Nobody would play with a Jewish child anymore.</span> <span id="s138">So then we sort of -- to the Jewish kids, we were friendly with the Jewish kids, too.</span> <span id="s139">So then we were all Jewish kids, and we stuck to one another.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: When that young friend said that to you, was that the first time that you felt . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Felt there was something -- I was different.</span> <span id="s142">And I couldn't, and I couldn't understand why I was different.</span> <span id="s143">Well, I was asked before by someone why was I different.</span> <span id="s144">Did I feel any different?</span> <span id="s145">You know, we did speak Hochdeutschwhich is the better German.</span> <span id="s146">So did that girl, this Lucy, Lucy, really, she spoke Hochdeutsch.</span> <span id="s147">Only the farmers had a dialect, and we never did have a dialect.</span> <span id="s148">So I felt was that the difference?</span> <span id="s149">No, it wasn't the difference, because the teacher spoke Hochdeutsch and so did the pastor of the village, speak Hochdeutsch.</span> <span id="s150">So we were -- I was very upset that suddenly they would make such a difference and make us feel like outcasts, and it got worse and worse.</span> <span id="s151">It was just -- that was only the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Did it affect school right away?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s154">Not right away, because we were pretty good students, especially my sister was an excellent student.</span> <span id="s155">So the teachers couldn't right away throw us out of school because we sort of held the school together.</span> <span id="s156">But there was a time where it was impossible, it was only Heil Hitler and there were these songs which I really can't translate.</span> <span id="s157">But in German it was “Wenn’s Judenblut vom Messer spritzt.”</span> <span id="s158">Jewish blood runs off the knives, then we feel better.</span> <span id="s159">Just songs like that, and we felt very, very, very bad.</span> <span id="s160">We were little kids and yet when we looked around and we seen the BDMthat's a circle of German girls who had these nice outings, we felt so why can't we be part of it?</span> <span id="s161">Why can't we?</span> <span id="s162">As a matter of fact, I remember at one point when I walked through the schoolyard -- we lived right next to the schoolyard -- everybody said, "Heil, Hitler" like this.</span> <span id="s163">I did, too.</span> <span id="s164">What did I know?</span> <span id="s165">I was eight years old.</span> <span id="s166">So my mother said to me, "You're not supposed to do that."</span> <span id="s167">I said, "Why not?"</span> <span id="s168">She said, "Haven't you been told that you are Jewish?"</span> <span id="s169">I said, "Oh, I forgot."</span> <span id="s170">So it was very hard to comprehend.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">01:12:00 I couldn't get it together that I was suddenly Jewish and I couldn't do whatever I did before.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">2 Standard German (German) 3 When the blood of the Jews sprays from the knife (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s173">4 Bund Deutscher Mädel [League of German Girls] (German); branch of Hitler Youth.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">But, they told me quickly that . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: That must have been very frightening.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: It was very frightening, and, especially for an eight-year-old child.</span> <span id="s177">If you're older, you understand.</span> <span id="s178">But it got worse and worse, and by the age of 11, my parents decided that they couldn't leave me in school anymore.</span> <span id="s179">Neither myself nor my sister, and they would send me to a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s180">In the meantime they had made Jewish schools all over Germany where only Jewish kids went.</span> <span id="s181">And so, therefore, I went to Bad Nauheim, which was Bad Nauheim Bezirkschulein the district of the area where some of the children came by bus and some of them stayed in the dorm.</span> <span id="s182">And I was sent into the dorm.</span> <span id="s183">I was very homesick, and my mother and father had a hard time getting me there, but once I was there I was fine.</span> <span id="s184">And my sister went -- went,, she's a year older -- she skipping already, I don't know, in one grade here and there, went straight to a teacher's seminary to Würzburg.</span> <span id="s185">That was a teacher's seminary, so she went there and I went to Bad Nauheim.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: So what year, do you remember what year it was that you went?</span> <span id="s187">A: In 19 -- I was 11, 1936.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Did you, before you left for school, did you talk with your sister about what was happening and what was happening to her?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Yeah, always, always.</span> <span id="s190">And my sister, although she's only 15 months older, she always was, like, she gave me strength.</span> <span id="s191">I, I made believe like she was 100 years older, and I would say to her, "So, what's going to happen to us?"</span> <span id="s192">She says, "Nothing.</span> <span id="s193">I don't know why you're worried.</span> <span id="s194">It's going to be all right.</span> <span id="s195">Don't worry about it.</span> <span id="s196">We'll live, we'll survive."</span> <span id="s197">So I figured if she said so, I'll probably survive and went on with that thought.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Did your parents tell you this?</span> <span id="s199">I mean . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: My father, my father was a very -- he was a German.</span> <span id="s201">He would say, "I went through World War I, and the Germans are really not bad people.</span> <span id="s202">And you're a young girl, and they're not going to kill you.</span> <span id="s203">Don't worry about it, you'll be fine.</span> <span id="s204">You'll absolutely fine.</span> <span id="s205">Hitler will disappear one of these days, and you're going to be okay.</span> <span id="s206">Just hold out, don't let them make you crazy.</span> <span id="s207">Be strong."</span> <span id="s208">And he had all these quotations from Schillerand Goetheand all kinds of things telling me that never do anything wrong.</span> <span id="s209">“Rather suffer, but don't do anything wrong.”</span> <span id="s210">Which in German is, “Lieber Unrecht Leiden als tun.”</span> <span id="s211">And he left me with all kinds of legacies, and I really, I, I lived through this on my life.</span> <span id="s212">I listened to ... he 5 District school (German) 6 (Johann Christoph) Friedrich von Schiller 7 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe 8 Better to suffer injustice than to cause it (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s213">was a very bright man.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">01:15:10 And,, at least of everybody feels their father's superior, but he had a strong mind.</span> <span id="s215">And he kept saying that definitely we'll get through that easily, and we don't have to go to America.</span> <span id="s216">We can stay in Germany, not to worry.</span> <span id="s217">So what was I supposed to do?</span> <span id="s218">I said “okay.”</span> <span id="s219">Little did he know what was in store for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: He and your family had an opportunity to go the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Well, yes.</span> <span id="s222">We had a -- we could have gone, but the number was very high.</span> <span id="s223">It was 70 or something, 700, I don't remember anymore.</span> <span id="s224">And, we had an aunt, you know, my father had this retarded sister.</span> <span id="s225">And he wasn't going to let her go, just abandon her.</span> <span id="s226">So he said, "Maybe I ought to send the children," my sister and myself.</span> <span id="s227">But then he said, "But my kids want to be with me."</span> <span id="s228">And we really wanted to be with them, and he said, "It will be okay."</span> <span id="s229">But in the meantime, they took the retarded sister into a home to Berlin away from us.</span> <span id="s230">And my father was taken to a labor camp, and well, on the 10th of November, you know, he was taken to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s231">And my mother came to, to Bad Nauheim where I was.</span> <span id="s232">And my sister came to Bad Nauheim from Würzburg and we reunited there.</span> <span id="s233">And from there we just faded out and being in Bad Nauheim with all the children and we were taken out of the school to the,. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: Could I interrupt for a moment . . . A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: . . . and just go back a little bit?</span> <span id="s236">When you were at school and you were alone boarding was the first time you were away from home.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Was that both difficult and easier because life was better for you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Life was better for me school-wise, yes.</span> <span id="s240">And I was 11 years old, so I figured eventually I would have to grow up -- be on my own, so I adjusted very well and I stayed there, and I had friends and it was fine.</span> <span id="s241">I could have gone home.</span> <span id="s242">I usually went home on vacations, but, it was never the same anymore because my sister wasn't there, and I stayed a few days and went back to school.</span> <span id="s243">But it was considerably pretty normal yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: So the Nazis or the Germans didn't come in and do things at the school?</span> <span id="s245">There was a . . . 01:18:05</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: Well, the 10th of November.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: In 1938?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: 1938.</span> <span id="s249">The Germans came and threw all the kids out, cut into the feather beds, and the whole school was in an uproar.</span> <span id="s250">The little kids were crying, looking for their parents.</span> <span id="s251">But naturally there were no parents; it was a boarding school.</span> <span id="s252">And, well, I was one of the older ones, there were six-year-olds; we held on to them.</span> <span id="s253">And they marched us to the mayor's office with the teachers, and the teachers were frightened themselves.</span> <span id="s254">We thought we were going to be shot there, but we weren't.</span> <span id="s255">We stayed there for a while, and from there we went back home.</span> <span id="s256">We went home.</span> <span id="s257">In the school, and it was horror.</span> <span id="s258">All the feather beds and everything was on the floor and all the -- it was a religious school, so the torah cloths were all torn and the books all -- whatever.</span> <span id="s259">But we remained in the school until 1939.</span> <span id="s260">We fixed it up again, and we stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: And the kids fixed it up?</span> <span id="s262">Everybody . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: The kids and the teachers and whoever helped, we all fixed it up, and we stayed another year until 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: So when these Nazis left, did you -- were the kids still very frightened?</span> <span id="s265">Did kids have bad dreams?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s267">The kids had bad dreams.</span> <span id="s268">So did the teachers.</span> <span id="s269">They weren't that much older, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">And we all had bad dreams.</span> <span id="s271">We were afraid.</span> <span id="s272">What would they do with us?</span> <span id="s273">And, -- but life went on, and we stayed till 1939 and then the school was eliminated.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: Now, your mother and your sister came there . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: And my sister stayed in the school for another year.</span> <span id="s276">Since she had some education in Würzburg she taught first and second grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: In your school?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: In my school.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: So this must have been very good for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: That was good because I had my sister.</span> <span id="s281">My mother went back home, and I think she eliminated everything.</span> <span id="s282">She -- my grandparents and her and my father moved to Frankfurt because there was no way we could stay in Nieder-ohmen because we were recognized all over.</span> <span id="s283">In Frankfurt, nobody knew us as Jews.</span> <span id="s284">We were just people like anybody else until we had to wear the star.</span> <span id="s285">So we lived together with our grandparents and it was okay.</span> <span id="s286">And, my sister worked, she had to do some, also, some slave labor work in Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s287">I don't recall what she did, but I went to school yet because I was still young -- younger.</span> <span id="s288">I went to Philanthropin and I took a course in medicine.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">01:21:00 I took a course in sewing, and I sort of was preparing myself for America.</span> <span id="s290">Learned how to speak English.</span> <span id="s291">And,, all kinds of courses, and that lasted until 1941.</span> <span id="s292">From 1931, till 1939 till 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Now, you father had been take to Buchenwald after Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Yes, but he came out about four weeks later because he was the so-called Frontkämpfer because had for -- at the front, so that if you could provide papers, they let him out.</span> <span id="s295">So he came to Frankfurt, and in Frankfurt he was taken away to a labor camp.</span> <span id="s296">It was someplace around Mecklenburg, I believe; I don't recall.</span> <span id="s297">And he had to do really hard work.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Do you remember his return from Buchenwald and what he talked about?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: I remember.</span> <span id="s300">He was so thin, and he was -- a few teeth were missing.</span> <span id="s301">I don't know whether they had beat him up or something, and he never wanted to talk about it.</span> <span id="s302">He was afraid that we would be frightened by it.</span> <span id="s303">And since he was such a German, he thought that couldn't happen to him.</span> <span id="s304">He definitely didn't want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s305">And I remember in 1939 when German soldiers came back to Germany from Poland, and they used to say, "They're taking the Polish Jews and they shoot them right outside."</span> <span id="s306">And my father would say, “that guy never told the truth, it's not so.</span> <span id="s307">I'm sure it's not.”</span> <span id="s308">He denied it.</span> <span id="s309">He really denied it, he thought that couldn't happen.</span> <span id="s310">Germans were not bad people.</span> <span id="s311">It was, you know, they were educated mostly from birth.</span> <span id="s312">Beethoven, Schiller and all the whole thing, so he couldn't believe that.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Were you more skeptical?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: No.</span> <span id="s315">I listened to my father.</span> <span id="s316">I thought my father couldn't be wrong.</span> <span id="s317">Only I could be wrong.</span> <span id="s318">I was too young anyway to think -- my sister kept saying, "Daddy is right.</span> <span id="s319">Not to worry."</span> <span id="s320">So we weren't worried.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: So you're living with your grandparents . . . A: And my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: . . . and your parents and your sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: My mother and my sister.</span> <span id="s324">My father was then taken away.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">9 Crystal Night (German); Night of Broken Glass.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">10 Front line soldier (German) 11 Ludwig van Beethoven</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: Taken away?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: Right.</span> <span id="s329">In Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s330">And it was bearable.</span> <span id="s331">We had a room and we didn't have much to eat, but we had food stamps, and we got food here and there.</span> <span id="s332">My grandfather used to go and buy things, but we were always rationed.</span> <span id="s333">My grandmother was always afraid that I would eat too much.</span> <span id="s334">Because I was always tall and heavier than the rest of the family, and she couldn't stand that.</span> <span id="s335">Whenever I ate, she said, "It's enough."</span></p> <p><span id="s336">01:24:00 That was a little hard for me, but she didn't mean any harm.</span> <span id="s337">I just took it very badly.</span> <span id="s338">But, in 1941 they took 150 or 60 young girls from Frankfurt to Berlin to a labor camp, and I was among them.</span> <span id="s339">My parents remained.</span> <span id="s340">My mother and my grandparents and my sister remained in Frankfurt, but I was taken to Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Now, by then you were wearing a Jewish star?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: By then we were wearing -- yes.</span> <span id="s343">By then we were wearing a Jewish star, right.</span> <span id="s344">Q: And these are just young Jewish girls that they're taking?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Young Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s346">Q: And . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Not older -- we were maybe ‘til 18.</span> <span id="s348">I was 15 then.</span> <span id="s349">Q: And how did you find out you had to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: Well, we got a notice . . . Q: In the mail?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: . . . we had to be -- in the mail.</span> <span id="s352">And we had to be there at a certain time, and a doctor would examine us, a Jewish doctor.</span> <span id="s353">And we were told we were going to a labor camp, which we did, and we were all taken to Berlin.</span> <span id="s354">Now, we were -- like I was 15 years old.</span> <span id="s355">I didn't think that was so terrible.</span> <span id="s356">I went with lots of friends.</span> <span id="s357">Of course, I had to say goodbye again to my parents from then I would never see them anymore, and my grandparents and I went to Berlin.</span> <span id="s358">And when, when, we came to Berlin, we were put up in an old movie house, and, it was in a very good neighborhood.</span> <span id="s359">But it was an old movie house and they made it in little rooms, so we were about -- two, four, six, eight people -- eight girls together.</span> <span id="s360">It was livable.</span> <span id="s361">If they would have left us alone, we could have survived there during the war.</span> <span id="s362">It was livable.</span> <span id="s363">So, of course, food was scarce, but at that time they had occupied Italy.</span> <span id="s364">They brought watermelons, and we had enough potatoes, so we made potatoes and we fried them with nothing.</span> <span id="s365">Made potato pancakes and watermelons and we got a little bread, and we got by.</span> <span id="s366">And we worked for the Siemens-Schuckert-Werke in Berlin.</span> <span id="s367">It was pretty hard labor, especially for a 15-year-old, but . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: What were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: We were making airplane doors.</span> <span id="s370">Well, I wouldn't say doors.</span> <span id="s371">A little, it was more or less windows.</span> <span id="s372">We had to cut off pieces,, we put it on a -- in German, it's a trebank.I've seen these things here, and I kept looking at them.</span> <span id="s373">I said, "This is what I worked on."</span> <span id="s374">You had to put it into the machine, and then you had to put the knife really close to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">01:27:01 And then it would cut off a piece, make it to a certain size.</span> <span id="s376">And very often if you didn't do that right and the thing kept falling out, you know, and would hit you.</span> <span id="s377">But I was always very careful to do it right, and I did okay.</span> <span id="s378">They paid us very little, but we had enough money to support ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: So they did pay you?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: They would pay us a little bit, yes.</span> <span id="s381">But we weren't just Jewish girls, there were German people living in Berlin, older people who worked there.</span> <span id="s382">And I was in Abteilung505.</span> <span id="s383">That was really for big, fat people.</span> <span id="s384">And since I was strong and tall, they put me in there while the others went to different places, but luckily I survived in that place.</span> <span id="s385">It was, it was bad, but the voice of my father came up, "You've got to survive.</span> <span id="s386">You have to be strong."</span> <span id="s387">And I tried very hard really.</span> <span id="s388">It wasn't always pleasant, but Berlin was not the worst.</span> <span id="s389">The worst is yet to come.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Let's stop and we can change the tape.</span> <span id="s391">01:28:15 End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s392">12 Lathe (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s393">13 Division (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s395">02:01:06</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: Okay, Carola, I wanted to ask you a few questions about Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s397">Did your mother work during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: No, she didn't.</span> <span id="s399">She took care of her parents, our grandparents, and, she took care of us.</span> <span id="s400">Q: Where was the money coming from for food . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s402">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s403">Maybe they had a little bit, I have no idea.</span> <span id="s404">There was no one working, and I don't know where the money came -- maybe from my grandparents.</span> <span id="s405">I asked that question many a times.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: Do you know if your parents sold the farm, or was it confiscated?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Yeah, they just took it.</span> <span id="s408">It wasn't sold.</span> <span id="s409">It was confiscated, absolutely.</span> <span id="s410">So we didn't get any money from the farm then until later on.</span> <span id="s411">So there was -- I don't know.</span> <span id="s412">What I lived from, I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: Do you remember when your dad went to the forced labor of the . . . A: I remember that, right.</span> <span id="s414">I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: What was that day like?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: Well, we were afraid that we weren't going to see him anymore.</span> <span id="s417">And he said that he would come back, not to worry.</span> <span id="s418">He's not going to leave us, he will come back.</span> <span id="s419">But I didn't see him anymore.</span> <span id="s420">My mother and my sister did, but I didn't see him anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: And how come they were able to see him?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: They took Jewish people out to labor camps.</span> <span id="s423">They wouldn't let anybody in there, and I suppose he wrote to them here and there.</span> <span id="s424">But I was taken away, so I had no connections with my father anymore.</span> <span id="s425">I would write to my mother once in a while, and she would write back.</span> <span id="s426">But that was only a short while, I was taken in 1941 to Berlin, in February.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">02:03:01 And my parents were taken then altogether to Lódz in September of 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Did you know they were taken in September?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: How did you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: They sent a letter saying we are relocating to Litzmannstadt.</span> <span id="s432">I still didn't know what that meant.</span> <span id="s433">They were moved out of Frankfurt to Lódz together with my sister, that's all I knew.</span> <span id="s434">Nothing else.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Now, the war started in 1939.</span> <span id="s436">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Was there a particular effect on you other than being Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: No, there was no particular effect, not on us personally.</span> <span id="s439">We went about our way like I was in school yet and, but no, not me.</span> <span id="s440">I mean, I was absolutely away from everybody.</span> <span id="s441">You know, I was all on my own.</span> <span id="s442">Then in Berlin, of course, I was together with other girls, and we formed close ties; we really did.</span> <span id="s443">We had no other choice.</span> <span id="s444">All we had was each other, and we didn't know what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s445">Their parents were also taken, so, we didn't know.</span> <span id="s446">We had to really stick to one another and bond.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Can you describe those relationships, what kinds of things you did together?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Well, we were -- the more religious girls would eat together, you know, and I was one of them.</span> <span id="s449">And a little bit, I think, I was an outcast because the others always thought I was a little bit too religious.</span> <span id="s450">I really wasn't, I was just observant.</span> <span id="s451">That was how I was brought up from home.</span> <span id="s452">But other kids really didn't care about religion, the other girls.</span> <span id="s453">They did whatever they had to do, so I made sure not to eat meat and things like that, you know.</span> <span id="s454">If there was meat available, I stayed away from it, I didn't -- I was very kosher.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: Now, this is interesting, because when you talked about your childhood and when your friends wouldn't talk to you anymore, you said, "But I didn't think I was Jewish."</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: Right.</span> <span id="s457">I didn't think I was, but kosher I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: I see, so it was different.</span> <span id="s459">You had a certain set of traditions that you followed that were habitual?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s461">Right.</span> <span id="s462">It was very much accepted in Nieder-ohmen, very much so.</span> <span id="s463">Because on Passover, we would hand out matzos to our Gentile neighbors and friends, and they in return would give us eggs.</span> <span id="s464">And I very often went to my friend's house and they had these beautiful salamis hanging in their cellar.</span> <span id="s465">It looked so good to me, I asked my mother many a times, "Why can't I just have a sliver?"</span> <span id="s466">And she said, "It's not kosher.</span> <span id="s467">It comes from a pig."</span> <span id="s468">So that was it, it was a no-no and I lived by the rules.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">02:06:01</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: Now, when you're in this factory, was that harmful in any way?</span> <span id="s471">I mean, are you getting weaker because you're not eating some of the things that you weren't?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: Well, we were young, 15 years old.</span> <span id="s473">No, I wasn't really that weak, but I missed my parents.</span> <span id="s474">I missed everything.</span> <span id="s475">But, you know, there was one thing we were young, and I think that really helped.</span> <span id="s476">Because when you're young, you always feel that something better is going to come, and it will eventually be good again.</span> <span id="s477">And we really didn't think of the worst, none of us did.</span> <span id="s478">We thought, “Eventually this will all end and we are going to go home again, and we'll be free.”</span> <span id="s479">But it didn't come to that, never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Were you praying with these young girls, as well eating together?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: I did.</span> <span id="s482">I prayed for myself.</span> <span id="s483">They didn't do much praying.</span> <span id="s484">But I had one girl -- two other girls who were equally religious, and we did a lot of praying.</span> <span id="s485">But the other girls really didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">They sort of looked down on us a little bit like the frumis -- frumiesyou know.</span> <span id="s487">That was done, but it didn't bother us a bit.</span> <span id="s488">It was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Now, did sometimes difficult things happen so you had to really help each other, not simply support each other spiritually?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Spiritually.</span> <span id="s491">In Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s493">Did someone get sick and they needed to . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: Well, it wasn't that much that people got sick, but, you know, they were young girls and they wanted to have dates.</span> <span id="s495">They wanted to go out on a date, and maybe they did.</span> <span id="s496">And they wore the Juden-star, the star, and they were caught.</span> <span id="s497">And when they were caught, they went right to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s498">They went right to Auschwitz where we never heard from them again.</span> <span id="s499">So that was a big issue, and so many girls disappeared.</span> <span id="s500">They just felt we'll take the star off and nobody will even know that I'm Jewish.</span> <span id="s501">After all, our skin was white.</span> <span id="s502">So nobody would know, but they were always caught, and many of the girls were taken before that time to camps and never survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Now, who would they meet and where . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: It's hard to say -- it's hard to say who they met.</span> <span id="s505">They were recognized by somebody.</span> <span id="s506">Maybe their nose was too long.</span> <span id="s507">Maybe they were stopped by a Gestapo, who would say “Du bist eine Jüdin?”</span> <span id="s508">and then what?</span> <span id="s509">To say “No.”</span> <span id="s510">“Where do you live?”</span> <span id="s511">You had to have papers, 14 Pious Jews (Yiddish) 15 You are a Jewess?</span> <span id="s512">(German)</span></p> <p><span id="s513">that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: No, I meant boys.</span> <span id="s515">Where were they meeting boys?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: Oh, where did they find boys?</span> <span id="s517">Well, in the factory, you could find not just Jewish boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">There were the men who helped us with the machinery.</span> <span id="s519">Every young men, young German men, who sort of became interested in the Jewish girls, and if you were stupid enough, you would go with them.</span> <span id="s520">But, otherwise, you just didn't do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">02:09:02</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: So you never thought about doing that?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: Never.</span> <span id="s524">First of all, that wouldn't have been my thing.</span> <span id="s525">I was much too religious.</span> <span id="s526">Second of all, that was something you just didn't do as a decent human being; you just wouldn't do that.</span> <span id="s527">So</span></p> <p><span id="s528">. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: Did you have some kind of a social life when you went to that, but when you were boarding in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: In Bad Nauheim?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s533">We had a wonderful life there.</span> <span id="s534">We had -- it was very good there.</span> <span id="s535">Really, it was easy.</span> <span id="s536">I met my husband there.</span> <span id="s537">He went to the same boarding school.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: So were you boyfriend and girlfriend in that school?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: We were -- I had an eye on him.</span> <span id="s540">I don't know whether he had an eye on me.</span> <span id="s541">Like girls usually do, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: So you had a crush?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: I had a little bit of a crush on him.</span> <span id="s544">I had a little crush on the teacher, and like all girls do, that was okay.</span> <span id="s545">But, you know, I went away, and we had different, very different roads, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Now, there seemed to have been some freedom of movement being to work in that . . . A: In Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: . . . in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: And you saw your father's sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: Right.</span> <span id="s551">I, we could go out on certain days.</span> <span id="s552">We had a curfew, of course, you know.</span> <span id="s553">But we could go out on Sundays if we weren't working in the factory.</span> <span id="s554">And I remember taking another girl along.</span> <span id="s555">I had heard that there was an institute for retarded people, and that she was brought there.</span> <span id="s556">So every Sunday I went with my friends to that place, and -- to meet her, to see her.</span> <span id="s557">And she was so happy when I came, and she didn't really know where she was.</span> <span id="s558">She had her friends there, and it was ring around the rosy and whatever, and she was happy to see me.</span> <span id="s559">And I was happy that she was happy, and I went back into the labor camp, until one day I went to see her -- wanted to see her and it was closed.</span> <span id="s560">Closed indefinitely, no more.</span> <span id="s561">Somehow they had taken them all some place and suppose gassed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: That must have been a horrible day.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: It was terrible, right.</span> <span id="s564">But I realized -- I still didn't realize that they had gassed them.</span> <span id="s565">I thought maybe they put them someplace else.</span> <span id="s566">I mean, you really didn't -- maybe we were so naive we really didn't think of gas chambers because we thought relocating, relocation, that was the thing.</span> <span id="s567">Gas chambers were far from our minds.</span> <span id="s568">We didn't think that could happen.</span> <span id="s569">That was only later.</span> <span id="s570">So when she wasn't there anymore, I was devastated, but there was nothing I could do.</span> <span id="s571">That was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: So now you're really alone in a way that you've never been before.</span> <span id="s573">Now, your parents are Lódz and your sister is in Lódz?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">02:12:03</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: Right.</span> <span id="s576">And my aunt, well she wasn't much of a help, but she was there, you know.</span> <span id="s577">While I was in Berlin, I knew she was there, and I could see her.</span> <span id="s578">She was someone from home, but that was it.</span> <span id="s579">There was no, no relationship with anybody.</span> <span id="s580">We sort of had each other, the girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: How did you deal with it?</span> <span id="s582">I mean, did you cry?</span> <span id="s583">Did you get really depressed?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: Well, we all did, you know.</span> <span id="s585">When we cried, we cried together.</span> <span id="s586">And like, you know, like in German they'll say, “geteilter schmerz ist halber schmerz,” “If you share your pain with someone, it's half the pain.”</span> <span id="s587">And we shared everything, everything, even the clothes we shared.</span> <span id="s588">We were really one happy bunch together.</span> <span id="s589">We made the best of it, but it wasn't until we were in Berlin until 1943 in February, they took big transports, more than a thousand Jews from Berlin, including us.</span> <span id="s590">And they told us in the labor camp that they didn't need us any longer.</span> <span id="s591">We are going to be resettled to Poland, and they're going to have Russians -- White Russian, who were replacing us.</span> <span id="s592">But what could we do?</span> <span id="s593">We were going together on 16 Shared pain is half the pain (German) the transport, and we were together again, all of us, 160, 50, 40, whatever we were by then.</span> <span id="s594">Some of the girls, I must say, had gone back home to their parents and were taken with their parents to a camp.</span> <span id="s595">How this was arranged, I don't know.</span> <span id="s596">But, I couldn't, my parents just disappeared overnight, so I couldn't have gone with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: What rumors are you now hearing?</span> <span id="s598">I mean, you're in the factory for two years in Berlin where some information must be coming in to somebody.</span> <span id="s599">Are there rumors that you're hearing about ghettos, about killings?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: Yeah, we heard about ghettos.</span> <span id="s601">Never about killings.</span> <span id="s602">We heard about resettlements in ghettos.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Killings, we didn't hear about.</span> <span id="s604">We, we kept thinking about the girls who disappeared from nowhere.</span> <span id="s605">That they did something wrong, they shouldn't have done it.</span> <span id="s606">But, we never thought that they were actually killed.</span> <span id="s607">We thought maybe they had taken them into a camp someplace else, but that they were killed?</span> <span id="s608">Never entered my mind, anyway.</span> <span id="s609">So it was not until 1943 in February we were taken to -- we didn't know where we were taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">02:15:04 We were taken to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s611">We were going on the cattle -- on the train.</span> <span id="s612">And in the train, it was horrible conditions.</span> <span id="s613">We were in there for quite a few days, and, people died right then and there.</span> <span id="s614">And we had one pail in the middle there -- well, it was horrible.</span> <span id="s615">So ...</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Is that your worst time?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: one of -- not knowing where we were going, not knowing what they were going to do with us, that was really hard.</span> <span id="s618">But there were always a few people, older people than us, who said, "It's going to be all right.</span> <span id="s619">You're going to be resettled and not to worry."</span> <span id="s620">We never really screamed, cried, or did anything.</span> <span id="s621">We just took it as it came, I guess because we were young.</span> <span id="s622">And we said, “It's going to be all right.”</span> <span id="s623">One sort of did that to the other, you know, we tried to really calm each other down until we got the train rolled in Auschwitz in February.</span> <span id="s624">And then we what happened, we got out in the middle of night and there was MengeleOf course, we didn't know who Mengele was, and there were quite a lot of other Gestapo and SS men and everybody around us with dogs.</span> <span id="s625">And they kept screaming in German, of course, "Aussteigen, Aussteigen!</span> <span id="s626">"And they formed a line, and “You go right and the other one goes left.”</span> <span id="s627">And whatever the older people left, the children to the left, and the younger people to the right.</span> <span id="s628">And we still didn't know what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: How big a transport was this, do you know?</span> <span id="s630">A: A thousand.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">17 Dr. Josef Mengele 18 Get out!</span> <span id="s632">(German)</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: A thousand?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: Right.</span> <span id="s635">From Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: And how did you know it was Mengele?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: I didn't know it then.</span> <span id="s638">Later on I recognized him.</span> <span id="s639">I really didn't know then.</span> <span id="s640">And he started screaming, "You get here.</span> <span id="s641">You go here."</span> <span id="s642">Well, by then I was 17, so I went into the camps and all the rest of the people -- I mean, the older people, and the people -- the children went to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s643">But we didn't know that.</span> <span id="s644">So when we got to the camps, we were first -- they undressed us.</span> <span id="s645">We were sent to the sauna, and in the sauna -- they cut our hair before that.</span> <span id="s646">They cut our hair, and then we were tattooed.</span> <span id="s647">And we met in the sauna, we were all sitting together, not knowing each other because we had no hair and it was really -- for a young girl to suddenly have no hair whatsoever -- was a devastating experience.</span> <span id="s648">But it wasn't the worst.</span> <span id="s649">So we just looked at each other and most of the time, we didn't even recognize each other because we looked so different.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">02:18:04 So after the so-called delousing, we were given clothing.</span> <span id="s651">Our clothes we never seen any more.</span> <span id="s652">So they gave us some old things.</span> <span id="s653">I was a tall girl and I had a blouse which went to here.</span> <span id="s654">No hair, and unbelievably you looked like a degenerate.</span> <span id="s655">You looked like an idiot coming out of there.</span> <span id="s656">And what happened to those beautiful girls, I've been asked many a times, but you were a young girl.</span> <span id="s657">You must have been a pretty girl.</span> <span id="s658">If that's done to you, you're not pretty anymore.</span> <span id="s659">You look disgusting, and, of course, that wasn't the worst yet.</span> <span id="s660">The worst was yet to come.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: How did they cut your hair, with what?</span> <span id="s662">Did they cut it with a scissors or with a razor?</span> <span id="s663">A: Clippers.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: With clippers?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: Clippers and all the way down, so . . . Q: Did they cut your bodily hair as well?</span> <span id="s666">A: Yes, they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: Women cut your -- was it the same person who cut the hair on your head, or did you go in a line?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: We went in a line, some of them did their head and some of them did the other, you know, bodily hairs for us.</span> <span id="s669">It was a line, it was very well organized like everything in Germany was very well organized.</span> <span id="s670">But the people who did that were other inmates, you know, that were assigned to that particular thing.</span> <span id="s671">And most of them didn't speak German at all, so the only language I spoke was German.</span> <span id="s672">So all, some of them spoke Polish; some of them spoke whatever . . . Czechoslovakian</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: Did you -- you, obviously, then didn't speak with these women, or did you try to speak with them and say, "What's going on here?"</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: Well, you know, you know my friend, Zippyshe was around that area.</span> <span id="s675">She was in the Politische Abteilungand I remember her coming by and saying -- she spoke German, and she said, "Don't say a word.</span> <span id="s676">Just do what they tell you and you'll be okay."</span> <span id="s677">And I figured she really meant well with me, and I did what she said.</span> <span id="s678">I didn't say one word, and I told my friends, "Just let's keep still and do what they tell us to do."</span> <span id="s679">And they really didn't do us any harm except for someone who made a big to-do about it.</span> <span id="s680">I don't want my hair cut.</span> <span id="s681">Why should you?</span> <span id="s682">Some of the women were married to Gentiles, and they said, "My husband is an Aryan.</span> <span id="s683">Why should you cut my hair?"</span> <span id="s684">And that would get those girls who had been there for several years already extremely angry.</span> <span id="s685">They kept saying, "But you are a Jew.</span> <span id="s686">So, therefore, we have to cut your hair and shut up."</span> <span id="s687">So there was always some sort of an argument with cutting of the hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: Did Zippy go to a number of young girls and say, "Just be quiet"?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: Yes, she would just go around and say, "Be quiet.</span> <span id="s690">Don't say anything.</span> <span id="s691">02:21:00 Let them cut your hair.</span> <span id="s692">It's not the world's worst.</span> <span id="s693">It will grow back."</span> <span id="s694">And she was right, you know.</span> <span id="s695">This is not the world's worst, this wasn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: What was the tattooing like?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: The tattooing was done --, well, like any tattooing here.</span> <span id="s698">People are tattooed all the time.</span> <span id="s699">The tattooing was they took your skin and they took a pin, a pen, pen and they sort of stuck it in piece by piece and they put the number.</span> <span id="s700">It's a real German number I have on my arm.</span> <span id="s701">And then this half a Winkel,here underneath, which I never knew what it actually meant.</span> <span id="s702">I thought maybe this was part of a -- half of a Magen David.</span> <span id="s703">That's what I explained to myself; I don't think that it was now.</span> <span id="s704">Whatever it was, I have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: Did that hurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">19 Zippy Tichauer 20 Political division (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s707">21 Corner (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s709">Didn't hurt, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: Now, were you then given a number to put on your uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s712">Over here and we had like a cross in the back so we shouldn't be able to escape, so . . . Q: And who put -- who did that?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: It was old people, other inmates who were assigned to do these things.</span> <span id="s714">It wasn't the SS women themselves.</span> <span id="s715">They just stood there and supervised.</span> <span id="s716">They didn't do that themselves.</span> <span id="s717">They stood and laughed and had a good time in seeing these poor Jews looking like animals.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: Were there any men around?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: Yeah, once in a while there was a . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: I mean, when you were being registered, in that registering process?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: There was always a few SS men standing there with the SS women, and -- but it didn't bother us.</span> <span id="s722">We really you know, we didn't look like women anymore anyway.</span> <span id="s723">We were not ashamed of anything, that's what we looked like and that's what we had to deal with.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: Were you registered the first day you came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: I believe I was registered the first day I came in, because, you know, the Germans are accurate with their registrations and their book work.</span> <span id="s726">So I believe I was registered, maybe I wasn't.</span> <span id="s727">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: Did somebody fill out a card of information?</span> <span id="s729">Just your number?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: I believe so.</span> <span id="s731">Maybe they did.</span> <span id="s732">If they did, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s733">It could have been because why would they have the officers where Zippy worked, they called it the PolitischeOffice.</span> <span id="s734">So maybe they did, I do not recall it at all.</span> <span id="s735">It's possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: So you get these strange-looking clothes, you're shaved, and you have a tattoo?</span> <span id="s737">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: Now, what happens?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: Now, we were assigned to a block.</span> <span id="s740">I think it was Block 13 I was in.</span> <span id="s741">We were all the girls, not all of the girls who came at the same transport.</span> <span id="s742">So we were more or less together, and we</span></p> <p><span id="s743">22 Political (German) were put on -- so we had what we call a Koje.</span> <span id="s744">02:24:06 You know what a Koje is?</span> <span id="s745">A Koje is like a board.</span> <span id="s746">There was one on the bottom; there was one on the top, and I think there was a third one.</span> <span id="s747">We had no straw, we had no blankets, we had nothing and it was February.</span> <span id="s748">They took away our clothes, but I do remember they left me with my shoes.</span> <span id="s749">And I was a kid, I didn't know -- I had shoes, very simple shoes on.</span> <span id="s750">I was in Auschwitz three days and the soles had separated from the top.</span> <span id="s751">So I found a rag someplace and tied them together.</span> <span id="s752">It was quite a few weeks I walked barefoot in February.</span> <span id="s753">It was very cold.</span> <span id="s754">There was snow on the ground.</span> <span id="s755">I put all kinds of -- whatever I could find on my feet just to stay warm.</span> <span id="s756">And so they did put us into the barracks.</span> <span id="s757">And then every morning we had zählappellwhich is the roll call, and there was usually SS men or SS women that came.</span> <span id="s758">We stood there sometimes for hours in the freezing cold, so some of the girls already died right then and there because it was impossible.</span> <span id="s759">Couldn't take that.</span> <span id="s760">Food, we hardly got.</span> <span id="s761">And really, I mean, they were falling down left and right.</span> <span id="s762">So standing there -- then, one of the SS men would come and make a selection, and most of the time that was Mengele.</span> <span id="s763">And he would go to say -- he didn't like the face, he didn't like what you looked like, and he says, "Come on out.</span> <span id="s764">Come on out.</span> <span id="s765">Come on out."</span> <span id="s766">So I remember that so well.</span> <span id="s767">You know, I was brought up very religious, and the prayer you say when you die is “Shema Israel,” so every time he came around, I would just stand there and say my prayer.</span> <span id="s768">And luckily I was never taken.</span> <span id="s769">And I used to tell my friends, "Do what I'm doing."</span> <span id="s770">I was such a religious person.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Well, it worked for me, it didn't work for everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">02:27:01 So it went on for weeks and weeks.</span> <span id="s773">We marched out in the morning.</span> <span id="s774">We went to build barracks out in Auschwitz, and then the SS men came with their dogs.</span> <span id="s775">And if they didn't like you -- but who you -- liked you?</span> <span id="s776">You looked like an animal.</span> <span id="s777">They would just say, "Go, run after her.</span> <span id="s778">Go ahead and take the dog."</span> <span id="s779">The dog would bite you.</span> <span id="s780">I have a few bites on my legs.</span> <span id="s781">And, you know, by then you were already every day you looked skinnier and skinnier.</span> <span id="s782">There was nothing left of you anymore, and then suddenly I noticed I was getting typhoid.</span> <span id="s783">I started to -- couldn't control my bowel movements anymore, and I felt this is it.</span> <span id="s784">I'll probably lay down like the rest of them.</span> <span id="s785">By then most of the girls had already -- the first four weeks were the worst, and I probably won't be able to make this.</span> <span id="s786">But then I remember my father said not to give in.</span> <span id="s787">“You've got to be strong.”</span> <span id="s788">And at night I used to hallucinate and, you know, there was no Schindlerno Schindler's list or anything.</span> <span id="s789">If anyone would help you, it was the girl who laid next to you.</span> <span id="s790">She would say, "Here, look, I give you a piece of rag to clean yourself off, and I'll take your bread."</span> <span id="s791">Well, I much rather gave her the bread, clean</span></p> <p><span id="s792">23 Bunk (German) 24 Roll call count (German) 25 Hear, O Israel (Hebrew); declaration of God’s unity and watchword of Jewish faith.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">26 Oskar Schindler myself off, and be okay the next day.</span> <span id="s794">But it was horrible, I screamed for my mother, my father.</span> <span id="s795">There was nobody.</span> <span id="s796">I was a young girl, I just felt somebody should listen to me.</span> <span id="s797">I really would say the first four weeks, if you held out the first four or six weeks, you were okay.</span> <span id="s798">I think I did, I held out those weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: Okay, let's take a break.</span> <span id="s800">02:29:00 End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s802">03:01:06</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Carola, you said that you were building barracks.</span> <span id="s804">So you were living in Auschwitz barrack now at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: And where were you building these barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: We walked out -- I don't know.</span> <span id="s808">We walked out, we walked in at night.</span> <span id="s809">Quite a distance, it must have been in Oswiecim, in someplace there.</span> <span id="s810">And, we, you know, we carried the stones.</span> <span id="s811">If we had sort of a jacket, we had to turn it around and we put the stones in there and carried them.</span> <span id="s812">The buttons in the back, and that's the kind of work we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: Were you put to that work very quickly within the first week of your coming?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: Yeah, right away.</span> <span id="s815">Right away.</span> <span id="s816">The first four weeks, I was doing that kind of work and that was the time when I started having typhoid.</span> <span id="s817">I was so sick, so sick.</span> <span id="s818">And I went -- in Auschwitz, there was this so-called Lagerstraβe,the street.</span> <span id="s819">And there was the Lagerstraβe where our barrack was, and I -- it was close to the kitchen.</span> <span id="s820">And I walked to the kitchen, and I found some coal on the floor.</span> <span id="s821">And I always heard that coal will stuff you up if you eat coal.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">03:03:01 And I had a little bit of medical knowledge, not too much.</span> <span id="s823">Coal will stuff you up.</span> <span id="s824">No matter what, what could have happened?</span> <span id="s825">I found a piece of coal in the kitchen and I ate the coal, and I found a piece of lemon peel near the kitchen and I took the piece of lemon peel in my pocket.</span> <span id="s826">I ate the piece of coal.</span> <span id="s827">And water we didn't have, but we had the snow on the ground.</span> <span id="s828">And I ate the snow, and I swallowed that and I got better.</span> <span id="s829">And every time when I felt faint, and I had that piece of lemon peel in my pocket for all the years I’ve been in Auschwitz, and every time I felt faint, I took that lemon peel.</span> <span id="s830">And, you know, there's always a little something coming out yet -- no matter how long you have a lemon peel in your pocket -- and I could smell it, and I felt like -- relieved.</span> <span id="s831">So the lemon peel and the coal got me out of my dilemma.</span> <span id="s832">And then one day, they were taking all the so-called fryzjerkaswhich I didn't know at the time what that meant, to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s833">And they needed new ones in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s834">I didn't know what that meant, and they had selected already about six; they needed a seventh.</span> <span id="s835">And this girl, Sheyna was her name, stood next to me, and she said to me, "Pick up your arm."</span> <span id="s836">And I said, "Now I’m not -- what is a fryzjerka anyway?"</span> <span id="s837">She says, "A fryzjerka is a beautician."</span> <span id="s838">And I said, "But I'm not a beautician.</span> <span id="s839">I, I don't know how to do hair.</span> <span id="s840">I can't do 27 Camp street (German) 28 Hair dresser (Polish) that for the SS women."</span> <span id="s841">She said, "Oh, keep quiet.</span> <span id="s842">Just give them your number."</span> <span id="s843">So she took my hand, and she said, "37468, she's the seventh fryzjerka.</span> <span id="s844">“ So the girl in charge took my number down and that made me the fryzjerka, which is a beautician, but I didn't have to do the SS women.</span> <span id="s845">All I did was cutting the hair of the people who came in the same way they had done to us.</span> <span id="s846">Now, that was a very devastating experience, since lots of transports came in and lots of friends of mine came and I had to cut their hair.</span> <span id="s847">And I kept telling them, like Zippy had done previously to me, "Do what they tell you and don't make noise."</span> <span id="s848">And I did tell them, and their hair was cut and I did that for quiet some time.</span> <span id="s849">That somehow made my life a little better since it was indoors.</span> <span id="s850">Then after a while, they replaced us again with other girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: About how long were you doing this?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: I don't recall how long, but I did that for a few months, for a few months.</span> <span id="s853">Q: Did you still live in the barrack you had been?</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: The same barrack I was living in, yes.</span> <span id="s855">Q: Did they train you?</span> <span id="s856">I mean . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: No, they didn't train me, no.</span> <span id="s858">Well, everybody knows how to use a clipper, and you just cut the hair.</span> <span id="s859">I really didn't do too much hair cutting.</span> <span id="s860">I did more of the body -- the bodily hair, you know, under the arm, on the bottom part.</span> <span id="s861">And it worked for a while, it was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">03:06:01 Then they replaced us again.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: Wait, wait, wait, wait.</span> <span id="s864">This couldn't have been very easy for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: It wasn't easy, but it got me out of the Auβenarbeit,going, marching out of the camps every day and building barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: Were there rules that you weren't allowed to talk to the women who came in?</span> <span id="s867">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: We were mainly supervised by Kapos, women who had been there before us.</span> <span id="s869">Well, they could have been miserable and started hitting each and every one.</span> <span id="s870">But whoever came and started to rebel, we would tell them, "Don't say anything.</span> <span id="s871">Just have your hair cut.</span> <span id="s872">It's not the worst."</span> <span id="s873">And people -- only some people would say, "But my husband is Aryan.</span> <span id="s874">Why should you cut my hair?"</span> <span id="s875">And then the whole thing started to explode a little bit.</span> <span id="s876">I watched this for quite some time, and it was horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">29 Outside work (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: Did you see Zippy again there in that area?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: Zippy always worked near the sauna.</span> <span id="s880">She would work in the political -- she would come by, and she would ask questions and she would come around.</span> <span id="s881">And she would talk to the newcomers, because Zippy speaks more than one language.</span> <span id="s882">My language was German, nothing else.</span> <span id="s883">And that was a bit hard, you know.</span> <span id="s884">Speaking -- you know, speaking German only was for the other inmates like I spoke the language of our enemies, you know, of the Nazis.</span> <span id="s885">So many a times, they thought "Are you Jewish?"</span> <span id="s886">I said, "Yes, I am."</span> <span id="s887">"How come you speak German?"</span> <span id="s888">So, you know, for survival you do anything.</span> <span id="s889">It didn't take me long, and I learned how to speak the Slovak language.</span> <span id="s890">I spoke it so well -- unfortunately, I don't speak it anymore -- that I went after the war to Czechoslovakia and they thought I was born there.</span> <span id="s891">So I learned a different language, and it got me a little further, I suppose.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: Now, how about the other women who were cutting the hair?</span> <span id="s893">You knew them . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: Well, I got to know them, yeah.</span> <span id="s895">I got to know them.</span> <span id="s896">Well, this little girl, Shayna, who took me in and said, "Take her number," I worked with her.</span> <span id="s897">And she spoke Yiddish only, you know, and she had a little sister.</span> <span id="s898">They were beauticians.</span> <span id="s899">They were manicurists and beauticians, but I was nothing.</span> <span id="s900">I had no idea.</span> <span id="s901">And I remember that was my first experience I had with Yiddish.</span> <span id="s902">Now, Yiddish sounds pretty much like German, you know.</span> <span id="s903">A little bit.</span> <span id="s904">For a Yiddish-speaking person, the German is like a distorted Yiddish, but for a German- speaking person, Yiddish is a distorted German.</span> <span id="s905">So I, that's when I learned how to speak Yiddish, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">03:09:01 So I learned two languages in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: Now, why did you decide to learn Slovakian?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: Most of the girls, like Zippy, they spoke so many languages, and they spoke Slovak, and you know, it's a Slawischlanguage.</span> <span id="s909">Once you know how to speak the Slovak language, you can understand Polish, too, so I understood a little Russian, a little Polish.</span> <span id="s910">I understood quite a bit, so it was okay.</span> <span id="s911">Except for Hungarian, that language I could never catch on.</span> <span id="s912">That was too much for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: Now, you knew a young woman named Rose Farkas, who was also cutting hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: Yeah, Rose Farkas worked with me.</span> <span id="s915">She was in the same Kommandoso called.</span> <span id="s916">And I remember her, but she had been in Auschwitz for quite some time.</span> <span id="s917">I was a newcomer to</span></p> <p><span id="s918">30 Slavic (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s919">31 Commando (German) them, and now, I'm an old lady, but then I was the youngest of them all.</span> <span id="s920">And it seemed that all the girls, you know, they were very sweet to me.</span> <span id="s921">I was the little kid, the new little kid on the block.</span> <span id="s922">So they took very good care of me.</span> <span id="s923">We didn't have Schindler, we didn't have anyone.</span> <span id="s924">We helped each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: So how did they take care of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: Well, that's a long story.</span> <span id="s927">I'll make it as short as I can.</span> <span id="s928">Q: No, don't make it short.</span> <span id="s929">That' okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: Well, when I worked in the sauna, you know, I couldn't hold my stool because I had diarrhea continuously.</span> <span id="s931">And the Kapo of the sauna was a German woman.</span> <span id="s932">She was a lady of ill repute, so she was not very nice or very neat.</span> <span id="s933">And she had nasty things to say, and when she seen that I was just a -- I couldn't walk anymore, and wherever I went -- I hate to say it -- but something dropped.</span> <span id="s934">The girls would just take a pail of water and wash it away, and she would say, "So what's wrong with that one here?</span> <span id="s935">She belongs to Block 25."</span> <span id="s936">Block 25 was the death camp -- death block.</span> <span id="s937">And the girls said, “No, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s938">She is okay.</span> <span id="s939">Not to worry.</span> <span id="s940">She is working hard.</span> <span id="s941">Nothing."</span> <span id="s942">And they protected me, you know, they protected me from all sides.</span> <span id="s943">Why, I don't know, but I really, like I said, I was a young kid and they were all a little older.</span> <span id="s944">Zippy is maybe about seven years older than I am.</span> <span id="s945">So they felt they had to rachmoneswith me.</span> <span id="s946">And, of course, you know I didn't speak exactly the way they . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: So this went on for a long time?</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: It went on for a long time.</span> <span id="s949">You don't -- it helped.</span> <span id="s950">The coal, the lemon peel, that was my medication, and it helped me.</span> <span id="s951">It helped me to survive for quite some time.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: Did you think about going to the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: No.</span> <span id="s954">That was a no-no.</span> <span id="s955">If you went to the hospital, you stayed there because you would never go out again, no matter what.</span> <span id="s956">So I had to, because my father had said, "You have to survive, and you will survive."</span></p> <p><span id="s957">03:12:04 And I had that in me that, “It's going to be all right.</span> <span id="s958">Just don't give in to them, you're going to make it.”</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: So, now, they took all of you who were so-called “beauticians” -- what a strange name -- and put you into another Kommando?</span></p> <p><span id="s960">32 Mercy, compassion (Yiddish)</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: I don't know whether they took all of us.</span> <span id="s962">I believe when the Greek transports came, like this Rollie and Stella, they were beauticians.</span> <span id="s963">They took them into that Kommando, but I was out of the Kommando.</span> <span id="s964">But I went, instead of cutting hair, I went to the Bekleidungskammer, which was close by.</span> <span id="s965">There we cleaned the clothes.</span> <span id="s966">It was like a cleaning outfit.</span> <span id="s967">We, people were getting undressed, we had to sort their stuff and then put it through machines and -- called the Entlausung.So I worked there for a while then.</span> <span id="s968">That also better than going outside and building barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: Was it warm in there during the winter?</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: Well, you were near sort of an oven.</span> <span id="s971">It wasn't that cold.</span> <span id="s972">It wasn't always warm, but when you slept at night, you were cold in the corner.</span> <span id="s973">It was kind of cold, freezing.</span> <span id="s974">But by then, of course, once I got into the sauna, I got a pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s975">Not shoes, but those things you wear in Holland.</span> <span id="s976">What do you call them?</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: The clogs?</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: Clogs, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: Wooden shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: Yeah, that was good.</span> <span id="s981">They lasted, so you could go through winter weather with them.</span> <span id="s982">Q: Did you feet get sores on them from those shoes?</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: Uh-uh.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: Luckily nothing.</span> <span id="s986">Luckily nothing.</span> <span id="s987">And I walked without shoes in Auschwitz for quite some time.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: Now, how did you manage that and not get . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s990">Somehow I think somebody up there was watching over me.</span> <span id="s991">Because when I look back -- at that time, nothing phased me, I was a young kid, but when I look back and I think back of all the things I experienced, I said to myself “somebody up there was watching over me” because how do you walk in Poland without shoes, in March?</span> <span id="s992">There were other people that did the same thing, and their toes were frozen off.</span> <span id="s993">Quite a few.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: And you never had frostbite?</span></p> <p><span id="s995">33 Dressing room (German) 34 Delousing station (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: Never.</span> <span id="s997">I had bites from the dogs, but not frostbites.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: Carola, when did you find out after you had come to Auschwitz that there were gas chambers and they were killing people?</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: Very easily, because we worked in the sauna.</span> <span id="s1000">The gas chambers were very close by.</span> <span id="s1001">So we seen the chimney smoke, that's all we seen.</span> <span id="s1002">We didn't see transports going in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">03:15:02 Maybe they did that at night, but we seen the chimney smoke and it was peaceful.</span> <span id="s1004">We didn't hear anything, we didn't hear anybody cry.</span> <span id="s1005">We didn't hear anybody scream.</span> <span id="s1006">We did hear music play when the transports marched in and out to work.</span> <span id="s1007">Auβenarbeit, so to speak, but you did not hear any screaming in the gas chambers because people who went into the camps -- into the gas chambers didn't know where they were going.</span> <span id="s1008">So while I was working in the sauna and doing the entlausendisinfection, they asked me to go to the crematorium and get some blue gas.</span> <span id="s1009">Whether they needed that for the clothes or they needed it to wash the people off to take lice away and entlausen -- I don't recall.</span> <span id="s1010">All I recall is that I went, of course, not alone.</span> <span id="s1011">There was an SS woman walking with me to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1012">I was supposed to get two bottles of Zyklon Bor whatever they called it.</span> <span id="s1013">A liquid gas.</span> <span id="s1014">And, I went, and this lady went with me with her gun, of course.</span> <span id="s1015">And I asked the Sonderkommando, the man, to get me what I was supposed to get.</span> <span id="s1016">So he opened the wrong door.</span> <span id="s1017">He must have opened the wrong door.</span> <span id="s1018">I just stood there, and I seen these people piled into the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1019">Not saying a word, they were all dead.</span> <span id="s1020">They were all piled in there.</span> <span id="s1021">They couldn't even fall down because they pushed them all in there, and I just looked and I said, "This is impossible."</span> <span id="s1022">Of course, I had known all along that was happening, but to see is to believe it.</span> <span id="s1023">And then I came back to the sauna.</span> <span id="s1024">I never told anybody.</span> <span id="s1025">I was so horrified, I didn't want other girls to feel bad and get nightmares.</span> <span id="s1026">I had them.</span> <span id="s1027">You see grownups with children and everything, yet standing up.</span> <span id="s1028">They were not taken out yet, and they were not gassed.</span> <span id="s1029">They were not burned yet, so quickly he closed the door.</span> <span id="s1030">He was very embarrassed that he opened the wrong door, and this SS woman escorted me back into the camp.</span> <span id="s1031">And, like I said, I never told anybody until a few years ago I was interviewed by someone and then it took me a long time to even talk about it.</span> <span id="s1032">That was the experience I had with the gas chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">03:18:03</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: Did you ever tell Zippy this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">35 Delousing (German) 36 Cyclone B (German) 37 Special commando (German); term used for Jewish prisoners selected to work in the gas chambers and crematoria.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: I don't think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: So you didn't even go to someone who you knew was a functionary to talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: I didn't talk to anybody about it because I don't think I told ever anybody except Nina who interviewed me after the Washington Together-- Togetherness, but otherwise, I didn't tell anybody.</span> <span id="s1039">But it's now not as bad to talk about it anymore.</span> <span id="s1040">It was very hard for me to even open up to see this horror.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: Was the SS woman standing with you when he did this?</span> <span id="s1042">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: And . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: It was nothing to her, she had probably seen it a million times.</span> <span id="s1045">Q: And she didn't care that you had seen it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: No.</span> <span id="s1047">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1048">It was okay.</span> <span id="s1049">As a matter of fact, you know, the SS women -- all the transports came from Poland, from Czechoslovakia, from Greece, from Italy.</span> <span id="s1050">Everybody brought beautiful clothes and I had been working in the sauna.</span> <span id="s1051">I had to put this stuff into the machines.</span> <span id="s1052">They used to say, "Well, this is nothing.</span> <span id="s1053">Just wait till the American people come.</span> <span id="s1054">When we get the clothing of the American Jews, then we really have clothes."</span> <span id="s1055">So, obviously, they were very sure of themselves that the American Jews will eventually end up in the gas chambers, too.</span> <span id="s1056">So that was my experience with the gas chambers in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1057">, what I wanted to say, by that time, you know, in Auschwitz most of our girls who had come with me from Berlin had already died except for one.</span> <span id="s1058">She was a young girl, she was 19; I was 17.</span> <span id="s1059">By then maybe she was 20 and I was 18.</span> <span id="s1060">I passed -- I walked in the Lagerstraβe and I seen her laying there, and I said to her, "What's the matter?"</span> <span id="s1061">She says, "Well, I'm going to die.</span> <span id="s1062">I can't hold out."</span> <span id="s1063">But she says, "You're a young girl.</span> <span id="s1064">You're going to --" She says, "You're going to make it, ... and I want you to tell the world what they did to us."</span> <span id="s1065">And I held her in my arms and she died.</span> <span id="s1066">And I said the “Shema,” that was the right thing for me to do and I walked away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">03:21:05 It was an everyday happening in Auschwitz, you just seen your friends on the street and dying.</span> <span id="s1068">She was a very nice girl, and I really felt that she was going to make it, but there was no way.</span> <span id="s1069">People could not endure all the stress and all the strain and no food and wintertime.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">38 American Gathering of Holocaust Survivors (Washington, DC) 39 See “Shema Israel.”</span> <span id="s1071">That was a very, very bad experience for me.</span> <span id="s1072">That was something that I will never forget.</span> <span id="s1073">I had known this girl from childhood on.</span> <span id="s1074">And even today sometimes I see a woman, an older woman, who -- she was very short -- and I look at her and I say, "She probably would have looked like--" Bertel was her name -- "she probably would have looked like that today."</span> <span id="s1075">She would have been an old lady by now, but at that time she was 19 years old, beautiful and everything.</span> <span id="s1076">Couldn't make it, no chance.</span> <span id="s1077">And so by then all, most of the girls from Berlin had passed away, had been killed, or had been shot, or didn't want to live anymore.</span> <span id="s1078">And we were just with the girls who were there, and we again made close ties with each and every one because everybody had one reason; that was to survive.</span> <span id="s1079">Stick to one another and survive.</span> <span id="s1080">And there was one thing I must say.</span> <span id="s1081">Somebody in Auschwitz, and I think they must be from Czechoslovakia, maybe from Poland by the name of Carola Stern, and that person must have died.</span> <span id="s1082">And she got some sardines from the Red Cross from Switzerland, and she was no longer there, so they gave it to me.</span> <span id="s1083">This was the most fortunate thing I had, so I had about four cans of sardines, and I could buy myself, you know, a piece of bread or something like that.</span> <span id="s1084">They also gave us a piece of salami, like once a week.</span> <span id="s1085">And being that I was so Orthodox, I wasn't going to eat it, I exchanged it for bread.</span> <span id="s1086">Later on I found out that I didn't have to do that, I could have eaten it.</span> <span id="s1087">But that was my religion which wouldn't allow me to eat any unkosher food, even in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: Where could you exchange?</span> <span id="s1089">You would just exchange with another prisoner when you had them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">03:24:02</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: Uh-huh, with another person.</span> <span id="s1092">And sometimes if you exchange it for a pair of underpants you know.</span> <span id="s1093">Anything, and sometimes, you know, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: When you were working in the sauna -- not the sauna, when you were working with cleaning the clothes . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: . . . did you ever take clothes for yourself or for other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">A: I don't really -- I never took clothes.</span> <span id="s1098">Because the clothes was dirty, you know.</span> <span id="s1099">You had to go through a machine first.</span> <span id="s1100">They came out on the other end.</span> <span id="s1101">Maybe the people who were on the other end could.</span> <span id="s1102">What I did I assorted the clothes dirty, you know.</span> <span id="s1103">Maybe I did take a thing or two; it's possible.</span> <span id="s1104">I don't recall ever taking anything because by then they had given me a black uniform, a black -- I had something to wear and the clogs.</span> <span id="s1105">So I was happy with what I had, I didn't really -- I got a jacket, yeah.</span> <span id="s1106">We did organize -- they called it “organization.”</span> <span id="s1107">We stole a few things, let's put it that way, if we could.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q: Did you wear a babushka on your head?</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1110">All the time because they wanted us to.</span> <span id="s1111">They didn't want the hair to grow.</span> <span id="s1112">But then the hair grew back slowly, you know.</span> <span id="s1113">But after a week -- a month or so, they would always cut if off again until later when I worked in the Bekleidungskammer they didn't cut their hair that much anymore.</span> <span id="s1114">Sort of skipped it once or twice, so my hair grew back and I looked a little bit more normal than I did before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: How did you wash?</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: Well, you had to keep yourself clean; otherwise, you had lice and whatever.</span> <span id="s1117">So we went to the toilets, whatever water kept running there, we did wash ourselves off.</span> <span id="s1118">But the toilet conditions were terrible, you know, it was an awful thing.</span> <span id="s1119">But if we got to some water or even during the snowy season we would take a little bit snow, and we would let it stand in our Schüssellor whatever we had.</span> <span id="s1120">And we had some water, we kept washing ourselves.</span> <span id="s1121">Well, we did not have our periods, you know.</span> <span id="s1122">So we were not women.</span> <span id="s1123">Obviously, they had put something in the food which women did not menstruate anymore.</span> <span id="s1124">So we were easy to keep ourselves clean.</span> <span id="s1125">They did that, I forgot what they call it.</span> <span id="s1126">Some sort of a solution they put in the soups to make the women sort of leaner and no desires or anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: Did you have your period when you were working in the factory in Berlin?</span> <span id="s1128">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: And was that difficult in the factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: No, that wasn't difficult.</span> <span id="s1133">We could still go out and get things and to protect ourselves.</span> <span id="s1134">That was okay.</span> <span id="s1135">In Auschwitz, that would have been an impossible thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">03:27:01 It really would have been.</span> <span id="s1137">It was very hard to keep yourself clean.</span> <span id="s1138">If you kept yourself clean, you were on top of things.</span> <span id="s1139">It was very hard, though.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: Were you picking lice off each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: Well, I didn't pick lice off myself.</span> <span id="s1142">I, I, don't think -- I probably did have.</span> <span id="s1143">But I remember later on that I had sort of knots.</span> <span id="s1144">Is that what you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: Knots?</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">40 Bowl (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">A: The eggs of the lice in hair.</span> <span id="s1148">No actual louse crawled around my head, but then you sort of combed yourself with your fingernails, whatever, to get that stuff out.</span> <span id="s1149">And you kept washing yourself and washing yourself and somewhat it went away again.</span> <span id="s1150">Never did go away completely.</span> <span id="s1151">We all had lice.</span> <span id="s1152">We definitely all had lice.</span> <span id="s1153">There was no way that we could escape that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1155">Let's take a break.</span> <span id="s1156">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1157">We will have lunch.</span> <span id="s1158">03:28:04 End of Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">04:01:18</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: Carola, what was the next job that you had after the cleaning of the clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: Well, it was sort of a side job, I would call it.</span> <span id="s1163">They took lots of the people and somebody had to write it down.</span> <span id="s1164">Because the Germans were very thorough with all their bookkeeping, and since I spoke German, I was elected to write down whether one had blood type A, blood type B, blood type whatever.</span> <span id="s1165">And everybody was so thin and so hungry to give blood was a horrible thing, but they did.</span> <span id="s1166">They had no other choice because that blood was sent to the front, to the soldiers, WehrmachtSo I did, too.</span> <span id="s1167">They took it from me, too.</span> <span id="s1168">So I did that for a while, that was -- that is besides when no one came for a day or so, that was my job then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">So, of course, people cried, they didn't want to do it, but there was no other choice.</span> <span id="s1170">They had to, we were forced to.</span> <span id="s1171">And all these survivors who looked so undernourished and ready to die had to give blood.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: And where was this done?</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: It was done in the sauna in a little room, and they marched the people in.</span> <span id="s1174">Not the newcomers, but the people who had been there for a while.</span> <span id="s1175">So they gave blood.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: So people must have been extremely weak after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: They were terribly weak.</span> <span id="s1178">Not only that, a lot of Hungarians had the good blood type, blood type B, I believe is the good blood type.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">04:03:11 And they took it again and again because that was the type they wanted for their soldiers.</span> <span id="s1180">I believe it's B, the best blood type.</span> <span id="s1181">And they had to give it.</span> <span id="s1182">Of course, they were weak.</span> <span id="s1183">They were weak to begin with.</span> <span id="s1184">They got weaker after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q: You had typhoid, not typhus; is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">A: I had -- in German, it's typhus.</span> <span id="s1187">In English, it's typhoid.</span> <span id="s1188">Right.</span> <span id="s1189">Q: Did you get sick any other time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: Well, I was never -- I never really recuperated to the fullest.</span> <span id="s1191">I, in later on as we were -- 1945, as we marched out of Auschwitz, I developed an eye infection, and my eyes were very red.</span> <span id="s1192">And I don't know how, but somehow things always fell in place.</span> <span id="s1193">There was this doctor who 41 Armed forces (German) worked at the Revier.He seen me walking on the street, and he said to me, "Carola, your eyes are red.</span> <span id="s1194">You need some drops."</span> <span id="s1195">And I said, "Oh, I didn't see a mirror.</span> <span id="s1196">I didn't even know my eyes were red."</span> <span id="s1197">And he gave me drops and the drops helped me, and my eyes got better until later on, 32 years later, there was a flare-up of the eyes which I developed really in the camps.</span> <span id="s1198">The doctors had examined the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1199">It had been laying there dormant for 32 years, and then it came up as iritis.</span> <span id="s1200">And later on, it developed into glaucoma.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q: Do you remember your day off?</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: I don't remember my day off.</span> <span id="s1203">We weren't always working, because sometimes we were just laying around.</span> <span id="s1204">When there was nothing to do and we were dreaming of better times and then when the war would end and we would survive.</span> <span id="s1205">We would be together with our parents and people again.</span> <span id="s1206">And, and, we were always cooking -- for some reason “some day we will have food again.”</span> <span id="s1207">When you're hungry, that's the only thing you think of.</span> <span id="s1208">The only thing is food.</span> <span id="s1209">And, we were constantly talking about food.</span> <span id="s1210">“We will cook this” and “we will cook this.”</span> <span id="s1211">The most intelligent, the most -- I mean, each and every one of us was talking about food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: What particular food did you talk about?</span> <span id="s1213">Did you have a particular fantasy?</span> <span id="s1214">A: Whatever one liked best.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: And what did you like best?</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: I liked puddings.</span> <span id="s1217">I loved puddings, and I liked cakes and things like that.</span> <span id="s1218">So I dreamt of rice pudding.</span> <span id="s1219">I adored rice pudding and all this kind of stuff I didn't have in years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">04:06:03 Then food didn't mean -- a particular food didn't mean too much,.</span> <span id="s1221">We just wanted to have, let's say, a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s1222">Just a loaf of bread and call it our own.</span> <span id="s1223">And we felt that some day somewhere we'll have a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s1224">May be.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: Did you ever notice a difference in the food, the amount of food you got or the kind of food you got?</span> <span id="s1226">Was sometimes it better than other times?</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: Well, it was never good.</span> <span id="s1228">But in -- after we went out of Auschwitz, we went to the last camp.</span> <span id="s1229">They eliminated the salt.</span> <span id="s1230">Obviously, they were short on salt and they sent this all to the front, to the soldiers.</span> <span id="s1231">So after we had no salt, we were so skinny, it's amazing.</span> <span id="s1232">We were so thin, it took all the water and everything out of us.</span> <span id="s1233">That was horrible.</span> <span id="s1234">That was in the last camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">That wasn't in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">42 Police station (German); according to interviewee, this term was used to refer to the camp infirmary.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">Q: Were you ever able to take a shower after you first came into Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">A: Yes, I have been able to take a shower when no one was looking.</span> <span id="s1239">We went sometimes we stole ourselves a shower.</span> <span id="s1240">We went into the sauna, and somebody turned on the water, one, two, three; we were in and out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: Was that dangerous?</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: Yeah, we made sure that no one was looking.</span> <span id="s1243">None of the SS women was -- well, I don't know how dangerous it would have been, but they probably wouldn't have liked that.</span> <span id="s1244">They wanted us to be dirty.</span> <span id="s1245">Dirty Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q: Do you remember noise in the barrack or smells in the barrack?</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A: There were quite a bit of smells because people always died, and then they laid there for a little while until someone removed them.</span> <span id="s1248">But when somebody died, the next took the shoes.</span> <span id="s1249">The next one took the kerchief.</span> <span id="s1250">The next one took the -- it was like an everyday occurrence.</span> <span id="s1251">It was done every single day.</span> <span id="s1252">That's where we got an extra jacket or something.</span> <span id="s1253">If somebody died, you took it from them, and you cried with everyone who died who was killed or didn't get up anymore in the morning.</span> <span id="s1254">But life had to go on.</span> <span id="s1255">Life and death.</span> <span id="s1256">There was more death than life, but that's how it was in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1257">It was like a very quiet street when I watched the movie "Shoah."</span> <span id="s1258">I seen that silence, that silence.</span> <span id="s1259">That's how it was.</span> <span id="s1260">It was very silent, you didn't hear anything.</span> <span id="s1261">It wasn't noisy at all, and the gas chambers were burning day and night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: So even in the barracks, it was quiet?</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: It was quiet.</span> <span id="s1264">Because, you know, you get to a point when you're so hungry, you have nothing to say to each other anymore.</span> <span id="s1265">When you're so desperate for food and so starved for love and for your family, there's very little to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">04:09:06 Absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s1267">At the end, we hardly talked to each other.</span> <span id="s1268">There was no spirit.</span> <span id="s1269">What does a young person do?</span> <span id="s1270">They talk about boyfriends.</span> <span id="s1271">And we had nothing to talk about.</span> <span id="s1272">There was nothing.</span> <span id="s1273">They had take the dignity and everything away from us.</span> <span id="s1274">There was absolutely nothing left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: In the beginning did you have conversations at night?</span> <span id="s1276">Did you learn about each other's lives when you met new people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: We always did.</span> <span id="s1278">Yeah, we always did.</span> <span id="s1279">They always told us what they did at home, and what their father and mother did and what a good life they had at home and we talked about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: Did anybody ever sing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: We had a sort of a Lagersong.</span> <span id="s1282">Yes, we did -- we didn't -- we heard the music, you know, when people marched in and out.</span> <span id="s1283">And yes, there was a song in Auschwitz, too.</span> <span id="s1284">But we really didn't sing much, no.</span> <span id="s1285">We didn't . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: Do you remember that song?</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">A: Yeah, I do.</span> <span id="s1288">Very vaguely, but I do.</span> <span id="s1289">Let me think….</span> <span id="s1290">It doesn't come to me at the moment, but I'll remember it maybe later on.</span> <span id="s1291">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">Q: What do you remember about the women's orchestra playing?</span> <span id="s1293">They played when you went out to work and when you came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">A: Viennese waltzes and things like that.</span> <span id="s1295">Good music, Beethoven and very good music, because the Nazi officers, the SS, liked good music so they played it for them.</span> <span id="s1296">And there musicians, girls, yes.</span> <span id="s1297">They had training, and sounded very good, very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: Was it helpful in some way?</span> <span id="s1299">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">A: It was horrible.</span> <span id="s1302">It was -- the gas chamber was here and the music was playing.</span> <span id="s1303">I mean, it was ironic, you know.</span> <span id="s1304">It was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">Q: Did you know that Zippy was in the orchestra?</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A: No, I didn't know that.</span> <span id="s1307">I think she played an instrument, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: Did you have relationships with non-Jewish prisoners, as well as Jewish prisoners?</span> <span id="s1309">Or were you in the barrack with only Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: Well, in the barrack in Auschwitz, I was with only Jews, but, I had, you know, Kapos, I got together with Gentiles, yes.</span> <span id="s1311">They were prisoners, too.</span> <span id="s1312">They were -- the one with the blue Winkel over the -- I can't think of the name now.</span> <span id="s1313">Bibelforscher-- they were Jehovah's Witnesses, right.</span> <span id="s1314">And there were the black Winkel that was the prostitutes.</span> <span id="s1315">The red Winkel was the politische -- the Communists and whatever.</span> <span id="s1316">So each and every one had a -- they weren't all Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">04:12:012</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">43 Camp (German) 44 Biblical scholar (German); term used to refer to Jehovah’s Witnesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">There were Polish Gentiles, and they were from all over.</span> <span id="s1320">All kinds of people that we dealt with, and you spoke to them, too, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Q: Do you remember any particular prisoners who.</span> <span id="s1322">Were . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">A: A Gentile prisoner?</span> <span id="s1324">Not really.</span> <span id="s1325">No.</span> <span id="s1326">Later on I remember Gypsies in the last camp.</span> <span id="s1327">Yes, I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">Because there were, -- that could read your hand, and -- do you want me to tell that story?</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: Why don't we -- well, no, go ahead, tell the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: Well, that was in the last camp.</span> <span id="s1331">We were just sitting there, and it was a Sunday, I suppose.</span> <span id="s1332">We didn't do anything, we were just sitting together.</span> <span id="s1333">The last camp I didn't work -- I worked in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1334">I was little waiter, and the Gypsies were sitting there.</span> <span id="s1335">And they kept saying to us, "Let me read your hand."</span> <span id="s1336">They were Hungarians.</span> <span id="s1337">"Let me read your hand."</span> <span id="s1338">And, you know, reading your hand, telling the fortune, is not done in the Jewish tradition.</span> <span id="s1339">We don't do that, but I figured, “What have I got to lose?”</span> <span id="s1340">And so I gave them my hand.</span> <span id="s1341">I said, "Go ahead and read it."</span> <span id="s1342">So she read my hand and she said -- other girls translated for me -- she said, "You're going to come of here, I want you to know, you're going to come out of here.</span> <span id="s1343">You're going to meet a young man, someone you knew already from early childhood and you'll marry him.</span> <span id="s1344">And you're going to have a son and a daughter."</span> <span id="s1345">And I said, "You word in God's ear."</span> <span id="s1346">I couldn't pay her, but that's all I could tell her.</span> <span id="s1347">So she said, "Okay, it's going to happen."</span> <span id="s1348">It did happen.</span> <span id="s1349">I don't know, it did happen.</span> <span id="s1350">It really did.</span> <span id="s1351">That was a very strange thing, but I never forget it.</span> <span id="s1352">I always remembered the Gypsy who gave me, told me her fortune -- my fortune.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">Q: Did you know about any underground work in Auschwitz or hear about resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">A: Well, yes, I did at one point.</span> <span id="s1355">That was at the first four weeks we were in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1356">There were two girls that were half Jewish, and they didn't want to go on.</span> <span id="s1357">They wanted us to bury them under, under the barracks, and we did.</span> <span id="s1358">We shoveled stuff over them, and they went underneath that.</span> <span id="s1359">And when it was time to go home, Taube-- Taube was the Aufzähler.</span> <span id="s1360">He counted us, and there were two missing.</span> <span id="s1361">And, my God, he put the dogs on us and everything.</span> <span id="s1362">He had the dogs shovel them out.</span> <span id="s1363">The dogs captured them and they shoveled them out.</span> <span id="s1364">They wanted to escape, go back to Germany.</span> <span id="s1365">That was about the only thing where I was a witness of -- I helped them shovel in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">04:15:02 I -- we kept saying, "Don't do that, don't do that."</span> <span id="s1367">They said, "Yes, yes, yes, yes."</span> <span id="s1368">So we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">45 Adolf Taube</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">46 Counter (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: And then what happened to those two girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">A: I don't recall what happened to them.</span> <span id="s1373">They certainly weren't treated very well, that's for sure.</span> <span id="s1374">What happened to them, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1375">It was in the beginning in 1943.</span> <span id="s1376">So, maybe they got to Auschwitz the first four weeks, so I really don't remember.</span> <span id="s1377">What happened to the girls.</span> <span id="s1378">That was a no-no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Q: Did they try to find those of you who helped, or do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">A: No.</span> <span id="s1381">Well, we had all kinds of things there.</span> <span id="s1382">They didn't give us any food for a day.</span> <span id="s1383">We shouldn't have done that.</span> <span id="s1384">All kinds, we were, we had punishment there.</span> <span id="s1385">All kinds of things, but nothing major happened.</span> <span id="s1386">Nothing major.</span> <span id="s1387">What happened to the girls, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1388">I really don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: So you were never beaten or were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: I have had the dogs put on me, yeah.</span> <span id="s1391">Beaten?</span> <span id="s1392">Beaten, I was like everybody else.</span> <span id="s1393">You know, you passed through there, and they took the whip and they just beat everybody who passed through.</span> <span id="s1394">But not me personally beaten.</span> <span id="s1395">If they felt like beating the people at the zählappells, they would beat.</span> <span id="s1396">They would just take a whip and beat.</span> <span id="s1397">But nothing that was sort, of like a morning prayer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">Q: Do you ever remember very short appells as very long ones?</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">A: No, I only remember the long appells.</span> <span id="s1400">There was never a short appell.</span> <span id="s1401">It could have rained, and it could have snowed.</span> <span id="s1402">It could have done anything.</span> <span id="s1403">They let us stand there until they were good and ready to come out and count us.</span> <span id="s1404">Because, I mean, the Kapo, or what they called the Stubenältestethe one of the barrack, they would put us together and we would stand there.</span> <span id="s1405">We had to wait for the SS person to come and count us again.</span> <span id="s1406">And they took their good old time.</span> <span id="s1407">Could be two hours in the rain, whatever.</span> <span id="s1408">Well, all they wanted us to do is die right then and there, so why hurry up?</span> <span id="s1409">That was the master plan.</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">Q: You know, in the men's camp, the men wore caps.</span> <span id="s1411">And whenever they saw as SS, they were supposed to take off their cap.</span> <span id="s1412">Were there any particular rules?</span> <span id="s1413">Did you have to stand a certain distance from the SS?</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">A: Not really, but when you spoke to them you had to address them in a certain manner.</span> <span id="s1415">Like, in the military, you know, because I had the experience later on talking to the Obersturmführerand otherwise, I never spoke to any of the SS, I really didn't.</span> <span id="s1416">SS women, yes, they were there, and we didn't talk much to them really, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">47 Room elder (German) 48 Lieutenant colonel (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">04:18:02</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">Q: Do you remember who you say, which SS women, other than . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A: Teresa.</span> <span id="s1421">Teresa.</span> <span id="s1422">Well, there were other women, but I don't remember their names in particular because I really had no dealings.</span> <span id="s1423">No dealings with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">Q: Did you have any occasion to go into Zippy's office in the barrack four.</span> <span id="s1425">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1426">I have been -- I've been in the politische, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: And what was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">A: It was -- if I remember correctly, there were desks that were sort of make-believe desks, and there were girls writing and doing whatever.</span> <span id="s1429">And Zippy forever walked around with her little charts and pencil and did whatever -- whatever she did, I don't really know, but I seen her always hanging out there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">Q: So you saw her a good deal?</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">A: I saw her, yeah.</span> <span id="s1432">Saw her quite often.</span> <span id="s1433">She was an all around person in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1434">She was very well liked, it seemed to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">Q: Well, tell me about that a little bit, because often people talk about the Slovakian girls in very negative terms.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">A: Yeah, I know.</span> <span id="s1437">Well, my opinion is that when I came to Auschwitz in 1943, the Slovakian girls had been there already for a year and a half, I believe.</span> <span id="s1438">They had lost everything.</span> <span id="s1439">Their sisters or brothers or whatever they had, they were already dead.</span> <span id="s1440">They were the pioneers of Auschwitz, and they were treated like dirt.</span> <span id="s1441">Like dirt.</span> <span id="s1442">So everybody was out to live, you know.</span> <span id="s1443">We all wanted to live, and we tried very hard to make the best of it.</span> <span id="s1444">So when the other so-called Zugangeinmates came into Auschwitz, they may have been harsh at times.</span> <span id="s1445">Yeah, I've seen that quite often.</span> <span id="s1446">Like I said before, when someone says, "Well, I don't get my hair cut because my husband is Aryan," and so on, they would say, "You're just as much of a Jew as I am.</span> <span id="s1447">Who do you think you are?"</span> <span id="s1448">They would get nasty with words, but never -- I mean, I have never experienced anything like hitting or kicking or something like that.</span> <span id="s1449">I've heard some people say that, but it was -- where I worked it wasn't like that.</span> <span id="s1450">As a matter of fact, the girls who worked with me in the sauna some of them are still alive and have been really very good to me.</span> <span id="s1451">They have called me.</span> <span id="s1452">They live in Israel.</span> <span id="s1453">And, as a matter of fact, one was here in America.</span> <span id="s1454">She's now a widow, and she came here and she asked me whether I was happy with my marriage and I said, "Yes, I am."</span> <span id="s1455">I said, "Why would you ask me?"</span> <span id="s1456">She says, "Because I have enough.</span> <span id="s1457">We could both live in Israel together because I would take you with 49 New comers (German) me."</span> <span id="s1458">I thought that was very, very nice.</span> <span id="s1459">I said, "No, thank you."</span> <span id="s1460">Q: So your relationship with the Slovakian girls was . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">A: I cannot say anything, -- I can only say that they survived their way.</span> <span id="s1462">04:21:07 Everybody survived their -- I can't say anything nasty about them really.</span> <span id="s1463">They were out to live and if something came across they didn't like, they would shout and they would maybe kick and maybe hit.</span> <span id="s1464">I personally haven't seen it, but I have heard from plenty of people who said they were nasty.</span> <span id="s1465">They weren't nice.</span> <span id="s1466">But look, I was not their kind; I was a German Jew, and maybe I was young, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1467">Maybe they felt I was a child, they were awfully nice to me.</span> <span id="s1468">That's all I can say.</span> <span id="s1469">And Zippy was exceptionally nice.</span> <span id="s1470">Very, very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: Did a lot of people know her in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: I think everybody knew her.</span> <span id="s1473">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1474">I asked some of my friends, "Did you know Zippy?"</span> <span id="s1475">"Oh, the dark-haired girl?</span> <span id="s1476">Sure, I knew her."</span> <span id="s1477">Of course, she was always around.</span> <span id="s1478">She was running around.</span> <span id="s1479">Everybody knew Zippy, mostly everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">Q: Tell me, you were talking about how close the girls were in your barrack.</span> <span id="s1481">Did you have a particular small -- you couldn't be close friends with 500 people in your barrack, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">Q: Did you each have small groups with you when you were close?</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1485">Mostly with the girls who worked together, we were close with one another.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">And we helped each other with food, you know, and some of the girls smoked, which I didn't do.</span> <span id="s1487">But somehow, somehow they got cigarettes into the camps.</span> <span id="s1488">How they got them, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1489">And it was a very close relationship with one another.</span> <span id="s1490">Everybody was trying to help one another without having a Schindler hanging on us, you know.</span> <span id="s1491">We did for each other whatever we could do to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">Q: Were there ever fights that developed between groups, or did people stick within their own group pretty much?</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">A: You mean . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: Arguments with . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">A: Slovaks with them and Polish with them?</span> <span id="s1496">I didn't see it, no.</span> <span id="s1497">I seen two sisters fighting with one another, and that was my first experience with the Yiddish language.</span> <span id="s1498">And I couldn't believe it, like, they were very good with each other.</span> <span id="s1499">They were really very sweet people.</span> <span id="s1500">They were beauticians, and one said to the other, "You, you zolst vaksen vi a tsibele mit kop in der erd.</span> <span id="s1501">"Which I translated that in German.</span> <span id="s1502">I was horrified, that's when I learned to speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1503">That means, “You should grow an onion with your head in the earth.”</span> <span id="s1504">Oh, my God.</span> <span id="s1505">That was a curse if you ever heard one.</span> <span id="s1506">So I spoke to her and I said, "Why would you say that?"</span> <span id="s1507">“Because she did such stupid things.”</span> <span id="s1508">I don't know what she did, but there were two sisters, so it couldn't have been all that bad.</span> <span id="s1509">But things like that came up, you know, where two sisters would fight with one another.</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">04:24:04 We were only human, you know, no matter what the situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">Q: Do you remember men prisoners coming into the camp and working?</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A: Yeah, there were men coming in, right, but not too many.</span> <span id="s1513">There were people coming in.</span> <span id="s1514">, we didn't have that much of a connection with the men.</span> <span id="s1515">Some girls had more than others, but, I met a very nice person who later on helped me with lots of things.</span> <span id="s1516">And, -- but there was not what you call a love affair going on in Auschwitz, but men were in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">Q: Did he help you in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">A: He helped insofar if I tell the story now, you know.</span> <span id="s1519">When the transports from Lódz came into Auschwitz, I thought -- that was in June -- no, that was in August 1944, I thought that my parents would be still alive.</span> <span id="s1520">And I said to myself, “Nothing can happen to me anymore.</span> <span id="s1521">If I see the Obersturmführer” -- and I forgot his name – “I would go to him and I'll ask him if he can bring my parents into the camp, provided they are still living.”</span> <span id="s1522">So as I walked on the street in Auschwitz, I see this Obersturmführer walking, and I went over to him.</span> <span id="s1523">And then -- we were talking about how do you address an officer -- I went over to him, clicked my heels, and said, "Herr Obersturmführer, sieben und dreising vier acht und sechzig, meldet sich."</span> <span id="s1524">Which means "37468 makes herself known."</span> <span id="s1525">He says, "What do you want?"</span> <span id="s1526">with a very stern voice.</span> <span id="s1527">And he said, "And how come you speak German?"</span> <span id="s1528">I said, "I'm from Frankfurt," which I really wasn't, but Nieder-ohmen, nobody would have ever known.</span> <span id="s1529">I said, "Well, I was born in Germany, and I wanted to ask you something.</span> <span id="s1530">Do you go to the ramp to get the people from the Lódzer ghetto?"</span> <span id="s1531">He said, "Yah, yah."</span> <span id="s1532">“Yes,” he says, "why would that interest you?"</span> <span id="s1533">I said, "Because my parents have been in the Lódzer ghetto since 1941, and since the transports are coming now into Auschwitz, I would like to ask you if it's okay with you, sir, to bring my parents into the camp.</span> <span id="s1534">I'm here two years, and if that's possible, please do that."</span> <span id="s1535">So he looked at me like I was nuts, like chutzpa of a young girl.</span> <span id="s1536">And he said, "Your parents, where are they?"</span> <span id="s1537">50 …should grow like an onion with your head in the ground (Yiddish).</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">51 Mr. Lieutenant Colonel, 37468 reporting (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">04:27:01 I said, "Well, in Litzmannstadt."</span> <span id="s1540">He said, "Well, no, you can't go.</span> <span id="s1541">But if you know of a man who can -- if you know of a man, he can go."</span> <span id="s1542">So I knew this man by the name of Bumeck Stern, same name as mine.</span> <span id="s1543">And I knew him, and I said, "Yes, I do, and if the officer allows me to, I will get him."</span> <span id="s1544">And he took this young man to the ramp and this Bumak called out the names of my parents and my sister, and they weren't there anymore.</span> <span id="s1545">There was no, no response.</span> <span id="s1546">So he came back into the camp.</span> <span id="s1547">Occasionally, he would come into the camp.</span> <span id="s1548">He wasn't in my camp, you know, and he said, "There was no response.</span> <span id="s1549">I don't think your sister, nor your parents are alive."</span> <span id="s1550">So I had to deal with that, I figured “that's it.”</span> <span id="s1551">And then transports still came in . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">Q: We have to change the tape.</span> <span id="s1553">I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s1554">So we'll start right there.</span> <span id="s1555">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">04:28:07 End of Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">Tape #5</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">05:01:04</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">A: You know, he was the Obersturmführer who was killed together with Grese.When I see him together on the movies once, I recognized him.</span> <span id="s1560">I don't recall.</span> <span id="s1561">Zippy would know his name.</span> <span id="s1562">Kramer,I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">Q: Kramer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">A: Kramer, I thought.</span> <span id="s1565">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1566">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s1567">So Mr. Stern doesn't find . . . A: My parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">Q: . . . your parents or your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">A: Doesn't find anybody.</span> <span id="s1570">But I -- are we on?</span> <span id="s1571">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">A: I, I, didn't give up.</span> <span id="s1573">I thought maybe the next transport.</span> <span id="s1574">We didn't go to every transport, maybe the next transport.</span> <span id="s1575">So I, I didn't give up.</span> <span id="s1576">And in July -- in August 1944, another big transport came from Lódz, Litzmannstadt and I walked through the sauna thinking that if my mother -- my father wouldn't have been there anyway -- and my sister would be there, I would just see them.</span> <span id="s1577">My mother at that time was still a young woman.</span> <span id="s1578">Maybe she was 41, 42 years old, and she was tiny.</span> <span id="s1579">She looked tiny.</span> <span id="s1580">And I walked through the aisles where people the came in and their head -- their hair was already shaven, I think so.</span> <span id="s1581">They already had -- no, they didn't have a number on their arm yet.</span> <span id="s1582">They were about to be bathed or whatever, showered.</span> <span id="s1583">And as I walked through the rows, through the aisle there, I hear a tiny voice say, "Carola."</span> <span id="s1584">And I turned around.</span> <span id="s1585">It was my sister.</span> <span id="s1586">And the reason she recognized me, it's a very interesting story.</span> <span id="s1587">When I as a child, I had a way of bending my arm completely back, and I walked like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">05:03:05 She knows, I really don't know.</span> <span id="s1589">She seen a woman walking, a girl walking with the arm like that, and she said to her -- a girl was standing next to her, "This is my sister."</span> <span id="s1590">She says, "What are you talking about?</span> <span id="s1591">This couldn't be your sister."</span> <span id="s1592">"I noticed the arm," she said.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">And, and when I turned around after she called, "Carola," it was my sister.</span> <span id="s1594">And we hugged</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">52 Irma Grese</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">53 Josef Kramer and I wanted to know what happened to my parents, and she said they were all dead.</span> <span id="s1597">And that's where Grese was, Grese, “the Beast of Bergen-Belsen.”</span> <span id="s1598">She witnessed this thing, she seen me speaking to my sister and hugging my sister.</span> <span id="s1599">And she stood there and cried.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">Something nobody had ever seen before, and then she said to me, "Carola," she heard my sister call "Carola"; otherwise, she wouldn't have known.</span> <span id="s1601">She said, "You don't have to worry.</span> <span id="s1602">Your sister is going to stay with you now."</span> <span id="s1603">And we hugged again, at least we are together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">And whatever happens, we are together.</span> <span id="s1605">And she said, "Okay, there is nothing to worry about.</span> <span id="s1606">Your sister is going to be with you."</span> <span id="s1607">So I was trying to hold on to my sister, but she had to go through all kinds of different routines.</span> <span id="s1608">Having, being tattooed.</span> <span id="s1609">She was tattooed on the inside because I felt that she didn't have to have -- in case she would survive, she has a tiny little tattoo.</span> <span id="s1610">And I thought we would be together, but it was just a false promise.</span> <span id="s1611">They sent her to a different camp, and I didn't know where she went.</span> <span id="s1612">And once in a while, one of my friends who went around -- my friend, Claire,, one of the Frankfurt girls, she would go to the camp where she was in.</span> <span id="s1613">And she would come back, and she says, "Your sister is still alive.</span> <span id="s1614">Your sister is still alive."</span> <span id="s1615">She was in a different camp, and, I would hear from her once in a while.</span> <span id="s1616">"Not to worry, I'm still living."</span> <span id="s1617">And I had hoped that maybe, you know, maybe the Russians would come and we would, we would be free again, and we would get together.</span> <span id="s1618">But there was little hope, very little hope that we would be together.</span> <span id="s1619">So it went on,, the march that was in 1944 in, in August.</span> <span id="s1620">1945 in January, the big march from Auschwitz started, and I didn't know where my sister was.</span> <span id="s1621">I didn't know what was happening.</span> <span id="s1622">She was already so tiny and so skinny, I was afraid that she, she would be killed.</span> <span id="s1623">She would have been killed already then.</span> <span id="s1624">So we marched out of Auschwitz day and night, and late night and day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">05:06:03 And we were in cattle cars and we went to Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s1626">And in Ravensbrück we stayed four weeks, and I had no -- no sight of my sister.</span> <span id="s1627">I didn't know where she was.</span> <span id="s1628">We marched out of Ravensbrück, and from Ravensbrück we went supposedly to Malchow.</span> <span id="s1629">We did go to Malchow, there was another march from Ravensbrück to Malchow day and night, day and night.</span> <span id="s1630">And I was already so weak, and we all were.</span> <span id="s1631">One helped me on one side, the other on the other side, and we slept walking.</span> <span id="s1632">And that's how we went on, and whoever didn't do it lay down and they shot them.</span> <span id="s1633">They didn't give them any chance; they shot the girls just right then and there.</span> <span id="s1634">So at one point I had to go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s1635">I didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s1636">And I went out of my line and there was no bathroom, but there was barn.</span> <span id="s1637">So I went into the barn.</span> <span id="s1638">I said to the girls, "I have to go to the bathroom, it's impossible."</span> <span id="s1639">I went to the barn, I walked into barn.</span> <span id="s1640">My sister walked out of the barn.</span> <span id="s1641">And so I said, "Now, you're not going to be out of my sight anymore.</span> <span id="s1642">You're going to be with me."</span> <span id="s1643">And we did cling to each and she walked with me.</span> <span id="s1644">And everybody thought she was my little sister because she's small.</span> <span id="s1645">And we stayed together from that day on ‘til we were in Malchow, we stayed together.</span> <span id="s1646">We were never separated anymore.</span> <span id="s1647">So that was one good thing that I had to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s1648">That was a very unusual incident.</span> <span id="s1649">So from the march on, we marched into Malchow.</span> <span id="s1650">That was the camp where we hardly got any salt in anything.</span> <span id="s1651">But I had a chance to work in their kitchen, and in the kitchen what I did there is I did heat the kettles the to make the fire underneath, you know.</span> <span id="s1652">So what we really -- what the girls cooked there was water, potato peels, and a little bit of farina.</span> <span id="s1653">Not farina, oatmeal.</span> <span id="s1654">And that made sort of a soup, but it was better than nothing.</span> <span id="s1655">So at least I had a little soup I could give my sister and my friends, Claire, who was with me and Martha.</span> <span id="s1656">Two of the girls from Frankfurt survived with me.</span> <span id="s1657">We were together, and I had a chance to give them a little extra soup.</span> <span id="s1658">I added a little hot water and it was good.</span> <span id="s1659">But we got thinner and thinner every day because they took away the salt.</span> <span id="s1660">But that's where we laid around, and that's where we talked to the Gypsies and we talked about food and talked about better times which we felt we will never see.</span> <span id="s1661">And across from us was a camp with English prisoners, and they looked just as bad as we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">05:09:06 It was just across from the camp we were in.</span> <span id="s1663">They were also laying around, like, you know, like, like dead animals.</span> <span id="s1664">You know, when you go to a zoo and sometimes and those animals look like tranquilized, that's what we all looked like.</span> <span id="s1665">We were just either waiting to die or being liberated.</span> <span id="s1666">Something had to happen to us, we couldn't go on anymore.</span> <span id="s1667">And then that was in February, and we talked about that maybe we're getting liberated.</span> <span id="s1668">Maybe the Russians were coming closer, but we had no newspaper.</span> <span id="s1669">Nobody knew anything.</span> <span id="s1670">All of a sudden at the beginning of May, the Nazis, the SS came running in and they kept screaming, "Get out of here you dirty Jews.</span> <span id="s1671">Get out of here.</span> <span id="s1672">Let's go.</span> <span id="s1673">Walk."</span> <span id="s1674">Now, we figured “where are we walking now?</span> <span id="s1675">“ We could hardly move anymore.</span> <span id="s1676">They walked us into the woods.</span> <span id="s1677">We were so sure that in the woods they were going to shoot us.</span> <span id="s1678">Because it was coming closer, the war was getting -- coming to an end, we felt.</span> <span id="s1679">And why in the woods?</span> <span id="s1680">So they marched us into the woods, and all of a sudden in the woods -- it was, I think it was May the 3rd, or was it -- maybe it was a different -- maybe May the 8th.</span> <span id="s1681">I think it was May the 3rd.</span> <span id="s1682">They all disappeared, there were no Nazi uniforms.</span> <span id="s1683">They were either they had their private uniform, their clothes in a package.</span> <span id="s1684">The SS men disappeared; there were none.</span> <span id="s1685">And all of a sudden we see a tank with three young American soldiers screaming from the top of their lungs, "You guys are free.</span> <span id="s1686">Hitler is dead.</span> <span id="s1687">You're free, you're free."</span> <span id="s1688">And they had -- I remember they had chocolate.</span> <span id="s1689">There was a quite a few of us.</span> <span id="s1690">They had chocolate and cigarettes, and they threw it out of the tank, and they threw it down for us.</span> <span id="s1691">It wasn't enough for all of us, and we -- my sister looked at me and said, "Did you hear that?</span> <span id="s1692">We're free."</span> <span id="s1693">I said, "Yes, but where are we going to be?"</span> <span id="s1694">We were free, we were happy, but no place to go.</span> <span id="s1695">But, we had more than other people because we had each other.</span> <span id="s1696">So while we were sitting around in the woods, we all got together and, “We got to do something.</span> <span id="s1697">Where are we going?</span> <span id="s1698">We're not going to go back to Germany.”</span> <span id="s1699">So one of the girls, Slovak girls, said, "I lost two sisters in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1700">I'm not going home alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">05:12:00 You two girls are going with me."</span> <span id="s1702">So we traveled from Malchow to Czechoslovakia, my sister and I. And we came there, and to our surprise her parents were still there.</span> <span id="s1703">Her little brother was there, and they greeted us with open arms.</span> <span id="s1704">For the first time we seen parents again and people who were good to us.</span> <span id="s1705">Gave us clothes, gave us food, and it was like such a relief.</span> <span id="s1706">It was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1707">We stayed there four weeks, and they fed us.</span> <span id="s1708">And, of course, we had only one wish, to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s1709">So no matter they did, my sister and I looked at each other and I, I remember my father, my mother had told me that I should remember an address in New York City.</span> <span id="s1710">It was “648 184th Street in New York City;” that was my aunt's address.</span> <span id="s1711">And I said to my sister, "You know, I know Tante Anna's address."</span> <span id="s1712">And she said, "No, you don't."</span> <span id="s1713">I said, "Yes, I do."</span> <span id="s1714">I said, "If I get only to that address, then we'll be fine."</span> <span id="s1715">Well, there no one -- you know, you couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s1716">I mean, we went in the nighttime, early in the morning we went over the border from Czechoslovakia to Austria.</span> <span id="s1717">And the border was like a train -- what do you call the train, what the train goes on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">Q: Train track?</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">A: A train track.</span> <span id="s1720">And on one side the Russians stood, and they wanted to shoot when they seen two little girls, two young girls coming there.</span> <span id="s1721">So I said to them -- I knew a little bit Russian, I said I was a Gypsy and I looked like one.</span> <span id="s1722">My hair had grown by then, and it was long and a comb I didn't have.</span> <span id="s1723">And I said I was Gypsy -- and it was pitch black because I was a blonde before.</span> <span id="s1724">"My father lives in Austria, and we want to go to Austria."</span> <span id="s1725">Would they let us through?</span> <span id="s1726">They said no, they had to shoot us.</span> <span id="s1727">And we said, "No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1728">We can't be shot.</span> <span id="s1729">We have to get through here and just close your eyes.</span> <span id="s1730">Turn around.</span> <span id="s1731">Let us go."</span> <span id="s1732">So they said, "Okay, close your eyes."</span> <span id="s1733">And we closed our eyes.</span> <span id="s1734">"Go right through, but when you get over the border there will be the Americans.</span> <span id="s1735">They're going to be shooting at you."</span> <span id="s1736">Well, there was no American shooting at us.</span> <span id="s1737">The Americans were fast asleep, it was five o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s1738">And we got into Austria.</span> <span id="s1739">Once we were in Austria, we went to the train station.</span> <span id="s1740">We figured that was the right thing to do.</span> <span id="s1741">And there we seen other survivors.</span> <span id="s1742">Why would we know that they're survivors?</span> <span id="s1743">They looked like us.</span> <span id="s1744">They had not much clothes, and they said to us, "You, you must be" -- at that time they were called “KZ’ler,” “concentration camp," you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">05:15:02 And we said, "Yes, we are."</span> <span id="s1746">And they said, "We'll take you to a DP camp."</span> <span id="s1747">So they took us to a DP camp, and we lived in Austria until we were ready to come to America, in Gmunden, in Kammer-Schörfling.</span> <span id="s1748">And through the help of the American soldiers which we met in Austria, they were stationed in Austria, we wrote to my aunt.</span> <span id="s1749">And my aunt got the letter, and she was overwhelmed that we were alive, but, of course, everyone else had died.</span> <span id="s1750">My grandparents and whatever.</span> <span id="s1751">And she sent us food and she sent us clothing, and we were saved.</span> <span id="s1752">We came to America in 1946 in July.</span> <span id="s1753">It was a year and three months after the liberation, which was good.</span> <span id="s1754">That’s where -- and after I was here for a little while, my aunt thought it would be wise to put it in the newspaper.</span> <span id="s1755">Tell everybody that we are alive, but there was like the German Jewish newspaper called the AufbauShe, she put it in there, and my husband read it and he came to visit me.</span> <span id="s1756">And that's when we later on got married.</span> <span id="s1757">So the 54 Konzentrationslager [concentration camp] (German) 55 Reconstruction (German); popular periodical of the German-Jewish community in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">Gypsy was right, I married the guy I knew from way back when, and I had a son and a daughter.</span> <span id="s1759">And now I have five grandchildren, and I have a lovely daughter-in-law and a lovely son-in-law.</span> <span id="s1760">And I have my own family, thank God.</span> <span id="s1761">That's something I never would have dreamt of, something I thought it would never, so I marched into Auschwitz and I was one of the lucky ones who marched out.</span> <span id="s1762">Not many did.</span> <span id="s1763">... Now, my friend, Martha, survived, and she lives here partly.</span> <span id="s1764">And the other one lives in Queens, and Zippy lives in Manhattan.</span> <span id="s1765">And I have the two other friends in Israel, and that's about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">Q: So you maintained Lagerschwesters?</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">A: Yes, we do.</span> <span id="s1768">We call each other once every so often.</span> <span id="s1769">Now, distances are pretty far, but we do speak to one another.</span> <span id="s1770">We call each other and we try to keep up the friendship.</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">Q: Are those some of your closest friendships, the ones with the people you were in Auschwitz -- with whom you were in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1773">They are my closest friends.</span> <span id="s1774">You know, like you said “Lagerschwesters” -- besides my sister, Martha is like a sister to me, Claire is like a sister to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">05:18:06 We, we don't see each other all that often, but we call each other and we get together to weddings and Bar Mitzvahs, whatever is to celebrate.</span> <span id="s1776">We, we kept that friendship.</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">Q: Do you talk about Auschwitz very much with each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">A: Not really, no.</span> <span id="s1779">We really don't.</span> <span id="s1780">Once in a while, if someone asks us, we bring up the subject but, we try not to.</span> <span id="s1781">But I remember one incident I had and this was also friend who worked in the sauna with me, a Czechoslovakian girl.</span> <span id="s1782">We had a bakery in Washington Heights, and she came in one day.</span> <span id="s1783">And she didn't know me, but I recognized her.</span> <span id="s1784">And she asked me for a loaf of bread, and I looked at her, and I said, "Bözsi" So she said to me, "Could I have a loaf of bread, please?"</span> <span id="s1785">And I said, " Bözsi, you can have all the bread in the world.</span> <span id="s1786">I have all the bread you want."</span> <span id="s1787">And she looked at me, and she said, "Am I supposed to know you?"</span> <span id="s1788">And I said, "Yes, you know me quite well.</span> <span id="s1789">I'm Carola."</span> <span id="s1790">And she says, "Really?</span> <span id="s1791">I can have all that bread?"</span> <span id="s1792">That's something we only wanted, one loaf of bread and call it our own.</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">Q: Could we take a break?</span> <span id="s1794">You decided to leave Czechoslovakia in spite of this warm and loving family because you really wanted to get to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">Q: When you came to the DP camp, what was it like there?</span> <span id="s1797">I mean, did they give you help with 56 Camp sisters (German) things, other than with the letter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">A: No, they gave us help.</span> <span id="s1799">As a matter of fact, we got a uniform because we didn't have decent clothes really.</span> <span id="s1800">We got a uniform like the American soldiers and on it here, it had the sign DP, displaced persons.</span> <span id="s1801">So we, we -- the Germans thought we were Americans, I guess, except we didn't speak the language.</span> <span id="s1802">We were well taken care of there.</span> <span id="s1803">They gave us food and everything.</span> <span id="s1804">And, of course, we made connections.</span> <span id="s1805">We met one soldier who came from Chicago who was originally from Germany, and he had been in the army.</span> <span id="s1806">A very -- one very interesting story, I forgot to tell you that.</span> <span id="s1807">And we were sitting in the -- what is it?</span> <span id="s1808">They called the clubs PX, PX clubs, right?</span> <span id="s1809">We were sitting there in the nightclub in Austria with this particular young man.</span> <span id="s1810">I had met him in the synagogue on a Friday night, and he said that I was the first German Jew he had met.</span> <span id="s1811">All were Polish Jews, and where did I come from.</span> <span id="s1812">So I told him and we talked to each other, and he said he will get in touch with my relatives and tell them that I'm living, my sister and me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">05:21:05 Which was very nice, and he offered to take us, my sister and me, to the club and there you could have something to eat and something to drink.</span> <span id="s1814">And you could dance a little bit, and something we didn't have in years.</span> <span id="s1815">And all of a sudden I'm sitting in the club, and I see this soldier sitting there.</span> <span id="s1816">And I look at this young soldier I was with and I said, "You know, I know this guy."</span> <span id="s1817">So he looked – he says, "Where would you know this guy from?"</span> <span id="s1818">I said, "That soldier went to school with me in Germany in Bad Nauheim."</span> <span id="s1819">He says, "Are you kidding me?"</span> <span id="s1820">“Okay,” he says, "I'll ask him."</span> <span id="s1821">So he's sitting there and he calls, you know, he says to him, "Hey, listen, listen."</span> <span id="s1822">And I said to him, "But his name isn't ‘Listen.’</span> <span id="s1823">His name is Max Bettman."</span> <span id="s1824">So he said -- I didn't know the language that well.</span> <span id="s1825">So he said, "Is your name Max Bettman?"</span> <span id="s1826">And he said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s1827">And he said, "Do you know this lady?"</span> <span id="s1828">And he looked at me and said, "No."</span> <span id="s1829">I looked at him and I says, "I'm Carola," and he says, "Oh, no."</span> <span id="s1830">He couldn't believe it, that he went to school with me, and his father was the principal of the school.</span> <span id="s1831">And he also helped to bring us to the United States, his father, yeah.</span> <span id="s1832">And only about three years ago we had a reunion where I invited all the kids who survived from Bad Nauheim, and he was there, Max Bettman.</span> <span id="s1833">He didn't remember that I said, "This is Max Bettman," he didn't, you know.</span> <span id="s1834">He had forgotten.</span> <span id="s1835">But I, the funniest part was that when I said, "Don't call him Listen.</span> <span id="s1836">His name is Max Bettman."</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">Q: What did you do during the days?</span> <span id="s1838">Was there vocational training?</span> <span id="s1839">Did they teach you English--?</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">A: After the war?</span> <span id="s1841">After -- in Austria?</span> <span id="s1842">Q: In the DP camp, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">A: Yeah, I did work -- since my first love always has been nursing, and I had a little training in Germany in Berlin, while I was in camp I had been sick quite often.</span> <span id="s1844">And while I was in the Berlin and I had an ear infection, they always kept me a little longer in the hospital because they knew that my first love was nursing.</span> <span id="s1845">So I stayed there and took the temperatures of people and they gave me uniform, whatever.</span> <span id="s1846">And, when I was liberated, I worked in an Army, American Army hospital for a little while.</span> <span id="s1847">Not for too long, but for a few days.</span> <span id="s1848">I just wanted to -- it was hard because I didn't speak the language, and they kept calling me “Fräulein,’ and I didn't want to be called “Fräulein.”</span> <span id="s1849">That's all the Americans knew, they, you know, heard by one thing or the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">05:24:02 But, I could take temperatures then, too, and pulse, then take the blood pressure and that was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">Q: And what was your sister doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">A: My sister also worked a little bit.</span> <span id="s1853">Yeah, she, she met an American soldier, and I think what she did -- he was a dentist.</span> <span id="s1854">She worked a little bit in a dental office or something.</span> <span id="s1855">If I'm not mistaken, I think that's what she did.</span> <span id="s1856">But for a little while because we only stayed there a year and went to America.</span> <span id="s1857">So we weren't too long in Austria, but we recuperated.</span> <span id="s1858">And Austria is a beautiful country, really nice, and we regained our strength and it was good.</span> <span id="s1859">It was nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">Q: How long did it take you to regain you to regain your physical strength, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">A: Maybe two, three months.</span> <span id="s1862">You know, because we were young.</span> <span id="s1863">You know, we were 20; 19, 20, whatever.</span> <span id="s1864">We were pretty young, so it doesn't take too long.</span> <span id="s1865">We got food.</span> <span id="s1866">It took us a while to adjust.</span> <span id="s1867">I remember I was quite sick.</span> <span id="s1868">Something went wrong with my intestines, I had very often terrible cramps.</span> <span id="s1869">Because you had to really get used to food again; we had no food whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1870">And if you ate anything fatty, the gallbladder acted up, so it was quite hectic for me to get used to.</span> <span id="s1871">But the minute I sat my foot on an American boat to come to America, I never had another attack of pain.</span> <span id="s1872">It may be psychological.</span> <span id="s1873">The minute I entered -- on the boat, everybody was sick.</span> <span id="s1874">Everybody was throwing up, that was a natural thing.</span> <span id="s1875">But I never had another gallbladder attack.</span> <span id="s1876">And I was examined in Austria.</span> <span id="s1877">For the gallbladder had bent, or was out of shape, or something like that.</span> <span id="s1878">So somehow I felt I was safe, on safe ground, in coming to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">Q: Did you find it difficult to be in Austria at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">A: I didn't find it difficult.</span> <span id="s1881">The only difficulty I had, I remember going to the movies with the American soldiers, and I heard a woman say, “Die Juden machen sich wieder."</span> <span id="s1882">“The Jews make themselves known again."</span> <span id="s1883">You know, that was my experience in Austria, so that was right after the war.</span> <span id="s1884">There was people who were very antisemitic.</span> <span id="s1885">I'm sure today it wouldn't 57 The Jews are making themselves again (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">be like that anymore, but at that time they noticed -- well, it wasn't written all over us that we were Jews, but, they recognized it.</span> <span id="s1887">Somehow they recognized this.</span> <span id="s1888">It was so instilled in them to get rid of the Jews that they had no other way but act up on it.</span> <span id="s1889">Not to look at the Jews and destroy them any which way.</span> <span id="s1890">We were like, like vermin, no-good people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">Q: Did you date when you were in the DP camp?</span> <span id="s1892">Did you meet . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">A: Did I date in the DP camp?</span> <span id="s1894">, yes, I did.</span> <span id="s1895">I think I did.</span> <span id="s1896">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1897">I had met my friend again, Bumak.</span> <span id="s1898">He came to the -- he was in -- I don't remember where he was.</span> <span id="s1899">He came and I visited.</span> <span id="s1900">He visited a few times, and well, there were young American soldiers and there was a little dating going on.</span> <span id="s1901">Most of the girls found their husband right then and there, you know.</span> <span id="s1902">Got married with them.</span> <span id="s1903">I didn't, I wanted to go to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">Q: Let's take a break and change the tape.</span> <span id="s1905">05:27:49 End of Tape #5</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">Tape #6</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">06:01:04</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1909">Where were we?</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">Q: We were -- you obeyed the prediction of the Gypsy and you got married.</span> <span id="s1911">What year did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">A: 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">Q: So when did you meet your husband?</span> <span id="s1914">Soon after, within a few . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">A: '46.</span> <span id="s1916">Right.</span> <span id="s1917">He came to visit.</span> <span id="s1918">And well, he had been a friend of mine in at school in Bad Nauheim, but we didn't want to get married.</span> <span id="s1919">I mean we were just good friends, and thing were very lonely for me when I came to America, you know.</span> <span id="s1920">He had been in the Army and he spoke the language, and I sort of spoke it okay.</span> <span id="s1921">And he was very good, and he -- I had told him my whole story.</span> <span id="s1922">He always wanted to know more and more.</span> <span id="s1923">He was very warm because in the beginning it was very hard for me.</span> <span id="s1924">First of all, I didn't know the language too well.</span> <span id="s1925">Second of all, when you rode in the subway and it was in the summertime and you were exposed, a number of people would walk away from you and say, "What in the world is that?</span> <span id="s1926">She has a number on her arm."</span> <span id="s1927">There weren't too many of us at that time in 1946, and I felt very isolated, very lonely.</span> <span id="s1928">And if you wanted to tell actually what happened to you, people used to say, "Don't tell me that.</span> <span id="s1929">I won't sleep tonight.</span> <span id="s1930">I don't want to hear your story."</span> <span id="s1931">I mean I didn't tell people on subways, but my own relatives -- they were awfully nice to me, they were really good.</span> <span id="s1932">But they didn't want to hear our stories because they were getting on in years, and they didn't really want to be bothered.</span> <span id="s1933">My aunt, I told the story, and then, “It's enough.</span> <span id="s1934">I won't sleep tonight.”</span> <span id="s1935">So, therefore, no one did anything.</span> <span id="s1936">Of course, we were not American citizens.</span> <span id="s1937">We couldn't afford a psychiatrist or anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">06:03:01 We were just -- we were just people who had to get into the mainstream of life, you know, and we tried very hard.</span> <span id="s1939">We didn't -- German wasn't spoken in America because the war had ended.</span> <span id="s1940">If you spoke German, they looked at you like you were a Nazi.</span> <span id="s1941">So we had to speak the language which was good, I suppose.</span> <span id="s1942">And we got together with our own people, people who were in camps.</span> <span id="s1943">And very often I heard from people who had come here previously, I heard them say, "Well, these people who were in camps, they behave awfully strange."</span> <span id="s1944">And I'm a sensitive person, I didn't like to hear that.</span> <span id="s1945">We did behave awfully strange, but nobody took in consideration what we had actually gone through.</span> <span id="s1946">So it got to a point where we sort of separated ourselves from everyone, and we said -- we got together on social occasions, only the survivors, the ones who survived.</span> <span id="s1947">But we went to work and we started a new life, and we got into the mainstream.</span> <span id="s1948">And I went, -- I knew how to sew which I had learned in Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s1949">I went into the factory and I made piecework, worked in a blouse factory.</span> <span id="s1950">And it was in 1946, 7, I made $80 a week, which was a fortune.</span> <span id="s1951">And everyone around me hated me because at that time we were piece -- they were pieceworkers, and if you worked too fast you ruined the prices for the other people.</span> <span id="s1952">I didn't know that.</span> <span id="s1953">I did it as fast as I could because I wanted to make money in the worst way.</span> <span id="s1954">So that was pretty tough, but I made it.</span> <span id="s1955">I mean I had an average of $60, which was pretty nice in 1946 and seven when really people didn't make too much money.</span> <span id="s1956">And then I paid the money to my uncle and aunt who let me stay there.</span> <span id="s1957">You know, and my aunt cooked for me, and I lived there.</span> <span id="s1958">And it was very cozy and very nice, and then my husband would come and take me out for dinner.</span> <span id="s1959">My husband, he wasn't -- he was just a boyfriend -- would take me to the movies and things like that.</span> <span id="s1960">And from then on, life got a lot easier for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">Q: Did you go to school at all?</span> <span id="s1962">Were you able to?</span> <span id="s1963">A: After the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">A: I didn't really.</span> <span id="s1966">The only schooling I had was going to a parent's class when I pregnant with my son to learn how to be a mother.</span> <span id="s1967">That was also not easy.</span> <span id="s1968">You see, when you're young and you don't have a mother and don't have a father, and people sort of -- you had to do it all on your own.</span> <span id="s1969">But we did it, we really worked hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">06:06:01 We helped one another.</span> <span id="s1971">“You do it this way, I do it that way.</span> <span id="s1972">You bathe the baby.”</span> <span id="s1973">I took the mother's class -- yeah, that was the only schooling I had because I had to make a living; I had to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">Q: Were you -- of the two sisters, did you get pregnant first?</span> <span id="s1975">Or did your sister get pregnant?</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">A: My sister got pregnant and she lost the first baby.</span> <span id="s1977">I was really the one who had the first.</span> <span id="s1978">My son was the firstborn.</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">Q: And she helped you, as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">A: My sister lived in Baltimore, so she couldn't really help too much.</span> <span id="s1981">They separated us, which we didn't really like.</span> <span id="s1982">But my sister went to college again in business college in Baltimore.</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">Some other relatives of ours lived in Baltimore, and so she stayed there and she met her husband there.</span> <span id="s1984">So it was all for the better.</span> <span id="s1985">She had hers in Baltimore, and she still lives in Baltimore again.</span> <span id="s1986">She ended up in Baltimore.</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">Q: Tell me something, Carola.</span> <span id="s1988">You lived under the Nazis from the age of eight to the age of 20.</span> <span id="s1989">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">Q: I don't know if it's the most formative years, but it certainly is an enormously significant part of your life.</span> <span id="s1991">How do you understand your adjustment?</span> <span id="s1992">Your coming back to life after all of this happening to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">A: You know, there is such a thing, I guess it's called a “survivor.”</span> <span id="s1994">You just do it, you know.</span> <span id="s1995">You don't think about, you just do it.</span> <span id="s1996">We had, we had such a strong will to survive in the camps.</span> <span id="s1997">When we -- once we were liberated, it was a piece of cake, you know, and you don't think about it too much.</span> <span id="s1998">You just go ahead and do it.</span> <span id="s1999">Don't talk about it and do it.</span> <span id="s2000">But when I think back now -- I'm an old lady, and I think back at the time, the hard times we had, I sometimes don't understand how I survived it and how I did it.</span> <span id="s2001">And how I -- later on we had the bakery and I worked there, and it was all completely strange to me, bakery and whatever, but I did it.</span> <span id="s2002">And whatever I did, thank God, I was pretty good at it, so they tell me.</span> <span id="s2003">So, at least I know some through college, and my daughter or whatever, it was hard work to do all that.</span> <span id="s2004">And we wanted -- they denied us a free education in Germany.</span> <span id="s2005">Maybe I could have gone to nursing school, but I didn't have the means and have the money, and so I didn't.</span> <span id="s2006">But I wanted my children to have the education that everyone deserved, so we worked, both my husband and I, we worked very hard to get our son through law school and the whole thing, you know.</span> <span id="s2007">So you just, I would say, get up and do it.</span> <span id="s2008">Don't think back what has happened, don't have pity.</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">06:09:01 Don't look, look in the past, look in future.</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">Q: Is that what you learned from all this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">A: That's what I learned from it.</span> <span id="s2012">And the other day my, my son was -- since we talked about it, my son was to make to speech how it was living with a mother who's a survivor.</span> <span id="s2013">And, you know, come to think of it, he said the same thing.</span> <span id="s2014">He said, "She didn't look back and she didn't live in the past.</span> <span id="s2015">She lived in the present, and she lives in the future."</span> <span id="s2016">And, we never discussed the Holocaust in our house.</span> <span id="s2017">We didn't cry -- if I cried, I cried on my own.</span> <span id="s2018">I never showed my kids that I was a poor Holocaust survivor.</span> <span id="s2019">They never knew about that, I used to pick him up when he was a baby and I used to hold him.</span> <span id="s2020">And I used to say, "They're never going to take you away from me," you know.</span> <span id="s2021">And I really thought I had created something here.</span> <span id="s2022">You know I wanted to really hold onto him, and that he didn't know.</span> <span id="s2023">I only knew that he was so dear to me.</span> <span id="s2024">Once I had this little boy in my arms, I thought the world belonged to me.</span> <span id="s2025">And then another little girl, it was just wonderful.</span> <span id="s2026">But I went on with life and didn't look back and I think I accomplished, after all this horror, I accomplished what I wanted to accomplish.</span> <span id="s2027">Not quite, but I'm not finished yet.</span> <span id="s2028">And like I listen and read the stories and I hear these kids saying -- of course, they're right -- they keep saying, "We have to tell the story because soon the survivors will be dead."</span> <span id="s2029">So the kids who go through the March of the Living say that, “We have to tell the story; therefore, we're going through the March of the Living -- the Holocaust survivors will be dead.”</span> <span id="s2030">I don't want to hear it.</span> <span id="s2031">I want to live for a while yet and tell my story.</span> <span id="s2032">And I think maybe I will.</span> <span id="s2033">With God's help, I will.</span> <span id="s2034">Well, the “Shema” I've been saying in Auschwitz, at the roll call, appell, I still say.</span> <span id="s2035">If things get really tough and you know they have been.</span> <span id="s2036">I've complained already in the meantime and I've had all kinds of diseases, I'll say my “Shema,” I go on.</span> <span id="s2037">So, basically, I wouldn't call myself a very orthodox person, but I would call myself an observer.</span> <span id="s2038">And I think everybody should, in their own religion, should be observant.</span> <span id="s2039">It will make for a better world.</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">Q: So you do believe in God?</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">A: I do.</span> <span id="s2042">Because I, I feel somehow, somebody looked out over me, looked out for me because not too many people came out of this horror.</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">06:12:08</span></p> <p><span id="s2044">Q: When you think about the human race, as opposed to God, given what you went through and what you saw people doing to other human beings, are you -- you don't look like a pessimistic person, but are you pessimistic or are you optimistic?</span></p> <p><span id="s2045">A: Well, what they did to other people, yeah -- that in the beginning did destroy my whole outlook on life.</span> <span id="s2046">That I have to admit.</span> <span id="s2047">That was, “Where was God, you know, and why did they do it?</span> <span id="s2048">The Germans educated people, and, you know, why would they do a thing like that?”</span> <span id="s2049">It is very much so threw me off everything in the very beginning.</span> <span id="s2050">But then I noticed that without God and without a belief, it's not for me.</span> <span id="s2051">I can't go on like that, so I went right back to where I started out from.</span> <span id="s2052">I really did.</span> <span id="s2053">I tried to instill it into my kids, but they are not as observant as I am.</span> <span id="s2054">But, to each his own.</span> <span id="s2055">I don't preach to them, I let them do whatever they want to because it has to come from you inside, so . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s2056">Q: Is there anything you would like to say that we haven't talked about, or tell your grandkids?</span> <span id="s2057">A: Well, one thing I hope and pray that there is never a repetition of this horrible crime the Germans have done.</span> <span id="s2058">I hope that they have a better life.</span> <span id="s2059">It doesn't just go for my grandchildren, it goes for all human beings, humankind.</span> <span id="s2060">And these wars, unfortunately, in the Middle East and all that, I hope will come to peace, eventually.</span> <span id="s2061">That the whole world will be at ease, there will be fights.</span> <span id="s2062">No guns, no nothing.</span> <span id="s2063">Guns should be completely destroyed.</span> <span id="s2064">There shouldn't be any of this, and people should live in harmony and peace.</span> <span id="s2065">And I hope my grandchildren -- I won't see it anymore, but maybe my grandchildren will.</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">A: You're welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">06:14:22 (Starts to show photographs) This is my mother at the age of 19 taken in Nieder-ohmen, Germany where she was born and she was raised and where she lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">This is my mother's engagement picture.</span> <span id="s2070">I believe she was 20 years old.</span> <span
