id="s2">By Rhoda Lewin</span></p> <p><span id="s3">February 26,1986 Jewish Community Relations Council, Anti-Defamation League of Minnesota and the Dakotas HOLOCAUST ORAL HISTORY TAPING PROJECT</span></p> <p><span id="s4">Q: First, some background.</span> <span id="s5">You first went to your friends.</span> <span id="s6">You only asked for one passport.</span> <span id="s7">Who would have gotten the passport?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: Well, the reason we only asked for one was, we were a family of five; parents and three kids, but our father had a secure job, so he was more or less safe.</span> <span id="s9">My brother, being a boy, we didn’t think could pretend to be a Pole.</span> <span id="s10">So it was a matter of the three of us.</span> <span id="s11">And it was very hard at that time unless you had a job that the Germans considered useful to them.</span> <span id="s12">The rest of the Jews were practically finished.</span> <span id="s13">But the mood in the ghetto was such that there were so many pressing problems, like I was after my mother all the time.</span> <span id="s14">I said, ‘ Why aren’t we doing something?</span> <span id="s15">We know that this city was liquidated, and that city was liquidated.</span> <span id="s16">Our turn is coming up soon.’</span> <span id="s17">I said, “ Let’s do something about it.”</span> <span id="s18">And she said, “ Don’t bother me.</span> <span id="s19">We can’t do anything.</span> <span id="s20">Whatever will happen to everybody will happen to us.”</span> <span id="s21">And I remember our grandfather, who was a very Hasidic man, he refused to hear it altogether.</span> <span id="s22">He said, “ God will not allow it.</span> <span id="s23">I don’t believe it!</span> <span id="s24">All these things are lies!”</span> <span id="s25">So the psychological situation was such that you either denied it or you gave in and you said, “ Well, there’s nothing we can do, let’s forget about it.”</span> <span id="s26">I was 19 years old, and I had the urge that I didn’t want to give up.</span> <span id="s27">I wanted to do something about it, so I kept nagging my mother, and finally she came up with the idea that the only people we could try would be them.</span> <span id="s28">And we approached them.</span> <span id="s29">And when they came, she had no guts to ask for too much, so she said maybe she (Danuta) could give me -- we were friends, we were the same age -- if she could possibly give me her passport, then that’s how I would be satisfied and quieted down.</span> <span id="s30">But then when we did it, then mother decided she wants to give to all three of us</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: What would have happened if Danuta had given you her passport?</span> <span id="s32">Then what if she needed a passport?</span> <span id="s33">You would have been in serious trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: If I was caught, she would be automatically caught, too.</span> <span id="s35">But what we didn’t know, they were already active in the underground, and they themselves were on false passports, because they were fighting the Nazis already!</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Oh, so they actually had two passports.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: Right.</span> <span id="s38">They didn’t use their own any more, but they didn’t give us their own, for their own safety.</span> <span id="s39">But their mother was one of the leaders, and she in turn asked someone who was making the passports for themselves -- for their own members -- she said she needs three passports for her Jewish friends, and they gave it to her.</span> <span id="s40">But they had closed the door.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: That was Dr. Sabina talking.</span> <span id="s42">It is Wednesday, February 26, 1986, and we are continuing an interview begun three years ago, because the two Polish women who made it possible for Mrs. Zimering to survive the Holocaust are here visiting in Minneapolis.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">First I would like to ask your Polish friends what life was like for the Poles during the war.</span> <span id="s44">We all know how the Jews were deprived of food and clothing, but I’m sure that the Poles were suffering, too.</span> <span id="s45">Maybe they could describe that.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Note: From this point on, Dr. Zimering will translate Lewin’s questions into Polish, and then translate the responses by Mrs. Trybus and Mrs. Spiewak into English.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: (Translates question into Polish.</span> <span id="s48">The response is in Polish, and then Zimering translates to English.)</span> <span id="s49">She said the conditions for Poles were very difficult; that the original Nazi plan was to exterminate the Jews first and the Poles next.</span> <span id="s50">From very early in the occupation of Poland by the Nazis, most of the Polish nation became mobilized in the underground movement of fighting the Nazis for the country.</span> <span id="s51">She said the organization was almost like an underground army.</span> <span id="s52">The Germans were aware of it, and they were fighting them very fiercely, and they had a lot of members of the underground army executed.</span> <span id="s53">At one time, there were 90 people in the small town that we came from.</span> <span id="s54">And of course there was a continuous fear and terror to be caught and punished by the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: When they caught them, did they just execute them on the spot, or did they keep them in jail, or transport them to camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: (Discussion in Polish).</span> <span id="s57">There was no set way of punishing the caught partisans.</span> <span id="s58">Some were shot on the spot, some were put in prisons, and others were tortured, very mercilessly, like their mother.</span> <span id="s59">Their mother went through very hard beatings, and torture before she was sent to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s60">So there were not legal steps taken.</span> <span id="s61">They just handled them in different ways.</span> <span id="s62">The methods of interrogation were just extremely cruel.</span> <span id="s63">They pulled out nails.</span> <span id="s64">Outside of ordinary beatings with rubber things with lead ends, they would put people under water until they were practically suffocating, then pull them out.</span> <span id="s65">And burned them, and hung them up so they couldn’t touch the ground, and hung them there and continuously asked, “ Tell the truth!</span> <span id="s66">Tell the truth!”</span> <span id="s67">It’s most brutal.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Could they estimate what percentage of the people -- the Poles in the town -- were involved in the underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: (Discussion in Polish).</span> <span id="s70">Ninety percent of the population.</span> <span id="s71">And by the way, it’s important to know that they belonged to the Armiya Krayova, the AK.</span> <span id="s72">That was the name of the organization that they belonged to and they fought with.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: There were different organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: Well later on.</span> <span id="s75">Poland was attacked by Germany September 1, 1939, and occupied within a couple of weeks.</span> <span id="s76">Warsaw held out a little longer, you know.</span> <span id="s77">Our town was finished in a week.</span> <span id="s78">It was occupied.</span> <span id="s79">But she says that the formation of Armiya Krayova was a month after the occupation.</span> <span id="s80">Within a month they were organized.</span> <span id="s81">The next organization underground, which had a Socialist leaning, the Army of Ludova, didn’t come into existence until 1941, so this organization carried on for two years before the other one came into existence.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: We’ll back up for a minute now.</span> <span id="s83">Food was rationed.</span> <span id="s84">There was no clothing.</span> <span id="s85">Everything was focused on the war effort, rather than for the civilian population.</span> <span id="s86">Can they remember anything about that -- how, where they got food?</span> <span id="s87">Was there a black market?</span> <span id="s88">They had land, didn’t they?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Yeah, they had land.</span> <span id="s90">(Asks question in Polish.</span> <span id="s91">Response in Polish.)</span> <span id="s92">Everything was rationed very early in the war.</span> <span id="s93">I still remember, too, that the Germans were confiscating everything that was available and shipping it to Germany, and very little was left for the population.</span> <span id="s94">She remembers instances where the only food they had was grain.</span> <span id="s95">And their mother used to just cook up that.</span> <span id="s96">There was no meat, there was no sugar.</span> <span id="s97">And for shoes, they were wearing wooden shoes.</span> <span id="s98">There was no leather, there was no shoes.</span> <span id="s99">There was a lot of hardship in that respect.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: And I’m sure no fuel in the winter?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: (Question asked and responded to in Polish.)</span> <span id="s102">There was no fuel.</span> <span id="s103">It was very scarce and so it was quite cold.</span> <span id="s104">(More Polish.)</span> <span id="s105">So they were using wood, and the wood shavings, because coal was quite scarce.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: And if you had a typhus epidemic, Poles caught typhus, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: (More responses in Polish.)</span> <span id="s108">Soap was in short supply.</span> <span id="s109">There was lots of lice infestation and of course typhus.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Maybe we should move on and talk about some of their activities as partisans.</span> <span id="s111">I got the impression that because it was such a broad battle against the Germans -- the occupation -- that some of the partisans, or the partisan leaders perhaps, felt that to endanger yourselves to shield Jews maybe was not the smartest thing to do -- it was not a high priority for them.</span> <span id="s112">Is this true or is this not true?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: (Discussion in Polish.)</span> <span id="s114">She said she’s aware of only her own experiences, and in her case, the fact that the documents were given to us -- to Jews -- from a higher leader in her organization, this would mean that they were taking risks, and helping Jews, and she also remembers a case where a Polish man threw some bread to a Jew who was being led through the streets to work, and he was shot on the spot.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: Did they provide papers for other Jews too?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: (Response in Polish.)</span> <span id="s117">She said they themselves helped only us, but she knows of cases where several other Jews survived in Piodsgraf because of help from other Poles.</span> <span id="s118">One was by her aunt, and some other people, and she also remembers a case where a Jew (Dr. Tannenbaum) was a high officer in the same underground organization, was fighting with the other members, and happened to die in one of the battles.</span> <span id="s119">(Other woman speaks in Polish.</span> <span id="s120">Mentions Feinsky, Zborovsky.)</span> <span id="s121">She knows several other cases where Jews survived through help of other Poles, in our town.</span> <span id="s122">(More Polish, mentions Goldhirsch.)</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Would they like to describe some of the partisan activities that they engaged in?</span> <span id="s124">You know, we always think of partisans blowing up bridges and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: (Response in Polish.)</span> <span id="s126">This is the younger sister, Maria Spiewak.</span> <span id="s127">She says when the war broke out, she was 14 years old, and her sister was 16 years old, and they became couriers.</span> <span id="s128">Their job was to smuggle documents between Piodsgraf and the central office in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s129">And she was smuggling weapons.</span> <span id="s130">And this was basically their work.</span> <span id="s131">(More give and take in Polish.)</span> <span id="s132">Documents and secret, illegal press, newspapers.</span> <span id="s133">What is very important to know, is they both were given, and all the other members, cyanide that they had hidden on themselves, and they were told that if they are caught and tortured and in danger of giving away names of other members, to take their own life.</span> <span id="s134">(Brief discussion in Polish.)</span> <span id="s135">They happened to be in Warsaw twice, they were sent there twice, during the Polish uprising in August of 1944.</span> <span id="s136">There was a Jewish ghetto uprising in April of ’43, which, of course, the Germans completely destroyed, but then the Poles had a uprising of a bigger scale in summer and fall of ’44, and this was also not successful.</span> <span id="s137">Besides smuggling weapons and documents, their home was a center for hiding some of the partisans from other parts of the country that were on the run and had to have a safe shelter.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s139">I noticed that you said in your interview, that after the war ended, you went back to your town -- it was 90,000, that was a sizeable town -- and you found your old friends still there.</span> <span id="s140">Could you talk a little about how you felt?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Well, when we came back in September of ’44, my sister and I were looking for members of the family that we hoped had survived.</span> <span id="s142">We had a large family of probably 70, 80 people, and we found two, an uncle and his daughter.</span> <span id="s143">And when we went to see our friends, their mother was still in Germany in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s144">She wasn’t back yet.</span> <span id="s145">And Danuta, the older sister, happened to be married at that time, so we missed seeing her, but we had a visit with the younger one, with Maria, and she returned the things that we left with them before we ran away.</span> <span id="s146">Among especially valuable things were the family Shabbat candle holders that we still have, that were in the family for a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: What other things had you left with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Clothes.</span> <span id="s149">Not much.</span> <span id="s150">There were some photos, family pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: And they saved those for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Yes, they saved them and we got them back.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: One of the things I was going to ask earlier and we got sidetracked, you said that for much of the time that you were in Germany, your father was still free.</span> <span id="s154">I would imagine he was working with the coal business still?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s156">After 1942, out of 24,000 Jews that were in the ghetto, they left 2,000.</span> <span id="s157">Everybody else went, most of them, to Treblinka, for extermination.</span> <span id="s158">They were shipping them to concentration camps earlier, but the final stage was just strictly crematorium.</span> <span id="s159">But what my father did, he was among the remaining 2,000 that were needed for the Germans to work in war-related industry.</span> <span id="s160">So he was not in the coal business any more, he was working for the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: In a factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: In a factory.</span> <span id="s163">(Conversation in Polish.)</span> <span id="s164">It was a factory of wood-related products that they needed.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: And so you would write letters to your father from where you were in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: No, not to the father.</span> <span id="s167">We would write letters to them, and they would give it to our father.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: And you sent food packages?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s170">We were in Germany with the false papers, working as Polish girls in Germany, and we were able to keep in touch with him.</span> <span id="s171">He was able to know that we are alive and we were able to know how he is through writing letters to them.</span> <span id="s172">If we wrote a letter to a Jew, we would have been finished, so we were writing letters to our Polish friends, and how they were able to give it to him, was, he was -- (Conversation in Polish.)</span> <span id="s173">--– See, I’m finding out new things now, myself!</span> <span id="s174">Apparently when they got a letter from us, it wasn’t that my father or my brother went to their home.</span> <span id="s175">It was too risky.</span> <span id="s176">It wasn’t possible.</span> <span id="s177">But they went to where they were staying, where they were interned, and they would have a place, a place of meeting, and my father would wait behind the wire fence, and they would approach, give him the letter, and quickly go away.</span> <span id="s178">And this was done continuously.</span> <span id="s179">And then once, towards the end of the war, when my mother was shipped to a concentration camp and they were being looked for by the Nazis, and ran away from home, and my father didn’t know what was going on, so only at that time did he go to their home to find out what happened, and it was a great risk.</span> <span id="s180">And their father was there, and he was not aware of all the contacts, and he was very scared to see him there, and he told him, “ Get out.</span> <span id="s181">This house is being watched.”</span> <span id="s182">And there was nothing there for him, there was no letter.</span> <span id="s183">(More Polish.)</span> <span id="s184">And the father of the girls told him what happened, that the wife is in a concentration camp, and the girls are in hiding, and there’s no more contact -- it was not possible any more -- between us and our father.</span> <span id="s185">(More Polish.)</span> <span id="s186">This was about August of 1944, and Piodsgraf was liberated in January of ’45, so it was towards the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: It was liberated by the Americans?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: No, by the Russians.</span> <span id="s189">The Russians came from the east.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: It was about 90 miles from Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Something like that, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: You were liberated by the Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Right, in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Do you want to talk about what it was like to be liberated by the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Well, I wonder.</span> <span id="s196">Probably not.</span> <span id="s197">I can ask them.</span> <span id="s198">(Asks in Polish.</span> <span id="s199">The answer is “no”.)</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: Well, of course, talking about the Russians really doesn’t have anything to do with the story we were telling, so we’ll just omit that.</span> <span id="s201">Is there anything I didn’t ask that I should have?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Well, during the whole underground activity, they were together most of the time.</span> <span id="s203">They were traveling on trains delivering either weapons or the documents, and during one trip, the older, Danka, was caught by the Nazis, by the Gestapo, and put in jail in Czestochowa, which is a city maybe 90 miles southwest of Piodsgraf.</span> <span id="s204">And she was kept there until liberation.</span> <span id="s205">She was sure that she would not make it through it, because the penalties were death, but she was lucky that before they got to her case, before any further investigation, the Russian troops liberated Czestochowa, and she simply ran out of jail, and was free, and walked on foot from Czestochowa to Piodsgraf, back home -- in January -- which was about a 90 kilometers walk.</span> <span id="s206">Now Maria, she continued her work after her sister was arrested, and she couldn’t be in Piodsgraf, because they were on the “wanted” list by the Nazis, so she was in another town, in Tomaszow.</span> <span id="s207">And when the Russian troops came, she also returned home.</span> <span id="s208">And they met each other, maybe a week later.</span> <span id="s209">Danka arrived, but the mother remained in Germany, and later on she recuperated in Sweden for several months, and didn’t come home until November of 1945.</span> <span id="s210">She was arrested in July, 1944, and didn’t get back until ’45, in very poor shape, health, from which she never fully recovered.</span> <span id="s211">She spent the last 11 years of her life in bed.</span> <span id="s212">She was 54 years old when she was arrested by the Gestapo and sent to a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: I’ve had a number of people say that they recuperated in Sweden.</span> <span id="s214">Was there some kind of a treatment center, a hospital, a recuperation area where people were sent?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: (Conversation in Polish.)</span> <span id="s216">Well, she was sent to Sweden because of her very poor health condition.</span> <span id="s217">In the camp, she went through typhoid fever, typhus, dysentery, and towards the end she got tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s218">She was in Sweden, in Malmo, in a hospital, and they tried to bring her back to health.</span> <span id="s219">She left for Poland against their wishes.</span> <span id="s220">They felt that she still was not in good enough shape to leave, but she wanted to go home.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: How did she get to Sweden?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: Oh, that was the Swedish Red Cross that was going to the camp[s and picking out weak people, children, and bringing them to their country for restoration.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Were other countries doing that too?</span> <span id="s224">Other Red Cross organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: (Translates into Polish.</span> <span id="s226">Response.)</span> <span id="s227">They are not aware of other ones.</span> <span id="s228">We know that our brother, who was a teenager at that time, was liberated in Buchenwald, and he was sent to France, where they sent the Jewish orphans.</span> <span id="s229">But as far as medical care, she is aware only of Sweden, the Swedish Red Cross.</span> <span id="s230">Yes, Sweden was a neutral country, so after the war, they were in much better shape than most anyone in Europe, and they had the humanitarian drive.</span> <span id="s231">They were very helpful to thousands of concentration camp inmates</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: To go back to your own interview, Sabina, are these the same little girls who used to say to you when you were a little girl, “ You’re so wonderful, you’re such a good friend, why don’t you become a Christian like us?”</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: (Translates.</span> <span id="s234">Laughter.</span> <span id="s235">Response in Polish.</span> <span id="s236">Laughter.)</span> <span id="s237">Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s238">They were the little girls, they were the friends that proposed it.</span> <span id="s239">In fact, they just reminded me that when we left Piodsgraf and went to work in Germany as Poles, we had the documents, and in addition to it, they gave us a little Polish cross to wear on our necks to really look like Polish girls, and little Catholic prayer books sent along with us.</span> <span id="s240">I forgot that.</span> <span id="s241">(More Polish.)</span> <span id="s242">They wanted to make sure that we were complete Poles.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Now you’re Sabina’s sister… Bigos: We are both sisters, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: And your name now?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Bigos: My name now is Helena Bigos.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: You were talking about when you were hiding in their attic, and they brought the food up to you.</span> <span id="s247">Can you describe that?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Bigos: Yes, this is 40 years ago, and I still remember when they brought us the food, and there was a little window in the attic so we could look out, and many times we saw those people that were going to work, we saw them through the window.</span> <span id="s249">And we were there without the knowledge of their father, so we had to be very nice and quiet.</span> <span id="s250">I still remember it like it would be yesterday.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: And they weren’t getting extra rations, they were sharing their food.</span> <span id="s252">Would they like to talk about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: (Discussion in Polish.</span> <span id="s254">Laughter.)</span> <span id="s255">She wanted to know if I said their mother was my teacher in grade school.</span> <span id="s256">I did.</span> <span id="s257">There was a closeness, a friendship, between their mother and our mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: And you had the brother.</span> <span id="s259">(Discussion in Polish.)</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: They remember the evening when we showed up out of the ghetto, in the hiding place where they, themselves, were hiding.</span> <span id="s261">What happened was, we got the documents before we needed them.</span> <span id="s262">That was several weeks before the time when the ghetto was being surrounded, when the extermination commando showed up.</span> <span id="s263">We heard about it at midnight -- I think I have it in my report -- and when we knew that this is it, the whole family took off our armbands, and we took our documents and left the ghetto at night.</span> <span id="s264">My father had the legal stuff for the job, but the four of us, my sister, myself, my brother and my mother headed for their home, to our friends, which was in the Polish part of town.</span> <span id="s265">It was illegal for us to be there.</span> <span id="s266">They remember when we showed up at night, not at their home, but at their hiding place.</span> <span id="s267">They seem to remember that better than I do.</span> <span id="s268">They saw us, and kept us there.</span> <span id="s269">They, themselves were already hiding out because they were active in the underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: So then the place where you hid in the attic was not their home, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: Yes, it was their home, but later on.</span> <span id="s272">We spent that night in this little shack that was in a field, and then during the day we went and were in their home.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Was their father ever active in the partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: No, he was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Through the whole war, he knew his wife and daughters were doing this, and he just kept himself separate.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s277">(Conversation in Polish.)</span> <span id="s278">He was aware of it, but he did not participate.</span> <span id="s279">He didn’t interfere, but he just did not participate.</span> <span id="s280">He was just afraid.</span> <span id="s281">(More conversations in Polish.)</span> <span id="s282">He knew the dangers of being shot, if caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Poor father, his wife and his daughters wouldn’t obey him.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: (Conversation in Polish.</span> <span id="s285">Laughter.)</span> <span id="s286">Not everybody can be a hero.</span> <span id="s287">And he just wasn’t a hero.</span> <span id="s288">He was a professor of biology, he was a very well educated man, but he just didn’t have the courage that their mother and they had.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: I think very few of us have the courage to be heroes.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s291">(More conversation in Polish.)</span> <span id="s292">Yes.</span> <span id="s293">You might be interested in what Rabbi Goodman asked them when they were here last time and were honored at the Adath Jeshurun synagogue.</span> <span id="s294">He considered them heroines, and he was wondering how they came about to do what they did.</span> <span id="s295">Why don’t I ask them that and say their answer then.</span> <span id="s296">(Conversation in Polish.)</span> <span id="s297">At that time and again now, she claims that to them it was not a heroic doing.</span> <span id="s298">It was normal, humanitarian response to a friend in trouble.</span> <span id="s299">And they, at that time, considered it a normal thing to do, even though it was at the danger of their own life.</span> <span id="s300">(More conversation in Polish.)</span> <span id="s301">She remembers that when we were in Germany in the working camp, and we corresponded with them, one of the letters she wrote to me, very happy and excited, giving me the news about the uprising in the Warsaw Jewish ghetto.</span> <span id="s302">I was very happy to hear about it, and I was very happy that she was interested in it, but I immediately destroyed the letter, because I thought, if they saw a letter like that on me, it would be very suspicious, that one Polish girl in Poland is writing to another Polish girl in Germany about a Jewish uprising.</span> <span id="s303">(Laughter.)</span> <span id="s304">She wanted to share the news with me.</span> <span id="s305">(More Polish.)</span> <span id="s306">She wrote it because she was very happy about it, and knew that I would be, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: (Tape recorder off and on.)</span> <span id="s308">One more thing.</span> <span id="s309">We’ve been sitting here talking about people that also are studying the Holocaust, and then you mentioned a Jewish cardiologist who returned to Poland and is now living in Lodz.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: He never returned.</span> <span id="s311">He never left.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Oh, he never left Poland rather.</span> <span id="s313">Yet he was one of the organizers of the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s314">And that made me wonder, did any Jews come back to your city to stay?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: (Conversation in Polish.)</span> <span id="s316">Piodsgraf, our hometown, which had 20,000 Jews, has only one Jew left.</span> <span id="s317">There’s one who lives there now, who never left either.</span> <span id="s318">(More Polish.)</span> <span id="s319">And then there was a doctor that’s deceased now, that was quite known at the time, but these were the only two Jews that they know of.</span> <span id="s320">In most cases what happened was like with us.</span> <span id="s321">Jews were either deported, or left, and when they were liberated in some other parts of Europe, went back to Poland mainly to look for other relatives, and then left again.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: Was there a lot of destruction in the city?</span> <span id="s323">Buildings bombed, burned…</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: The city was bombed the very first day of the war, September 1, 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: Because I wondered if that had something to do with your not wanting to go back, too, that when you went back, so much had been destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s327">The main reason why most Jews did not want to be there, was they just didn’t find any family, and it was very painful to continue to stay in a place where there was just no one there.</span> <span id="s328">But what she also suggested, a contact would be the Jewish -- (More Polish.)</span> <span id="s329">she had contact with, and she thought you might like to know about it, there’s a Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s330">(More Polish.)</span> <span id="s331">And another thing also, that you might want to know that they forgot to say, they said recently people like them who were given medals and acknowledgement by Yad Vashem, formed an organization.</span> <span id="s332">And they have an organization in Poland of all the Poles that were helping Jews.</span> <span id="s333">The organization is called the Organization for the Righteous Among Nations.</span> <span id="s334">And there are, as of now, she said, 1,600 Poles in Poland that belong to that organization, that received the medals like they did.</span> <span id="s335">And their name is shown in the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: Now, in order to get that award and be recognized, there have to be witnesses, and affidavits.</span> <span id="s337">These 1,600 people are all people who have…</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Well, how it’s usually done, is like in our case, we survived the war because of their help, and we applied to Yad Vashem.</span> <span id="s339">We sent a summary of the history of the Holocaust, for us, and mentioned their names as two people that gave us the passports, and made it possible for us to survive.</span> <span id="s340">And Yad Vashem had a meeting, I guess they have their normal procedure, they get together, they analyze the records, and then they decide who gets one, who does not.</span> <span id="s341">And that’s how they got theirs.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: And there are 1,600 Poles who…</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: Right.</span> <span id="s344">In Poland, yeah.</span> <span id="s345">In fact, from what she said, in all Europe there are 6,000 “righteous gentiles.”</span> <span id="s346">(More Polish.)</span> <span id="s347">And this is an ongoing process.</span> <span id="s348">There are people continuously being found and given the award and honored.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: Is there anything else that we should talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: (Discussion in Polish.)</span> <span id="s351">The Germans’ favorite place to execute Poles that were caught for activities in the underground movement was the remnants, the ruins, of the Jewish ghetto in Warsaw and in Lodz.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: They would bother to transport them there and then kill them?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: Yeah, they would take them out of the prisons, take them to the ruins of the Jewish ghetto and execute them there.</span> <span id="s354">(More Polish.)</span> <span id="s355">She thinks that it was done because it was an empty place, they were just ruins.</span> <span id="s356">She doesn’t know whether it had any symbolical meaning or not, but it was just ruined.</span> <span id="s357">They loved the part of Warsaw that used to be the Jewish part.</span> <span id="s358">(More Polish.)</span> <span id="s359">The Jewish uprising was the first one, in April of ’43.</span> <span id="s360">The Polish uprising was in August of ’44.</span> <span id="s361">And when this was squelched, then they leveled most of the city.</span> <span id="s362">(More Polish.)</span> <span id="s363">She was wondering whether you have any specific questions.</span> <span id="s364">She said she could talk for hours about it.</span> <span id="s365">(More Polish.</span> <span id="s366">Laughter.)</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: What would she like to talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: (Laughter.</span> <span id="s369">More Polish conversation.)</span> <span id="s370">They feel that what we are doing is very important, to collect the oral history, to document, in order for our young people to be aware of what we all went through.</span> <span id="s371">And the second reason would be to try and prevent anything like that happening again, and to be aware that a dictatorial system could create a situation where one human being is so cruel to another one.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Polish Woman; (In English.)</span> <span id="s373">Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s374">(Laughter.)</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: Both Danuta and Maria went to the Jewish Historical Society in Warsaw, showed them the documents they received and the medal from Yad Vashem, and they were very interested in them.</span> <span id="s376">And they showed them the coverage they got in our press, when they got back from here in 1979, and apparently they were informed that when they returned from their trip now, they’ll be interviewed by the American T.V. over there.</span> <span id="s377">That they are very interested in their history and in their deeds.</span> <span id="s378">So that’s why they felt they would love to have this tape, also, to add to their collection.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Well we can certainly make copies of the tape right away and give them copies of the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: Yeah, because part of it is in Polish, so they would see it, and their children know English.</span> <span id="s381">They are both mothers and grandmothers.</span> <span id="s382">In fact Mrs. Spiewak’s son is, right now, a professor at the University of Madison, Wisconsin, in mechanical engineering.</span> <span id="s383">And Mrs. Trybus’s son, at one time he was a fellow at M.I.T. in Boston, and spent two years as a teacher at the University of Edmonton, Canada, and now returned to Poland and is teaching in a high position in Poland, at the university.</span> <span id="s384">So they have children that are highly educated and know English, so they’d be able to translate this.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Now the son who’s in Madison, is he there to stay permanently?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: Right now, he’s on a three-year visiting professor status, and she doesn’t know how it will be in the future.</span> <span id="s387">(Polish conversation.)</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: And you don’t have any trouble getting visas to come here.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: (More Polish.)</span> <span id="s390">Polish woman: Neit, neit.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Of course you left your family behind.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: (Polish.)</span> <span id="s393">It was not difficult.</span> <span id="s394">In one day they got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Well, I’m glad you could come.</span> <span
