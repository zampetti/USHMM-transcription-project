id="s10">September 23, 1994</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: Will you begin by telling me your maiden name, when you were born, where you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: Well, my maiden name was Fletcher, and I was born in .</span> <span id="s13">Q: Was your name Henny Fletcher?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: My name was Henny Fletcher, and I was born in Kovno, Lithuania, in 1924.</span> <span id="s15">Q: The date?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: November 25, 1924.</span> <span id="s17">Well, are you already recording me?</span> <span id="s18">Yes?</span> <span id="s19">I had a younger brother, who was three years younger than I was, and I suppose we could be considered an upper middle class family, because we had a lovely apartment and my brother and I went to a private school which was a rarity.</span> <span id="s20">Basically, I was not lacking in anything.</span> <span id="s21">I was pretty happy go lucky young kid, and we were both growing up like average two children.</span> <span id="s22">We used to go to the country in the summer time, and in the winter time, I used to spend my days after school on the ice skating rink in Macobie (ph) because I like gymnastics.</span> <span id="s23">And my brother was a nuisance, like all the other little brothers who were always in the way.</span> <span id="s24">I cannot tell you that I had any difficulty growing up.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: What was your father's business?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: My father was a businessman.</span> <span id="s27">He was actually in manufacturing.</span> <span id="s28">He didn't, he people who did it for him, educational toys, like chess, dominoes and all the other ones and also children's games.</span> <span id="s29">The highlight of my life was in December, my father used to deliver all the -- have the orders delivered to the stores on our main street, which is the equivalent of Park Avenue in Kovno, which , and all these stores were Gentile stores mostly, and I was the one who used to deliver all these packaged orders.</span> <span id="s30">And I had friends of mine who were looking forward every year in December to accompany me because my father used to hire a sled with two horses and a driver, not a driver actually, whatever you call him, and he used to put all the boxes in the sled and put my friend, the one which I picked, and me in the seat cover with a heavy fur cover, and then we used to stop near every store.</span> <span id="s31">I used to walk out.</span> <span id="s32">He used to deliver the box.</span> <span id="s33">And I used to say I am Fletcher's daughter in Lithuania, and they used to give me the money.</span> <span id="s34">It was the highlight of me and my friends period usually before Christmas time.</span> <span id="s35">I had an exceptional father, really, because he had tremendous confidence in me.</span> <span id="s36">He just thought at the age of 10 or 11 that I could do anything.</span> <span id="s37">And I remember when I was 11 years old, he called me into his room, and he opened up the desk drawer, on the right side, second drawer, and he showed me a bank book and there was money in there, written down how much money.</span> <span id="s38">And I said to him, "what's that for?"</span> <span id="s39">He said, "that's for you, for your dowry."</span> <span id="s40">And I said to him, "dowry, you're not going to pay anybody to marry me."</span> <span id="s41">I was so furious then.</span> <span id="s42">As I said, he instilled in me tremendous confidence, self confidence, and I think that helped me a lot during the war and after the war because he was a great optimist.</span> <span id="s43">He was a very funny man.</span> <span id="s44">He always had interesting jokes and interesting stories.</span> <span id="s45">He also designed calendars -- in Lithuania -- I don't know Lithuania-- but every single day you tore off a page.</span> <span id="s46">I think they have it here, too, I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s47">And on the back of the page of each day there was a joke, and my father was the one who wrote all the jokes on the other side of each day.</span> <span id="s48">So, I grew up in a household with almost like a funny man and he always made life very happy and amusing.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Were you close with your mother, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s51">I had a wonderful mother.</span> <span id="s52">She was the opposite, very quiet, very refined lady who always looked for me to help out, but I was never around because I was busy, as I said, having fun.</span> <span id="s53">But she had help, but she was a lovely lady, unassuming and very gentle and very kind and I loved her very much.</span> <span id="s54">She was a very pretty lady.</span> <span id="s55">I remember on high holidays she used to get dressed up always in a grey wool suit with a silver fox fur for not a collar, but it was called a shawl.</span> <span id="s56">And she was blond, and every year she used to go to the women who used to make hats and the hat was always open on top so her blond hair would show and an large, large brim.</span> <span id="s57">And whenever she used to walk in the synagog for the high holidays, people looked at her.</span> <span id="s58">She was tall and a very nice lady.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: Were you religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: No.</span> <span id="s61">Well of course we were kosher in the house.</span> <span id="s62">I wouldn't say we were ultra religious, but we were kosher at home, and we celebrated the high holidays and Hanukkah and Passover and traditional, I would call it.</span> <span id="s63">Then, of course, when the Russians came into Lithuania, we were kind of on pins and needles, because my father was a businessman.</span> <span id="s64">He was afraid they were going to send us to Siberia.</span> <span id="s65">So, he started planning on how we should get out of Lithuania.</span> <span id="s66">It wasn't easy, actually, for people who are more or less established to just throw away everything and pick up the family and leave.</span> <span id="s67">That was in 1939, and at that time, we had relatives in Germany, and one time they sent us a letter asking us to help them, because they had this store.</span> <span id="s68">They were store keepers and one day the Germans came in -- that was written in the letter -- the Germans came in, took away the head of the family from the store and told the wife, he's going to be back in a few days.</span> <span id="s69">We just want to interrogate him.</span> <span id="s70">The next day, two days later, they came back with a little box, which in Lithuania peppercorns came in little boxes, and they came back and handed her the box, put it on the counter and said, "this is your husband."</span> <span id="s71">So, this was the letter we received in '39.</span> <span id="s72">And of course, my parents tried to help them to leave, and they did arrive in Kovno, but is didn't sound real.</span> <span id="s73">It just didn't sound that people could do that to other people.</span> <span id="s74">So, my mother definitely felt that something was wrong with her, but my father kind of believed it because there were quite a number of Polish Jews who kept on running away at that time from Poland.</span> <span id="s75">So, he started somehow plotting things out how to get out.</span> <span id="s76">So, the first thing he did, which he wasn't silly, but he went to to see his family because he came from Vilna.</span> <span id="s77">I'm just digressing because I just wanted to show you what a great man he was in a way.</span> <span id="s78">He wasn't actually, he wasn't demonstrative, but he was exceptionally supportive of me.</span> <span id="s79">I don't know, but he really was.</span> <span id="s80">Before the Russians came in, I had a beautiful coat made for me.</span> <span id="s81">It was grey wool, fur collar, a trench coat with a belt, very sharp.</span> <span id="s82">So, my father took the coat and said he was going to see his family in Vilna, and he came back and the lining of the coat was removed and behind the lining was all mink -- filled in with mink.</span> <span id="s83">He felt that in case something is going to happen to him, I should have something to fall back on, to sell the coat or sell the mink for my mother and my brother and myself.</span> <span id="s84">That is the kind of family I grew up.</span> <span id="s85">I really and truly feel personally that I cannot, how should I say it, I could not let this four years, or actually three years, actually horrible three years, ruin my life, ruin me for the rest of my life.</span> <span id="s86">It was a period where actually the world went mad, and I happened to be caught in between.</span> <span id="s87">It could have happened to anybody who was there.</span> <span id="s88">That to destroy the rest of my life and to feed my children with experiences of madmen after the war and live in the past, I couldn't do that, because my upbringing was great.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Let me ask you a little bit more about Kovno before the war.</span> <span id="s90">Was it a great place to grow up?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Yes, I had no difficulties.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: The city, I mean, were there things to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s94">There was this school we went to, they had all kind of functions.</span> <span id="s95">It was a very good school.</span> <span id="s96">And then of course in the winter time we had the ice skating rinks with the music, and we used to go outside and play and dance and do all these wild things, which were wild then.</span> <span id="s97">Then I belonged to Macabe, which is an organization, which is a sport organization.</span> <span id="s98">I used to spend my days there.</span> <span id="s99">I was the ping pong champion.</span> <span id="s100">And in the summer we went to the country where I used to hike.</span> <span id="s101">I really, maybe I never encountered any problems.</span> <span id="s102">I was always exposed to Jewish people, Jewish school, except for the people who were dealing with my father, who were exceptionally nice, too, because apparently they needed his product.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: So you didn't have any difficulties?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: I really didn't, but it turned out worse with the Germans, eventually.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: You had a nice life.</span> <span id="s106">Did it ever occur to you that that would be taken away?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s108">Not only did it never occur me, but even when I was in concentration camp, I always expected to survive.</span> <span id="s109">And I really attributed it to my father.</span> <span id="s110">I'm serious, because in retrospect, I mean I thought about it before you came.</span> <span id="s111">He really instilled in me a tremendous amount of self assurance and confidence, and if you just do your thing, you'll make it if you want it badly enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Now, you were mentioning that you were starting to get concerned after the Russians came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: What sorts of opportunities were taken away from you at that time?</span> <span id="s115">How did your life change?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: You mean to leave Lithuania?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: No, just in Kovno when the Russians were there, were certain things prohibited to you?</span> <span id="s118">Could you continue to practice your religion.</span> <span id="s119">Did you still go to school?</span> <span id="s120">Was everything basically the same, or did it change?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Well, the first thing that changed was the Russians had a theory that they had to relocate the people.</span> <span id="s122">Never to leave the same people in the same area.</span> <span id="s123">So, what they did, the first thing they did was to move me from my school to another school where I didn't know anybody.</span> <span id="s124">I did know some, but -- and the people from the other school were moved to my school.</span> <span id="s125">So, they kind of mixed the whole thing up.</span> <span id="s126">And, they also, of course introduced all Russian history and Russian, and we were fed with all the Russian propaganda.</span> <span id="s127">I wouldn't say -- the only problem as far as I recall is that we were fearful that any day they'll come and just take us to Siberia because everybody around us, whoever was in business, that's where they wound up.</span> <span id="s128">The truck used to come, just like the Germans actually.</span> <span id="s129">They had the same system.</span> <span id="s130">Without warning, they used to knock at your door and say, "Come, take whatever you can just take with you."</span> <span id="s131">Put you on a truck, put you on a train, and send you to Siberia.</span> <span id="s132">So, that was our only fear at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Did you know people that were going to Siberia, did you know where they were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Well, they knew, they knew that's what the Russians are doing.</span> <span id="s135">They did have some inclination of what they were doing.</span> <span id="s136">The people, especially who are in business, who are employing people.</span> <span id="s137">So, that was the only fear which I recall my father had.</span> <span id="s138">But, otherwise, and as I said, I got used to being in the new school, and I kept on doing my own thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Did you continue to practice Jewish holidays and all?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: I don't really recall, because we were not that religious that it affected us.</span> <span id="s141">Probably the people who were religious it affected them.</span> <span id="s142">But I don't recall going to Temple that year for all the high holidays.</span> <span id="s143">That's something that is kind of murky in my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Do you remember the first day of the war in Kovno?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Yes, I do, very much so.</span> <span id="s146">It was 1941, June 21, 1941.</span> <span id="s147">That was a day that I was supposed to go to my school, my original school to pick up my diploma because I had graduated from high school.</span> <span id="s148">I had a pair of silk stockings, which I kept for that special occasion, to put on a pair of silk stockings.</span> <span id="s149">I walked to school, which was quite a distance, and I picked up my diploma.</span> <span id="s150">It was all rolled up with a ribbon, and I walked home, and as I passed where the President of Lithuania lived, suddenly something fell out from an airplane, because they bombed the President's quarters.</span> <span id="s151">I fell on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s152">I got up.</span> <span id="s153">I wasn't really concerned about the bomb more than that I tore my stockings.</span> <span id="s154">I came home, and we knew something was going to happen because we really -- in spite of the fact that we did not want to believe that the Germans are going to come into Lithuania, and we hoped that it would just pass us by, we knew that they are there and we had no choice at that time.</span> <span id="s155">We were already caught between the devil and the .</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Can you describe the atmosphere in the street at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: It was chaotic.</span> <span id="s158">It was very, very chaotic.</span> <span id="s159">It's very difficult to describe the chaos.</span> <span id="s160">People really didn't know what to do, because they were trapped.</span> <span id="s161">We were really just trapped.</span> <span id="s162">We couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s163">We didn't have weapons.</span> <span id="s164">We didn't have anything.</span> <span id="s165">We didn't have anybody on our side.</span> <span id="s166">It wasn't only the Germans that were against us, it was actually the Lithuanians started before the Germans started.</span> <span id="s167">So, they started looting and screaming and yelling and beating us up.</span> <span id="s168">So, we didn't know which way to turn.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: You saw this and this was just all around?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Oh, all around us, all around us, yes.</span> <span id="s171">We kept our door locked, and we were lucky that they must have got enough from the people around so they didn't manage to break down our door.</span> <span id="s172">They were terrible, unbelievable.</span> <span id="s173">It was such like, like I said, I never had any contact with them before, but they turned like animals.</span> <span id="s174">It was just neighbors, people who you dealt with.</span> <span id="s175">They suddenly -- it was almost like they waited for it, like hungry dogs and so it was rough.</span> <span id="s176">It was really rough.</span> <span id="s177">You know, I read a book by an author by the name of Bothenheimer (ph).</span> <span id="s178">He's a Jew.</span> <span id="s179">I'm just telling you a little story about it.</span> <span id="s180">I belong to a study group, and in the book it described about a bunch of Jews who believed they were being taken by the Germans to a hotel and that eventually they would be staying there until after the war.</span> <span id="s181">I was the only survivor.</span> <span id="s182">The rest of the people in the group were Americans.</span> <span id="s183">And after reading the book the discussion was going on, how stupid could you be.</span> <span id="s184">Couldn't you just stand up against the Germans?</span> <span id="s185">Couldn't you just stand up against the Lithuanians?</span> <span id="s186">There were so many and there were only three or four soldiers around you.</span> <span id="s187">And I was absolutely furious, because it wasn't a matter that we were weak, or that we were like sheep.</span> <span id="s188">We had no choice.</span> <span id="s189">How can you just protect yourself against a bunch of mad dogs.</span> <span id="s190">You just can't do that.</span> <span id="s191">I mean people did it, and they were immediately killed in front of you.</span> <span id="s192">So you just hoped against hopes that you will make it without making any waves.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Now, in the first few days after the bombs were dropped and the Lithuanians were running around beating people, can you describe what else was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Not really, not really.</span> <span id="s195">Just trying to figure out what's going to be next, and we were at home most of the time.</span> <span id="s196">We wouldn't dare walk out of the house until they came around with those loud speakers directing us what to do.</span> <span id="s197">But we packed.</span> <span id="s198">We packed mostly silver and mostly valuable things because, you know, in spite of the fact that we hadn't experienced things like that since almost 1924, for I'd say almost 20 years or so, or less than that, we lived a relative normal life.</span> <span id="s199">Really, a normal life, but when something happens to you you kind of know it's the survival of the fittest.</span> <span id="s200">You kind of know what to do.</span> <span id="s201">And you start thinking, you don't need a pillow, you don't need extra clothes, you need something that you can trade eventually.</span> <span id="s202">So, we took the silver and some of the jewelry, which my mother had and every upper middle class family had something, because there was no stainless steel and there was no other kind of this stuff which is sold here now, so whatever you had was kind of silver or gold.</span> <span id="s203">It was not synthetic.</span> <span id="s204">And we knew that the farmers outside in the country will be glad to acquire it, to exchange.</span> <span id="s205">Not that we ever experienced it before, but like I said, it's something that you just know.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Now, I know a lot of people were herded up, right away taken outside of the city and killed.</span> <span id="s207">Was this something that you were aware of at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: No, no I found out later on.</span> <span id="s209">Like I said, we were just lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Did you have any contact with the Jewish part of the city, Slobotka (ph), at this point, or were you separated?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s212">We did not live -- we lived in Kovno.</span> <span id="s213">Actually we lived behind the Post Office.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">There was the front of the Post Office and behind was the interior where they had buildings.</span> <span id="s215">We lived in one of the apartment buildings behind the Post Office.</span> <span id="s216">So, maybe that's why, now that I'm thinking about it, maybe they just didn't want to destroy the Post Office.</span> <span id="s217">They thought maybe the Post Office not too many Jews live.</span> <span id="s218">I don't know, but we were not bothered.</span> <span id="s219">We just waited to hear what the next step would be.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: It was several weeks, and then did you have to move from where you were living?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s222">Then we were told that we had to go to the Ghetto because they were going to have a separate place, a Ghetto, for the Jews.</span> <span id="s223">All they kept on yelling was and we took whatever we could.</span> <span id="s224">Now, I don't remember how we got there.</span> <span id="s225">I totally forget.</span> <span id="s226">I mean I remember so many details, but this is one thing that I just do not remember how we got there.</span> <span id="s227">I know we didn't walk.</span> <span id="s228">It was quite a distance, and I know that we had quite a lot of stuff by the time we came to the Ghetto, so maybe Father arranged -- I can't really -- it's blank.</span> <span id="s229">All I know is that we wound up in a small apartment, which was called at that time the Small Ghetto and which was actually this is where most of the Jews were brought in that particular part of the town.</span> <span id="s230">And then after a short period of time, they started coming in and asking for silver and whatever you have, all your valuables, the ones who brought there, and I remember my parents handing over a box of something with stuff.</span> <span id="s231">They saved some of the other ones and then after that there was the big which was called, they decided to shrink, that was their method to shrink up the area, and we were told to come out on the field, four in a row.</span> <span id="s232">Actually eight in a row.</span> <span id="s233">We started out, and my best friend and her brother and her father and mother were in the same row with the four of us, and they were the other four.</span> <span id="s234">And they said, everybody eight in a row and just walk.</span> <span id="s235">And the Germans, young, absolutely young faces, must be 18 or 19, inconceivable how you can motivate young people to be so cruel.</span> <span id="s236">They just walked and they separated in half, four and four, and they send my friend and her family on one side and my father and mother and brother on the other side.</span> <span id="s237">We didn't know what happened.</span> <span id="s238">It turned out that her side was the bad side, and these people from that particular side never came back.</span> <span id="s239">They were taken and they were killed.</span> <span id="s240">Now, all I can contribute it to is luck.</span> <span id="s241">She certainly -- I wasn't certainly better than she was and her family.</span> <span id="s242">We were both the same people and so, I'm here probably because I was just lucky.</span> <span id="s243">So, when they shrunk it, when they eliminated almost half of the population, we had to move to another area in the Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: This was when, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: This was only 1941.</span> <span id="s246">It was quite early.</span> <span id="s247">Q: Soon after the Ghetto was formed?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Yes, yes, because at the same time they also called out, they asked for 500 people who are, I mean, personalties, who speak German, who are educated, who are so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s249">They had names and these people who were actually dealing with Germany for years, my father almost went because he represented a Germany company too in 1932, and who were professional people.</span> <span id="s250">They all went, hoping that they would be able to do something to negotiate with the Germans or influence them.</span> <span id="s251">They were called out, and they were killed.</span> <span id="s252">This was known as the 500, the top, the cream really of the Jewish population.</span> <span id="s253">So, that was all in the same period of time, and they were trying somehow, in retrospect that's the only way I can understand, to kind of shrink the population.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Now this action that you were talking about where 500 people were taken away, this was in the beginning days of the Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s258">My uncle actually was one of them.</span> <span id="s259">He was taken away, and his wife and a child lived with us in the same apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Tell me a little bit about when you lived in the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s261">Who was with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Well, we had a kitchen, a bedroom and a dining room.</span> <span id="s263">My brother and my mother and my father and my aunt, who's husband was taken away with the first 500, and her child , who was five years old.</span> <span id="s264">My father worked for the guild it was called, and I went in the morning to the area where they set up people to go to work, and I used to get up in the morning.</span> <span id="s265">My mother used to stay home, and my brother was younger, so he also stayed home for a short period of time with her.</span> <span id="s266">I used to get up and go out to, what do you call it?</span> <span id="s267">It was a large area where everybody got together near the gate, and there there were leaders.</span> <span id="s268">The Germans needed people, and it was like groups that they took them outside of the Ghetto to do some labor.</span> <span id="s269">I was lucky enough to fall into the group where my husband was heading that particular group.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: You mean you met him?</span> <span id="s271">He wasn't your husband then?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: No, of course not.</span> <span id="s273">I was standing there, actually I was standing there in the group, and he had a group of men, and he said he needed a secretary, and he asked me to join him.</span> <span id="s274">So, I was lucky.</span> <span id="s275">So, I was working in his group.</span> <span id="s276">What I was doing at that time, I wasn't doing secretarial work.</span> <span id="s277">I was working at an airport at that time.</span> <span id="s278">They were building the airport, and we had to carry wood and drag things and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s279">But, it was not too difficult because eventually I helped him to other things.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Like what?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Well, the Germans, they were kind of decent, and they said if you will accomplish your, what do you call it, if you'll accomplish what you're supposed to do, your quota, you will be able to get some extra flour from the farmers around.</span> <span id="s282">So, that is what everybody worked very hard.</span> <span id="s283">Whether you do or you don't, you don't get anything, but here you are told what you will be getting.</span> <span id="s284">We certainly were very conscientious.</span> <span id="s285">So, we got flour, and what I had to do, I had to divide and kind of weigh the flour and divide the portions to every single person.</span> <span id="s286">But, I was so generous that a few times there was none left for me.</span> <span id="s287">So, my husband told me, at that time he wasn't my husband, he said don't be so generous.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: You were also doing the heavy manual labor?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Yes, yes, yes, I did.</span> <span id="s290">But this is once in a while that they wanted to be kind they would say, yes, but I was working.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: What other kind of work brigades were you on?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: That's the only one.</span> <span id="s293">I was waiting most of the time, and then, of course, I was taken to the farm, a farm.</span> <span id="s294">The Germans needed, for what reason I don't know, a group of young women to take on a farm to apparently pick vegetables or plant vegetables on the farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">They dragged me out of this group, and we found ourselves on this farm.</span> <span id="s296">I got up in the morning and walked out on the farm and a German came galloping on a horse, a nice big horse with a saddle, and he looked at all of us.</span> <span id="s297">We were about 18, 20 women approximately and he picked me and he said to me "Have you ever ridden a horse?"</span> <span id="s298">I said no.</span> <span id="s299">He said, "Good, it's time to learn."</span> <span id="s300">So he got off the horse, and he removed the saddle, and he made me get up on the horse, and he must have talked to the horse or did something to him because the horse started running like a madman, and I thought to myself, you're not going to lose me off that horse, and I made it.</span> <span id="s301">Then I finally came down, he said, "Now you learn, now you can pick vegetables."</span> <span id="s302">So, I was there for a couple of days, and then I was lucky enough, because I don't think they came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Why did he ask you to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: It was fun for them.</span> <span id="s305">I mean, can you imagine a young woman going on a bare back horse who has never ridden a horse, and a wild one.</span> <span id="s306">You know what it means to holding onto the horse, not to fall off and break your neck, because that was what he was probably hoping.</span> <span id="s307">Who knows, they were mad.</span> <span id="s308">They were creatures from hell.</span> <span id="s309">They were absolutely mad.</span> <span id="s310">I don't think they looked at us as humans and that was exactly what I decided at one time.</span> <span id="s311">They didn't look at us as humans.</span> <span id="s312">I never looked at them as humans, and I'll just try plain and simple to survive because you couldn't look them in the eye.</span> <span id="s313">I know a young woman looked them in the eye.</span> <span id="s314">They slapped her to death.</span> <span id="s315">They couldn't touch us, thank goodness, because they were told they would be poisoned.</span> <span id="s316">Otherwise they would have raped every single one of us.</span> <span id="s317">We were 18 year old kids.</span> <span id="s318">That's what they did.</span> <span id="s319">They did all kind of things for recreation.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Tell me a little bit more of what life was like in the Ghetto itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: Well, life went on when it was quiet, kind of normal in a way.</span> <span id="s322">We met, we kissed, we drank, we had fun when we had the opportunity.</span> <span id="s323">The young ones, we really tried to live as normal a life as you could.</span> <span id="s324">You're talking about people who are 18 or 19 years old.</span> <span id="s325">We have no responsibilities, we have no children.</span> <span id="s326">We have no family.</span> <span id="s327">Now, my mother had a stroke.</span> <span id="s328">I mean she just, as a matter of fact, her brother was killed, and then they had the children here, and they made my aunt take her child to be killed.</span> <span id="s329">She saw her child being killed, being put on a car, on a truck and I think -- I don't know, I heard gasoline.</span> <span id="s330">I don't know.</span> <span id="s331">When my aunt came back, she was mad for a short period of time, and my mother had a stroke.</span> <span id="s332">But she survived, and she was pretty good and that's thanks to my brother.</span> <span id="s333">He really came through.</span> <span id="s334">He was three years younger than I was, but he was a very smart determined young boy.</span> <span id="s335">First of all, he was tall.</span> <span id="s336">He was blond and didn't look Jewish at all and that was in his favor because every time he used to go to work, he used to just leave the place and go to Lithuanians, whom he knew, and traded some silver or whatever my mother gave him.</span> <span id="s337">My mother used to give him a piece of silverware at a time so they would wait for the next piece.</span> <span id="s338">He really supported the family.</span> <span id="s339">When my mother had her stroke, I was married then already, so when my mother had the stroke, he was really there for her, and he brought her everything, and he brought her to the point where she could walk and talk.</span> <span id="s340">So, you ask me how was life, if you asked me or all my friends, it's different.</span> <span id="s341">Because you know youth, we'll overcome.</span> <span id="s342">You cannot help it, so we'll do it.</span> <span id="s343">It's careless, I don't think it was an adventure because it was probably miserable because this one is gone and that one is gone.</span> <span id="s344">The whole thing was kind of scary, and the guys also, they are afraid they were going to die tomorrow, let's have fun.</span> <span id="s345">For young people it was bad, but not as bad as for my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: Were there cultural activities, political activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s348">No cultural activities, no political activities, you just try to live from day to day and work, and if you have a chance to have some fun, get married because you were safer.</span> <span id="s349">I think we got married after that incident on the farm because I wouldn't say it was safer to be married.</span> <span id="s350">I mean, I liked my husband and he liked me and he asked my father for my hand and my father said by all means if anybody will take care of you, he's the one who will, and my father was absolutely right.</span> <span id="s351">So, we got married.</span> <span id="s352">Not that it mattered much eventually, because they separated us eventually.</span> <span id="s353">But everybody felt that if you were married you were kind of safer.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Did you move in with his family or he came where you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: No.</span> <span id="s356">We got married on a Saturday, must have been because we worked on Friday, and I moved in -- actually I couldn't move in right away with his family.</span> <span id="s357">His family consisted of his mother, a brother and a sister-in-law, and they lived in one room.</span> <span id="s358">His mother was in the corner.</span> <span id="s359">I remember an iron bed.</span> <span id="s360">She was a semi-invalid.</span> <span id="s361">She had arthritis, a very bad case.</span> <span id="s362">She was in bed most of the time.</span> <span id="s363">My husband used to sleep on a cot, and then my brother-in-law and sister-in-law slept in the corner on a bed.</span> <span id="s364">When we decided to get married, my husband decided to build a second bunk, above my brother-in-law's bed.</span> <span id="s365">He built a very good one.</span> <span id="s366">He even cut in the wood a step for me to get up and down.</span> <span id="s367">So, it took him a while to build it.</span> <span id="s368">So, eventually I moved in with my husband in the upper deck, and he built a little shelf so I could bring my dowry with me, which my mother gave me before I left the house.</span> <span id="s369">She gave me about a pound of hard sugar, which was very valuable, more so than diamonds.</span> <span id="s370">I don't know how she kept it or where she kept it, and I brought my dowry up there on the second shelf.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: You had mentioned a little while ago, about the Small Ghetto being liquidated.</span> <span id="s372">That's where you were living at the time, wasn't it?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: When?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: When did you first move into the Small Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: Actually first we moved -- it wasn't the Small Ghetto, it was where everybody was.</span> <span id="s376">I don't know if it was called the Small Ghetto.</span> <span id="s377">Eventually they eliminated one and maybe the second one was called the Small Ghetto.</span> <span id="s378">Are you talking before the liquidation?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s380">In the beginning you said you were moved to the Small Ghetto, and even in the beginning, as I understand it, the Ghetto was in two parts joined by a bridge or something, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: I don't think so.</span> <span id="s382">There was no bridge.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: Well, I don't know, there was some sort of street, but there were two parts.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: Yes, right, you're right, there were two parts.</span> <span id="s385">I must have been in the small one originally.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: The one that they got rid of?</span> <span id="s387">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Were you there the day they decided to liquidate it?</span> <span id="s389">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: What happened is, they called everybody out in the field and there were eight in a row -- Q: Oh, this was that that you mentioned already, I'm sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: That's okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Do you remember a hospital in there that burned?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: No.</span> <span id="s395">I heard something about it, but I don't remember.</span> <span id="s396">This is when they liquidated the small one, and they separated my friend and her family from us, and we wound up in the other part.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Also in that month, a little later in that month, there was a very large action, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Later that month?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: In October, do you remember this?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Do you mean when they took children and old people?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: No, there was, I believe at the end of October, they took about nine or ten thousand people out, took them to the Ninth Fort, I believe.</span> <span id="s402">Do you remember this?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Okay, then I won't ask you about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: Because, you know, I remember it vaguely, but I really can't contribute much to it.</span> <span id="s406">I do know many people disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: All of a sudden a third of the Ghetto is gone?</span> <span id="s408">A: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: So you had to have noticed something?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: Oh, yes, I noticed it, but I don't remember.</span> <span id="s411">I cannot give you any details about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Was there a point in all of this when the atmosphere changed and people started to become more frightened, trying to make plans or hiding places or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Not then.</span> <span id="s414">After the old people and children action, this was when the people realized that something has to be done.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: When was that, can you tell me?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: This was the most horrendous time.</span> <span id="s417">It must have been in 19-- we got married in 1943, in November.</span> <span id="s418">It must have been in the beginning of 1944.</span> <span id="s419">It was -- I don't know the exact date, which is immaterial really.</span> <span id="s420">I wasn't working at that time.</span> <span id="s421">I was off that day, and my brother-in-law, my husband's brother was also home.</span> <span id="s422">So, the two of us were home with my husband's mother.</span> <span id="s423">Suddenly the loud speaker started screaming all the people and children out.</span> <span id="s424">And my mother-in-law, as I said was a semi-invalid, a wonderful woman, an exceptional lady.</span> <span id="s425">She used to teach me how to make gourmet dishes.</span> <span id="s426">She was a fabulous cook.</span> <span id="s427">She was a pharmacist by education, a wonderful lady.</span> <span id="s428">We didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s429">We knew she could not walk, so I looked at my brother-in-law, and he looked at me, and I said, let's hide her someplace.</span> <span id="s430">But before we had a chance to do anything, they just broke into the room.</span> <span id="s431">As I told you, we were in one room, all five us, and they said out to her from bed and I stood in front of her and I said, "She can't walk."</span> <span id="s432">So they gave me a slap.</span> <span id="s433">She can't walk, so carry her.</span> <span id="s434">So I said to Miska, my brother-in-law, let's put something on her.</span> <span id="s435">She was wearing a nightgown.</span> <span id="s436">Anyway, they wouldn't let us do anything.</span> <span id="s437">They made my brother-in-law grab her by the shoulders, and I had to grab her by the foot.</span> <span id="s438">I tried to pull down her dress-- it would break my husband's heart-- her nightgown, and we carried her out and the street was a nightmare because all you could see were young people carrying these old people like animals.</span> <span id="s439">And we carried her to the place where the busses were stationed, and he told my brother-in-law -- they are so young, it is unbelievable, the milk was still on their lips -- to stay, and I'm the one who should carry her out.</span> <span id="s440">Now, she was a frail woman.</span> <span id="s441">I must have picked her up, and I walked up on the bus, and I figured that's the end of me too.</span> <span id="s442">There was no seat, so I had to put her in the aisle, and I covered her up.</span> <span id="s443">They looked around to find a seat for me.</span> <span id="s444">So, they pushed me down the stairs and said, "you get out of there."</span> <span id="s445">That was my memory of this particular day.</span> <span id="s446">And I think this is when they took them to the Ninth Fort.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: You had a little brother at this time.</span> <span id="s448">What happened to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: He wasn't so little anymore.</span> <span id="s450">You grow up awfully quick.</span> <span id="s451">He must have been 15.</span> <span id="s452">He was an organizer.</span> <span id="s453">He kind of supported the family.</span> <span id="s454">Immediately after I got off the bus and I started running, because I was hysterical, because I was sure that my mother was gone also.</span> <span id="s455">So, I ran back to my mother's home, and there's my mother sitting in the chair with makeup.</span> <span id="s456">I don't know where by brother found makeup.</span> <span id="s457">She was 39 years old, my mother, or 40.</span> <span id="s458">My father was completely beside himself.</span> <span id="s459">My father got lost in himself rather, so my brother who is the one who fixed up her hair and put makeup on her and told her to sit in this chair and don't move and smile.</span> <span id="s460">So, when the Germans came in, she was young, you know.</span> <span id="s461">She didn't get up, she didn't blink, so they just let her be this time.</span> <span id="s462">What happened to him, was when the Kovno Ghetto was liquidated, we all were taken to the train, and he walked out from the march, he removed his yellow sign, and apparently he had friends, we knew he had friends, because he kept on dealing with them, but he disappeared.</span> <span id="s463">We don't know if a Lithuanian saw him walking out and immediately arrested him and some of his so called friends, but we never heard from him again.</span> <span id="s464">That was the end of my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: Were there sort of regular arrests or beatings or brutalities that you had to notice on a regular basis?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: In the Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Were there guards in the Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: You know, I used to get up in the morning and go to work and then used to come back.</span> <span id="s469">How much more brutal can it be what they did having to drag their mothers or fathers or children burning in front of you?</span> <span id="s470">I mean I didn't see it every day of my life.</span> <span id="s471">I don't think I'd be here.</span> <span id="s472">I'd be mad.</span> <span id="s473">I mean you can get hardened up to a point.</span> <span id="s474">They used to beat up people.</span> <span id="s475">It became, they beat you if they didn't like your face, they used to slap you and hit you.</span> <span id="s476">They needed us because we were laborers, especially the young ones.</span> <span id="s477">And of the old ones, they just periodically got rid of.</span> <span id="s478">The only brutality which was cruel is out of the Ghetto when we wound up in concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: When you just said that the children were burning, that was in the Ghetto?</span> <span id="s480">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Can you describe it?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: I don't know if I can describe it, but that's what my aunt said.</span> <span id="s483">I didn't see it.</span> <span id="s484">She said they dragged the kid away from her, a beautiful little girl, threw her literally into the truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">They had a truck there, and they moved it away somehow, and then it started burning.</span> <span id="s486">I don't know what they did.</span> <span id="s487">And then they just pulled it away.</span> <span id="s488">This was her description because she was beside herself.</span> <span id="s489">Or maybe they pulled it out of the Ghetto, and she saw the flames, but it was in her presence she saw that.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: What do you remember about the political organization of the Ghetto?</span> <span id="s491">I mean, how were things run?</span> <span id="s492">Who was running it?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: No.</span> <span id="s494">I really wasn't --.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Did you know anybody who was in the underground?</span> <span id="s496">A: My brother-in-law.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: But it was not something that you were involved in?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: Underground?</span> <span id="s499">No, I had a relative who wanted us to go to the underground right before the Ghetto was liquidated, but my husband didn't want to.</span> <span id="s500">And we didn't go, lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Apparently lucky, I don't know, whatever we did, it turned out we made it somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: Now you said after the children and old people were taken away which was I think March--?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: That then you really knew you had to do something?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: That's right, but we didn't.</span> <span id="s506">We tried -- there was nothing we could do because the people outside were not willing to help.</span> <span id="s507">So, as I said, we were cornered.</span> <span id="s508">We couldn't do anything about it.</span> <span id="s509">The underground -- there were all kinds of rumors going around.</span> <span id="s510">We just hoped that the Russians were going to come back soon.</span> <span id="s511">I mean on the radios they kept on saying the Germans are running for their lives, and they were already by then, so we were hoping they were just going to leave us alone while they were going to retreat.</span> <span id="s512">But they decided to take us with them, and that is when the two of us decided maybe we should build a bunker for the two us, because the bunkers which some of the people built, were sophisticated bunkers which were under the ground.</span> <span id="s513">It took them quite a while to dig.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">When we came to ask if they would let us in, they said it was filled up.</span> <span id="s515">There is no more room.</span> <span id="s516">So, we decided to do something on our own.</span> <span id="s517">So we decided to dig a hole for ourselves because they kept on saying the Russians are at our doorstep.</span> <span id="s518">They are going to enter Lithuania any day.</span> <span id="s519">So, the two of us worked through the night, and we dug a nice hole in the yard, and we put a large pitcher of water and some crackers, and we made a seat for ourselves down there, and we covered up the hole with a green pillow to make sure it kind of blends in with the landscaping.</span> <span id="s520">And then the next day or two days later, the Germans were rounding up the Jews to take them -- don't worry, wherever we take you is going to be better than here.</span> <span id="s521">So, we got into our hole, and we covered it very gingerly.</span> <span id="s522">We put the pillow on top of it to make sure that some of the leaves and branches could cover the pillow.</span> <span id="s523">We sat down, the two of us, and we figured we would last for a couple of days.</span> <span id="s524">There was enough air and water.</span> <span id="s525">The next thing we heard were people walking, making noise, Germans.</span> <span id="s526">They yelled, "look here, look there, there must be somebody here because there is a house and it looks like the door is open."</span> <span id="s527">And suddenly we had a boot coming in.</span> <span id="s528">One of the Germans stepped their foot on the pillow, and they started screaming, "come on out of there," and suddenly a rifle was put into the hole, and I came out absolutely muddy, dirty, and my husband came out absolutely muddy dirty, and luckily I have to say they were Austrians.</span> <span id="s529">Not that they are much -- not that I understand, I'm not sure, but one of them was an older man.</span> <span id="s530">He must have been 40, he said, "how many more are there?"</span> <span id="s531">I said, "just the two of us."</span> <span id="s532">He became hysterical, it struck him so funny.</span> <span id="s533">"Why should you want to stay here and be dirty and filthy.</span> <span id="s534">Go get washed and we'll take you to a nice place in Germany."</span> <span id="s535">That is how we were actually saved, because when the Germans left, they completely destroyed the Ghetto by fire and by bombing it and by all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s536">So, the people who were in the sophisticated bunkers, they choked to death.</span> <span id="s537">We definitely wouldn't have made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: When you work outside of the Ghetto, you have an opportunity to bring in some more food, because the food was limited in the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s541">So, therefore, one of us, when I didn't want to work , I didn't have access to anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Do you remember there being any kind of qualitative change when the Ghetto became a concentration camp?</span> <span id="s543">How that came about?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: Excuse me, the Ghetto did not become a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s545">The concentration camp was in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: I thought that Kovno they enclosed, and they called it an official concentration camp a little bit later on before the liquidation.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Pardon, before what?</span> <span id="s548">Q: In November of '43?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: No, they called it an official concentration -- who called?</span> <span id="s550">Q: I don't know, the history books, the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: It was a Ghetto.</span> <span id="s552">We refer to concentration camp in Germany, but basically it was different.</span> <span id="s553">Here we just lived in our homes.</span> <span id="s554">We had homes in Ghetto, despite of the fact that they came around every so often to eliminate a number of population.</span> <span id="s555">But in concentration camp, we were completely under their mercy.</span> <span id="s556">You lived in their quarters.</span> <span id="s557">You got up in the morning, and you were given a little pail with some sort of a spoon, and you got a cup of water.</span> <span id="s558">So, it could be called concentration camp, I don't recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: So, were there any other events that really strike you while you were still in the Ghetto?</span> <span id="s560">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s561">This was the worst that could happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: Towards the end, when they were trying to liquidate the Ghetto, I guess, what happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: Like I said, this is when we hid in the woods in our bunker, and they took us to where everybody was there.</span> <span id="s564">That is where I met my mother, and father and brother, because they were already in that large area where they were going to take everybody to Germany or to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: Where was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: This was in Ghetto.</span> <span id="s567">In Ghetto there was a large building which it, how should I call it -- they gathered everybody up there, and after they emptied out the Ghetto, they went from home to home, told everybody to go.</span> <span id="s568">The streets were full of people, I mean the handful of people that were left.</span> <span id="s569">I don't know numbers.</span> <span id="s570">And we all went except for us, the two us.</span> <span id="s571">We were the last, actually.</span> <span id="s572">Most of the people were gathered up already for the last two days while we were busy trying to save ourselves.</span> <span id="s573">So, there was a large building and that is where they distributed old people in separate rooms, groups of them, and then took them outside the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s574">And then my husband and I, the two of us, were brought to this place.</span> <span id="s575">Lucky enough, I found my mother and father, and Ralph found his brother and sister-in-law.</span> <span id="s576">So, we all stuck together, and then the Germans -- it was like a parade -- they opened up the doors and said "Now walk."</span> <span id="s577">And we walked out from the Ghetto to go to the trains where they took us to Germany because the Russians were chasing them.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Did you take anything with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Yes, that is what I wanted to say.</span> <span id="s580">Yes, you could take something with you, and I had my coat which my father -- I had my coat with me which my father made for me, I mean filled the lining up with mink skins.</span> <span id="s581">And we walked through the street, and as my brother walked out, removed his sign, his yellow star, and walked out and disappeared.</span> <span id="s582">And eventually we came to these trains, the cattle trains.</span> <span id="s583">And we got on the train, all of us, the whole family, and they brought us to Stutthof.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Before we get to Stutthof, I want to understand a little bit what the train was like, how many people were on it what that train ride was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: There were many people, like sardines.</span> <span id="s586">Everybody was pushed together.</span> <span id="s587">One woman was mad there.</span> <span id="s588">She was outrageous.</span> <span id="s589">And of course, everybody eliminated there.</span> <span id="s590">It was very very bad.</span> <span id="s591">It was very bad.</span> <span id="s592">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s593">How can I describe it to you.</span> <span id="s594">It was hell.</span> <span id="s595">And I was wearing my warm coat, wouldn't let go of it.</span> <span id="s596">And as we came to Stutthof, they told the women to get out, and they said we don't need you.</span> <span id="s597">You'll meet up with your husbands and fathers later on.</span> <span id="s598">So, my sister-in-law, the two of us got of the train, and I think, I'm not sure if they had transportation -- I think they had open trucks where we were piled in, and we were brought to Stutthof.</span> <span id="s599">And then we were told, of course, right away my coat was taken way, and whatever else I had, which was very little, I suppose, because I didn't have a chance to take anything with me.</span> <span id="s600">I held on to my mother, and then they told us to disrobe.</span> <span id="s601">You know, they had all these tables and young Germans sitting behind it.</span> <span id="s602">And they said to us, "Okay, go into this large area and disrobe."</span> <span id="s603">I mean by disrobe take everything off.</span> <span id="s604">So, here I am next to my mother, hundreds of women, and we had to be totally naked coming in in front of a desk with a bunch of young hoodlums.</span> <span id="s605">So, what do you think in a case like that.</span> <span id="s606">They are creatures from another planet.</span> <span id="s607">There was no planet then, but creatures from hell.</span> <span id="s608">Why should I bother worrying about them, whether they look at me.</span> <span id="s609">How demeaning can you even feel standing with your mother and relatives and families --my sister-in-law -- and here you're standing totally naked, and they look at you.</span> <span id="s610">So, I just stood there, and they just looked at us, and they told us to go in the back to take showers, and they gave us the uniforms, the striped uniforms, and this is how our ordeal started.</span> <span id="s611">This is concentration camp.</span> <span id="s612">Then they put us in those bunks which you have in the museum, it's exactly how the museum has it, in those bunks, and I don't know how long I was there, but it was awful.</span> <span id="s613">It was totally terrible, because mothers were taking the food of their children, not children, there were no small children.</span> <span id="s614">Daughters were eating up the food.</span> <span id="s615">I mean people were destroying each other.</span> <span id="s616">That was actually their idea.</span> <span id="s617">Whoever was weak and who could not overcome really were taking advantage of their own kind.</span> <span id="s618">Anyway, I was holding on to my mother as long as I could, and then one day they told us to come out in one of those areas which is similar to fairground, except there was no fair, for them it must have been a fair, and they did the same kind of system.</span> <span id="s619">We were walking, and I was holding onto my mother, and she walked pretty well, and she looked pretty good, and they took her away from me.</span> <span id="s620">They pushed me on one side, and they pulled my mother on the other side.</span> <span id="s621">I ran to my mother, and I was beat up pretty badly, and I was pushed away.</span> <span id="s622">That's the last I saw her.</span> <span id="s623">Then we were put into open cars, trucks, my sister-in-law and myself, and we were taken to some sort of a --</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: I need you to say that sentence again.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: We were put into open trucks, always open trucks.</span> <span id="s626">This is why for the life of me I cannot understand how everybody around there didn't know what was happening.</span> <span id="s627">They always saw us.</span> <span id="s628">The farmers around us, the people around us, they always saw it.</span> <span id="s629">And the Germans were showing off or whatever, and they were taking us to an area where they divided us into groups.</span> <span id="s630">And there I was with my sister-in-law, and a very young woman about my age, walked over to me and she said, "Do you mind if I join you because everybody was taken away from me."</span> <span id="s631">I said sure, why don't you join us.</span> <span id="s632">And then about after a half an hour or so, because we had to wait to be distributed wherever they were going to send us, two other woman came over, both of them actually were nurses, a little bit older.</span> <span id="s633">And they said,"You look like three nice woman, do you think we can join your group so we can stick together."</span> <span id="s634">So, we spent the rest of our time together actually.</span> <span id="s635">So, then they put us again in one of these open trucks, and took us to work in the fields, to build ditches for -- what do you call those things -- I can't think of the name at the moment, but it will come to me.</span> <span id="s636">So what they did is they housed us in tents, in regular tents, as you see here.</span> <span id="s637">They housed about 50 women, and in the middle of the tent was a little stove, one of those wood burning stoves, and they gave us a space on straw which this is -- so the five of us plopped down together in one corner, and we stuck together the five of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Where were they from?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: All of them from Kaunas, and we really stuck together, really stuck it out.</span> <span id="s640">Q: Were most of the other prisoners from Lithuania?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: Lithuania, yes.</span> <span id="s642">This was -- you see we were the last ones to be taken out of eastern Europe, so basically Stutthof was the political concentration camp.</span> <span id="s643">So, probably it was just so late in the game that they didn't take us any other place.</span> <span id="s644">So there were some gentiles in Stutthof.</span> <span id="s645">So, we were taken there in one of the areas, which was kind of in the woods, it was mostly in the woods, where we were digging ditches -- trenches, that is what it is, trenches.</span> <span id="s646">We dug very deep trenches, and that is really where the labor was hard, because they stood over you and made sure that you don't even take a breather.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: And if you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: Oh, they hit you.</span> <span id="s649">They really hit you without any mercy.</span> <span id="s650">Q: Were you hit?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: I was never hit, because I worked.</span> <span id="s652">I told you I just decided at one time, especially when I was standing there naked, that these are devils from some place, and I'm going to look at them as such.</span> <span id="s653">So, this was my -- I brainwashed myself.</span> <span id="s654">I figured they are not going to bring me down to their level.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: So you didn't stay in the camp of Stutthof that long?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s657">Stutthof, I think they kept -- I was there I would say about three days, approximately.</span> <span id="s658">It wasn't long, or maybe a week.</span> <span id="s659">I mean time -- I cannot tell you time.</span> <span id="s660">It was one thing I didn't think about.</span> <span id="s661">But it wasn't long, because I didn't work there.</span> <span id="s662">We didn't work there, but the rumors were that they were going to sterilize us all.</span> <span id="s663">And we were lucky to get out of there.</span> <span id="s664">Unfortunately, I couldn't get my mother out.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Were there any children there?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: No, but they wanted to sterilize us, because you know women, period.</span> <span id="s667">I mean, we didn't have our period.</span> <span id="s668">Thank God there was something in heaven, somebody was watching over us.</span> <span id="s669">We didn't for two years, but the rumors were flying around that they were going to sterilize all the young women.</span> <span id="s670">So, when we finally got into the woods, got up every morning and got our soup and went to work, and we dug those deep ditches, and then it was winter.</span> <span id="s671">And it was cold, and I used to break up the ice when I went in.</span> <span id="s672">There was a break once in a while, and get into the ice and wash myself because the biggest killer almost, and demoralizer, was the filth.</span> <span id="s673">The filth, the stench and the lice, and the five of us decided we were going to try to eliminate it by hook or by crook, because the people around us were unbelievable.</span> <span id="s674">Especially older people, also many young ones that gave up.</span> <span id="s675">They just didn't care.</span> <span id="s676">That was the biggest destruction, the filth, and this is what we -- two things we promised ourselves.</span> <span id="s677">We were going to keep our feet covered, and winter was coming, and the snow and as soon as you got sick this was the end of you.</span> <span id="s678">They did not tolerate anybody being sick.</span> <span id="s679">So, they watched how to kind of decrease the population there.</span> <span id="s680">So, when somebody woke up sick, if you went to the infirmary, chances are you'd never come back, or if you were too filthy.</span> <span id="s681">We decided we are going to keep clean, and we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: As I said, we broke up ice, got into the water and washed ourselves, and at night we used to dry our underwear on the pipe of the woodburning little thing.</span> <span id="s684">I think we were the only ones who did that.</span> <span id="s685">And then, I was the brave one, I used to run out in the middle of the night, when the soldiers were kind of resting or not expecting any kind of movement.</span> <span id="s686">I used to run out to -- if we were -- we were continuously being moved from one area to another because we finished one to dig those trenches in another area, then we were moved to another area.</span> <span id="s687">And you could see homes not too far away from us.</span> <span id="s688">I used to run out and go to the farmers.</span> <span id="s689">They used to give me some bread.</span> <span id="s690">At first I used to fill myself up with as much food as I possibly could, and then they used to give us loaves of bread, and I used to bring the bread to my four buddies.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: You could just sneak out?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: You couldn't.</span> <span id="s693">It was a fence, but it was a tent.</span> <span id="s694">There was a large tent, a very primitive kind of a tent and around they had the very primitive kind of wires, which they were not concerned about anybody going to run away.</span> <span id="s695">Where would you run, 50 women or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: And the guards were sleeping?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: It was -- they could have shot me, I'm sure, but as I said, I was a little bit of a daredevil I suppose.</span> <span id="s698">I didn't do it too often, but I tried it quite a few times.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: And the farmers were--?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s701">They give you a piece of bread and tell you get out of here.</span> <span id="s702">They were terrified you shouldn't stay long, that you shouldn't be caught--they shouldn't be caught, not I shouldn't be caught.</span> <span id="s703">But they knew, they knew they were willing to give you bread and feed you.</span> <span id="s704">I never had any problems.</span> <span id="s705">I stopped quite a number of them, maybe four.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: They knew what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: Of course they knew what was happening.</span> <span id="s708">You had to be absolutely blind or live someplace, I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: Who were your guards?</span> <span id="s710">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q; Where were your guards from, what nationality?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: Oh my God, Germans.</span> <span id="s713">You never talked to them.</span> <span id="s714">You didn't even look them in the eye.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">You look them in the eye you get beat up.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: Did you have a like a block elder or somebody just in charge of your tent?</span> <span id="s717">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: You didn't have that much --?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: No, no because we were mobile.</span> <span id="s720">They kept on moving us.</span> <span id="s721">We just kept our nose clean and worked, and that's about it.</span> <span id="s722">So the only time I was beat up was when I wanted my mother back.</span> <span id="s723">After that, I just figured I'm not going to mess around with them.</span> <span id="s724">I'm going to try to stay alive.</span> <span id="s725">And then the end came when they decided to take us on the "death march."</span> <span id="s726">And they knew, rumors started flying around that the Germans are retreating.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">The Russians are going to destroy them, so they decided to take us with them.</span> <span id="s728">To this day, I cannot understand why.</span> <span id="s729">I would really like to know what their -- they didn't have any reason for anything.</span> <span id="s730">They just did what they were told.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Did you know that's why they were moving you?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: Of course, absolutely we knew.</span> <span id="s733">And we started the "death march", it's called now.</span> <span id="s734">It wasn't called then, because we didn't even think about it.</span> <span id="s735">And they started taking us from village to village.</span> <span id="s736">We stopped in a bar at every village, and they kept on losing people on the way, especially people who didn't have shoes.</span> <span id="s737">And I happened to have a good pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s738">Before, this was the most terrible experience of my life -- one of the most terrible experiences of my life.</span> <span id="s739">Before we were taken on this death march, they delivered a truck with shoes.</span> <span id="s740">Somehow, luckily some German threw me a pair of good shoes.</span> <span id="s741">I don't know if he meant me or he meant somebody else, but I grabbed it, and I had a good pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s742">And I could see people that we lose are the ones who freeze their feet.</span> <span id="s743">It was cold.</span> <span id="s744">It was winter.</span> <span id="s745">It was in March or February, February I think, the end of February.</span> <span id="s746">And we kept on losing them.</span> <span id="s747">We came to a barn.</span> <span id="s748">In the morning they used to wake us up, and we walked again.</span> <span id="s749">They stopped in villages, the names that I happen to have, and one day one of the women who were part of my group said to me, "Why don't I try to go out and see," -- it was after the third village -- "to see if I can get some bread for us.</span> <span id="s750">You always are the one who has been supplying us with some extra food.</span> <span id="s751">Let me try, except my shoes are very bad.</span> <span id="s752">Why don't you lend me your shoes and I'll leave you mine," which were smaller.</span> <span id="s753">She had a smaller foot that I did.</span> <span id="s754">She left.</span> <span id="s755">She never came back.</span> <span id="s756">And I got up in the morning when I had to leave, and I looked at her shoes and I said, I'm not going.</span> <span id="s757">And my friends say yes you are.</span> <span id="s758">And I said I'm not going to die like a dog on the street.</span> <span id="s759">Let them shoot me here.</span> <span id="s760">I'm just not going because I knew this was going to be the end.</span> <span id="s761">You don't walk out barefoot.</span> <span id="s762">Now, I just want to tell you about human nature.</span> <span id="s763">In the one of the tents where we were, there was a woman who was a loud mouth and a very disliked person, but she always seemed to be able to get more than anybody else.</span> <span id="s764">One of those, you know, and everybody kind of stayed away from her because she yelled at everybody.</span> <span id="s765">She was rude, she was common -- I don't even want to call her that.</span> <span id="s766">She was a very disliked individual.</span> <span id="s767">And I'm standing there with my three buddies, and I said to them I'm not going.</span> <span id="s768">She appears from no where, and she said to me, "I have a pair of shoes for you.</span> <span id="s769">I have an extra pair for myself."</span> <span id="s770">She handed me a pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s771">She saved my life.</span> <span id="s772">I don't know what happened to her.</span> <span id="s773">I've been looking for her for many years.</span> <span id="s774">I never spoke to her.</span> <span id="s775">I never exchanged a word with her through the months that we worked together.</span> <span id="s776">But she saved my life.</span> <span id="s777">I put on my shoes, and I kept on walking.</span> <span id="s778">Eventually we wound up in the , which was the last village of this "death march."</span> <span id="s779">By then they knew, the Germans knew that they had lost the war and that the Russians were on their tail.</span> <span id="s780">They put us in a barn and that was really -- that was real hell because everybody was dying.</span> <span id="s781">I wouldn't be surprised that 85 percent of the people died there because the diarrhea and the stench and the frozen bodies were unbelievable.</span> <span id="s782">Every place you sat next to a corpse.</span> <span id="s783">And one of my friends I went to school with, actually she was not in the same area I was, this was kind of a -- they decided to gather all the rest of the area of these people in .</span> <span id="s784">It was like the last step, and she was in a different camp.</span> <span id="s785">She came over to me and she said, "Henny you are still walking around.</span> <span id="s786">Would you help me bury my mother?"</span> <span id="s787">And I helped her carry out her mother, because the first thing they did was make us dig deep ditches because they knew.</span> <span id="s788">And I dropped the mother on a pile of bones.</span> <span id="s789">And I went back -- I went back to this barn and surrounded by death, except my two friends.</span> <span id="s790">One escaped, two escaped on the way.</span> <span id="s791">The one with the shoes and the other one kind of also, she escaped.</span> <span id="s792">So two of them left, so the three of us, we're still holding on to each other and suddenly we hear voices.</span> <span id="s793">They closed the barn doors, it was like 10:00.</span> <span id="s794">I remember because we were liberated, it as an hour later.</span> <span id="s795">It was 10:00.</span> <span id="s796">They closed all the doors of the barn.</span> <span id="s797">They poured gasoline around, all around, and they were going to burn the whole thing.</span> <span id="s798">The next thing, it was a matter of I don't know -- the next thing, we hear bagging on our barn doors and Russian spoken.</span> <span id="s799">And they opened up the doors, and of course, the ones who could, walked out.</span> <span id="s800">I was one of them.</span> <span id="s801">And my friend, my two friends, immediately ran out, and I don't know, not too many ran out because as I said, I wouldn't be surprised if 15, 20 percent of people made it, were able to walk out.</span> <span id="s802">I mean maybe they carried them out.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">End of Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: I don't remember exactly but all I know is that when we were brought in there quite a number of people, but when we left, there were only a handful who could walk out.</span> <span id="s806">So, I ran out.</span> <span id="s807">A Russian grabbed me, and he handed me a rifle and he had our guards, these young shnooks, I think two or three of them or four of them, I think four of them, few, because some of them run away, lined up along the wall.</span> <span id="s808">And he said, shoot them.</span> <span id="s809">He handed me, it was clicked, the whole thing, he said go ahead.</span> <span id="s810">He said do it.</span> <span id="s811">I held the gun in my hand, and I thought to myself, that's ridiculous.</span> <span id="s812">Should I become like them?</span> <span id="s813">And I threw away the rifle, and the Russian he yelled to me in Russian , stupid.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: Did other people shoot at the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: No, they didn't.</span> <span id="s816">I'm telling you, I was the first one to run out because I walked luckily.</span> <span id="s817">So then they took my two friends, I think one of them could hardly walk, so we dragged her, and they went to the village.</span> <span id="s818">And the village, at that time, was deserted, because all the Germans ran away.</span> <span id="s819">And you could get in any house you wanted to.</span> <span id="s820">So, we found ourselves a house.</span> <span id="s821">The three of us settled in this house.</span> <span id="s822">And the first thing I did, I went to milk a cow.</span> <span id="s823">There was a cow in the back, and the cow kicked me, lucky, and she kicked the whole milk out.</span> <span id="s824">And if that wouldn't have happened, we would have died, because that was the first poison to drink milk or butter or anything of that sort.</span> <span id="s825">So, we opened up the cabinets, and it was Germany there, it was under German occupation, this area.</span> <span id="s826">The cabinet, there was food there called , the things you put in jars for the winter with the rubber seal, and they had all kinds of fruits, so we started with cook fruits, a little bit.</span> <span id="s827">And the next thing my two friends came down with typhoid.</span> <span id="s828">I didn't -- I wasn't very sick, but I was also sick, so I took care of them.</span> <span id="s829">And then the Russians came.</span> <span id="s830">The Russians were in the Army, and they needed women, and they were going from house to house, disregarding anything.</span> <span id="s831">That time we decided we weren't going to let anybody in.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: How did you know this was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: You know, that's a very interesting question.</span> <span id="s834">You know everything.</span> <span id="s835">You really do.</span> <span id="s836">It's an instinct.</span> <span id="s837">It's an instinct you find out.</span> <span id="s838">If your life depends on it or if it's something, you just find out.</span> <span id="s839">Probably somebody knocked on the door and said don't let in the Russians, even if they say they are Jews and they want to help you, because they are like animals.</span> <span id="s840">So, finally somebody came to the door and kept on banging and banging and started speaking Yiddish, "please let me in.</span> <span id="s841">I've been on the front for so many years.</span> <span id="s842">I'm a mess."</span> <span id="s843">I said, "we're all sick with typhoid.</span> <span id="s844">There is no place to sleep."</span> <span id="s845">They did not have any place to sleep.</span> <span id="s846">They didn't have any place because the houses, some of the houses, were taken up by the survivors which weren't many.</span> <span id="s847">And some of them, the Germans still were there.</span> <span id="s848">I don't know, but they said they were exhausted and they had to sleep.</span> <span id="s849">And he kept on speaking Yiddish and I decided I'll take a chance.</span> <span id="s850">So, we let him in, and he happened to be a very nice guy.</span> <span id="s851">And he laid down on the floor and slept.</span> <span id="s852">He was totally exhausted, and he just wanted to help us and see what he could do for us, and in the morning he left.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">And then I took sick, and then the three of us kind of made it, and we decided to keep on going.</span> <span id="s854">Now, I don't know -- the Russians, that's right.</span> <span id="s855">After we got well, they said they were going to take us to .</span> <span id="s856">And from there they were going to send us wherever we want to go.</span> <span id="s857">Since we are from Lithuania, they'll send us back to Lithuania.</span> <span id="s858">And I knew that I wasn't going back to Lithuania ever.</span> <span id="s859">So, we came to , and we worked there all of us.</span> <span id="s860">We actually watched the Germans load ships and boats, and we were actually the drivers.</span> <span id="s861">We were guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: For the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: For the Russians, yes.</span> <span id="s864">And then I decided, I heard rumors again, they were going to send us -- we were five women, they were going to send us back to Russia, not Lithuania.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">They'll send us to Russia someplace on one of those farms, and I decided I'm not going there.</span> <span id="s866">So, I took whatever I had, next to nothing, I threw it out of the window.</span> <span id="s867">There was a guard watching the area where the buildings where we were actually housed, Russian stayed there and people who worked for them.</span> <span id="s868">And they had a guard and a gate, and you just had to announce before you go.</span> <span id="s869">There was a curfew there.</span> <span id="s870">You couldn't leave just whenever you felt like it.</span> <span id="s871">But my window faced the outside, so I threw whatever a small bundle out, probably some underwear and whatever, and I just went to the guard, and I told him I'm going to the movies, and he said okay, go ahead.</span> <span id="s872">So, I went.</span> <span id="s873">I picked up my little bundle, and I ran to the train.</span> <span id="s874">And trains were going anyplace, no matter where you wanted to go.</span> <span id="s875">And I really didn't know where I was going to go.</span> <span id="s876">I said I wanted to go west.</span> <span id="s877">And I got on the train, and there were two underground soldiers sitting, and they said they come from Lodz, and they heard that in Lodz there is an organization, an organization was established to find out who survived.</span> <span id="s878">It's like what do you call those centers, where everybody sends their family -- but it's a center for all survivors so they can find people whoever tells them who they were looking for.</span> <span id="s879">There was no mail.</span> <span id="s880">I mean it was really only word by mouth, really.</span> <span id="s881">I said okay, I'll go to Lodz.</span> <span id="s882">So we arrived in Lodz at 6:00 in the morning, and they wanted to take me to a place to sleep over, and I didn't particularly care for that.</span> <span id="s883">So, when I got out of the train, I decided to make it fast, and they yelled, "we fed you with chocolate."</span> <span id="s884">They gave me chocolate, that's true.</span> <span id="s885">And I went away, and I got on a bus at 6:00 in the morning.</span> <span id="s886">My Polish was kind of rusty, so I asked the driver where is the Jewish center, and he said, "I'll take you there."</span> <span id="s887">So, I arrived there, and I walked in there and that was around 7:00, 8:00, and I registered, and I told them I want to work for you and they said okay, go behind there.</span> <span id="s888">So, that is where I wound up.</span> <span id="s889">I was bald then because we were all shaven.</span> <span id="s890">And I was wearing a turban usually.</span> <span id="s891">And then one afternoon when I got through working, I went upstairs in the common area where there are a couple of dozen women are sleeping on the floor in some kind of makeshift sleeping bags, and I removed my turban.</span> <span id="s892">I needed some fresh air, and I walked out in the hall to go over to a friend of mine, and there was my husband.</span> <span id="s893">So, he even met me without my turban.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: You must have been stunned.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: Yes, that's putting it mildly because I really didn't know what happened to him, and I was going to Israel.</span> <span id="s896">I figured what the heck, I speak the language.</span> <span id="s897">I don't have anybody any other place in the world so I might as well go to Israel.</span> <span id="s898">And they would have sent me awfully quickly because many Lithuania young people in '37 and '38, and I figured I would try a not a , but I will try it, and then I will take it from there.</span> <span id="s899">And then my Prince Charming appeared, and it was fun.</span> <span id="s900">And then we came to this country.</span> <span id="s901">We decided we were going to start our lives all over again.</span> <span id="s902">It's no use living in the past because we had nothing to do with it.</span> <span id="s903">The world had gone mad so what should we do.</span> <span id="s904">It could have happened to anybody.</span> <span id="s905">So we're not going to let that ruin us and bring up our children with complexes.</span> <span id="s906">They probably have other complexes, but certainly we didn't spoon feed them about our experiences and about the world that everybody is terrible, because there are some decent people in the world.</span> <span id="s907">It was just a terrible experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: When you do think about this, because even though you want to live in the present, you have to think about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: Well, sure I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: Are there certain memories that haunt you?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: Except that time when I knew I was going to die without my shoes.</span> <span id="s912">That's my worst experience in my life -- that's not the worst, but for personal -- I have never felt as close to death as this moment, never.</span> <span id="s913">Because, as I said I always think that things are going to turn out all right.</span> <span id="s914">Everybody calls me Polyanna, but I just hope it eventually will turn out all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: Let me ask you a strange question.</span> <span id="s916">How did you feel about being Jewish throughout this?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: I never thought of it.</span> <span id="s918">I never thought specifically about being Jewish, why it happened to me you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: Well, I'm wondering did you wish you weren't Jewish?</span> <span id="s920">Did you feel more Jewish than ever?</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: No, no I didn't feel more Jewish than ever.</span> <span id="s922">I'm going to tell you something.</span> <span id="s923">I don't if it has something to do with this.</span> <span id="s924">We have a son, and a daughter and seven grandchildren.</span> <span id="s925">And our son married a catholic young woman from France.</span> <span id="s926">And my friends were telling me -- it was a long time ago 21 years ago -- friends were telling me my god it's terrible.</span> <span id="s927">How can you take it?</span> <span id="s928">How can you live with it?</span> <span id="s929">I went to my rabbi and had a long conversation, and I said, you know intellectually I can understand it.</span> <span id="s930">She's a nice woman.</span> <span id="s931">That's what he wants, what the heck, who am I am?</span> <span id="s932">Emotionally I don't think I can take it but I'll probably take it.</span> <span id="s933">And as the years went on and people asked me I said, you know the more we have on our side, the better off we are.</span> <span id="s934">So, that is my philosophy in life.</span> <span id="s935">The more people think of Jews as equal people in this world, the more chance we have of not having something like that happen again.</span> <span id="s936">Because he was a madman and all his nation went mad.</span> <span id="s937">I mean these people went mad and the ones -- there are a lot of nice ones there I'm sure.</span> <span id="s938">I'm not going to condemn the whole German population, but the majority of them said they didn't know about it.</span> <span id="s939">How could they not know about it, and how couldn't they foresee it, but I'm not a philosopher to try and figure out.</span> <span id="s940">But it's terrible that people in power can motivate young people to become so unfeeling, so beastly without any remorse, and they can really turn them into terrible human beings, so it shows you.</span> <span id="s941">So, I can't tell you if I felt bad being Jewish or good being Jewish.</span> <span id="s942">I didn't think about it much.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: Anything else you want to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: I'm glad you are here because I was going to write a book, and I know I'd never get to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">So, I had very mixed feelings when you said you were going to come here.</span> <span id="s946">I knew I'd have to go through that ordeal, but at least our family and all our grandchildren and great grandchildren and so on and so forth, if they want to know something about us -- although they all asked through the years, the little ones and the big ones, but we always answered them what they asked.</span> <span id="s947">We never gave them more information.</span> <span id="s948">But now at least they can go to the museum and press a button and listen to their grandparents if they want to.</span> <span id="s949">If they don't want to, just let them be nice human beings.</span> <span id="s950">That's all we want them to be, and I thank you for coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">End of Tape #4 Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
