used to -- I used to jump on him and hit him, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Why did you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Cause I guess he aggravated me.</span> <span id="s158">And then, he used to hold me.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: And my mother used to say, you stupid, why you holding her?</span> <span id="s161">I didn’t want her to fall down.</span> <span id="s162">So he -- in a way he was protecting me, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s164">But you didn’t quite accept it.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: But it was nothing serious, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: Nothing like what the children do nowadays, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Nothing like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Nothing like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Did you start school before the war, a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: One year.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: One year.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Not quite a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: I-In kindergarten?</span> <span id="s175">Or did they --</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: No, it was first class.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: First class.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: First class.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: I remember s -- being very upset.</span> <span id="s181">I came home, cause the teacher told me to stand up, which I did, and she didn’t think I did, but I was so short that she thought I was still sitting down.</span> <span id="s182">Okay?</span> <span id="s183">That’s one thing.</span> <span id="s184">And then it was hard because it was -- I could already feel the tension in the first grade, and they were already beginning to be mean.</span> <span id="s185">And then -- I guess it was the tame -- time when Dad was in camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: And Mom wasn’t home, and -- and my grandparents did the best they could, you know, but it was -- we were all so upset with my dad, because for a long time we didn’t even know where he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Did you see him taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: You didn’t.</span> <span id="s191">You were not home.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: No [inaudible].</span> <span id="s193">He was taken in the street, because I was -- my brother and I were at our grandparents, cause things were not, you know, good.</span> <span id="s194">And so Mother left us there, feeling that children with older people are safe, okay?</span> <span id="s195">And she went back with Dad to their apartment.</span> <span id="s196">And as she walked from their apartment to come to us, they took him, just picked him up in the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: While they were walking together?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: While they were walking together.</span> <span id="s199">They just took him away.</span> <span id="s200">And -- and m -- Mother came by herself, and you know, they had like a staircase, I can just see it, like a spiral staircase, and I was hanging there waiting for them.</span> <span id="s201">And I looked down and she is hysterical, they took Papa, they took Papa.</span> <span id="s202">And I didn’t know at first what is she talking about, they took Papa.</span> <span id="s203">And then my grandparents came, you know, and -- and we got the picture, they took him.</span> <span id="s204">Just --</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Did you know who she was talking about --</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: -- did you realize that there were --</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Yes, I realized there was danger, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: There was danger, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: As much as they tried to protect us, not to tell us everything, somehow we just felt inside the fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: D-Do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: You could feel it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: You could feel it.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: You could feel it.</span> <span id="s215">And then you saw them, you know, marching, and they came up the steps, you know, with their boots, and stuff, and you could just feel creepy.</span> <span id="s216">And they never tried to scare us, always tried -- oh, you know, it’s going to be better.</span> <span id="s217">But yet she was so worried because she didn’t know where Papa was.</span> <span id="s218">So for four weeks we had no idea where he was.</span> <span id="s219">Then finally somebody told us that there -- a bunch of men in a basement, someplace in ha -- so then she went there, and she finally saw him.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Still in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: You know, they waved -- still in Vienna -- waving to her, and we knew that he was a smoker, so she was worried, you know, he should have -- now we would take away cigarettes, but at that time she was worried that he’d be miserable without his cigarette.</span> <span id="s222">But they wouldn’t let her give him the cigarettes.</span> <span id="s223">Anyway, and then they took him away.</span> <span id="s224">All of a sudden he’s not there.</span> <span id="s225">So then again we waited to see where.</span> <span id="s226">And he was able to write finally, in fact, I have letters.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: You do?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: Yes, I have letters that he wrote.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: And he went to Dachau first?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: Dachau first, yeah.</span> <span id="s231">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: So your -- you and your brother Heinz are at your grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: And is it your m-mother’s ma -- ma --</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Your mother’s parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Were they working?</span> <span id="s239">Were the f -- was -- were they wer --</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: No, they were older.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: They were older?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: I mean, they were in -- in their 70’s, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: No, I don’t think they were working.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: They were older.</span> <span id="s246">Well, it’s -- it’s all relative, isn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s248">Well, my grandmother, I think she -- we didn’t know what was wrong, but now thinking back, I think she had arthritis badly.</span> <span id="s249">But they didn’t have anything to give her to make her feel better.</span> <span id="s250">She was -- but she never complained, she just sat in her chair, tried be warm, and I -- warm things on her.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: And my mother had one sister, which was not married, so she was with them, you know, all the time.</span> <span id="s253">And that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: So who really took care of you?</span> <span id="s255">Your mother was living in their -- in that apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Yeah well, she -- she used to take care, but just when they took Papa --</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: -- then she wasn’t able to because she was standing in line day and night --</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: -- to get papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: And then, I don’t know if anybody told you, but she had to walk out of the house with a pail and a brush in case they decided to make her wash the floors in Vienna.</span> <span id="s263">Not the floors, the --</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Streets.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: -- the street, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: And did she?</span> <span id="s267">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: You don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: She never told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: She never told you.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Never told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: How did the -- your father is in Dachau --</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: -- and then he’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: -- and then Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: And he’s there for about a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: So how are you surviving in this year?</span> <span id="s282">Ho -- who has money and how do you get food?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: Well, first of all, my father had his parents still alive, which, you know, we were -- went there too, to see them, and they were, you know.</span> <span id="s284">And he had two brothers.</span> <span id="s285">Two brothers and two sisters.</span> <span id="s286">There were five of them.</span> <span id="s287">So there was family on that side.</span> <span id="s288">Only my mother’s side there wasn’t much family.</span> <span id="s289">So, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s290">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: You don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Did you see the f-family of your father as well --</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: -- together?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: Sure, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: So everybody -- you must have felt as a child, a -- a -- a lot of the nerves of everybody.</span> <span id="s298">Everybody must have been --</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Yes, yes, and -- and yet, they were so trying to protect us that they didn’t tell us half of the things what was going on.</span> <span id="s300">You know, nowadays, say you have to be honest with children, well, I guess they were brought up differently.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: Children -- like i-if someone died, the children never knew the person died.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: They just went away.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: Just went away.</span> <span id="s305">I don’t know why, but that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Do you think that was a bad thing?</span> <span id="s307">Do you think they should have told you more?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: No, I think I really appreciated that they didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: I really did.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: I really did.</span> <span id="s313">And we left -- Mother got some papers, so -- for him to get out of the camp, but we were able to take him out, but if he wouldn’t leave in 24 hours, Vienna, they take you back and that’s it, that -- you only had one chance.</span> <span id="s314">So thank God, she got papers, spend a lot of money, whatever she had on them, and they weren't worth anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: The papers were not worth anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Worth anything.</span> <span id="s317">And just on time, Italy opened up, all you needed was a passport, you could go to Italy, so -- which was a blessing, because whatever she had, Uruguay, Paraguay, I don’t know where all the papers were, but you couldn’t travel with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: You mean, so she had papers for him to go out of the country?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: Out of the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: But those papers were worthless --</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: Worth -- worthless.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: -- she paid money for nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s324">With a lot of harassment when -- while she was trying to get them.</span> <span id="s325">And I know that was so sad, because sometimes she rushed to be first, you know, to get there, and if you were first, then they put you at the end of the line.</span> <span id="s326">You know, they did -- tried anything to give you a hard time.</span> <span id="s327">So sometimes she came home crying.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s329">So that must have been very tough for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: So -- but she, you know, she did everything she could.</span> <span id="s331">So we got -- she got the passport from Papa, and then he didn’t have a picture, so quickly when he gonna came out, he took a picture, and that’s all the passport needed.</span> <span id="s332">And you can see his face is swollen like that.</span> <span id="s333">They gave him certain things that swelled the people up, especially the ones that they let out, to show that he is --</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: That he’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: That he is okay.</span> <span id="s336">But it was not a healthy look he had, you know?</span> <span id="s337">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Did he -- did he return to Vienna before he went to Milan?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: Yes, he came --</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: He did, so did you see him for that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Yes, yes, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: Was that a great day for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: The best.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: It was the best.</span> <span id="s345">So you missed him a lot, didn’t you?</span> <span id="s346">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: I went to the -- to the sta -- train station to get him.</span> <span id="s348">And a lot of them were [indecipherable] right in, he wasn’t there yet, but he came [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s349">That was the best sight.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: And -- and did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: And then we had to tell him, you know, that he has to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: So Milan, that was the closest, you know, to Italy that he could go.</span> <span id="s354">But we were so lucky that they let us in, just with the passport.</span> <span id="s355">And then he got there, and he -- I don’t know, he must have written, or I guess just a letter saying that -- we said we would follow him, your mother said that she would follow him with me and my brother.</span> <span id="s356">And he wrote, don’t come yet, because I cannot find work, and I don’t speak the language.</span> <span id="s357">Obviously.</span> <span id="s358">And Mom wrote him back, don’t write any more.</span> <span id="s359">We’re coming this and this time, wait for us at the station, at the railroad station in Milan.</span> <span id="s360">And that’s what she did, and that’s how she saved our life.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: By not paying attention to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: See, he was still so stupid -- excuse me, Dad -- after going through what he went through, he still didn’t believe that they would touch children and old people.</span> <span id="s363">He didn’t believe that.</span> <span id="s364">Or women.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: It was just the men.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: He thought just the men.</span> <span id="s367">And then he would leave us alone, but obviously, as we know later, they didn’t leave anybody alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: So he figured that we should stay safely at home, rather than going into the -- how would you say, into the world without knowing where we’re going, okay?</span> <span id="s370">But Mom was smart enough to -- and we wanted to take, you know, the grandparents, to follow us even, and his brother.</span> <span id="s371">One got out to England, the youngest one.</span> <span id="s372">The older one had a wife and a baby, cutest baby.</span> <span id="s373">And no, he had -- she had a father, and he had the parents he wouldn’t leave, you know, and he still had a sister.</span> <span id="s374">They didn’t believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: They didn’t believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: They didn’t believe, because they, you know, they took them all, after.</span> <span id="s377">I -- I finally went to Vienna, I made one trip to Vienna, after 35 years, 40 years, I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s378">And I asked if they know what happened to my family, grandparents.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: So then they wrote me with a list of what camp they were taken to.</span> <span id="s381">Camps that I never heard of.</span> <span id="s382">But they said there was nothing unusual because they had like 250 camps.</span> <span id="s383">You know, you only knew about the big ones --</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: -- like Dachau, Buchenwald, Auschwitz, and Bergen-Belsen, all those.</span> <span id="s386">But the little ones you didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Yeah, there were hundreds of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: Hundreds of, yes.</span> <span id="s389">And they wrote me, you know, where they were killed, and wa -- they even had written down what day they wer -- died.</span> <span id="s390">They don’t say killed, the day they were died.</span> <span id="s391">Some of them I think they had wrong names, but I had an idea of, you know, when it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: So, who did travel with you besides your -- your -- or you went, you -- they didn’t travel with you, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: -- you and your mother and --</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: Ju -- and father --</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: -- Heinz, your brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: -- and mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: And your father’s already in Milan.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: In Milan, yeah.</span> <span id="s400">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: And did your grandparents come, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Nobody.</span> <span id="s404">Just -- just the three of --</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: Just the four of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: The four of you together.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Just the four of us.</span> <span id="s408">Nobody else made it out.</span> <span id="s409">Nobody else made it out.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: And you took a train to Milan from Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: Yeah, we took a train.</span> <span id="s412">And we got very nervous c-crossing, you know the -- the border, cause you never know --</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: -- what they’re gonna do with you.</span> <span id="s415">And the passport has a big J on it, so there was no -- you know, they’re asking me always when there’s my name, middle name, you have a middle name?</span> <span id="s416">At that time they did not -- children did not get middle names like now.</span> <span id="s417">But Hitler gave us a middle name.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Yes, what was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: Sarah.</span> <span id="s420">Sarah, Sarah -- all the Jewish people were Sarah and the men were Israel.</span> <span id="s421">Even in the passport it tells there, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: So did you have a passport?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s424">Well, on my mother’s passport.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: On your mother’s passport?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s427">Mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: And Heinz was on the mother --</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Heinz, too, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: -- was on the mother’s passport.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: Mother’s passport, three of us on one passport, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Was your mother able to take out any money, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: Not much.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Not much.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: We didn’t have much.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: And we were afraid to take any possessions because we didn’t trust them, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: -- [indecipherable] in the border.</span> <span id="s440">So we just took like we were -- we wanted to take -- the warm blankets like they had in Austri --</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: A quilt?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: A quilt, a [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: A down?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: A down.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: You know, we all had down, and Mother wanted to take for us.</span> <span id="s447">And then my brother says, don’t take it, don’t take it.</span> <span id="s448">He was afraid, you know.</span> <span id="s449">So then later, while we still were able to converse with them in Vienna, my aunt decided she’s gonna s-send one to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: You --</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Never got that.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: -- never got that.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Never got that.</span> <span id="s454">But I know she did.</span> <span id="s455">And none of the jewelry or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: We didn’t take anything.</span> <span id="s458">My mother’s, you know, just wedding ring.</span> <span id="s459">I had a charm bracelet, you know, which I was so fond of, but we had a feeling like maybe my aunt put it in the quilt, because she knew that I liked it.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: But maybe that’s when they found that, they just took everything away.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: You just never knew what they were -- and I forgot to tell you that in the morning they came to pick up my father.</span> <span id="s464">If he wasn’t gone --</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: They would have picked him up.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: They would have picked him up, yeah.</span> <span id="s467">They would have taken him.</span> <span id="s468">W-We could hear it on the steps, too, you know, they were --</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: The boots?</span> <span id="s470">The shoes?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Yeah, the boots, coming up the steps and knocking on the door like crazy.</span> <span id="s472">And my poor grandmother was so, you know, scared.</span> <span id="s473">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: So they came to your grandmother’s house?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: They came to my grandmother’s house, because Mother, you know, was with us more than she was -- she gave up the apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: But what’s the use, you know, to pay rent there, and you know, not be there.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: So, she was wi --</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Did you wear a j -- have to wear a Jewish star?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: You didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: No.</span> <span id="s484">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: Did your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Her sign was the pail.</span> <span id="s489">The pail and the brush.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: And her passport.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: And her pa -- she didn’t have a passport then.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: She only had the passport when you were leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: For Papa, yeah.</span> <span id="s494">For Father.</span> <span id="s495">That was the important one.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Yeah, that he got away.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: When you were on the train, do you remember feeling scared?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s500">Til we crossed the border [indecipherable] to border.</span> <span id="s501">One of the -- one of the borders which was very tense.</span> <span id="s502">When they come in -- they really scare you when they walk in, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: They were so scary looking.</span> <span id="s505">Well, they let us go, and that’s the main thing.</span> <span id="s506">My brother, I think, was more scared than me, even.</span> <span id="s507">Maybe cause he was older, he was smarter to be scared than me.</span> <span id="s508">So he was really nervous when they got --</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: Were you in a compartment in the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: Alone?</span> <span id="s512">Or were there other people there?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: No, other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: There were other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: Other people, yeah, other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: Do you know if they were Jewish and they were trying to escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: You have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: I didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: So there was no</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: Maybe they knew, but they didn’t -- Mother didn’t tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: They didn’t tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: Were you holding onto your mother a lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: No.</span> <span id="s528">I was just sitting scared, too scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: Did you feel, at that age, closer to your father than your mother, in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: I felt closer -- no, I felt pretty protected by Mom, but I felt closer to Dad, because they took him.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: You know?</span> <span id="s533">I was worried about him.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: So you had a lot of protective instincts, didn’t you, as a kid?</span> <span id="s537">Interesting at such a young age, to be like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: I worried about him.</span> <span id="s539">Whew.</span> <span id="s540">But thank God --</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: He was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: -- he came out.</span> <span id="s543">There was -- and you know, my father never talked about.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: Never?</span> <span id="s545">Did you want him to?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: I didn’t really want him to, not at that young age.</span> <span id="s549">Maybe later on I would have liked to know certain things.</span> <span id="s550">But I tell you why he didn’t.</span> <span id="s551">He felt insulted by the situation, you know?</span> <span id="s552">He felt so degraded.</span> <span id="s553">He didn’t think that he was deserving of such a thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: So he didn’t want to talk about it, no.</span> <span id="s556">Was strange, but he never talked about it.</span> <span id="s557">The only thing is, you know, when they -- in the street when they were walking, and they met someone from -- they used to say K. Z., K. Z. lager, and they knew each other, and then they called my father’s name, it was like this, you know, he was jumping.</span> <span id="s558">So it was always a hard thing when he -- when he met someone in the street and they called his name, he was like an attention.</span> <span id="s559">And was so sad to see that.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: And this was happening in Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: It was happening in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: We have to stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: Evelyn, do you remember arriving in Milan?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: Remember getting off the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: Train?</span> <span id="s569">Yes, because my dad was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: That’s how you remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: It was happiness.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: Did -- did you and your mother s -- and your brother study a little bit of Italian before you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: No.</span> <span id="s577">How long --</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: We didn’t have time.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Do you have any idea how long it was between when your father got there, and when you got there?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: I would say maybe a couple of weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: That’s all?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: Yes, we rushed.</span> <span id="s583">I think.</span> <span id="s584">It might have been longer, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: So you think you got there 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: 1939 -- end of ’39, I guess.</span> <span id="s589">I have to look it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: You have to look.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s592">Let me see.</span> <span id="s593">I don’t even know if it says here.</span> <span id="s594">Think there were some dates here.</span> <span id="s595">There’s -- maybe here.</span> <span id="s596">Okay.</span> <span id="s597">1930 -- 1940 was already.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: 1940?</span> <span id="s599">So it was after the war started?</span> <span id="s600">After the attack on Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: Escape from Vienna.</span> <span id="s602">Yeah, must -- must have been the end of 1939, ’40.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: ’40, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s606">So where did you live when you were -- after you we --</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: Well, he had an apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: He did?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Yeah, with one -- one room, you know, just one room.</span> <span id="s610">And I don’t have a big memory of Milan at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: Were you there for very -- you weren’t there for very long, were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: I don’t think very long, no.</span> <span id="s613">But a few weeks, quite a few weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: But I don’t have a very good memory of that.</span> <span id="s616">I remember being there, not knowing -- and I remember coming down stair -- steps, and whoever was there, the landlady or whatever you call her, tried to teach me to say, you know, good morning, good evening.</span> <span id="s617">And then I tried to remember which was morning, which was evening, you know.</span> <span id="s618">That was kind of hard, you know, to learn all of a sudden, a language.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: So what’s good morning in Italian?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: Buon giorno.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: And what’s good evening?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Buona sera.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: So you eventually learned, didn’t you?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: Yes, I did learn.</span> <span id="s625">My favorite language.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: Is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: It’s a beautiful language.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: Yes, I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Your father didn’t have work when you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: How did he get an apartment, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: I guess with the little money that he took with him, you know.</span> <span id="s636">But then we had to leave Milan, then someone talked us into going to France, that we could be saved in France.</span> <span id="s637">So we went to Italian city, Ventimiglia, which was on the border of someplace.</span> <span id="s638">And over there there were people that were leaders, to take you over to France, through mountains and woods, you know?</span> <span id="s639">But they needed money, you know, they wanted money, they did it for money.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: So we stayed there for awhile, and waited for the right people to come to take us.</span> <span id="s642">And some people came back.</span> <span id="s643">I remember that so clearly, they couldn’t get them across.</span> <span id="s644">And here comes this young woman, we were sitting and having lunch.</span> <span id="s645">We had like, I remember, a lunch -- you know, lunch is the big meal in Europe, just one, either one minestr -- minestrone, you know, the vegetable soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: Which filled you up and it was good.</span> <span id="s648">And that’s all we could afford, you know, just have this plate of soup, or -- I didn’t get used to spaghettis yet, you know, I didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: You didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: No, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s651">I couldn’t eat the spaghettis.</span> <span id="s652">The only one between the four of us, my mom.</span> <span id="s653">She liked them right away.</span> <span id="s654">But we didn’t, so we had the soup.</span> <span id="s655">And we’re sitting in the restaurant, and he -- here comes this young woman, scratched from top to bottom, just scratches on her.</span> <span id="s656">And she stands by the door, like out of her mind, and she pees in front of everybody, just standing there on the door.</span> <span id="s657">She lost her mind.</span> <span id="s658">She absolutely lost her mind trying to get up, you know, the mountains, and they had so many thorns there that wherever they were going, it just scratched the hell out of her, you know?</span> <span id="s659">And mu -- she must have gone through such a terrible thing that she just didn’t know what she was doing.</span> <span id="s660">She was crying, just crying.</span> <span id="s661">And I told my parents, “We have to go through that?</span> <span id="s662">That’s terrible.”</span> <span id="s663">So Mother said, “Yeah, but we already gave them all our money, you know, we have to go.</span> <span id="s664">We don’t have anything left.”</span> <span id="s665">But then some word came that it’s over.</span> <span id="s666">They’re not going any more to France.</span> <span id="s667">So we didn’t have money, we didn’t have a ride, we didn’t have anything.</span> <span id="s668">So we went to the -- to the station, to the railroad station to get out of Ventimiglia.</span> <span id="s669">And somehow, I guess -- I don’t know if the Jewish emi -- Jewish people helped, or who helped, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s670">But they got us -- we were able to get on the train to Genoa, okay?</span> <span id="s671">So we got on the train -- we got on the train and my dad, he is -- was such a good person, he was the leader.</span> <span id="s672">He had a little more, you know, brain than some of the people, so he was the leader and he got everybody on the train, and he was left behind.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: You were on the train, and he was not on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: Do you I have to tell you more?</span> <span id="s675">Did this get -- did I get hysteric -- you darn right I got hysterical.</span> <span id="s676">And they had soldiers on the train, they were all trying to comfort me, I don’t know -- didn’t understand what they were saying to me, you know.</span> <span id="s677">But I know they were nice to me.</span> <span id="s678">You know, the Italian?</span> <span id="s679">And they tried to calm me down.</span> <span id="s680">And the -- I don’t know what you call the guy that was running -- not running the train, but the people that are on the train, don’t worry, don’t worry, because next stop -- he tried to explain to me the next stop, they gonna put him on the next train and we just have to wait.</span> <span id="s681">But that was 100 years we waited.</span> <span id="s682">You know?</span> <span id="s683">We had just gotten him, and now to lost him again, it was horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: So did they hold your train?</span> <span id="s685">They would --</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: No, they -- we -- we got to Genoa and just waited at the station --</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: -- for the next train.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: The next train.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: Til he finally got out.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: Got out.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: So then, we were in Genoa, where do we go?</span> <span id="s693">You know, what do we do?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: So there was a piazza, you know, in Italy, they have a lot of piazzas, and there was a piazza Christopher Columbus.</span> <span id="s696">And that’s where we wanted to go because we felt closer to America, being --</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: -- Columbus was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: So we went on that piazza.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Now this is after your dad comes?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: After my dad, sure --</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: You wait --</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: -- we waited</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: -- you’re waiting for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: -- oh yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: -- oh yeah.</span> <span id="s709">And then we needed something, we hadn’t eaten a long time, too, and they had like milk, you know, they sell milk, warm milk in Italy, big -- big cups, like a bowl more.</span> <span id="s710">And we had some of that with some bread in that, you know, which was any thing inexpensive that we could get.</span> <span id="s711">And so we had a bite of that, what did we do now?</span> <span id="s712">So then the Italian government gave us a subsidy.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s714">A: They did, yes, they did give us some money.</span> <span id="s715">I don’t know exactly how many liras, but it helped -- helped us, you know?</span> <span id="s716">And then we got into an apartment.</span> <span id="s717">They helped us to get into an apartment.</span> <span id="s718">I am saying apartment, I’m -- it’s a room, we got a room with pens -- a penzione.</span> <span id="s719">Penzione.</span> <span id="s720">Fact, I got some pictures from that, too.</span> <span id="s721">And -- and we got one big room, and it was like below the level of the street, but we didn’t care, you know, as long as we were together, and -- in fact, we snuck in some people that were, you know, needy, didn’t know where to go, so we -- they slept with us on the floor, whatever.</span> <span id="s722">We snuck them in at night.</span> <span id="s723">I remember that.</span> <span id="s724">Of course, Mother never told us that we were sneaking them in, but I think we were smart enough to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: They didn’t pay us, you know, they didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: Did this room have furniture?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: It did?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: It had beds, and closet, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Now, ho-how were you and your brother -- are you just good kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: You know that the situation --</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: Yeah, oh yeah.</span> <span id="s735">We were good kids, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: They never had trouble with us, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: Unless you got separated.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: We never wanted to get separated --</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: -- no, we stuck together like glue.</span> <span id="s742">So -- and then -- then came the order.</span> <span id="s743">I don’t know why, that we had to leave Genoa, but the men had to be separated from the women and children.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: Let me ask you something before we go to that.</span> <span id="s745">How -- about how long are you in Genoa?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: I would say --</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: Is it a few months?</span> <span id="s748">You could check.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: Well, actually, my brother was Bar Mitzvah’d in Genoa.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: He was?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: He was.</span> <span id="s752">He was 13 then.</span> <span id="s753">He was barmit -- okay, let’s see.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: You’re eight or nine years old --</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Eight or nine.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: So he’s 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: Yeah, he’s 13, and I is -- again skipped something.</span> <span id="s760">While we were in Genoa, the Jewish community sent the children -- the Jewi -- Italian people were taking in children to feed them lunch, you know, lunch is the big meal.</span> <span id="s761">They were giving us lunch.</span> <span id="s762">But I -- to this day I don’t understand why they separated my brother and I. I went to one family and he went to a different family to eat lunch.</span> <span id="s763">And it was very scary because there were already sirens going on, you know, the war was already beginning, or I don’t know what it was, but I had to walk quite a way to get to this -- was a woman that was -- her name was Celestina Weiss.</span> <span id="s764">And I remember her name.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: Celestina Weiss.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: Celestina Weiss.</span> <span id="s767">And she prepared lunch for -- not she, she had a -- a woman there who was cooking lunch for us, just the two of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: Just the two of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: Just the two of --</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: You were the only kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s772">Why couldn’t my brother be there with me, you know?</span> <span id="s773">So we would have walked together, I wouldn’t have to be so scared to walk by myself when the sirens came, and then the ha -- in Genoa they have large tunnels.</span> <span id="s774">So I rushed like crazy into the tunnel, cause that was like protection from the bombs.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: Was their air raids?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: Air raid --</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: There were air raids, weren’t there?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: Air raids, yeah.</span> <span id="s779">And you know, nobody would let you in once the air raids, so I’m running into those tunnels like crazy, til it’s over.</span> <span id="s780">But I’m by myself, I’m a little kid by myself, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: So how come your mother or your father didn’t walk with you, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: They were not supposed to.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: They weren’t supposed to.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: No.</span> <span id="s785">I came -- I think when I -- they had a little bit of schooling at the synagogue in Genoa, so from the school I had to go to the -- to it.</span> <span id="s786">And that there was so much left over, and I was thinking, why don’t she give it to me for my parents, but you know, I -- I was -- I couldn’t -- you know, I was not brought up that way, to say anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: I was just thankful for the meal.</span> <span id="s789">And my brother went to a different family, who was also very nice to him, but only him.</span> <span id="s790">And then when the Bar Mitzvah was, we went all to the synagogue there, and this family that was feeding my brother, they send us to -- they made reservations in a restaurant to -- you know, to celebrate his Bar Mitzvah.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: You know they -- nobody came with us, just four of us.</span> <span id="s793">Now I’m thinking why?</span> <span id="s794">Why would not one of the parents, or -- I don’t understand that.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: You mean no -- the -- one of -- the -- the parents where he was going --</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: -- didn’t come?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: Just you --</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: They made reservation for the four of us to eat in a restaurant together, finally we were together in the meal.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: You know, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: But nobody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: But nobody else.</span> <span id="s805">Can you figure that one out?</span> <span id="s806">No.</span> <span id="s807">But that was war, I guess, and people were strange.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: Now the woman where you were eating lunch, did you -- did she talk with you?</span> <span id="s809">Di -- was it nice --</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: Yeah, she was nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: -- she was a nice person?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: Very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: Very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: And a lot of families were doing this for the Jewish --</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: And you could see the richness in her house.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: You know?</span> <span id="s819">I think where my brother was going, there were younger people, because they had children and this woman was -- right now, a -- a -- she doesn’t s-sound like she was that old, but you know, at the time, when you’re eight or nine, you would think she is -- maybe she was 50, and I thought she was 95, you know, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: How quickly did you learn to speak Italian?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: I would say within a year [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: Yes, so by -- by now in Genoa, you’re pretty good.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: I was already -- I was doing pretty good, not -- not as good as I wanted to, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: I’m -- I was getting along, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: Now, do you -- you are Jews in a Fascist country.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: And they do now -- by the time you’re there, they have anti-Semitic laws.</span> <span id="s829">Are you feeling anything against you as Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: You’re not.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: No, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: Not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: Not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: So you feel safe there, in some way.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: I -- I feel safe, yes.</span> <span id="s837">Til the order did come to separate us again.</span> <span id="s838">That was very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: Uh-huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: As you can imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: And l-let’s -- before we do that one, w-we -- you are going to s -- to some sort of a school, every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: Yeah, it’s a --</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: Jewish school.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: -- Jewish school, at the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: And are you learning academic subjects as well as religion or not?</span> <span id="s846">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: I think it’s subjects besides religion, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: Yes, they were trying to teach us, I guess, a little bit language, and math, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: Did you have homework?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: You don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: I don’t remember homework.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: You don’t remember homework?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: No.</span> <span id="s856">Don’t remember homework.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: Do you remember teachers?</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: I don’t -- I know they were there, but I --</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: But you don’t remember them?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: Not remember them.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: Now, in Genoa, are you living in the same place the whole time?</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: That ba -- that sort of basement --</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: Yeah, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: -- apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: Is your father working?</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: He couldn’t get work.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: So you’re living on the subsidy.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: We’re living on subsidy.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: Which can’t be very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: No.</span> <span id="s875">Just enough to exist, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: Now, are you hearing rumors about the war in the rest of Europe?</span> <span id="s877">I mean, you, as a kid you --</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: Well, you hear war because of the sirens, you know -- you know, and bom -- they were bombarding already.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: Uh-huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: There were bombardments.</span> <span id="s881">So, but you don’t really know what goes on here, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: So you don’t hear your parents talking, and -- and you don’t know --</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: Do you ask about your relatives in Vienna, what’s happening to Grandpa and Grandma?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: Yeah, I ask, but they didn’t know.</span> <span id="s886">I think my uncle was one that

grandparents, in my mother’s side.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: And he was giving us report, you know, that -- there’s certain toys that we had there, that he want my -- my grandfather wouldn’t give it away for anything.</span> <span id="s892">He had like a stepstool, and my brother put nails in it with his initials, see?</span> <span id="s893">So my uncle wanted it for his son.</span> <span id="s894">And says, I give you everything, but I won’t give you this away.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: Who knows

down -- you know, the towns in Italy are all up.</span> <span id="s960">You had to go up and then come down.</span> <span id="s961">Everything was hilly, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: -- you know.</span> <span id="s964">And we had to go to register with the police every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: Every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: Every day, that we didn’t escape, or I don’t know where they -- what they thought.</span> <span id="s967">I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s968">But that’s how we got our subsidy, too,

Couldn’t call.</span> <span id="s987">And then they -- I don’t know if it was Tortoreto, Campania.</span> <span id="s988">He went two pla -- he went two pla -- different places.</span></p> <p><span

City -- a town, yeah.</span> <span id="s994">And then what we did is we made a request that maybe he could come to us, or we could come to him so we’re together.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: You know, it was so hard to be apart.</span> <span id="s997">So they send us together to a camp in Italy.</span> <span id="s998">It was called Ferramonti.</span> <span id="s999">You heard of it, I’m sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1001">Ferramonti di Tarsia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: Yeah, di Tarsia.</span> <span id="s1003">So they send us there instead of -- nice place, you know, li -- to be free.</span> <span id="s1004">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: And Ferramonti is in the south.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: In the south yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: And is it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: Very hot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: Very hot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A: Hot during the day, lot of malaria and stuff like that going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: And is -- this is below Rome?</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: Below Rome, yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: And how did you all get there?</span> <span id="s1014">By train again?</span> <span id="s1015">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: Maybe by truck?</span> <span id="s1017">By truck -- truck?</span> <span id="s1018">Maybe trucks, or buses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: Something like that, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: Do you go by yourselves?</span> <span id="s1022">I mean, they say you’re going to be there, or do they -- the soldiers don’t pick you up and take you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: No, we just go --</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: This is sort of a free --</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: -- a free thi -- I mean, you’re going by yourselves to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: And -- and when we got there, to f -- Ferramonti, it was so quiet there.</span> <span id="s1030">It was the time for when they were counting, you know the people, like the soldiers were, they -- they had a -- appelle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: Appelle, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: Appelle, yeah.</span> <span id="s1033">So nobody was in the street.</span> <span id="s1034">And my brother didn’t want to go in.</span> <span id="s1035">There’s barbed wire all around, he was afraid to go in.</span> <span id="s1036">He says, that’s it, the end for us, you know?</span> <span id="s1037">So I said, and Mother too, Papa’s here, we have to go in, we cannot leave him.</span> <span id="s1038">The police had to get --</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: The police had to get him?</span> <span id="s1040">Because he wouldn’t go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: Wouldn’t go in.</span> <span id="s1042">My brave brother wouldn’t go in.</span> <span id="s1043">So, poor guy.</span> <span id="s1044">He says if there’s barbed wire, and soldiers, it’s not a good sign.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: Well, he has a good instinct, didn’t he?</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1048">Now you are 10 or 11 year old now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: And your brother is 14?</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: 14, yeah, must be 14.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: Must be 14.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: Yeah, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1056">At least 14 going on 15, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: So we get there, and like I say, it’s quiet, and there’s a guy going around us like a nut, like this, around and, “Haben sie die Basel, Haben sie die Basel, Haben sie die Basel.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: What is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: You know, constantly is asking us for a paper, a newspaper, Basel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: From Basel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: You know the -- everybody’s hungry for news.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: But this guy was afraid to ask, I guess.</span> <span id="s1066">I couldn’t understand why he was going around us like crazy.</span> <span id="s1067">“Haben sie die Basel, Haben sie die Basel, Haben sie die Basel.”</span> <span id="s1068">And he scared me almost.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: I can imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: But he kept circling where you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: He kept circling the three of us, you know, because they were just coming out of the barracks at that time, and so he wanted some news, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: -- poor man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">A: But finally my dad came out, so that was again a good thing.</span> <span id="s1077">We didn’t feel so abandoned when he came.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: When he came out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1080">He was a little man, but strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: He was strong.</span> <span id="s1082">Okay, we’ll stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">End of Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Beginning Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: Evelyn, you’ve mentioned your grandparents a lot.</span> <span id="s1086">Can you give us their names before we go on with the story?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1088">On my mother’s side, my grandfather’s name was Marcus, and my grandmother was Rose.</span> <span id="s1089">And their last name was Leer, L double e - r.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Q: L double e - r?</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: Yeah, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1092">I

<p><span id="s1124">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A: But they called her Toni.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Q: They called her Toni?</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">A: Toni, because Toby is too Jewish, it was too Jewish, so they tried to -- Vienna, you know, you had to watch your name, your language.</span> <span id="s1128">See, there was never a Jewish word spoken in the house, because when they went into the workforce, they didn’t want the children to say Jewish words, because they were right away discriminated against.</span> <span id="s1129">So they were very careful with Jewish words.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: Does that mean that you were not very Jewish identified, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: No --</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: -- when in -- in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: We were Jewish, definitely, but we tried to live in a non-Jewish world.</span> <span id="s1134">They were so prejudice that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: -- we -- we -- not talking about me --</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: I’m talking about my parents and grandparents --</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: -- they had to watch, cause --</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A:

<p><span id="s1145">A: Yeah, before even, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">A: You had to be careful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">Q: So was it very different for you in Italy, in term -- could you feel it being different in your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">A: In Italy, let’s see, in Genoa, no, I felt -- except that, you know, the divisions, and I was very upset.</span> <span id="s1150">I never complained about it, I never spoke about it, but thinking back, I know that I was so upset that we had food, and not that my parents were starving, but they had to, you know, hold back.</span> <span id="s1151">So I couldn’t -- now, I cannot understand why.</span> <span id="s1152">There was so much food these people had, and they were rich, why couldn’t they feed a family, or keep two kids together?</span> <span id="s1153">I couldn’t -- I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: So th -- so the -- the Jewish Italian families took in kids --</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: -- but not adults?</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: Not adults, just --</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: So, do you know what your parents did for lunch?</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: Well, they had some.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: They had some.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: They were not, you know, that -- you know, they -- simple things, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: -- maybe a sandwich, or Mom -- Mother made maybe some soup, or -- you know, something.</span> <span id="s1164">I don’t think they were starving at that time, but it would have been nice if, you know, they could have had better --</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: -- I would have been happier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1168">What was supper like?</span> <span id="s1169">Did you have supper together as a family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q: And was that just a very light meal?</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: Yeah, light meal.</span> <span id="s1173">Light meal.</span> <span id="s1174">Of course, children get more hungry than adults too, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: Yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: We were so hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: It was tough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: Yeah, it was tough when you’re hungry.</span> <span id="s1179">And I just feel for people that are hungry.</span> <span id="s1180">I can feel the pain, the hunger, you know, that I went through.</span> <span id="s1181">It’s not good.</span> <span id="s1182">Not a good thing.</span> <span id="s1183">And you don’t know what’s going to be -- I remember -- well, that’s later.</span> <span id="s1184">I don’t want to get ahead of myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q: Well, you can, so you don’t forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">A: No, I won’t forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: You won’t forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: When we get to the next town, in Ferramonti?</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: We lived in barracks, one room, you know, four of us in one room.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: The four of you were in one room?</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: Small, small, very small room.</span> <span id="s1193">And I think outside the barracks there was like toilet -- I can’t remember where the toilets were.</span> <span id="s1194">I don’t remember bath -- baths.</span> <span id="s1195">I think we just washed ourselves in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: The sink?</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: -- sink -- no, we didn’t have a sink [indecipherable] you know, in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: What, like a bowl?</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: Bowl, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: Purposely made for [indecipherable] I -- I don’t remember baths there.</span> <span id="s1202">There might have been, but my memory’s not there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: And my mother was so busy feeding us that her stomach sank.</span> <span id="s1205">Do you ever hear of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: No, what does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A: By her not eating, her stomach sank and she kept on fainting.</span> <span id="s1208">You know, she walked, and she fainted, and she walked and she fainted.</span> <span id="s1209">So the camp allowed us children to go outside the camp, or ma -- or the police, the milizia was there, the soldiers, they had booths in front of the camp in a few places.</span> <span id="s1210">And they could sell you some th -- God bless the Italians, they could -- she needed a lot of vitamins, like lemons, oranges, so we bought from them that stuff.</span> <span id="s1211">And then once in awhile we were able to go to one of the farms to bring for Mom some stuff that she needed, you know?</span> <span id="s1212">They didn’t have vitamins like we have now to get her back on -- her health back.</span> <span id="s1213">She was just so sick, and I had to do, you know, all the labor.</span> <span id="s1214">The washing -- and washing was not easy because no running water, obviously and so we carried water into the house, and then we had to wash and then carry it out.</span> <span id="s1215">And of course, you didn’t have that much clothes that you have now, so you had to be careful, you know, what you did, and I had a father and a brother, and -- you know, and I was very --</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q: So you’re doing the laundry for everybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">A: I was doing the laundry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">Q: All by hand?</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: Where would you hang the clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A: I think I had out -- it dried in a minute because it was so hot.</span> <span id="s1222">It was so hot, you couldn’t go out during the day.</span> <span id="s1223">And we always got a lot of -- and at night it was cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q:

id="s1235">A: In comparison to German, oh yes.</span> <span id="s1236">But you still were restricted, and I think they had a mess hall, if I’m not mistaken.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">Q: And that’s where you ate?</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">A: I think they did have a mess hall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: And do you remember the food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A:

I like it a lot.</span> <span id="s1253">But -- but we ate there, I think they had so much food, and then we kind of got, would you say chummy, or -- the camp director, he had the little girl about my age, so I was friendly with her, and -- I’m moving things.</span> <span id="s1254">And he gave us a little bit more privileges, the father, you know, the camp director, very nice man.</span> <span id="s1255">But in that way my mother slowly gave away everything I owned to that little girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: I had one do -- one doll that I took from Vienna.</span> <span id="s1258">My very favorite I couldn’t take with me.</span> <span id="s1259">This was like a soft doll, and her name was Muschi.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: Muschi.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: Muschi was a certain name this doll had.</span> <span id="s1262">So my mother ha -- gave it to her, you know, cause she liked the doll, and that’s a war, you have to do that.</span> <span id="s1263">And a lot of my clothes, which was okay, because I grew out of them, you know, and she was a little smaller.</span> <span id="s1264">And they were all like custom made, you know, from Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: And my dad working in the factory where fabrics were, from a little sample I was able to have a dress because I was a little kid.</span> <span id="s1267">So that’s how we, you know, we paid our way and the -- you know, you go through things that you have to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: Did that aggravate you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1270">I think losing the doll was I think worse than my clothes.</span> <span id="s1271">Really was, the doll.</span> <span id="s1272">And I lost my book, couldn’t have the book to schlep with me, you know, was too heavy and -- you know, I understood and I didn’t understand, you know?</span> <span id="s1273">I understood that I couldn’t, but I wish I could have, and you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: So in some way you lost your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: I did, yeah.</span> <span id="s1278">And in Kansas City they came to interview me.</span> <span id="s1279">You know, we have a book, I don’t know if you are familiar with the book, which the Kansas City Star did.</span> <span id="s1280">And this woman that came to interview me only wanted to know wa -- how was it before a -- when I was a child.</span> <span id="s1281">How was it then?</span> <span id="s1282">I couldn’t tell her very much.</span> <span id="s1283">I tried to tell her, I was not a child, you know, I grew up too fast.</span> <span id="s1284">She didn’t get it, you know.</span> <span id="s1285">So -- I mean, I told her, and I got away a little bit from it, but I never was able to really express the way wi -- things really were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">A: But that’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: It’s as if pieces of your childhood --</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: Yeah, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q: -- were taken away from you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">A: -- yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">Q: -- in various stages.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">A: -- taken away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A: And I never was a child again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: When you played with this little girl, did she allow you to play with the doll?</span> <span id="s1297">Did she realize that she was getting your doll?</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A: I don’t know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Q: You don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1301">I don’t know whether she did or not.</span> <span id="s1302">She liked the doll, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: And that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">Q: Do you think were only Jews in this camp, or was it -- there were people who were not Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A: There were peo -- people married to non-Jews, you know, that stuck with their husbands, some women do stick with their Jewish husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1308">And they put them in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: Some people don’t, yes, and they were there with them.</span> <span id="s1310">In fact, we had next door to us a couple that was -- he was Jewish, she was not.</span> <span id="s1311">But they loved each other a lot and -- cause they were together.</span> <span id="s1312">And then they separated them, we heard later.</span> <span id="s1313">And they told him that they killed her, and she wasn’t any more alive.</span> <span id="s1314">Well, he went out of his mind, this poor man killed himself.</span> <span id="s1315">And it wasn’t true.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: So you know, tragedies like that happen.</span> <span id="s1318">They were such a nice couple.</span> <span id="s1319">I just loved them.</span> <span id="s1320">And they had a lot of -- in Ferramonti they had a lot of wild dogs.</span> <span id="s1321">See, the dogs came, and it was so hot that they were a little wild, cause the heat and no food.</span> <span id="s1322">And they came, and this couple were hiding a dog that they got attached to.</span> <span id="s1323">But then came the order that all the dogs had to be killed.</span> <span id="s1324">And I remember them sitting and just crying, you know.</span> <span id="s1325">And still holding on and thinking another day, another day.</span> <span id="s1326">They tried to keep that dog just as long as they could.</span> <span id="s1327">But then they were searching room by room, you know, for the dog, because they said the dogs got mad, you know, like from the heat, and from -- by the hundreds they came to Ferramonti, because we were -- we were feeding them, I guess, and they came, but not enough, so they -- they were dangerous, they said.</span> <span id="s1328">So you could just hear fire them -- firing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: And I felt so bad for them, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">Q: Did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">A: Especially people I -- we didn’t get any dog, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">A: Right now I would, but at that time, no.</span> <span id="s1335">And I felt so bad for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">Q: Were you friendly with any of the dogs, even though you didn’t have one?</span> <span id="s1337">Did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: I was friendly with the dog next door --</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: Next door.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: -- you know, with these people.</span> <span id="s1341">But I was a little bit afraid, to be truthful, cause he was quite a big dog, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">A: -- and they were scaring us what the dog is gonna do, and you know, that they can bite you and attack you, and -- I didn’t see any dog doing that, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: -- they could have, you know?</span> <span id="s1346">W-We got a lot of injections.</span> <span id="s1347">And another thing where my brother didn’t want any inject --</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: He didn’t -- he didn’t want injections either?</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">A: Here comes the police again, to get him to the doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">Q: But it’s interesting that the government was doing that, even though they were keeping you in a camp, isn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1352">They were very nice to -- to do that.</span> <span id="s1353">And I think that was -- and later on, you know, the typhus was really rampant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">A: So with those shots, we were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: You were protected.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A: Yes, we were protected, we didn’t even know how much, when we moved out of the camp.</span> <span id="s1358">There were a lot of doctors in that camp.</span> <span id="s1359">Like -- I understand like over 200 doctors.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1362">Lot of doctors.</span> <span id="s1363">And they were looking for work, they were so bored.</span> <span id="s1364">So one day I’m carrying a -- a jug with water, and that was, you know, a jug from [indecipherable] you know, like --</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q: Ceramic?</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: -- would be ma -- ceramic, kind of.</span> <span id="s1367">And somehow The jug hit my hand, and I was bleeding, you know, I hit the vein just there.</span> <span id="s1368">And I was ble -- you should have seen, a hundred came running.</span> <span id="s1369">They were so happy somebody was bleeding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">Q: So they could do something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">Q: Did they have a school for kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">A: They had a school.</span> <span id="s1374">In fact, I have one picture left from that camp, with all the kids, only one picture.</span> <span id="s1375">My brother is on it, and I am.</span> <span id="s1376">You know, real small picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: I don’t know how that one got saved.</span> <span id="s1379">I’ll tell you later how we got rid of our pictures.</span> <span id="s1380">But somehow that picture is there.</span> <span id="s1381">There was a school, and they had exercise in the morning for the children, and this neighbor, he was our math teacher, he was also from Vienna with his wife.</span> <span id="s1382">And they had -- they had, I think, even religion in there, they had religion, and singing, you know, and it was -- and I made a lot of friends, girlfriends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A: I made some girlfriends, and I still have little doilies from Ferramonti that one of the -- my friends had, and she gave them to me.</span> <span id="s1385">There were like four -- five sisters, and she gave them to me to embroider.</span> <span id="s1386">Cause you know, I was always with the needle in my hand.</span> <span id="s1387">And so I started to embroider, you know, to ey -- I loved to do those things.</span> <span id="s1388">Not now any more, but I did then.</span> <span id="s1389">So I still have that, would you believe it?</span> <span id="s1390">Never finished them.</span></p> <p><span

<p><span id="s1395">Q: Were they small doilies, those doilies?</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">A: Yeah, they’re small, and what you can do is you can then put them together --</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: -- and make, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1401">I ha -- still

id="s1641">A: He -- I don’t know what he thought, but he was very fearful.</span> <span id="s1642">Maybe cause he was a boy and he knew they were taking men, you know, for instan -- I don’t know what he was, but he was quite upset.</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">Q: How -- how did it happen that you left Ferramonti di Tarsia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">A: They made us go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">Q: They made you leave.</span> <span id="s1648">Did everybody --</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">A: Because we wanted to be together with my dad, and we requested to go either to him or he come to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">A: So they made us go there, together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">Q: No, when you -- when you were going to leave Ferramonti, did they -- how -- how di --</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s1654">We had to leave because they’re gonna close the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">Q: They were going to close it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">A: Yeah, they going to close out the camp, cause of sickness, I think, and I don’t know, they were gonna close it.</span> <span id="s1657">So we had a choice where to go, you know in Italy, always in Italy.</span> <span id="s1658">So we didn't want to stay too far down, and we didn’t -- my dad didn’t want to go to close to Germany --</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">A: Up too high.</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">A: See?</span> <span id="s1663">So we chose like in the middle, like in Toscana, there.</span> <span id="s1664">So they came up then, when we said the middle, that’s what they came up with, Grosseto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">Q: Grosseto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">A: Which was the big city, and we went to Pari, which was the town where we went.</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">Q: And was Pari nee grosset -- near grosset --</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">A: It’s a province of Grosseto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">A: And when we arrived on a bus, that I remember, we were on a bus.</span> <span id="s1671">We got off the bus, and the Italian knew the children, the Jews are coming.</span> <span id="s1672">So they looked at us, and then a few of them came to touch us, I swear to you, to touch us.</span> <span id="s1673">And then they said, you feel just like we do.</span> <span id="s1674">You know, you don’t feel any different.</span> <span id="s1675">You know, because they heard on the radio so much from Hitler that we are such different people, beasts or whatever.</span> <span id="s1676">So we have to feel different.</span> <span id="s1677">Well, they didn’t see that.</span> <span id="s1678">So they got very affectionate with us, and we became friends with the people in -- in the town, and my dad and my brother started to work in the fields, to make, you know, some money, or even for trading for food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">A: And they worked very hard, they worked so hard, they had to -- you know, they got jobs, wa -- but nobody really wanted, I mean, they were doing it, but as long as they had someone else to do it -- like to build trenches for the grapes, you know, you had [indecipherable] but they were full of stone and rock, and with that thing that they were knocking, you know.</span> <span id="s1681">I mean, their hands were just a mess, everything was a mess.</span> <span id="s1682">And -- but you know, they tried their best to go do it, and they did their job.</span> <span id="s1683">And then came summer, so they worked in the fields again to cut weed, you know, cut the weed.</span> <span id="s1684">Why do I remember that?</span> <span id="s1685">Because in the biggest heat, we had to go and bring them lunch, okay?</span> <span id="s1686">Mom cooked, and I had to go and take it to them in a basket, you know, the hot food.</span> <span id="s1687">I don’t know why you needed hot food, it’s hot like hell.</span> <span id="s1688">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s1689">And that was the rule, they had to have lunch.</span> <span id="s1690">And I hated to walk there, it was so hot.</span> <span id="s1691">Didn’t have the best shoes, you know, to walk, but I did, and I brought them food there.</span> <span id="s1692">And whenever I didn’t have to, I was very happy.</span> <span id="s1693">Sometimes my mom went, you know, which was even harder for her.</span> <span id="s1694">I was -- I was a little spoiled rotten kid, I didn’t want to do it, but I did.</span> <span id="s1695">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">Q: You were a spoiled rotten kid?</span> <span id="s1697">You don’t sound like -- you didn’t sound like one before, all of a sudden?</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">A: I know, all of a sudden I’m a spoiled rotten --</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">Q: Did people tell you you were spoiled?</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1702">But you really felt --</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">A: I was not spoiled.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">Q: You weren't spoiled.</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">A: No, I wasn’t.</span> <span id="s1706">And then --</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">Q: Where were you living in Pari?</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">A: Pari?</span> <span id="s1709">Yeah -- i-in a house, we were living in a house.</span> <span id="s1710">Trying to think.</span> <span id="s1711">The f -- when we first got there, we lived in a house with -- we each a room, but we lived with another family for the kitchen -- we shared the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1712">But we had the room, but that didn’t work out too good, and then something opened up that we were able to move into a house.</span> <span id="s1713">The only good thing was that house had a bathroom, while this house did not have a bathroom, which was nothing unusual not to have a bathroom.</span> <span id="s1714">And -- but there was a sta -- sta -- a stalla -- stall where the -- where the cows were going in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">Q: A barn?</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">A: A barn.</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">A: Under the house that was, like.</span> <span id="s1719">So we had to go there to go to the bathroom, with the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">Q: Was there an outhouse?</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">A: Yeah -- no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">A: No, was just there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">Q: Just there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">A: Yeah, very, very embarrassing to me, I --I was very upset about it.</span> <span id="s1726">And anyway, was not easy.</span> <span id="s1727">So we lived there in that house, and in -- in that town you had to -- you baked your own bread, okay?</span> <span id="s1728">I went to work.</span> <span id="s1729">I went to work.</span> <span id="s1730">I started to sew with different dressmakers, they taught me how.</span> <span id="s1731">Okay, I went to a dressmak -- I couldn’t go to school, we were not allowed to go to school.</span> <span id="s1732">And my ma --</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">Q: Because you were Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">A: Because we were Jews.</span> <span id="s1735">And my mother knew that I like, you know, to work with my hands, so she says, how about if you would -- so they accepted me, you know, the dressmakers, and I started to work for different dressmaker, you know, whenever one needed me, I went there and I worked, and I learned, too, you know, while I work.</span> <span id="s1736">They tried to teach me, and -- ironing, you know, whatever needed to be done.</span> <span id="s1737">Sf -- finishing -- first it was finishing work, which now doesn’t exist, finishing, the machine finish it.</span> <span id="s1738">But it was all done by hand, you know, finishing, and then I made garments, slowly, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">Q: And do you remember if this is 1942 - 1943?</span> <span id="s1740">So are you, 12 years old, you’re 13 years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">Q: You’re 12.</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">A: Going on 11, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">Q: You think it was ’42?</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">A: 11, yeah.</span> <span id="s1746">Something like that.</span> <span id="s1747">Because then I went into the woods, so I know.</span> <span id="s1748">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">Q: So you’re going every day to this work?</span> <span id="s1750">Five days a week?</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">A: I go every day to this work, and what was bad, we didn’t have much food in the house, because the Italian people, as wonderful as they are, they were stingy with giving you food, okay?</span> <span id="s1752">Cause they tried to horde whatever they could.</span> <span id="s1753">So, many times my mother and I walked miles to see by the farmers what they -- what we could get.</span> <span id="s1754">Like we went -- you’re familiar with ricotta cheese?</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">A: They -- wonderful ricotta cheese.</span> <span id="s1757">Sometimes we had luck that they gave us some.</span> <span id="s1758">May -- we were ready to pay, we didn’t want for nothing.</span> <span id="s1759">And sometimes they said they don’t have, or -- usually at noon they were all, the farmers sitting on a big table having a feast.</span> <span id="s1760">And we say could we have -- I don’t know, some jelly, some whatever.</span> <span id="s1761">Oh, we’re just out of it today.</span> <span id="s1762">You know.</span> <span id="s1763">I was so hungry, I walked so much, you know.</span> <span id="s1764">And they just -- some didn’t want to give.</span> <span id="s1765">Some didn’t want to give.</span> <span id="s1766">And some made me a sandwich, maybe, and gave it to me.</span> <span id="s1767">But they were not -- the farmers were not that generous.</span> <span id="s1768">They were more generous, my friends in the ci -- in the town, than the farmers were.</span> <span id="s1769">Like a potato in one, and something, you know.</span> <span id="s1770">And I think to this day I hate the walking, because I walked so much for nothing, you know.</span> <span id="s1771">Anyway, it’s a good excuse.</span> <span id="s1772">And so then -- yeah, we -- I was sewing, and I enjoyed it, different -- yeah, I know what I wanted to say.</span> <span id="s1773">And they always had midday, in the morning, the kids all had something to eat, they brought there stuff to eat.</span> <span id="s1774">Well, I didn’t always have, you know, so I just walked out, because I didn’t want to see, and yet I was hungry, you know, children.</span> <span id="s1775">So once in awhile they would give me something, and -- but most of the time not.</span> <span id="s1776">And then in the afternoon was the same thing.</span> <span id="s1777">They were eating in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s1778">And I had just enough for lunch, I didn’t have leftover from.</span> <span id="s1779">So I was hungry, I was always hungry.</span> <span id="s1780">But they just didn’t give, you know, so -- one day I was so hungry, and I looked every place in the house for something to eat, and all I could find was an onion, a small onion.</span> <span id="s1781">And I bit into it like I don’t know what.</span> <span id="s1782">And I just ate the last thing in the house, that day, you know, the next day we got again something, but just to tell you how hungry I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">A: You know, children get so hungry.</span> <span id="s1785">So I was young.</span> <span id="s1786">Like to say, I wasn’t even 11 yet, I don’t think.</span> <span id="s1787">Yeah, I was 11 while I was in the woods, so [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">Q: So this was earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1790">I remember because of -- got my period in the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">Q: In the woods, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">A: That’s why I remember that I -- my age.</span> <span id="s1793">Which was another terrible thing.</span> <span id="s1794">But anyway, before I get into the woods, how did we get int -- to the woods?</span> <span id="s1795">You had to do your own bread, okay?</span> <span id="s1796">Now, you made the bread, and there was one bakery in town, where you call them in the evening and you say, I’m making bread, so they come and pick it up and put it in the oven.</span> <span id="s1797">So my mother called in, went to them that she is making bread.</span> <span id="s1798">So she says, okay, I’ll be there to get it in the morning.</span> <span id="s1799">So they made the bread, and then next thing you know, somebody comes to tell us, you better leave right now, cause five o’clock in the morning the Germans are going to be here to pick you up.</span> <span id="s1800">We don’t have bread, you know, obviously, and one of our Italian friends gave us a bread, you know, to take, and my cat, my Muschi, she wanted -- you know, we had to leave her, so I left her with a friend.</span> <span id="s1801">And it was pouring rain.</span> <span id="s1802">I had open shoes, but that’s all I had, you know.</span> <span id="s1803">So anyway, we said okay, let’s go.</span> <span id="s1804">There was two more families there with -- actually three.</span> <span id="s1805">Two of them in a different direction -- there was a couple -- like my brother said, somebody Russian.</span> <span id="s1806">There was a Russian man, Russian Jew.</span> <span id="s1807">He was married to a Gentile German lady, who stuck with him.</span> <span id="s1808">They were like so tall, and especially I was so little, I thought they were two giant.</span> <span id="s1809">But they were tall.</span> <span id="s1810">And they went one way with another couple who had two boys from Vienna, they were from Vienna.</span> <span id="s1811">And we went with a couple with two children.</span> <span id="s1812">Small -- little smaller than me, a boy and a girl, so there’s -- they came with us, in the same place.</span> <span id="s1813">So we kept on walking and walking and walking, and all of a sudden we were ready to enter the woods, and I hear a cat.</span> <span id="s1814">My cat followed me into the woods.</span> <span id="s1815">I don’t know how she got out.</span> <span id="s1816">And, you know, cats don’t like wet, don’t like rain, she came right in the rain with us.</span> <span id="s1817">So, of course, with everything else, I had the cat, so I picked her up, I don’t care, you know, I picked her up because I felt sorry for her.</span> <span id="s1818">But later on you will see, the cat li -- saved our life.</span> <span id="s1819">So anyway, I pick up the cat, and we go into the woods.</span> <span id="s1820">We have no place to stay, and it’s raining.</span> <span id="s1821">We had like a tarp, and we put on the floor, and -- to sit on, you know, and it was -- we didn't have much food, the -- these friends gave us some bread, and I don’t know, maybe a piece of cheese, I don’t remember what she gave us.</span> <span id="s1822">But whatever she wa -- she gave us, was wonderful.</span> <span id="s1823">So in the morning, then we heard later, this woman comes.</span> <span id="s1824">“Mia,” that was my mother, “a far il pane.”</span> <span id="s1825">Make bread.</span> <span id="s1826">Because she gives you the signal when to make the bread, and then she comes and picks it up.</span> <span id="s1827">Well, Mia’s not answering, and she cannot understand, so she is knocking, and no -- I -- that’s what they told us later, she’s knocking and knocking and she runs up, she sees something is wrong, and she finds we’re gone.</span> <span id="s1828">And 10 minutes later the Germans were there to pick us up.</span> <span id="s1829">And nobody knew, you know, what happened to us.</span> <span id="s1830">And this woman says she called to make bread, that’s impossible, they have to be here.</span> <span id="s1831">Well, somebody saved our life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">Q: Do you know who that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">A: Later on we found out who it was.</span> <span id="s1834">It was a bishop from Grosseto, a bishop that called, I guess the priest of the town, I don’t know who exactly, but he left word for us to leave.</span> <span id="s1835">So he must have been, you know -- heard or whatever.</span> <span id="s1836">And boy was he right, you know?</span> <span id="s1837">He just saved all our lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">A: And we went into the woods, and there was only a couple of people that knew where we were going, what woods, because there lots of woods.</span> <span id="s1840">And eventually, while we were there, they brought us some bread, or something, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">Q: From the town?</span> <span id="s1842">From Pari?</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">A: From the town, from Pari, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">Q: So how did -- how did people find out in Pari, where you were?</span> <span id="s1845">Did someone go back and tell them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">A: Not -- not people, certain people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">Q: Certain people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">A: Certain people.</span> <span id="s1849">Certain people -- there was one guy, he would have given his life if somebody would have told him where we are, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">A: A Fascist, a real Fascist.</span> <span id="s1852">But they knew it, and nobody told him where we are.</span> <span id="s1853">And -- and in those mountains we had people that made coal, carbonia, a -- well, they were coal.</span> <span id="s1854">And they knew us, and they wanted to keep us safe, you know.</span> <span id="s1855">And once in awhile they gave us, if they had leftover bread or something, they gave us.</span> <span id="s1856">And then one day they’re sitting around, and here comes the Fascist, and they knew, you know, the Fascist.</span> <span id="s1857">So they’re talking to him, which I heard later, and one of the guys is just there with one of those things that you chop wood with, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">Q: An axe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">A: An axe.</span> <span id="s1860">And just talked to him, and just does that with the axe, you know, so he got the picture that if you talk, or if you don’t behave -- do you know where these Jews are?</span> <span id="s1861">You know, he was asking.</span> <span id="s1862">I would like to give them, you know, bring them some food or something.</span> <span id="s1863">And he said we have no idea where they are, and he was going, you know -- so you know, we had close calls, very close calls.</span> <span id="s1864">But nobody spoke, nobody gave us away, where we are.</span> <span id="s1865">Now --</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">Q: Now, these were Germans who were coming after you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">A: No, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">Q: Not Italian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">A: -- Italian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">Q: There’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">A: Oh, the Germans were going to come and pick us up --</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">A: -- yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">Q: But this Fascist is a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">Q: -- is an Italian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">A: An Italian, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1880">And he would have given anything if he could have caught -- catch us.</span> <span id="s1881">I don’t know why, we didn’t do anything to him, but it was a Fascist, a -- we didn’t do anything to the Nazis either, but they did to us.</span> <span id="s1882">So anyway, nobody spoke, and then we had a very hard time.</span> <span id="s1883">Finally, they helped us build a shack, just to have a little, you know, protection from the weather.</span> <span id="s1884">And it was like from the trees, the branches, made from branches, cause these people knew how to do that, and they helped us, the people that -- the coal miners.</span> <span id="s1885">And then you had to take from the earth, and you know, fill in, and then they made like beds from th -- from the branches, and then put straw on it, you know, to lay on it, but a -- small.</span> <span id="s1886">And we were trying to be close.</span> <span id="s1887">And one turned, the other one had to turn, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1888">It was so hard, because you know, branches are not -- nothing is smooth, and the straw was falling right through.</span> <span id="s1889">Anyway --</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">Q: So it wasn’t such a great situ --</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">A: It wasn’t a great situation, but it was a little bit -- you know, we were real prepared for the bad weather, because it was snowing, too.</span> <span id="s1892">And you had to whisper the whole time, cause in the woods your voice carries, far away, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">Q: So what are you ins -- excuse me --</span></p> <p><span id="s1894">A: Inside --</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">Q: -- inside the woods, o -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">A: -- in this thing, and the first night, in fact, the thing, the roof fell in, so all the men -- the two men and my brother and the other boy, all night had to sit with something to hold it up, you know, the roof up.</span> <span id="s1897">We couldn’t make much of a fire because we didn’t want anybody to see the smoke.</span> <span id="s1898">During the day was completely a no-no with the fire, but in the night we tried to do little bit open fire to keep a little warm, you know?</span> <span id="s1899">And we still had the cat.</span> <span id="s1900">And the cat disappeared, and I was beside myself, the Germans killed my cat, they took my cat.</span> <span id="s1901">But she found herself a boyfriend.</span></p> <p><span id="s1902">Q: She found herself a boyfriend?</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">A: And she came -- she came home pregnant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1906">That we didn’t need, believe me.</span> <span id="s1907">So she came home pregnant and had four little kittens.</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">Q: Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">A: So then we got -- we asked this guy that brought us food to leave the -- the cha -- the little basket, so we can put in, you know.</span> <span id="s1910">And then he had to find us someone to want the little -- after -- you know, after awhile, to take them.</span> <span id="s1911">And she was just marching behind, you know, her kittens, when we were moving from place to place, cause we never tried to stay too long in one place.</span> <span id="s1912">Even when we came to sleep and we always tried to go away from the place, and watch who goes by and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">A: -- you know, we were constantly in fear, constantly.</span> <span id="s1915">We never knew.</span> <span id="s1916">And then there were bombardments, and we were next to a river, and it sounded -- you know the sound was so harsh, or strong.</span> <span id="s1917">And we thought always, we’re next, you know, they’re gonna bombard us next.</span> <span id="s1918">But it didn’t happen, but the fear was constant, the fear was constant.</span> <span id="s1919">And whispering.</span> <span id="s1920">Then one day, this couple, that Russian couple, she, poor woman, got hysterical, you know, from all of the stuff going on.</span> <span id="s1921">I don’t know what she was, but she started to scream.</span> <span id="s1922">And that’s the worst thing you can do in -- in the woods.</span> <span id="s1923">So he tried to calm her down and everything, but, you know, she went through a lot of stress, and she probably was thinking, why am I here?</span> <span id="s1924">You know, I have no reason, but she stuck it out, but she just lost it.</span> <span id="s1925">And we were -- so we had to move from there right away, cause we thought, uh-oh.</span> <span id="s1926">And another thing what was having, they had a forest fires.</span> <span id="s1927">So we were worried about that, you know, that’s it’s gonna -- we could feel, you know, the heat from the fire.</span> <span id="s1928">So again we were on the run.</span> <span id="s1929">Constantly on the run, in the woods, in the rain, in the heat.</span> <span id="s1930">And oh, was -- one day it was snowing so hard.</span> <span id="s1931">And we were without anything.</span> <span id="s1932">We didn’t have a piece of bread, we didn’t have anything to eat.</span> <span id="s1933">So we thought, okay we’ll just -- you know, nothing you can do.</span> <span id="s1934">And here comes this man, this blessed man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">Q: With food.</span> <span id="s1936">And is this somebody that you knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">A: He’s the one that a -- that brought us food --</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">Q: Before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">A: -- before.</span> <span id="s1940">He was really not from Pari, he was from the big city, he was what they called sfolato.</span> <span id="s1941">When -- when they started to bombard the big cities, they all came to the small town.</span> <span id="s1942">We had a lot of people from Pisa.</span> <span id="s1943">In fact, I fell in love with a guy from Pisa.</span> <span id="s1944">And he was -- but he was from Siena, I think.</span> <span id="s1945">And he was wonderful, can you believe it?</span> <span id="s1946">The biggest snow, here comes this man.</span> <span id="s1947">He says, “I knew you didn’t have.”</span> <span id="s1948">An angel.</span> <span id="s1949">Angel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">Q: That’s fabulous.</span> <span id="s1951">Okay, I have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">End of Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">Beginning Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">Q: What was the name of the man who brought you the food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">A: Dario.</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">Q: And wa -- was Dario from Pari?</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">A: Ye -- yeah, he lived in Pari because he was from the city and I think he had some relatives in Pari, and that’s how he got to Pari.</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">Q: And how do you think he found you?</span> <span id="s1959">Do people know, were there --</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">A: I think -- wait a minute, I think word was sent to him where we are.</span> <span id="s1961">You see, I -- I had one -- one change of clothes, I didn’t have much, but we had a big oversea case, you know, one of those wooden things that we left at the church.</span> <span id="s1962">The priest took it in for us.</span> <span id="s1963">So when we need a piece of something, somebody went there and got it, and brought it to us.</span> <span id="s1964">And this other couple that was with us, was -- this woman there was about my size, only she was taller, she was a woman, I was a child, so -- but that’s besides the point.</span> <span id="s1965">Anyway, I was -- my skirt was getting -- not that I was getting so tall, but still I was growing, and my skirt was getting shorter and shorter.</span> <span id="s1966">So it was not a good thing, you know?</span> <span id="s1967">Anyway that’s that.</span> <span id="s1968">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">Q: Two more questions now, for this -- for this particular part.</span> <span id="s1970">One is, how in heaven’s name did you get a cat in the first place?</span> <span id="s1971">How did you get Muschi?</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">A: Well, it’s not hard to get a cat in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">Q: No?</span> <span id="s1974">Lots of cats?</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">A: No.</span> <span id="s1976">Lots of cats.</span> <span id="s1977">And -- and we got her, you know, somebody gave her to me when she was a little kitten, and you know, it was just perfect.</span> <span id="s1978">Wherever you went there was a cat, so I had a cat of my own, which was great.</span> <span id="s1979">But we all loved Muschi, everybody loved Muschi, and -- except our people that were in the roo -- in the thing with us didn’t like it because she stole some food from them.</span> <span id="s1980">But she put it under the be -- under the thing.</span> <span id="s1981">I mean, they know we have a cat, so why did they put it under there?</span> <span id="s1982">Anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">Q: And you gave the cat the name of your doll?</span></p> <p><span id="s1984">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">A: Muschi.</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">Q: What did Muschi look like?</span> <span id="s1988">Was she a light cat, a dark cat?</span> <span id="s1989">A: She was a gray cat with white.</span> <span id="s1990">She was perfect.</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">A: She was perfect, just beautiful cat.</span> <span id="s1993">I always promised her I’ll take her to the United States with me.</span> <span id="s1994">And I would have, had she survived.</span> <span id="s1995">But see, with all the bombardments and with all the shooting, she went wild.</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1997">A: Sh-She turned wild.</span> <span id="s1998">I was holding her when we were liberated -- getting ahead of myself, but we were liberate -- I was carrying her because a lot of dogs and other animals came, so I figured she might be afraid.</span> <span id="s1999">So I h-held her.</span> <span id="s2000">And then she si -- this dog barked at her and she jumped off my hand and scratched me from here to here, which she never, ever did, from fear, and she went back to where we stayed, the farmers told us that they saw her.</span> <span id="s2001">And that is quite a trip she took back, I guess looking for us, poor cat.</span> <span id="s2002">But she couldn’t -- and we told them, you know, if you ever see her, please, you know, we want her back.</span> <span id="s2003">But the farmer said they never saw her again.</span> <span id="s2004">She just kept on looking for us and looking for us, I guess.</span> <span id="s2005">So I couldn’t keep my promise and bring her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">Q: Yeah, couldn’t bring her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2007">A: Which was very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s2008">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">A: Because as we got into the woods -- I told you that she saved our life --</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">A: -- cause finally we got away from wherever we were, far away, and there was a farmhouse, an empty farmhouse.</span> <span id="s2012">I don’t know if it was a farmhouse -- anyway, was a -- was a building, okay, where they stored hay and everything for the animals.</span> <span id="s2013">And they had a lot of cherry trees around there, so we have, you know, food.</span> <span id="s2014">And so we went in there, we were two -- by then we were two couples, you know, the other couple with two children and -- and us.</span> <span id="s2015">And Muschi was with us, and I look at Muschi, and she’s looking in -- in a direction.</span> <span id="s2016">And I’m following her eyes, there’s four German soldiers coming our way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2017">Q: And she’s not making a sound --</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">A: And she’s looking --</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">Q: -- she’s just looking.</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">A: -- looking.</span> <span id="s2021">But I could see the -- where she was looking, thank God she is looking in the right direction.</span> <span id="s2022">And just sat there, you know, and looked.</span> <span id="s2023">So I told -- you know, everybody, they are here.</span> <span id="s2024">So the men got out of that building, which was him, his son, and my brother, my father, four of them jumped out of the building, and we didn’t know where they were going, but out.</span> <span id="s2025">And we quickly -- I put on a kerchief, you know, I made myself really look like -- all of us like farmers, we’re all farmers.</span> <span id="s2026">Course we didn’t speak German, you know, or anything.</span> <span id="s2027">And all of a sudden, we hear a gunshot.</span> <span id="s2028">A gunshot, we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s2029">They didn’t know if somebody shot us, and we didn’t know if someone shot them.</span> <span id="s2030">So then here they come to the door, the Germans to our door.</span> <span id="s2031">And they say something in German, and we just said [indecipherable] you know, like we don’t know what they’re talking about.</span> <span id="s2032">But then they say -- one says to the other, you idiot, you didn’t kill the cat.</span> <span id="s2033">Thank God.</span> <span id="s2034">They were shooting at the cat, and as they were talking, the cat came running inside, see?</span> <span id="s2035">So we were relieved that they didn’t kill the cat, and thank God they didn’t shoot at the men.</span> <span id="s2036">But the men didn’t know that yet, okay?</span> <span id="s2037">So they left.</span> <span id="s2038">They left.</span> <span id="s2039">We were not important, they left.</span> <span id="s2040">They saw there was nothing but hay there, and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2041">So then, we could hardly wait for the men to see -- so here they come, God, all in one piece, you know, with like -- but we knew we had to leave that place.</span> <span id="s2042">So what we did, outside that house, we made room for our pictures.</span> <span id="s2043">We buried the pictures, and my dad knew shorthand, and he wrote shorthand every day of our stay in the woods, the whole life he wrote in shorthand.</span> <span id="s2044">So he put that down there, and pictures of ours from family, you know, whatever we had.</span> <span id="s2045">I don’t think there was money.</span> <span id="s2046">Whatever -- anyway, we all buried it.</span> <span id="s2047">And we figure, but -- you know, pretty down deep so it shouldn’t get wet.</span> <span id="s2048">And we left there, and we went -- you know, inside the woods a long different direction.</span> <span id="s2049">And then -- trying to think, you know what happened first, it’s hard to remember.</span> <span id="s2050">Went there, and we buried that, and then -- and then we went on.</span> <span id="s2051">Which was a big mistake, cause we got caught in the middle of shooting, the Germans -- and the French liberated us, the French and the Moroccans.</span> <span id="s2052">And they were shooting at each other, and we were in the middle.</span> <span id="s2053">Okay?</span> <span id="s2054">The French -- we finally saw a Frenchman, and we’re so happy, and he says, go away, go away.</span> <span id="s2055">And we didn’t know why he say -- tell us to go away.</span> <span id="s2056">You know, you’re so stupid sometimes.</span> <span id="s2057">Anyway, all of a sudden we’re just in the middle of all this fighting going on.</span> <span id="s2058">And my poor dad and mom wanted to protect us, so they each laid on us.</span> <span id="s2059">Dad laid on me, and Mom laid on my brother, so that things shouldn’t hit us.</span> <span id="s2060">We laid there for hours.</span> <span id="s2061">And then finally, it’s kind of stopped, so we kind of thought, let’s go back to the house and get our stuff and get out of -- out of here.</span> <span id="s2062">So when we got to the house, everything was -- they ripped the pictures, whoever found.</span> <span id="s2063">See, they thought maybe we had money that we buried.</span> <span id="s2064">Mut -- somebody must have seen us do that, but they thought maybe it was money and when that wasn’t money, they was mad, so they ripped things, you know.</span> <span id="s2065">And so my Dad’s -- all that writing went, and we lost a lot of pictures, which we were holding onto like dear life, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">Q: You got some pictures back?</span> <span id="s2067">Some of them were still okay?</span> <span id="s2068">Nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">A: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">Q: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">A: Nothing was still okay, everything was torn apart.</span> <span id="s2072">And yeah, the pictures of grandparents, you know, and the brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s2073">So then we went, and all of a sudden -- we got out of the house, we figured well, you know, we’ll go and see what -- which side we’re gonna go on, we didn’t know where to go.</span> <span id="s2074">So one of the Moroccans here got -- one of them are on the mule -- on those big mules, and they are up there, and we’re down here.</span> <span id="s2075">And they point to me, and they point to the other lady, the mother of the other, she was still a younger woman, blonde, you know.</span> <span id="s2076">And she wants us -- she want -- he wants us to go with him.</span> <span id="s2077">So we all started to cry, you know?</span> <span id="s2078">My mother is on her knees, begging.</span> <span id="s2079">The kids are crying.</span> <span id="s2080">I mean, it was a scene.</span> <span id="s2081">And we’re trying to think what to give him, he shouldn’t take us, you know?</span> <span id="s2082">And my mother had the wedding ring.</span> <span id="s2083">So she says here, you want this do -- and there were no -- not much conversation because they -- they didn’t understand each other, but I think with hands and movements you could tell what we were about.</span> <span id="s2084">So Mother takes off that, and my brother had a watch, so -- and took off the watch to give to him.</span> <span id="s2085">He took it.</span> <span id="s2086">He took it.</span> <span id="s2087">So we didn’t know, are we safe now, or what does he want, you know?</span> <span id="s2088">And he’s still pointing to me and her.</span> <span id="s2089">And my mother grow hysterical, you know?</span> <span id="s2090">Being liberated and not liberated.</span> <span id="s2091">So finally there were like some cows there on the field.</span> <span id="s2092">And somehow he -- he said to us, okay, you can have the cows, or some -- that’s how we understood, you know, we don’t know what he said.</span> <span id="s2093">And they all have gold teeth, you know, and they’re so disgusting, you know, they’re not -- the beards, and oh, horrible looking.</span> <span id="s2094">Anyway, he left.</span> <span id="s2095">He left.</span> <span id="s2096">My mother faints.</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">Q: Your mother fainted.</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">A: So we got her, you know, going.</span> <span id="s2099">Said, we have to leave this place.</span> <span id="s2100">Then the other lady -- my skirt was up to here, you know?</span> <span id="s2101">So she gave me one of her skirts, which covered me, and a blouse with long sleeves.</span> <span id="s2102">You know, they made me look, you know, unattractive as possible.</span> <span id="s2103">And a-again, you know, scarf on the head, anything they could do to make me look bad.</span> <span id="s2104">So I said, okay, we are going.</span> <span id="s2105">And we started to walk towards a town, different town.</span> <span id="s2106">And we’re going, and all of a sudden here’s this guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">Q: Again?</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">A: The same guy.</span> <span id="s2109">My poor mom, she passed out again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">Q: She --</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">A: She passed out again.</span> <span id="s2112">I thought this time she died.</span> <span id="s2113">I was sure she’s gone.</span> <span id="s2114">Anyway, he rode -- he rode away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">Q: He didn’t say anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">A: He ro -- he didn’t -- he said something, but don’t ask me what, and he rode away.</span> <span id="s2117">And we rushed to a farmhouse, where we knew partisans usually, you know, met, or I don’t know what we knew.</span> <span id="s2118">Anyway, we go there, and they have surrounded the -- that room, that house.</span> <span id="s2119">The Moroccans, they surrounded that house, barefoot, you know, they come and sneak up on you.</span> <span id="s2120">I mean, it’s a horrible thing.</span> <span id="s2121">And we finally opened the door and got in and here are the partisans inside.</span> <span id="s2122">And I am hysterical.</span> <span id="s2123">And then -- til then I was fine.</span> <span id="s2124">And when I saw them, I got hi -- I -- I really lost it, I was hysterical crying to them.</span> <span id="s2125">They were so sweet and so nice.</span> <span id="s2126">They assured me everything will be okay, you know, and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s2127">Was horrible.</span> <span id="s2128">So then they left, the -- the guys left.</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">Q: Which ones?</span></p> <p><span id="s2130">A: The Moroccans --</span></p> <p><span id="s2131">Q: The Moroccan --</span></p> <p><span id="s2132">A: -- left.</span> <span id="s2133">And they kind of helped us to get into a town that was not too far from the woods, and -- which we did.</span> <span id="s2134">In fear every step of the way.</span> <span id="s2135">We were liberated, and not liberated.</span> <span id="s2136">You understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s2137">Q: Sure, because everything’s in chaos.</span></p> <p><span id="s2138">A: We didn’t know if -- if they’re coming back, or if they -- we didn’t know what they were gonna do.</span> <span id="s2139">They could have shot us, they could have -- and they could have shot my parents and then taken us, and you know, we just didn’t know what they were gonna do.</span> <span id="s2140">Because for 24 hours the Moroccan had free hand, they can do whatever they want to women.</span> <span id="s2141">And they did a lot of damage.</span> <span id="s2142">They were very, very rude, very mean.</span> <span id="s2143">So we were lucky that we -- we got away with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">Q: Was this something that you understood what your mother was really afraid of, that you would be raped?</span> <span id="s2145">Did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2146">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2147">Q: You didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">A: I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s2149">I didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">Q: You didn’t realize.</span> <span id="s2151">You knew it wasn’t good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">A: I know it wasn’t good.</span> <span id="s2153">I know it wasn’t good to go with this guy.</span> <span id="s2154">And I wouldn’t want to go with this guy, I knew that.</span> <span id="s2155">Gosh, I knew it.</span> <span id="s2156">But of course, I didn’t see as much danger as my parents did, you know?</span> <span id="s2157">Oh, it was horrible.</span> <span id="s2158">And that -- that was our liberation, don’t forget.</span> <span id="s2159">And then, I could not stand to see a soldier, I was afraid of every soldier I saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s2160">Q: Didn’t matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">A: Didn’t matter what soldier --</span></p> <p><span id="s2162">Q: Who they were, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">A: -- they were.</span> <span id="s2164">I was afraid.</span> <span id="s2165">We finally stopped in a town where we got a little break and washed up, and some people gave us some food, you know.</span> <span id="s2166">Was not Pari, was town before Pari, but they helped us, you know?</span> <span id="s2167">And we walked all the time, just walk and walk and walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">Q: But were you trying to get to Pari?</span> <span id="s2169">Is that where you’re trying to go --</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">A: We tried to get to Pari

Because you know people there, and you know that they would help you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2175">A: Yeah, and we have our stuff there still, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2176">Q: The woods that you were in, was it south of Pari, or east of --</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">A: It was actually -- was the Siena woods, not Grosseto woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">A: We went into Siena woods.</span> <span id="s2180">We just kept walking, we don’t know where we’re going, we just kept walking.</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">Q: And this other

id="s2187">They went somebody else, and the other couple from Vienna, with two boys, I understand that the Germans too -- found one of the boys.</span> <span id="s2188">He tried to, you know, talk his way out of that he’s from the farm, you know, and I don’t really know whatever happened to them.</span> <span id="s2189">Lost contact, cause they didn’t come back to Pari, so it was just rumor, we didn’t know exactly --</span></p> <p><span id="s2190">Q: Exactly, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">A: -- what happened.</span> <span id="s2192">And they were sad.</span> <span id="s2193">In fact, one was Heinz --</span></p> <p><span id="s2194">Q: Same name.</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">A: -- one of the boys was Heinz, and one was Walter.</span> <span id="s2196">The boys, you know.</span>

id="s2210">I know I’m leaving something out, but I can’t think --</span></p> <p><span id="s2211">Q: Well let me -- let me go back --</span></p> <p><span id="s2212">A: -- yeah, ask me, ask me question,

into the woods, you know.</span> <span id="s2374">And I was one to be sure everybody’s here, nobody is going where I’m going.</span></p> <p><span id="s2375">Q: You wanted a lot of privacy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2376">A: I wanted privacy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2377">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2378">A: And then you never knew who was gonna be out there, either.</span> <span id="s2379">It was very, very difficult, another difficult time.</span> <span id="s2380">And what else?</span> <span id="s2381">Waiting for food, worrying about my Muschi, and just worrying about everything, you know, I was always worrying about things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2382">Q: How did you all get along?</span> <span id="s2383">The two families.</span></p> <p><span id="s2384">A: We

had really a fight was because of the cat.</span></p> <p><span id="s2388">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2389">A: Cause they finally had some meat and the cat took it, and not only that, brought her boyfriend in to help her eat it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2390">Q: Did she leave you to go see her boyfriend a lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s2391">A: Well, for awhile we thought we lost her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2392">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2393">A: We thought we lost her, and then here she comes, home pregnant, just like a bad girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s2394">Q: But she didn’t feel like a bad girl, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s2395">A: No, she was a good girl.</span> <span id="s2396">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2397">Q: So you did not keep her -- there was -- there was no way to keep her --</span></p> <p><span id="s2398">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2399">Q: -- inside or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2400">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2401">Q: She just roamed wherever she wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s2402">A: She -- wherever she wanted, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2403">Q: Did she stick close to you very often?</span></p> <p><span id="s2404">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2405">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2406">A: Then she [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2407">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2408">A: Yeah, you see she followed us in the worst weather --</span></p> <p><span id="s2409">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2410">A: -- so she felt good with us, but she just was a bad girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s2411">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s2412">She found a boyfriend [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2413">A: Found a boyfriend and that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2414">Q: Did you have any religious beliefs as a little kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s2415">A: Well, that’s a very sore subject.</span> <span id="s2416">I had religious beliefs because I was told to have religious beliefs.</span> <span id="s2417">I had to, you know, go to synagogue, and when I went to synagogue -- we went to synagogue where the women were upstairs, the men downstair, that was my grandparents, you know.</span> <span id="s2418">They were kosher.</span> <span id="s2419">But my mother never wa -- believed in it.</span> <span id="s2420">She was a rebel then, to the end.</span> <span id="s2421">And -- but she didn’t disturb their kitchen or anything.</span> <span id="s2422">But when we went out, or when she went out -- you don’t go out to eat in Vienna that much.</span> <span id="s2423">But when she did go out, she did not eat kosher food, okay?</span> <span id="s2424">But she -- she respected whatever the hou --</span></p> <p><span id="s2425">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2426">A: We couldn’t even tear the toilet paper on Shabbes.</span> <span id="s2427">You know, had to be done Friday, cause you’re not supposed to tear.</span> <span id="s2428">And when I drove my mother crazy the whole week I didn’t want to do anything, but came Saturday, I wanted to knit, I wanted to sew, I wanted to clean.</span> <span id="s2429">Drove her nuts.</span> <span id="s2430">The whole week you don’t want to do and s -- come Saturday, you want to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2431">Q: So this was when you were living with your grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s2432">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2433">Grandparents, or even when I was with Mother visiting, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s2434">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2435">A: Wherever I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2436">Q: You were a problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s2437">A: I was a problem.</span> <span id="s2438">They never let me do what I wanted to do.</span> <span id="s2439">And -- but they were wonderful grandparents, wonderful.</span> <span id="s2440">So were my parents were wonderful grandparents, too, I must say.</span></p> <p><span id="s2441">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2442">A: Too good.</span> <span id="s2443">They gave everything to their grandkids, they loved the grandkids.</span> <span id="s2444">So I guess it’s -- okay you asked me about belief.</span></p> <p><span id="s2445">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2446">A: I thought -- you know, I never gave it much thought as a child.</span> <span id="s2447">I knew I was Jewish, and I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s2448">Big deal, I’m thinking now.</span> <span id="s2449">I didn’t have to go through all of that, you know, but I’m Jewish, I’m -- I don’t believe in miracles, you know.</span> <span id="s2450">I don’t know what else I would believe in if it wasn’t Jewish.</span> <span id="s2451">I don’t believe in a lot of things.</span> <span id="s2452">You know, they all say the Bible, the Bible is a wonderful thing.</span> <span id="s2453">But it’s written by people.</span> <span id="s2454">God didn’t write the Bible, you know?</span> <span id="s2455">That’s what I always feel.</span> <span id="s2456">So what else am I gonna believe?</span> <span id="s2457">I’m not over religious, I’m not.</span> <span id="s2458">And I think -- for some reason I’m not, which I cannot completely say.</span> <span id="s2459">I can’t say.</span></p> <p><span id="s2460">Q: So you didn’t pray when you were in the forest, you didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s2461">A: Not much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2462">Q: Do you think your parents did?</span></p> <p><span id="s2463">A: My brother.</span> <span id="s2464">My brother was laying Tefillin every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s2465">Q: You’re kidding me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2466">A: After the -- he was Bar Mitvah’d.</span></p> <p><span id="s2467">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2468">A: He was very religious.</span> <span id="s2469">But -- unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s2470">Q: So he carried the Tefillin with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2471">A: Yes, he carried the Tefillin and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2472">Q: Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2473">A: But then, you know, he got away from it because he married a non-Jewish girl who did not believe in what he believes, which is okay, but went a little bit about it the wrong way, okay, and hurt us all a little bit too much.</span> <span id="s2474">What can I tell you?</span> <span id="s2475">So there’s not too much to argue about there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2476">Q: But you never -- you never had much of a belief?</span></p> <p><span id="s2477">A: I think the reason I didn’t have much of a belief, because of what happened to my brother.</span> <span id="s2478">I think that’s kind of -- kind of upset me so much, and what happened to my parents, such disappointment that they had.</span> <span id="s2479">And -- and they didn't even ask for what they were accused of asking for.</span> <span id="s2480">So anyway, I don’t want to tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2481">Q: Let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s2482">You -- there -- a -- on the one side when you talk about the Italians, they’re wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s2483">A: Wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s2484">Q: On the other side, you get put into a concentration camp, you are certainly on the run, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2485">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2486">Q: -- in really terrible circumstances --</span></p> <p><span id="s2487">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2488">Q: -- for at least a year, if not longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2489">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2490">Q: That’s still in the context of Italy, so is Italy a sort of a puzzle to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2491">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2492">Q: It’s not?</span></p> <p><span id="s2493">A: Italy is wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s2494">Q: It’s wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s2495">A: Wonderful.</span> <span id="s2496">If it wasn’t for Italy we wouldn’t be alive.</span> <span id="s2497">They helped us, the people were wonderful.</span> <span id="s2498">The people that we knew, not -- there were some son-of-a-gun that wanted to have our neck, okay, the heck with them.</span> <span id="s2499">But most people were helpful, most people were understanding.</span> <span id="s2500">They were wonderful, that’s all I can tell you.</span> <span id="s2501">They warned us, you know.</span> <span id="s2502">They fed us whenever they could.</span> <span id="s2503">Now there were some people that had, but didn’t want to show that they have, so they didn’t give, and -- cause they were afraid for themselves, maybe.</span> <span id="s2504">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2505">But they’re wonderful people, they really are.</span> <span id="s2506">I love them dearly, I really do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2507">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2508">So let’s talk a bit about the DP camp you went to.</span> <span id="s2509">It’s

Citta.</span></p> <p><span id="s2524">A: That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2525">Q: I’m not trying it --</span></p> <p><span id="s2526">A: Cinecitta.</span></p> <p><span id="s2527">Q: Cinecitta.</span> <span id="s2528">So this is in Rome, which is --</span></p> <p><span id="s2529">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2530">Q: -- which was, before it became a DP camp --</span></p> <p><span id="s2531">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2532">Q: -- a film s -- a set of film studios --</span></p> <p><span id="s2533">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2534">Q: -- right?</span></p>

didn’t really know.</span> <span id="s2672">And he was so patient, he was so nice, he was not fresh, he was a gentleman.</span> <span id="s2673">And the trouble was he left, and I could only dance with him, I thought, you know.</span> <span id="s2674">That’s how silly a person is.</span> <span id="s2675">So then another guy wanted to dance with me, so I said, I can’t dance with you, you dance different, I can’t dance with you.</span> <span id="s2676">Oh yes, you can.</span> <span id="s2677">So then he took me to dance.</span> <span id="s2678">Okay, so I danced with this guy.</span> <span id="s2679">But then there was this great dancer.</span> <span id="s2680">He was a black guy, not American black, from Abyssinia, Ethiopia now.</span> <span id="s2681">He was wonderful.</span> <span id="s2682">He was Fred Astaire.</span> <span id="s2683">And he really taught me to dance.</span> <span id="s2684">I was the first one on the dance floor, the last one off.</span> <span id="s2685">He was terrific.</span> <span id="s2686">And except that he was black, his features were white, you know?</span> <span id="s2687">And he spoke perfect Italian.</span> <span id="s2688">And you know, just a dancing partner.</span> <span id="s2689">So my parents said, look, we’re going down to dance, we’ll be with you, I don’t want you to dance with him all the time.</span> <span id="s2690">I said, “I don’t have to dance with him at all if you don’t want me to dance,” you know.</span> <span id="s2691">Fresh little me.</span> <span id="s2692">So I stuck close to them, I made believe I don’t see him.</span> <span id="s2693">So this guy was smarter than me or them, came over and said -- you know, greeted my parents nicely and said, “Do you mind if your dau -- if your daughter dances with me?”</span> <span id="s2694">Put them on the spot, and I had to dance again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2695">Q: So good, you got a chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s2696">A: So that was good, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2697">Q: That was good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2698">A: That was good.</span> <span id="s2699">And that was, you know.</span> <span id="s2700">But then he left, and then my mother-in-law -- at that time I had no idea it was gonna be my mother-in-law, there was a Hungarian guy in camp they wanted to dance with me.</span> <span id="s2701">I could not stand him.</span> <span id="s2702">I absolutely could not stand him.</span> <span id="s2703">And my mother-in-law kept on talking to him, giving him ideas how he could endear himself to me.</span> <span id="s2704">And talked to him, you know, Hungarian, they were Hungarian.</span> <span id="s2705">And he kept on bugging me.</span> <span id="s2706">He was -- he took a job cleaning the hallways in Cinecitta so he could see me, you know, in my room and when I come out.</span> <span id="s2707">I didn’t come out.</span> <span id="s2708">I didn’t want to come out.</span> <span id="s2709">And when I went to the dance, he came over, kissed the hand, you know.</span> <span id="s2710">Very polite guy.</span> <span id="s2711">He wanted to dance with me.</span> <span id="s2712">You know, I was mean enough to say no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2713">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2714">A: I did.</span> <span id="s2715">That’s how I could not stand him.</span> <span id="s2716">I was -- washed the floor in our room, and I took the pail to go to the bathroom to spill it out, he was there, he wanted to do it.</span> <span id="s2717">I didn’t want him to do it.</span> <span id="s2718">I didn’t want him anywhere near me.</span> <span id="s2719">I think my mother-in-law knew something.</span> <span id="s2720">She tried to get rid of me a long time ago, it didn’t work.</span> <span id="s2721">No, we had a good relations -- his mother lived with me for 40 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2722">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2723">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2724">He lived -- she was -- she lived til she was 96.</span></p> <p><span id="s2725">Q: No kidding?</span></p> <p><span id="s2726">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2727">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2728">A: It’s good we got along.</span> <span id="s2729">My father-in-law died a little younger, and then her sister came from Italy, and she stayed with us.</span> <span id="s2730">And they both died the same year.</span></p> <p><span id="s2731">Q: No kidding?</span></p> <p><span id="s2732">A: It was sad.</span> <span id="s2733">So we got along, but I reminded her of what she was doing to me --</span></p> <p><span id="s2734">Q: And what did she --</span></p> <p><span id="s2735">A: -- with Mr. kiss the hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s2736">Q: And what did she say?</span></p> <p><span id="s2737">A: Laughs, you know, it was so funny.</span> <span id="s2738">[indecipherable] it’s not funny, I was miserable.</span> <span id="s2739">You made me so miserable.</span> <span id="s2740">She did, but she didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2741">Q: So was it in some way a -- an okay place to be?</span> <span id="s2742">For the te --</span></p> <p><span id="s2743">A: Yeah, it was an okay place to be.</span> <span id="s2744">How can I say, how can I explain it?</span> <span id="s2745">The boys had a wonderful time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2746">Q: The boys did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2747">A: The boys did, more than -- more than the girls.</span> <span id="s2748">I mean, certain girls had a ball too, but I was not brought up to have a good time.</span> <span id="s2749">I had to be a good girl all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2750">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2751">A: And to this day, shoot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2752">Q: Do you resent that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2753">A: Yes, I resent that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2754">Q: You do?</span></p> <p><span id="s2755">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2756">Q: And you couldn’t get out of it, even when you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2757">A: I couldn’t get out even -- I just couldn’t get out of it.</span> <span id="s2758">She demanded.</span> <span id="s2759">She demanded that I be a good girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s2760">Q: And so you -- you became a good girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s2761">A: So I cow -- I obliged, yeah.</span> <span id="s2762">You can’t go back, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2763">Q: No, that’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s2764">A: And I didn’t want to be bad, but I wanted a little more freedom.</span> <span id="s2765">Not every time.</span> <span id="s2766">And then came Sunday morning.</span> <span id="s2767">My cute little nephews woke me up every Sunday morning.</span> <span id="s2768">They could hardly wait to have me home.</span> <span id="s2769">And then snuck in bed with me, and then my mother invited bachelors that didn’t have family, for lunch on Sunday.</span></p> <p><span id="s2770">Q: Now, we’re talking about New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s2771">A: We’re talking about New York --</span></p> <p><span id="s2772">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2773">A: -- so I had to get up, because the house had to be clean, and lunch had to be made, and the kids had to be fed.</span> <span id="s2774">And I loved those kids.</span> <span id="s2775">I loved them so much.</span> <span id="s2776">And then she came along, you know my niece?</span></p> <p><span id="s2777">Q: Zenie.</span></p> <p><span id="s2778">A: Zenie.</span></p> <p><span id="s2779">Q: Zenie.</span></p> <p><span id="s2780">A: Zenie came along.</span> <span id="s2781">She was different because she was first -- first girl.</span> <span id="s2782">So she was really special.</span></p> <p><span id="s2783">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2784">A: Was really special.</span></p> <p><span id="s2785">Q: So your brother had three kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s2786">A: No, five.</span></p> <p><span id="s2787">Q: Five?</span> <span id="s2788">Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2789">A: Then he had another two.</span> <span id="s2790">My -- my husband says -- nevermind what he says.</span> <span id="s2791">I almost made a boo-boo.</span></p> <p><span id="s2792">Q: Okay, I’m not going to ask you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2793">A: No, don’t ask, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s2794">Q: What -- you came to the United States in 1947?</span></p> <p><span id="s2795">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2796">Q: And you were in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s2797">A: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2798">Lived in New York for seven years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2799">Q: So that was not such an easy life.</span> <span id="s2800">Your father was a busboy?</span></p> <p><span id="s2801">A: My father started to be a busboy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2802">Q: Busboy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2803">A: But then he worked for Globe factory, which they made pie fillings and jellies.</span></p> <p><span id="s2804">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2805">A: Yeah, which was not easy either.</span> <span id="s2806">When he started he was in the cooking [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2807">Then later he worked himself up in shipping, so at least he didn’t have to be in that heat.</span></p> <p><span id="s2808">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2809">A: You know, was so hot there.</span> <span id="s2810">And he was a shipping clerk.</span> <span id="s2811">I guess they would say clerk.</span></p> <p><span id="s2812">Q: [sneezed] Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2813">A: Bless you.</span> <span id="s2814">And he -- he was there all the time, yeah.</span> <span id="s2815">Then the factory moved from Brooklyn to Jersey and he moved with them.</span> <span id="s2816">Yeah, and that’s wi

-- they came here after us, right, in ’49.</span></p> <p><span id="s2839">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2840">A: So, I think he looked in the phone book for Arzt, the name.</span> <span id="s2841">And he found Arzt.</span> <span id="s2842">Then he called up us, and then of course we wanted to see them right away, and we made arrangements to see them.</span> <span id="s2843">And my husband thinks because they were in the paper that we saw the paper, and got ahold of them, but it wasn’t like that, but it’s okay, either story is okay.</span> <span id="s2844">But I think I’m right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2845">Q: But you think you’re right.</span> <span id="s2846">I -- I’m sure.</span> <span id="s2847">I’m sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2848">A: He never asks me.</span> <span id="s2849">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2850">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2851">A: Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s2852">Q: So what -- when you re-met, it was

Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2860">A: And the boyfriend was jealous of him.</span> <span id="s2861">So it was a fun -- a fun time.</span> <span id="s2862">But I guess he won.</span></p> <p><span id="s2863">Q: I guess he won.</span> <span id="s2864">And we’ll change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2865">A: He won the jackpot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2866">End of Tape Six</span></p> <p><span id="s2867">Beginning Tape Seven</span></p> <p><span id="s2868">Q: So did you choose, or did they -- did Zdenko choose, between you?</span> <span id="s2869">You were in the middle.</span></p> <p><span id="s2870">A: Choose me?</span></p> <p><span id="s2871">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2872">A: I didn’t choose him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2873">Q: You didn’t.</span> <span id="s2874">I don’t believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2875">A: I gave in.</span></p> <p><span id="s2876">Q: You gave in.</span></p> <p><span id="s2877">A: I gave in.</span></p> <p><span id="s2878">Q: You got tired.</span></p> <p><span id="s2879">A: I was tired of saying no.</span> <span id="s2880">But yo -- he called from Kansas City to New York as often as possible.</span> <span id="s2881">Will you marry me?</span> <span id="s2882">No.</span> <span id="s2883">Will you marry me?</span> <span id="s2884">No.</span> <span id="s2885">Then he got, okay.</span> <span id="s2886">Every day, will you marry me.</span> <span id="s2887">So -- and I was so tired.</span> <span id="s2888">Then my mother said, “You’re driving him crazy, just make up your mind.”</span> <span id="s2889">I said, “I did make up my mind, but he doesn’t leave my mind alone.”</span> <span id="s2890">So -- and everybody, you know, liked him, and they liked me and what do you mean, you belong together.</span> <span id="s2891">I said, no.</span> <span id="s2892">I was fighting and fighting it, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s2893">Q: But you gave up fighting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2894">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2895">And in -- now I’m really talking.</span> <span id="s2896">The morning -- no, the morning before our wedding, the day before our wedding, I got a letter from my ex-boyfriend wishing me well, and -- a very lovely letter saying how nice it was to know me, and blah, blah, blah.</span> <span id="s2897">And my mother brings the letter just when my husband is there -- who wasn’t my husband yet.</span> <span id="s2898">So nosy wants to know.</span> <span id="s2899">So here, read it.</span> <span id="s2900">I mean, it’s nothing wrong what he wrote.</span> <span id="s2901">You send this letter back to him.</span> <span id="s2902">Why?</span> <span id="s2903">He has no business writing you a letter.</span> <span id="s2904">I said, he’s just has good wishes for us, why not?</span> <span id="s2905">I don’t want the letter.</span> <span id="s2906">You don’t have the letter, I have -- anyway, back and forth and back and forth.</span> <span id="s2907">And I wouldn’t send the letter back.</span> <span id="s2908">So he says, you don’t send the letter back, I don’t want to marry you.</span> <span id="s2909">I said, it’s a deal.</span> <span id="s2910">You don’t want to marry me, fine.</span> <span id="s2911">Okay, we’ll talk tonight, you come over to his family --</span></p> <p><span id="s2912">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2913">A: -- and we’ll see what his cousin -- he relied a lot on his cousin, older cousin, see what he says.</span> <span id="s2914">I said, okay, take -- I brought the letter, I let George read it.</span> <span id="s2915">George said, nothing wrong with the letter, you know.</span> <span id="s2916">And he is hysterical with this letter.</span> <span id="s2917">So I said, here George, you keep the letter, but I’m not sending it back.</span> <span id="s2918">Anyway, said goodnight, you want to go -- okay, I’ll see you tomorrow, maybe.</span> <span id="s2919">So then --</span></p> <p><span id="s2920">Q: He said -- he said maybe?</span> <span id="s2921">Oh, you said maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s2922">A: And then in the morning he called me up and aggravates me yet about the letter.</span> <span id="s2923">So I said, you better stop, don’t want to hear it, you want to get married?</span> <span id="s2924">Yeah, but you should, you know, it’s not right, and blah, blah, blah.</span> <span id="s2925">So I hung up on him.</span> <span id="s2926">The morning of our wedding, I hung up on him, okay?</span> <span id="s2927">But I knew he was gonna come around, so I did get dressed, you know?</span> <span id="s2928">Can you see the picture of all that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2929">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2930">A: So anyway, I got dressed, and you’re not familiar with New York, are you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2931">Q: Yes, I am, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2932">A: Ye -- are you?</span> <span id="s2933">Well, we got married in Brooklyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s2934">Q: It’s where I was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s2935">A: Yeah?</span> <span id="s2936">Oh good --</span></p> <p><span id="s2937">Q: Queens.</span></p> <p><span id="s2938">A: -- so you know.</span> <span id="s2939">On Pitkin Avenue, in -- in a place called Little Oriental.</span> <span id="s2940">Very nice, you know, not -- they had everything ready for me, I didn’t have to get a -- a rabbi, not a hazzan, a singer, a music, they arranged everything.</span> <span id="s2941">The food, wonderful, kosher from top to bottom, and so cheap, you know.</span> <span id="s2942">Now it’s -- would be like nothing, you know, but for us it was sort of expensive, you know.</span> <span id="s2943">So anyway we had this wonderful wedding, and the guy said, well you don’t have to worry because we had guards at the door if the groom wants to run away.</span> <span id="s2944">I said, “I think you might need guards for me, not for him.”</span> <span id="s2945">Oh.</span> <span id="s2946">So anyway, we got married, obviously.</span></p> <p><span id="s2947">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2948">A: Had a lot of fights in between, but we’re still here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2949">Q: Yeah, so you kept each other on your toes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2950">A: We kept each other on our toes, and what can I tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2951">Q: And you were close with his mother and father?</span></p> <p><span id="s2952">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2953">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2954">A: I don’t know --</span></p> <p><span id="s2955">Q: So she was very

schlepping on that bus, poor woman.</span> <span id="s2961">She wanted to come, you know, and be with me too.</span> <span id="s2962">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s2963">Q: Guess it must have been hard for her for you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2964">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2965">Q: -- to be out in Kansas City.</span></p> <p><span id="s2966">A: Especially we got married in July, and

tricking.</span></p> <p><span id="s2976">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2977">A: Speaking of tricking, he had no intention of moving back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2978">Q: He had no intention?</span></p> <p><span id="s2979">A: No.</span> <span id="s2980">He lied through his teeth.</span></p> <p><span id="s2981">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2982">A: He couldn’t leave his parents, but I could leave my parents, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2983">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2984">A: And stuff like that.</span> <span id="s2985">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2986">Q: So did you adjust to Kansas City?</span></p> <p><span id="s2987">A: I did adjust to Kansas City.</span></p> <p><span id="s2988">Q: You like it now?</span></p> <p><span id="s2989">A: I like Kansas City.</span> <span id="s2990">I’m very glad I did not move back --</span></p> <p><span id="s2991">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2992">A: -- to be honest, but I don’t want him to know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2993">Q: No, we’re not going to tell him this.</span></p> <p><span id="s2994">A: You’re not going to tell anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s2995">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2996">A: But no, I wouldn’t change it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2997">Q: And did you eventually get all your presents to Kansas City?</span></p> <p><span id="s2998">A: I didn’t open my presents til I moved into the house.</span> <span id="s2999">We lived in an apartment for seven years before we build the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s3000">Q: House.</span></p> <p><span id="s3001">A: And then I finally got everything in the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s3002">Q: And then you opened your presents?</span></p> <p><span id="s3003">A: And then I opened my presents.</span></p> <p><span id="s3004">Q: Did you then send thank you notes to people, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s3005">A: Most of the boxes I opened, I did send thank you notes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3006">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s3007">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3008">I didn’t know what’s in them any more, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s3009">Q: This must have been the longest period of time --</span></p> <p><span id="s3010">A: Very long.</span></p> <p><span id="s3011">Q: -- that anyone held their wedding presents.</span></p> <p><span id="s3012">A: Very long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3013">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3014">A: I lived on this street called Truman Road.</span></p> <p><span id="s3015">Q: Truman?</span></p> <p><span id="s3016">A: Truman Road, which led to his house, you know, a little bit.</span> <span id="s3017">He’s in Independence --</span></p> <p><span id="s3018">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3019">A: -- you’ve heard of Independence.</span></p> <p><span id="s3020">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s3021">A: And we were not -- well, we were on the same road with Truman.</span> <span id="s3022">And we had an apartment there with my in-laws, of course.</span> <span id="s3023">And they were very nice to me, and they loved me, and I loved them.</span> <span id="s3024">Sometimes it wasn’t always easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s3025">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3026">A: You know?</span> <span id="s3027">It wasn’t easy for them probably either.</span> <span id="s3028">But -- you don’t have much privacy, that’s the only thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s3029">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3030">A: But you have a good cook.</span></p> <p><span id="s3031">Q: You were sure of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3032">A: Yeah, a good cook.</span></p> <p><span id="s3033">Q: And you went to work pretty much right away?</span></p> <p><span id="s3034">A: Yeah, I did.</span> <span id="s3035">My first job was in -- see, I never worked in a factory.</span> <span id="s3036">I always worked in New York, custom made clothes.</span> <span id="s3037">And -- fine clothes, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s3038">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3039">A: I didn’t know what a factory is.</span> <span id="s3040">And then when I came he -- to Kansas City they didn’t have custom made stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s3041">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3042">A: There was only one store and they didn’t need anybody, you know?</span> <span id="s3043">Alterations I never did, I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s3044">So I went to work at a factory that was making maternity clothes.</span> <span id="s3045">And I started there -- was my first job there.</span> <span id="s3046">I started to work there in the biggest heat.</span> <span id="s3047">That year, in ’54, Kansas City had the biggest heat.</span> <span id="s3048">And I’m in the factory, I thought I’d die.</span> <span id="s3049">I didn’t [indecipherable] and you know, they don’t have air condition.</span> <span id="s3050">The fans going, that just gave you a headache.</span> <span id="s3051">It was very, very hard time ahead.</span> <span id="s3052">So I tried to, after awhile -- the boss was very nice to me, in fact at first, you know, he gave me a certain how much he’s gonna pay.</span> <span id="s3053">But then when he saw me, he gave me a little more, which is good.</span> <span id="s3054">And then I started to look for other jobs.</span> <span id="s3055">But I just couldn’t get used to the factory work.</span> <span id="s3056">So then this lady calls me, and she says, do you do alterations?</span> <span id="s3057">And th -- from the Jewish vocational service.</span> <span id="s3058">I said, no, I never did alterations.</span> <span id="s3059">Well, you know how to sew?</span> <span id="s3060">Yes.</span> <span id="s3061">You want to try?</span> <span id="s3062">I said, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3063">I know I don’t like factory.</span> <span id="s3064">Do you know how to shorten sleeves?</span> <span id="s3065">I said, I should know how to shorten sleeve.</span> <span id="s3066">Well, mens’s sleeves.</span> <span id="s3067">So I said, you know, I never shorten a man’s sleeve.</span> <span id="s3068">So she says, why don’t you come in, try, okay?</span> <span id="s3069">We need some help, try, see how it works.</span> <span id="s3070">Okay.</span> <span id="s3071">I went to try and stayed there 15 years.</span> <span id="s3072">There’s no hope for me.</span> <span id="s3073">So they wouldn’t let me go.</span> <span id="s3074">Shin -- he showed me once, you know, how you -- men’s little different.</span> <span id="s3075">But if you know how to sew, it’s not that difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s3076">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3077">A: And so I wound up doing most of the women’s stuff, besides po -- besides shortening sleeves for the men’s coat.</span> <span id="s3078">And they were very fond of me, and were nice to me except for the money, they were not too generous.</span> <span id="s3079">He was a Polish refugee who married an American girl, Jewish girl in Kansas City.</span> <span id="s3080">And he was good to me, very good, but the money was a different story, he was stingy.</span> <span id="s3081">So then everybody said why don’t you go on your own, why do you have to work for him.</span> <span id="s3082">And I wanted to get out, I tell you why.</span> <span id="s3083">He was very nice, but he got ill, you know?</span> <span id="s3084">And it upset me that he was ill, and he was nervous.</span> <span id="s3085">So I figure, maybe it’s time to leave, cause he is not going to be able to work much longer, and besides, you know, I just -- maybe they’re right, maybe I should go on my own.</span> <span id="s3086">So then a friend of mine said that she would go in with me, that she would, you know.</span> <span id="s3087">So -- and that’s how I opened up a business.</span> <span id="s3088">We found a spot, a store, and we open it up, and of course anybody that came to s -- to s -- him and say where’s Evie, he didn’t know where I went.</span> <span id="s3089">Cause he knew, but I mean, he didn’t know.</span> <span id="s3090">He would say, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3091">I don’t know where she is.</span> <span id="s3092">He was very, very upset that I left, you know.</span> <span id="s3093">Because he could go on vacation and leave me, you know, he -- he trusted me, and so it hur -- I understand that he was upset that I left, but after all, I had to live too.</span> <span id="s3094">So I went into business, 29 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s3095">Q: 29 years.</span> <span id="s3096">So were you making custom clothes then?</span></p> <p><span id="s3097">A: No, alterations.</span></p> <p><span id="s3098">Q: Alterations still, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3099">A: I did a few -- I snuck a few custom clothes in, but it’s hard to do both.</span> <span id="s3100">You have to do one or the other because you need different spots, and a different table, different machine.</span> <span id="s3101">And you need too much patience, which at the end I’m not -- I didn’t have any more.</span> <span id="s3102">But I still have enough patience, people still come to me.</span> <span id="s3103">See, the trouble is with custom made clothes, they see a paper, you know a magazine, and they think, I want that, they think they’re gonna look like the magazine.</span></p> <p><span id="s3104">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3105">A: Well, they’re not going to look like the magazine.</span> <span id="s3106">So then they start to pick.</span> <span id="s3107">I think this sleeve is a quarter of an inch, or maybe just an eighth of an inch too long.</span> <span id="s3108">And they make you, you know, do it over for nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s3109">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3110">A: You know, just because it’s custom made, so they think they have to.</span> <span id="s3111">So I said, no, I don’t want to make anything custom made.</span> <span id="s3112">When they buy the clothes, they know what they’re getting, you know, they can see.</span> <span id="s3113">I’d rather do alter -- which I never thought I would like.</span></p> <p><span id="s3114">Q: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3115">A: Never thought I would like.</span> <span id="s3116">But I liked it for awhile, but then when I started to not have patience, I said it’s time to retire.</span></p> <p><span id="s3117">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3118">29 years is a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3119">A: Cause I don’t -- and 15 years in [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3120">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3121">A: So, they’re still coming to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s3122">Q: I bet.</span></p> <p><span id="s3123">A: And I only kept -- I only kept the cream of the crop.</span></p> <p><span id="s3124">Q: I would come to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3125">A: I bet you would.</span></p> <p><span id="s3126">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3127">A: I wish you could.</span></p> <p><span id="s3128">Q: In a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s3129">A: Wish you could.</span> <span id="s3130">So, you know, they still trust my work --</span></p> <p><span id="s3131">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3132">A: -- and -- but I don’t want to -- I do it, but don’t rush me.</span></p> <p><span id="s3133">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3134">A: You know?</span> <span id="s3135">I been rushed all my life, I don’t want to be rushed.</span> <span id="s3136">No, I give you a week.</span> <span id="s3137">I said, that’s rushing.</span> <span id="s3138">They’re teasing me, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3139">Q: When did you start to think of yourself as a survivor of the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s3140">Was it late, was it right away?</span></p> <p><span id="s3141">A: Right --</span></p> <p><span id="s3142">Q: Away.</span></p> <p><span id="s3143">A: I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s3144">Q: Did you talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s3145">A: No, not too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s3146">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3147">A: Not too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s3148">Q: Recently have you t-talked about it more?</span></p> <p><span id="s3149">A: Well, I’ve talked about it more since the book came out in Kansas City.</span></p> <p><span id="s3150">Q: And what book is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s3151">A: That’s the book, it’s called, “From the Heart.”</span> <span id="s3152">Our pictures -- all the people that are in the book, the pictures are on the front page.</span> <span id="s3153">Mine is the only colored picture --</span></p> <p><span id="s3154">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3155">A: -- so there I am, as a bride, see?</span> <span id="s3156">And Johnny’s next -- Zdenko’s next to me.</span> <span id="s3157">And then you turn it around what we are now, oh my gosh, okay?</span> <span id="s3158">They had to do that.</span> <span id="s3159">And inside, whoever’s in the book, there’s a story, you know, to the --</span></p> <p><span id="s3160">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3161">A: -- what they interviewed, you know.</span> <span id="s3162">I told you the one that interviewed me just wanted to know about my childhood --</span></p> <p><span id="s3163">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3164">A: -- and she didn’t understand that I didn’t have a childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s3165">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3166">A: You know.</span> <span id="s3167">So I couldn’t really express the way I wanted to express.</span> <span id="s3168">And -- but that’s what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s3169">Q: And what was that, w-wa -- was that in the 90’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s3170">A: That’s when they -- that’s how I started to think more.</span></p> <p><span id="s3171">Q: Uh-huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3172">A: It was about 10 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s3173">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3174">A: That that started.</span> <span id="s3175">And then they had a big get together, celebrating 10 years of this book, and everything.</span> <span id="s3176">In fact, Zenie came with her husband, and my nephew, my first nephew and his girlfriend, because after 35 years they decided to divorce, and so he came with his girlfriend.</span> <span id="s3177">And that was wonderful, to have my family there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3178">Q: Oh yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s3179">A: That meant so much to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s3180">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3181">A: They gave us a beautiful, beautiful dinner, all the Holocaust survivors.</span> <span id="s3182">And Dudu Fisher, you know Dudie Fisher?</span></p> <p><span id="s3183">Q: I know the name.</span></p> <p><span id="s3184">A: He’s an Israeli singer.</span></p> <p><span id="s3185">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3186">A: He came to entertain.</span> <span id="s3187">Wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s3188">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3189">A: Just wonderful.</span> <span id="s3190">And like I said, it meant so much that they came.</span> <span id="s3191">And so that’s when I started, 10 years ago to think.</span> <span id="s3192">And then certain things come to me and I said, my God, I almost forgot that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3193">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3194">A: You know?</span> <span id="s3195">And things like that.</span> <span id="s3196">You know.</span> <span id="s3197">That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3198">Q: Well, I want to thank you very much, for coming from Kansas City and for being who you are.</span></p> <p><span id="s3199">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3200">Q: It’s been a pleasure to be with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3201">A: You’re sweet, thank you.</span> <span id="s3202">…This is a picture in Vienna.</span> <span id="s3203">It is I, my brother, and my little cousin, who we just were crazy about.</span> <span id="s3204">He was just a little -- this picture really doesn’t do him justice because he was so much cuter.</span> <span id="s3205">But he makes a funny face, and I think the sun was shining in somehow.</span> <span id="s3206">But he is one that got killed, they did not let him live.</span></p> <p><span id="s3207">Q: And what year do you think this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s3208">A: I think it must have been ’39. ’</span> <span id="s3209">39, because I think my dad was gone by then, and we went to see.</span> <span id="s3210">’38 or ’39, I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s3211">Q: And this picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s3212">A: This is my brother and I, when we got to Genoa.</span> <span id="s3213">So that was before his Bar Mitzvah, so I guess -- we figured out yesterday when was that, ’40?</span></p> <p><span id="s3214">Q: No --</span></p> <p><span id="s3215">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3216">Q: -- he was born in ’29 --</span></p> <p><span id="s3217">A: It’s ’27 he was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s3218">Q: Twen -- oh, ’27.</span></p> <p><span id="s3219">A: 1927, so must have been ’40, that’s just 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s3220">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3221">A: 1940.</span> <span id="s3222">We’d -- had just gotten to Genoa, and I think my parents wanted us to have a picture like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3223">Q: And this picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s3224">A: This is when we got to Genoa.</span> <span id="s3225">Again, it was done the same time as the one before.</span> <span id="s3226">It’s my parents, me in the middle, and my mother’s in the middle a-at the bottom.</span> <span id="s3227">And on one side the bigger woman, yeah, she was the landlady, and there was a maid there.</span> <span id="s3228">And they took very nice care of us.</span> <span id="s3229">They were wonderful to us.</span> <span id="s3230">We lived there long as we were in Genoa.</span> <span id="s3231">I can still remember the name of the street, which was via Goito.</span> <span id="s3232">So, little after that, started bombardments, and things were a little bit more difficult.</span> <span id="s3233">But they were so good to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s3234">Q: And this picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s3235">A: This picture is my brother in Pari, teaching these wonderful girls, and one is prettier than the other, which he loved, teaching them German.</span> <span id="s3236">They had nothing else to do, they were coming to Pari to get away from the big city’s bombardments and so on.</span> <span id="s3237">I’m not sure what town they came from, whether it was just as close as Siena or Florence, or maybe even Pisa, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3238">Anyway, there nothing else to do, so they thought they would learn German.</span></p> <p><span id="s3239">Q: And this shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s3240">A: And this is me, and my parents, and my brother, and I remember my outfit being gray with a pink blouse, and was so pretty.</span> <span id="s3241">And it was a -- a Jewish holiday.</span> <span id="s3242">Of course, there was no -- you know, no synagogue or anything, but my mother always made sure, somehow she managed to give us some new clothes on holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s3243">Q: And this was in Pari?</span></p> <p><span id="s3244">A: And this was in Pari, yeah.</span> <span id="s3245">She liked that wall, I guess, she always took pictures on that wall.</span> <span id="s3246">And we were all together, and that was always the main thing, we stuck together.</span> <span id="s3247">Ma -- one was worrying about the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s3248">Q: And these pictures?</span></p> <p><span id="s3249">A: The bigger one is my mom and I in Pari.</span> <span id="s3250">Just taking pictures for no reason.</span> <span id="s3251">I guess he had some extra film in the camera.</span> <span id="s3252">And the other picture is my brother and I.</span></p> <p><span id="s3253">Q: Same wall.</span></p> <p><span id="s3254">A: Same wall.</span> <span id="s3255">That wall was famous.</span></p> <p><span id="s3256">Q: And who’s this group?</span></p> <p><span id="s3257">A: This is all children that used to go to school in Ferramonti.</span> <span id="s3258">Ferramonti was the camp, and they tried to keep the children busy with teaching, you know, and like a school.</span> <span id="s3259">The barracks are in the background, whatever you can see, that’s -- was our living quarters.</span></p> <p><span id="s3260">Q: And this is you?</span></p> <p><span id="s3261">A: Right there in the middle, between two girls, yeah.</span> <span id="s3262">And one group was like five sisters, I think, four and five sisters.</span> <span id="s3263">That’s the only thing left.</span></p> <p><span id="s3264">Q: And these?</span></p> <p><span id="s3265">A: And that’s again Cinecitta and my dad and I, and I’m carrying my job in my hand.</span> <span id="s3266">Those were cards that I -- every time somebody ate, I turned the card around so that I know they ate.</span> <span id="s3267">And that was my job.</span> <span id="s3268">That was in the -- working in the kitchen that was for working people.</span> <span id="s3269">Because for the big kitchen, I needed a much bigger card, you know, to carry --</span></p> <p><span id="s3270">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3271">A: -- like
