id="s26">A: Sure, go ahead, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: -- from early [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s28">Now, I -- I know you go by Jack Ahrens, but obviously you weren’t born Jack Ahrens.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: No, I was not born Jack Ahrens.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: What was the name you were born with?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: I was born -- in Polish it was Yakob Aronczyk.</span> <span id="s32">A-r-o-n-c-z-y-k.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: And when did you become Jack Ahrens?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: I became Jack Ahrens in 1955, when I became a ci -- when I applied for my citizenship papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: Why change your name?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: I cha -- My wife was a schoolteacher, and for a first or second grade tea -- kids call her Mrs. Aroncheck and try to spell it, it wo-wouldn’t -- would have been rather difficult.</span> <span id="s37">And then, I didn’t want my children to stand out of the crowd with a strange name.</span> <span id="s38">I wanted them more or less, be able to blend in, cause they knew immediate -- they knew how to spell my last name and they knew how to pronounce it, but it helped them in school, in later days, because they were just born at that time.</span> <span id="s39">My daughter was born in ‘53, my son was born in ‘56, so she wasn’t -- he wasn’t even born yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: How did you pick Ahrens?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s42">I don’t remember exactly.</span> <span id="s43">I think it’s more or less out of a telephone book.</span> <span id="s44">We looked for the same, more or less, beginning, but -- I was married at the time, of course, and I did it in conjunction with my wife, and we sort of decided on it.</span> <span id="s45">She didn’t want A-r-o-n-s.</span> <span id="s46">In a way, she didn’t want to give away that she was Jewish at the time.</span> <span id="s47">Let them guess.</span> <span id="s48">Ahrens is a name that you have to guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Why was it important to her?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: It wasn’t important.</span> <span id="s51">She was a schoolteacher, she was teaching in a private school at the time and it was not a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s52">Maybe she would -- she just didn’t want to -- point to herself that, I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s53">However, she was proud of being Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Was there still, in the early 50’s, did you feel anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s56">That could be one of the hidden reasons.</span> <span id="s57">Maybe subconscious, or I don’t know, I never tried to analyze myself.</span> <span id="s58">We sort of looked at it for awhile, then we decided and we went along with it.</span> <span id="s59">And I have never regretted.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: When sometimes you’re in a deep sleep and you wake up from a dream or something, who are you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: I am Jack Ahrens.</span> <span id="s62">I have separated myself from my past, from the times when I was -- however the friends, my friends, people that I grew up with, and surprisingly enough, there is quite a number of them, still -- they accepted my last name, but they call me by my nickname that I had since I was born, and that was Yasha.</span> <span id="s63">That’s what they still call me.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Yasha.</span> <span id="s65">What did your wife call you?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: She called me Jack.</span> <span id="s67">Remember, she was American born.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: When did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: ‘51.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: What was your wife’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Selma Kaplan.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: With a K or a C?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: With a K.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: How did you meet her?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: That is quite an interesting story.</span> <span id="s76">If I s -- go all the way to Adam and Eve, to the very beginning, my mother was in the United States from 1934 to 1930 -- late ‘37.</span> <span id="s77">My father died in ‘31.</span> <span id="s78">She remarried, and she married an American man.</span> <span id="s79">His name was Epstein.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: First name?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: I don’t even know his first name.</span> <span id="s82">I never me -- I -- I pa -- I think I met him when he came to our town and he -- they met, but I don’t remember him.</span> <span id="s83">She spent time in Brooklyn and she made friends with a woman by the name of Sarah Kaplan.</span> <span id="s84">Sarah Kaplan was married to -- or rather, Sarah Kaplan was a -- the oldest sister in the Kaplan family.</span> <span id="s85">One of her brothers married my grandmother’s sister.</span> <span id="s86">That’s why my mother became friendly with Sarah.</span> <span id="s87">Sarah’s father was the youngest brother in that family.</span> <span id="s88">So actually, when I came here, my mother introdu -- not introduced me, made me call her and arrange a blind date.</span> <span id="s89">And that’s how the whole thing started.</span> <span id="s90">It’s actually -- My mother was a shadchen -- th -- the -- the -- the matchmaker, at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: I -- I noticed in your tape you use a lot of Yiddish.</span> <span id="s92">Is this kind of a -- one of your many languages that you --</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Used to be, or -- it’s strange, but I ha -- I spoke many languages at one time, and I sort of forgot them.</span> <span id="s94">I regret it.</span> <span id="s95">I regret it deeply, but I cannot converse any more in Polish, I cannot converse in Russian.</span> <span id="s96">I -- I used to be able to converse in Italian.</span> <span id="s97">I have great difficulty using these three languages, which I was fluent at one time.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Is that partly psychological?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s100">I think so.</span> <span id="s101">It’s -- My problem was, when I came here -- and I came on a scholarship -- I was studying in Italy and I feel -- you’ll find my history of studies, what I have started in -- in 1940, under Stalin, in Lvov, then I went to school again in 1944, after being liberated.</span> <span id="s102">After the ghetto experiences and hiding, I sort of saved myself by going to school instead of being forced to go into the Russian army and become artillery meat.</span> <span id="s103">I had no other, basically, I -- I had nothing in my background that would prepare me to ma -- for th -- i-i-i -- to survive, to make a living.</span> <span id="s104">My family was quite wealthy and they sort of isolated me from normal life.</span> <span id="s105">I was not in touch with business.</span> <span id="s106">The only thing I knew is more or less engineering and education.</span> <span id="s107">So I just kept going and I pursued the -- the career in engineering by going in Lvov and then being accepted in Turin, in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Why -- I-In your story, education is so central to everything.</span> <span id="s109">Why is education such a compelling and defining source for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: This was my crutch for survival.</span> <span id="s111">That’s what -- Basically, that’s what helped me survive, also.</span> <span id="s112">In looking back, when we left my hometown Lida, in 1940, and went to Lvov, the reason why we went to Lvov, there were two-fold reasons, basically.</span> <span id="s113">One, that my mother and myself, we were able to get the Russian passports -- acceptable Russian passports.</span> <span id="s114">By that, meaning that our occupation -- my occupation became student and my mother’s occupation becau -- became a working person, robotche.</span> <span id="s115">In spite the fact that we were Capitalists, according to the definition of USSR at that time.</span> <span id="s116">The reason why we picked Lvov, because I wanted to go to Vilna.</span> <span id="s117">But Vilna had not polytechnic institute.</span> <span id="s118">And Vilna got separated from Lida, because at that time, they made a separate country out of Lithuania.</span> <span id="s119">That would have meant crossing a border and difficulty in getting in touch with the family.</span> <span id="s120">So, we picked Lvov, where we could sort of disappear.</span> <span id="s121">Lvov, normally a city of 150,000, at that time had maybe 300,000, with all the refugees coming from Kraków, from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s122">It was on the Russian side of the divided Poland, from the -- after ‘39.</span> <span id="s123">And I was able to -- I was accepted to the non -- the pothip -- to the Polytechnic Institute.</span> <span id="s124">And that was my crutch, I figured I can -- I ha -- I have no other background -- I have nothing in my background that will allow me to make a living.</span> <span id="s125">I had to be on my own.</span> <span id="s126">Fortunately, the Russians were offering scholarships.</span> <span id="s127">Top students were getting a -- the -- a -- it’s not a scholarship, a stipend -- a living allowance and coupons where you could buy things or you could purchase things.</span> <span id="s128">And I -- I have looked -- I have my -- the booklet where they have entered my grades and I have never anything -- I never had anything below a B -- what you would call B in here.</span> <span id="s129">Fact, I don’t think I had any B’s, I had all A’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: You said you kept it?</span> <span id="s131">You still have it?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Not I kept it.</span> <span id="s133">I don’t -- I have -- I have it, because when I came back in ‘44, it was strange, but the Germans, during their occupations, they destroyed the Polish intelligentsia -- I mean, they killed the Polish professors.</span> <span id="s134">In fact, they did it before the killed the Jews, they killed the Polish -- the Polish professors in Lvov.</span> <span id="s135">But the-they -- Lvov itself was not bombed, was not destroyed.</span> <span id="s136">So the archives of the Polytechnic Institute remained intact.</span> <span id="s137">And that was the reason why I was accepted, because they had everything on file, including my photographs, I could not claim that I was someone else.</span> <span id="s138">And when they issued me the booklet where you enter the grades, they entered -- I s -- I still have it.</span> <span id="s139">If you want to look at it, I can show it to you.</span> <span id="s140">You do want?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: Yeah, I’d love to see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Hold on a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Oh, my gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: That’s Lewovsky Polytechnic Institute.</span> <span id="s145">Here is the essa -- S -- SRSR, that’s the Soviet.</span> <span id="s146">And this is the lukovok nishka, that’s where they enter the grades.</span> <span id="s147">See Yakob Aronczyk in here?</span> <span id="s148">There’s my picture from 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Very handsome.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Thank you.</span> <span id="s151">I had hair.</span> <span id="s152">See, this was issued in ‘45.</span> <span id="s153">And they entered the grades from 1940.</span> <span id="s154">Those stamps in here are because it was translated into Italian.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: That’s one of the lire stamps.</span> <span id="s156">Why was it [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: I ha -- I ha -- I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s158">There is one good.</span> <span id="s159">Otherwise it’s all excellent.</span> <span id="s160">See, this is from 1940 - 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: So when you went to Italy, it was translated then?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: They -- we -- in order to be accepted to -- in Turin, they had to -- they had to have a translation of that.</span> <span id="s163">This is ‘44 - ‘45.</span> <span id="s164">See, here are original signatures of the instructors, or professors.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Why, in all the moves that you’ve made, did you keep this?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: I -- I had to save that.</span> <span id="s167">First of all, I had no reason why to hide it, wh -- after I got it.</span> <span id="s168">In ‘45, I could have identifications paper on me without being afraid that somebody c -- that I’ll -- it’ll give me away.</span> <span id="s169">However, there were times where I -- where ID papers were critical and I had to hide them.</span> <span id="s170">But I was never searched.</span> <span id="s171">See, here is ‘44 - ‘45, this is the end of it.</span> <span id="s172">You can see when I had the last tests.</span> <span id="s173">The six -- six in there, that’s June, the sixth month.</span> <span id="s174">See they -- they use Roman numerals for the month, 16 is the day.</span> <span id="s175">This is six, that’s June, ‘45.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: So you were 24 years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: [indecipherable] from Turin.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: See it?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: The same one, and -- and this is ‘45 - ‘46 - ’47.</span> <span id="s182">Where are they?</span> <span id="s183">I took so many exams at that time.</span> <span id="s184">Here.</span> <span id="s185">Just that.</span> <span id="s186">That was in ‘47, the last one was in ja -- 30th of January, 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: And you came to this -- to the United States when?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: I came in February, in ninet -- 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Why the US?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: My mother was in the US already.</span> <span id="s191">See, I have mentioned to you that my mother was married to an American citizen.</span> <span id="s192">However, she never became a citizen, because she had property in Poland and in order to hey -- to save the property, she had to be a Polish citizen.</span> <span id="s193">When she came in 1938 to liquidate the property, the war broke up in thir -- broke out in ‘39.</span> <span id="s194">She had what she -- was called a re-entry permit for the United States, but not a citizenship.</span> <span id="s195">She did not want to become a citizen because she was married to citizen.</span> <span id="s196">So she had a re-entry permit, which was never honored by the Germans.</span> <span id="s197">She showed it to them, it did not help.</span> <span id="s198">You’re Jewish no matter what.</span> <span id="s199">It didn’t do any good.</span> <span id="s200">You’re not an American citizen, that’s -- that’s what counted.</span> <span id="s201">But she went -- when -- when we ended up, after th -- our odyssey, in Italy, she went to the American consul, I think it was in Rome.</span> <span id="s202">And he said, I cannot honor it, because you’ll come to the States, you’ll be a burden.</span> <span id="s203">Somebody has to send you an affidavit.</span> <span id="s204">If you -- you get an affidavit, together with a re-entry permit, you’ll -- I’ll issue you a -- a -- a permit -- a visa immediate -- not a visa, an entry visa, immediately.</span> <span id="s205">She had some friends in here that she -- from before, they send her an affidavit and she left -- I’m trying to think, it was late in ‘46, I think.</span> <span id="s206">In ‘46, or -- in the fall of 1946, she left for the United States and she was here.</span> <span id="s207">In the meantime, I was able to enroll myself, the tur -- University of tur -- Polytechnic Institute in Turin.</span> <span id="s208">And that was quite an odyssey also, cause Italian universities are quite strange.</span> <span id="s209">They don’t accept you.</span> <span id="s210">In svite -- in spite the -- the fact that they gave me credit for this -- for a -- the -- Lvov Polytechnic Institute, they would not accept me unless I could show them th -- my original high school diploma.</span> <span id="s211">Of course, I didn’t have it with me.</span> <span id="s212">The high school diploma was in Lvov.</span> <span id="s213">Lvov was in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s214">There was absolutely no way how I could get it.</span> <span id="s215">And then, I never thought, when I left Lvov, to go to the bursar and ask him gave me my high school diploma.</span> <span id="s216">They wouldn’t have given it to me anyway.</span> <span id="s217">I was able to find, through some friends, my last high school principal, from my home town.</span> <span id="s218">And because our graduating class was only 30-odd people, he did remember me.</span> <span id="s219">He was an official in the Ministry of Education.</span> <span id="s220">And he send me a document, which looked more official -- he asked me, “What kind of grades do you want me to put on there?”</span> <span id="s221">I said, “Put whatever you want, I don’t care, as long as I have the diploma.”</span> <span id="s222">He says, “I know that you passed, but I don’t remember the grades.”</span> <span id="s223">I said, “Put anything you want.”</span> <span id="s224">The document looked more official than the actual high school diploma.</span> <span id="s225">The matura in pol -- from Poland, that I have received it in -- in ‘39, and I was the last graduating class b-before the war.</span> <span id="s226">And on that basis, I was accepted at the Turin Polytechnic Institute.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: Did you speak Italian when you went?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: No.</span> <span id="s229">It was quite difficult.</span> <span id="s230">You had to study with that vocabulary, with the dictionary.</span> <span id="s231">Polish Italian on one side, and the -- and the text book on the other side.</span> <span id="s232">In spite the fact that I was in Italy from late ‘45 - ‘46 - ‘47, it’s actually almost two and a half years, we were always sort of separated from the Italian population.</span> <span id="s233">I was always with my friends, with the -- with the displaced people.</span> <span id="s234">We lived for awhile in a Displaced Person camp, where Italian was of no use.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: What languages were spoken in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Any language you knew, anything.</span> <span id="s237">Polish was good, Russian was good.</span> <span id="s238">They -- I think they refugees Esperanto.</span> <span id="s239">The -- The Yiddish.</span> <span id="s240">I think everybody spoke Yiddish, with a different inclination, you know, the Polish Yiddish is one, the German Yiddish is another and the armenik -- American Yiddish is a thi -- a-a-again different.</span> <span id="s241">But the Yiddish was the universal language.</span> <span id="s242">And it ca -- and I felt sorry for myself, because I -- when my mother was away in the United States, I lived with my grandparents.</span> <span id="s243">My grandmother and my grandfather, they spoke of course Yiddish between themselves.</span> <span id="s244">But when it came to speak to me, they broke their tongue and they spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s245">Says, “We don’t want to corrupt your language.</span> <span id="s246">You’re going to a Polish school, you speak Polish, so you can -- you can be proficient in your school.”</span> <span id="s247">That’s why I -- Yiddish, I had relear -- learn Yiddish, actually.</span> <span id="s248">In spite the fact that I heard it all around me, I didn’t use it.</span> <span id="s249">And between ourselves, my friends, we spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s250">My mother and father -- I was only 10 years old when my father died, they spoke Russian between themselves.</span> <span id="s251">And it’s strange, but my mother’s friends, they spoke Russian between themselves also.</span> <span id="s252">The reason, because they grew up and they -- my mother was unusual for her generation.</span> <span id="s253">She had a high school diploma from Russia -- from Czarist Russia.</span> <span id="s254">And at that time, a high school diploma for a woman, it’s like a Master’s degree in college now.</span> <span id="s255">She was a m-more educated than -- than her -- many of her friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: What did you call your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: Mother and Father.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: But in Polish, or [indecipherable] Russian, what?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Papa and Mama, as far as I -- as far as I can remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Did you speak to them in Russian or in Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Polish, Polish.</span> <span id="s262">I didn’t speak Russian.</span> <span id="s263">Be -- I had a potential knowledge of Russian, because when you put the radio on -- we had a good radio -- of course television was not in existence, that we could listen to all of Europe, and Russia was right next door.</span> <span id="s264">Especially, I -- I loved classical music at the time and the Russian orchestra known for their proficiency in classical music.</span> <span id="s265">They’re still known.</span> <span id="s266">So I had the potential knowledge of Russian, but I never used it, until ‘39 - ‘40, when the Russians came in.</span> <span id="s267">Russians came to me sort of naturally.</span> <span id="s268">I had the knowledge stored in me and I just let it out.</span> <span id="s269">And what -- what gets me now, I still have it stored and I cannot let it out.</span> <span id="s270">It’s sort of something is holding me back.</span> <span id="s271">I am missing the grammar, I am missing words.</span> <span id="s272">I cannot build a sentence, I can -- it’s -- it’s very difficult.</span> <span id="s273">I cannot think in Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: Do you ever go to Brighton beach?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: Occasionally, occasionally.</span> <span id="s276">But I still -- I speak to them in English, I make them speak to me in Russian.</span> <span id="s277">I have -- They speak Russian to me and I speak English to them.</span> <span id="s278">Maybe because I hate failure.</span> <span id="s279">I can fail and I’ll get stuck somewhere without being able to express myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Where does that come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: You were an only child?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: You seem, in -- in listening to your -- your previous interview, to have this incredible self awareness, all the time.</span> <span id="s285">You knew when to stop, when to start.</span> <span id="s286">You knew you could challenge authority at certain times and get away with it.</span> <span id="s287">And you did it constantly, it seems like.</span> <span id="s288">You found the way around things, around people, around situations.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: You had to, that was the only way how to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: You think it has anything to do with your having been an only child?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: Maybe, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s292">I never had any brothers or sister, I never had anybody that I could basically share my thoughts and my -- to the fullest.</span> <span id="s293">Even my closest friend, my wife, at times didn’t understand me and didn’t know what was actually guiding me, what was pushing me.</span> <span id="s294">Cause, remember, I came here in ‘48, with a minimum knowledge of English.</span> <span id="s295">Absolutely minimum.</span> <span id="s296">And I -- all of a sudden, I became an upper junior at the University of Illinois, living in an all American bo -- fra -- fraternity house with a bunch of spoiled -- basically spoiled kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: I’m going to turn over the tape.</span> <span id="s298">Just a second.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning of Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: This -- Tape one, side B, interview with Jack Ahrens.</span> <span id="s301">Why Illinois?</span> <span id="s302">Why did you -- Why did you go there?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: A friend of mine, at the time.</span> <span id="s304">We -- We know each other, but I haven’t spoken to this man in 40 years.</span> <span id="s305">We exchange New Year’s cards twice a year, for the Jewish New Year and for -- for Happy Holidays around Christmas time.</span> <span id="s306">We exchange cards and that’s as far as we go.</span> <span id="s307">We lived together in Turin.</span> <span id="s308">The American Jewish Distribution Committee created a student home in Turin, where we had, I think 40 - 50 students living there.</span> <span id="s309">In fact, we already -- we had -- think I had two reunions in -- here in the United States.</span> <span id="s310">I am in touch with some of the people that I met there, that we lived together.</span> <span id="s311">He was -- He could have been more aggressive than I at the time, but he got in touch with the Hillel Foundation in Chicago.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: How did he do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s314">Probably through somebody.</span> <span id="s315">He start writing to them and I remember the woman’s name, Marilyn Applebaum, and he was accepted to the Virginia Polytechnic Institute.</span> <span id="s316">I said, “Let me try, too.”</span> <span id="s317">I started to write to Marilyn and through Hillel Foundation, I was accepted at the University of Illinois, the fraternity -- my fraternity, Tau Delta Phi, gave me free room and board.</span> <span id="s318">The Hillel Foundation was paying to the university for my -- the tuitions and books.</span> <span id="s319">And I think, if I remember right, they gave me something like 30 dollars every three months, allowance.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: What language did you write to the Hillel people in?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: In English, with a vocabulary -- with a dictionary next to me, with great difficulty.</span> <span id="s322">But, I seemed to -- I got through to her and I got the acceptance.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: You know what you’ve got?</span> <span id="s324">Chutzpah.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s326">I got even more chutzpah when I --</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: That’s the clock?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: That’s the clock.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: And there’re different bird -- bird sound for each hour?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: Differ-Different bird every hour.</span> <span id="s331">Different bird every hour.</span> <span id="s332">Doesn’t last that long, but every hour is a different bird.</span> <span id="s333">You’ll have plenty of distractions, this is going to come off in me -- in -- in a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: I notice you’re really into clocks.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: Key --</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: There’s another clock over there, is that --</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Yeah, but that clock is going backwards, if you notice it.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Yeah, yeah, I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: Can I pour you some coffee?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: That’d be lovely, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Ah, you want a mug?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: Fine.</span> <span id="s343">I’ll -- I’ll turn off the tape recorder for a little bit.</span> <span id="s344">Why so many clocks?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s346">That one I built myself, this one I built myself.</span> <span id="s347">That’s from a kit.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Time important to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: I love it I love building things.</span> <span id="s350">I build a robot, which -- which walks and talks, from a kit.</span> <span id="s351">That company, I -- I mean, that was my loss, it kit -- went out of business and that was really my loss.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: But I’m curious about the clocks, why you would have -- we’re in one room with three clocks.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: I like to know what time it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Was there a point in your life when that was really, critically important?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: No.</span> <span id="s356">There was a po -- time in my life what I didn’t know what time it was.</span> <span id="s357">I had a wristwatch and that’s -- that’s it, that at times wasn’t working properly.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: When we were hiding in the cellar.</span> <span id="s360">Time of -- was of no essence.</span> <span id="s361">Is just a matter of surviving and especially when we were in a complete darkness for days.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: That’s -- from -- from your body right now, it seems like that is still very present for you, that experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: I -- I’m going to tell you something that I had never told anyone else, basically.</span> <span id="s364">I mean, now, we are going off on a tangent, you were asking me some o -- some other things, but we are going off on a -- on a tangent.</span> <span id="s365">When we were in hiding, and there were 11 of us, there was one man, my mother’s age, roughly.</span> <span id="s366">There was an older woman by herself.</span> <span id="s367">There was my mother and myself, that’s four.</span> <span id="s368">And then there was a Hashidisha family of seven.</span> <span id="s369">One of the men, that man that was there, my mother’s age, he had a gun and I had a gun.</span> <span id="s370">After the Pole was arrested -- the man that was hiding us, he -- the Germans -- I mean there was a trial and all that and supposedly they had to confiscate all of his property and the people -- the -- the -- th-the -- the -- the people that were actual -- that were removing the property from the basement and from the house, were the leftover Jews from the Yanoffska concentration camp.</span> <span id="s371">Remember, that was already -- that was early 1944.</span> <span id="s372">Ghetto was already liquidated, there was nothing in existence.</span> <span id="s373">In fact, I have a book by -- I forgot his first name, Wells, Villigeker, where he describes -- he is -- he was one of the people that was on Yanoffska Street at that time.</span> <span id="s374">He describes his experiences and it’s strange how he actually is telling me things that I -- that I -- that I have lived through.</span> <span id="s375">When they were removing the properties, that man could not take it any more, and we had to let him out.</span> <span id="s376">He went on the outside and he perished.</span> <span id="s377">He must have gotten caught.</span> <span id="s378">We survived.</span> <span id="s379">Now, the time when we were there, the experiences of hiding in that little hole and the relationship between the peoples, how we interacted, how we behaved toward each other, I wanted to write a play or write a book.</span> <span id="s380">I never had -- whenever I thought about it, I never had enough words.</span> <span id="s381">I cou -- I could not describe it, because it was absolutely unbelievable how the children were -- had a pillow ready to smother their old man because he was deaf and deaf people don’t know how ca -- how loud they are.</span> <span id="s382">How the Germans were on one side of the wall and we were on the other side of the wall and we heard them hit and yell and -- and scream at the Jewish boys which were out there.</span> <span id="s383">We -- We assumed they were Jewish boys, cause we never saw them.</span> <span id="s384">And it’s strange how the box that was hiding the entrance, to-together with that pole I have pa -- we have painted bricks on it, so it looked like bricks, that nobody noticed it?</span> <span id="s385">Or maybe somebody noticed it and deliberately ignored it to save our lives.</span> <span id="s386">We ne -- There are so many conflicts in there, so many possibilities, what actually happened?</span> <span id="s387">There -- I’ll never know, and it’s bothering me.</span> <span id="s388">I -- It’s in my subconscious, but I still try to put it out -- out of my mind, because if you ask me the names of the people that were there, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s389">I don’t remember their last name, and I don’t remember their first names.</span> <span id="s390">The man that got out, he was fr-from our hometown.</span> <span id="s391">Him, I remember, because I remember him from before.</span> <span id="s392">But otherwise, the names -- it’s sort of fu-fuzzy in my mind.</span> <span id="s393">The details are there, I can visualize it, but I don’t feel that I have enough words to describe it.</span> <span id="s394">Now, to go back to my chutzpah.</span> <span id="s395">When I went to the consul -- to the American consul in Genoa, cause from Turin, you had to go to Genoa, and I showed them that I was accepted at the University of Illinois and that was beginning of February, of ‘48.</span> <span id="s396">He says to me, “When does the semester start?”</span> <span id="s397">I said, “I don’t know, they accepted me.”</span> <span id="s398">He made some quick checks, he says, “You know, the semester has already started.</span> <span id="s399">If you go by boat, you have no reservations, you have no -- no way how to get there for at least a month.</span> <span id="s400">I will not give you the visa now.”</span> <span id="s401">So I asked him, “What about if I fly?”</span> <span id="s402">He said, “I’ll give you the visa immediately.”</span> <span id="s403">So I went back to the AJDC and I said to them, “I have a commitment from the American consul.”</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: AJDC is?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: American Joint Distribution Committee.</span> <span id="s406">They were that th -- They were the ones that were running the student home in Turin, and they paid for my flight on TWA, February 15th, from Rome to Geneva.</span> <span id="s407">From Geneva to Shannon, Ireland.</span> <span id="s408">From Shannon, Ireland, to Newfoundland, Canada.</span> <span id="s409">From Newfoundland to New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: How long did this take?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: I think it’s all within, I think 14 hours or 18 hours or something, but there were stops, because there were propeller planes, jets were not in existence, I -- at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: What were your feelings when you were on that plane?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: I was afraid.</span> <span id="s414">I was scared what’s going to happen.</span> <span id="s415">Will I be able to cope with an American university?</span> <span id="s416">After all, my scholastic background was partly Polish, partly Russian, partly Ukrainian, partly Italian.</span> <span id="s417">Now here, I have to translate everything into English.</span> <span id="s418">I didn’t know what’s going to happen to me.</span> <span id="s419">When I came to New York, in 1948, it was Friday -- late Friday afternoon.</span> <span id="s420">Immigration wouldn’t let me out.</span> <span id="s421">They said, “So many Jewish students, so many people are coming here on scholarships, we have to check with the university, is it true or not.”</span> <span id="s422">They called -- I said, “Call them.”</span> <span id="s423">They called them, and Friday afternoon, the offices were closed.</span> <span id="s424">I spend Saturday -- my mother was waiting for me at the airport and that was the LaGuardia, because Kennedy was not in existence.</span> <span id="s425">Idlewild.</span> <span id="s426">I said hello to her an-and I says, “I’ll be back.”</span> <span id="s427">What else?</span> <span id="s428">The immigration inspector said to me, “I have to take you to Ellis Island and -- but before you go, I don’t know if they’re going to let you stay here or not.</span> <span id="s429">I have a taxi here, you are alone, let me give you a tour of New York.”</span> <span id="s430">So we went riding around New York, he showed me -- and the Empire State Building, and the thing that really stuck in my mind was the Fulton Fish Market.</span> <span id="s431">Like a major attraction in New York at the time.</span> <span id="s432">I spent on Ellis Island, Saturday and Sunday.</span> <span id="s433">Monday morning they called University of Illinois and they apologized to me and they let me out.</span> <span id="s434">I stood with my mother for two weeks in New York.</span> <span id="s435">I didn’t go right away.</span> <span id="s436">What’s the hurry?</span> <span id="s437">I wanted to see New York, I wanted to spend time with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: How long had it been since you’d seen your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: At that time, about a year and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: What was it like to see her again, here, in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: In a way, I was disappointed.</span> <span id="s442">I was disappointed because that -- she was -- the kind of work she was doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: What was she doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: She was a waitress at the resorts and -- in the Catskills.</span> <span id="s445">She had no professions.</span> <span id="s446">She spoke the language, but not that well that she could have an office job.</span> <span id="s447">She was a middle-aged woman.</span> <span id="s448">She was -- She was in her early 40’s.</span> <span id="s449">My mother was exactly about 20 years older than I am.</span> <span id="s450">That was the only thing that she could do and actually make a decent living out of it.</span> <span id="s451">Her husband died, in the meantime, while she was in -- in Poland, he died here.</span> <span id="s452">And his family sort of disappeared, they -- th-they disowned her and th-they didn’t -- they didn’t want to know about her, nothing.</span> <span id="s453">I mean, she was completely on her bu -- on her own, by herself, with -- the only friend that she had was that woman that I mentioned before, that Sarah k -- Sarah Kaplan, that was the wife of a -- of a relative and so on.</span> <span id="s454">It’s not a relative, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s455">She was the only -- She was the only friend that she had at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: Where was your mother living?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: My mother had an apartment together with her sister and her sister’s husband.</span> <span id="s458">That’s another pa -- That’s another interesting story.</span> <span id="s459">My mother had -- What’d they have?</span> <span id="s460">Two brothers and two sisters.</span> <span id="s461">There were five of them.</span> <span id="s462">In fact, just about a month ago, they called me from Israel that my uncle has pa -- had died, at 93 or 94.</span> <span id="s463">He left for Palestine in the -- in ‘28, I think, or ‘27.</span> <span id="s464">1927.</span> <span id="s465">He was one of the original Halitseem, [indecipherable] Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Did you ever want to go to Palestine, or [indecipherable] Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s468">However, I wanted to go there after I got -- after I have gotten some sort of a profession.</span> <span id="s469">To come there without any skills, without knowing the language -- the Hebrew -- I mean, I have the basic knowledge of Hebrew.</span> <span id="s470">You know, when they -- you get prepared for Bar Mitzvah, I had a -- I -- I -- someone teach me, and -- but I never went to -- to the Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s471">There was a Hebrew school in my town, Talbud.</span> <span id="s472">I never went to the Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s473">So I never -- I was never prepared for Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Well, as I recall, you could at least ask the four questions and pretended it was Greek.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Oh yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s476">We -- That’s another pa -- another story, but her sister and her hus -- her husband, the sister’s husband and the sister, they were sort of distant cousins.</span> <span id="s477">To marry, they had to get a permission from a rabbi, because they were relat -- they never had any -- they never had any children anyway, so it didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s478">He was a chemical engineer, a very able chemical engineer, who built one of the major rubber factories in Poland and got pushed out by other people who sort of took it over.</span> <span id="s479">Then he went abroad and built a factory, I think, a rubber factory in Greece, a rubber factory in France.</span> <span id="s480">He had a French ler -- French degree, a degree from Toulouse, I think.</span> <span id="s481">Eventually, he settled in my -- on our hometown, and he and -- with his brother, made -- b-built a factory where they used to make rubber heels for shoes.</span> <span id="s482">In spite the fact that factory was small and basically the two of -- I don’t know how many they employed, but owning a factory made them Capitalists.</span> <span id="s483">So when the Russians came in, the thing got nationalized and they had to escape.</span> <span id="s484">They went to Vilna and they were one of the 8,000 that got the visas from the Japanese c-consul in Kovno.</span> <span id="s485">I think you heard of -- I forgot his name.</span> <span id="s486">They ended up in Japan, in -- rather in Shanghai, but because they were skilled -- they were both engineers, Canada accepted them.</span> <span id="s487">So they ended up in ‘40 -- in the early 40’s, they ended up in Canada.</span> <span id="s488">From Canada, they came to the States.</span> <span id="s489">My aunt was left in Lida to liquidate the property.</span> <span id="s490">She was selling whatev -- whatever they had in the -- in the house.</span> <span id="s491">The furniture, the clothe -- pardon me, the clothing, and all the other things.</span> <span id="s492">So then when they -- Russia closed the border with Lithuania, they had to cross the border to go into Vilna.</span> <span id="s493">The husband was still there and she and a number of other peoples got caught on the border -- the border, arrested by the KGB.</span> <span id="s494">Within two days or three days, there was a trial and they were sentenced to deportation to Kazakstan, which in a -- the long run, saved her life.</span> <span id="s495">In fact, his father -- my uncle’s father -- father was arrested not at the same time, but arrested also and sent to the same area of Kazakstan, and my aunt was there with his fa -- with her father-in-law, who died there.</span> <span id="s496">But when she was in -- when she was in -- in Kazakstan, she survived the war over there and in ‘45, she came to Lvov.</span> <span id="s497">From Lvov, she was able to go, somehow, to France or I don’t know, I -- I -- I don’t remember the details of her story, but she ended up in the United States, because her husband was here, before my mother came there.</span> <span id="s498">They had an apartment on Newkirk Avenue, in a building which is basically -- last time I saw it, it was abandoned.</span> <span id="s499">It was a four story walk-up.</span> <span id="s500">Newkirk and East 21st Street.</span> <span id="s501">And my mother got a room out there, with them.</span> <span id="s502">I think it was a two bedroom or a three bedroom apartment, on the top floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: So that’s where you stayed with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: That’s where I stood with her, right.</span> <span id="s505">For the couple of weeks.</span> <span id="s506">Then I went to the University of Illinois.</span> <span id="s507">I was with the -- in the fraternity.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: Yeah, I want to -- I want to stop for a second, cause you’re going very fast through all --</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: -- a whole lot of stuff.</span> <span id="s511">Okay, you -- your -- on this endless, seemingly -- sounding, at least, endless airplane ride to the United States, what did you expect to find here?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: I was looking to get away from the uncertainty -- uncertainty, to start building my life, to get some sort of a profession where I could -- where I know if I cannot do it -- if I cannot work for myself -- be on my own, is work for someone in a productive capacity.</span> <span id="s513">My father was an engineer.</span> <span id="s514">He -- An engineer basically without money.</span> <span id="s515">But he had the skills.</span> <span id="s516">The family put up the money, he was running the foundry that they had.</span> <span id="s517">He made a -- I loved to go there and watch how they melted the iron, how they cast the -- the -- the -- the plows and the -- the agricultural -- the equipment that they were building there, how they machined it, what -- e-everything they did.</span> <span id="s518">And I was only a little baby at the time, but I loved to watch it.</span> <span id="s519">That sort of instilled in me, the a -- the -- the -- the love for engineering, love for being able to create something with your own hands.</span> <span id="s520">That’s why I put so many things together.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Including that crystal radio when you were in hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: That was a lifesaver, because it gave it gave us a lot of information.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: Do you still listen to the radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: Yes, I do.</span> <span id="s525">I have a short-wave radio, which I listen to -- I like to scan the world to listen what the world thinks about us.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: When you say us, who do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: Us?</span> <span id="s528">I consider us Americans.</span> <span id="s529">I consider myself now as a full pledged citizen of this country, with some loyalties maybe stretching far.</span> <span id="s530">I support Israel, but I am not one of those that will say that because Israeli want it, it’s foolproof and it has to be that way.</span> <span id="s531">I love to read -- on the internet, I read the Israeli papers.</span> <span id="s532">The Haaretz and the Jerusalem Post.</span> <span id="s533">I look at them every single day.</span> <span id="s534">I have a computer in the other room, gift from my son.</span> <span id="s535">I don’t know how he became so proficient in computers, but he must have six of them in his house.</span> <span id="s536">In fact, when I have a problem, I call my youngest granddaughter to tell me.</span> <span id="s537">At eight, she knows more than I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: Okay, so we were talking about -- I’m going to change the tape in a minute, again -- your -- f -- what -- I asked you what you felt on that plane ride and you told me what your career goal was, but not how you felt.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: I don’t remember how I felt.</span> <span id="s540">I felt sort of liberated.</span> <span id="s541">If I got out of this, that I am going somewhere.</span> <span id="s542">I did not see any future studying, finishing my engineering career in Italy.</span> <span id="s543">It was sort of you gi -- you get a degree and what do you do with it afterwards?</span> <span id="s544">You are sort of -- it’s like a dead end education.</span> <span id="s545">I could not see myself competing with Italians in -- even in my profession.</span> <span id="s546">I had to get out somewhere where I could have more freedom.</span> <span id="s547">I had -- my knowledge of Italian was basically small.</span> <span id="s548">It was -- I could converse, but I was not fluent in it.</span> <span id="s549">I s -- I didn’t come to a point where I was thinking in Italian.</span> <span id="s550">Because in order to be fluent in a language, you have to think in that language.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: I’m going to change the tape now.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: Jack Ahrens interview, tape two, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: It’s difficult with -- to answer what wa -- what was I thinking about at the time.</span> <span id="s555">I sort of felt relieved that I am getting out from there, cause I was fu -- looking toward future something.</span> <span id="s556">I know in America you can -- it’s a goldeneh medina.</span> <span id="s557">Sort of, y-you can do something.</span> <span id="s558">Where, out there, what would I do?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Other than the material goals and your occupational goals, did you feel that you would experience less anti-Semitism, that you would be more accepted?</span> <span id="s560">That your past wouldn’t exist, any of that kind of thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: I did not experience any anti-Semitism in Italy.</span> <span id="s562">Maybe because I didn’t know who was Jewish and who was not.</span> <span id="s563">It came to a point where I was so stupid that I was talking to someone whose last name was -- I remember now, Suchadotti and I asked him, “Are you Jewish?”</span> <span id="s564">He says, “Of course.”</span> <span id="s565">I didn’t realize that Suchadotti in Italian, is Cohen in English, or Kaplan, or -- there are certain names that imply who you are, and I was so ignorant, I didn’t even know that.</span> <span id="s566">And then, again, I was in a circle with people who were of my own background, who were in Italy temporarily.</span> <span id="s567">It was sort of like a weigh station.</span> <span id="s568">You were there for the next year, two, three, four, but no one actually was planning on settling and staying in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: What was life like in the DP camps?</span> <span id="s570">A: We didn’t live that long in a DP camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: How long were you in a camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: In Italy, in a DP camp, maybe a half a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: How did you come to be there?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: When we were tra -- when we left Lodz, we were traveling with so-called Bricha.</span> <span id="s575">Bricha was the underground, Jewish organization that was guiding Jews out of Poland, out of -- with the goal of sending them to Palestine.</span> <span id="s576">So you had to go to an area -- they were sending them into Displaced Person camps in Germany, around Munich, Salzburg, in Austria or Italy, with the idea of having these people available to col -- to -- to send to Palestine whenever things became possible.</span> <span id="s577">That’s when Exodus started, the ship.</span> <span id="s578">In fact, many of the people that I knew ended up on Cyprus, because they were caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: How did you connect with Bricha?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: You just knew it, you just knew it, that’s all.</span> <span id="s581">One of the people that was -- one of the men who was stationed at that time in Prague, lives in New York now and we went -- through him -- he was a man -- he was a -- from my hometown, so I knew him.</span> <span id="s582">And that’s where it came in with the different papers, with the different nationalities that we were impersonating at the time, to confuse the border guards, to show -- they -- I am sure they knew about it, but they had to have the legal papers to allow us to travel.</span> <span id="s583">After all, it was such a drop in the bucket, of people that were traveling, of displaced people that were moving.</span> <span id="s584">Just didn’t mean anything.</span> <span id="s585">I -- I remember when we were stopped, I think it was in Salzburg and Innsbruck, our tr -- we were on a train, traveling -- we were traveling in the direction of Italy and there was an American train traveling in the opposite direction, with American soldiers and my mother got off and she went to talk to someone.</span> <span id="s586">She wanted -- She was in -- th-the -- she was desperate, trying to get in touch with someone in the United States, so she could use her re-entry permit.</span> <span id="s587">She got -- She remained -- She missed the -- Our train pulled out and she re -- and she got stuck in there.</span> <span id="s588">The next station I came, I got off and I went to talk to someone and the problem was the language.</span> <span id="s589">Because, in spite of the fact that I was under Germ -- with the Germans for so many years, I never spoke German and I don’t speak German.</span> <span id="s590">And German still remains a hated language.</span> <span id="s591">I found out that she ended up in Munich.</span> <span id="s592">So we remained in -- I think it was in Salzburg, if I remember right.</span> <span id="s593">I remained there for an extra day or two and I -- somehow I was able to send word for her to come down and she came down and we got reunited.</span> <span id="s594">And, with the group of people that I was tr -- that we were together, we kept going and we ended up in Kramona, in Italy.</span> <span id="s595">We went through the Brenner pass, we ended up in Italy.</span> <span id="s596">We were in camp in Kramona maybe three months when we decided, what’s Kramona?</span> <span id="s597">It’s a dead-end place.</span> <span id="s598">Let’s keep on going and we’re -- w-we ended up in a Displaced Person camp in Rome.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: Cheenacheeta</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: Cheenacheeta.</span> <span id="s601">That’s where th-the old movie studios.</span> <span id="s602">From Cheenacheeta, which is in the suburbs of Rome, we were able to go to Rome and find someone from our town to say, “What are you doing there?</span> <span id="s603">With the UNRRA packages and with the little money that you might have, rent an apartment and you will be able to live, you will able to do something.</span> <span id="s604">You’re -- It’s a -- It’s again an dead end thing.”</span> <span id="s605">So we rented a room in Rome.</span> <span id="s606">We had the packages, the food packages from UNRRA to survive on.</span> <span id="s607">You used to sell some of it.</span> <span id="s608">I don’t know where the money came from.</span> <span id="s609">I tried to buy things, sell things, but I was never good at it.</span> <span id="s610">In fact, I used to go to Milan on the train and because I was wearing American army fatigues, I couldn’t speak English, I couldn’t speak Italian, I used to speak like a mumbo-jumbo of something or speak -- say the few words in Italian, try to imitate an -- an English accent and get away without paying the -- the -- the -- without paying the fare.</span> <span id="s611">Go up to Milan, buy some watches, bring them back to Rome, sell the watches in Rome, at a profit, of course and that’s how we used to make a living.</span> <span id="s612">Then again, I tried to enroll in Rome, at the University of Rome.</span> <span id="s613">And they said, “You can’t do it without a high school diploma.”</span> <span id="s614">There was a -- sort of a -- like a soup kitchen in Rome, operated by -- I think it was by the American Joint Distribution Committee, where you could go there and get one nice, good meal, hot meal a day.</span> <span id="s615">And then Rome was a city that I s -- I must have spent a couple of months in the Vatican museum, just -- just looking there.</span> <span id="s616">I was in -- it was insatiable, looking at the treasures in the Vatican museum or with my love of music, I used to go and -- to standing room at the Rome opera, just to listen to th-the real famous singers that I knew at the time.</span> <span id="s617">Benjamina Jilly and I can’t remember the -- who was the -- the -- the -- the -- the female star of the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: Did you ever go to German opera?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: No.</span> <span id="s620">What do you mean by a German opera?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: If say there were different --</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Opera -- I -- Opera in German?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: Say Wagner is being performed.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: Yes, I did once, in New York and I slept through it.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Oh, I was just curious, cause you said you had such a negative feeling toward the German language, if --</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: I slept through it.</span> <span id="s627">I just had a very interesting experience, which is completely on a tangent.</span> <span id="s628">I have a very good friend, who has a daughter.</span> <span id="s629">She is a -- a psychologist.</span> <span id="s630">Her husband is a professor of German literature at NYU, in New York.</span> <span id="s631">His brother was married to a woman who he -- who he divorced, who remarried since and married an opera singer.</span> <span id="s632">That opera singer was here in New York, in 1991.</span> <span id="s633">He is Czech, himself, with the -- when ma -- the Metropolitan Opera brought in Katta Cabanava, opera by Yanachek, he was one of the leading men.</span> <span id="s634">I was invited then, we went to the Met, we had dinner in the dress circle and the first time we were invited behind the -- behind the curtains at the Met, him being a star, he had a room with a star, not the -- when you go to the Met, you go -- first there are the dressing rooms for the chorus and then there the stars.</span> <span id="s635">For the stars you need a special permit to get in there.</span> <span id="s636">So, we went there.</span> <span id="s637">His name is Peter Straka.</span> <span id="s638">Peter Shtraka, not Straka.</span> <span id="s639">I call him Straka, they call him Shtraka.</span> <span id="s640">He was just now in New York again.</span> <span id="s641">There was a revival of Katta Cabanava, all over -- all the mo -- all the month of January.</span> <span id="s642">And I have recorded that opera of the -- from -- they had a Saturday matinee.</span> <span id="s643">I pi -- I recorded it for him.</span> <span id="s644">In fact, I just sent my -- my friend’s daughter, she went to Zurich and they live in Zurich.</span> <span id="s645">I gave her the tapes to give it to him.</span> <span id="s646">And that opera is in Czech.</span> <span id="s647">I have the original recording.</span> <span id="s648">My original tapes, I have them here.</span> <span id="s649">I copied them off, copied them and I es -- gave it to him.</span> <span id="s650">And I was -- and I found beauty, actually.</span> <span id="s651">Wh-When -- The first time when I listened to the opera at the Met, I was bored.</span> <span id="s652">Czech opera in Czech.</span> <span id="s653">But I did find, when I listened to it the second time or the third time and the fourth time -- because I had the tapes, I had to edit the tape.</span> <span id="s654">I took out some things, the opera quiz, you know, the -- I took it out.</span> <span id="s655">I found a lo -- I found it being quite interesting.</span> <span id="s656">So I ju -- I like the -- not just Italian operas, not just French operas, but here was a Czech opera which was rather interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Okay, so you were -- you moved to an apartment, you -- out of the DP camps, into an apartment with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: My -- With my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: You went to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: No, I did not go to school, because the Rome -- Rome has no poli --</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: Oh, because they need your -- right --</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: Rome has no Polytechnic.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: Rome has only university.</span> <span id="s665">And the university would not accept me because I didn’t have a nattoo -- a high school diploma.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Right, I remember now.</span> <span id="s667">Okay, sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: A friend of mine -- it’s the -- I ca -- you can call it a friend, an acquaintance, who could not -- an older -- old -- o-older acquaintance.</span> <span id="s669">Say older, he’s probably three or four years older than I am.</span> <span id="s670">I don’t know what ever happened to him.</span> <span id="s671">He was in Poland and he wrote to me, through some other friends he found my name, can I get him his documents, his papers, because before the war, he went to the University of Pisa.</span> <span id="s672">See, being Jewish, Jewish boy -- Jewish -- people of Jewish persuasion, were not accepted for a higher education in Poland.</span> <span id="s673">They had a quota, 10 percent and that’s it.</span> <span id="s674">So, the ones that could afford, scattered all over Europe.</span> <span id="s675">He ended up here and some other people that I knew, in fact, he was an -- he was a friend to an older brother of a very good friend of mine, from my hometown, that they grew up together.</span> <span id="s676">He asked me to get him some peep -- papers from Pisa.</span> <span id="s677">I said, “I’ll get it for you.”</span> <span id="s678">But try to find my -- see what you can do for me in the Ministry of Education.</span> <span id="s679">He started his search on his end.</span> <span id="s680">I got him, in the meantime, his papers and he said to me, “You know, your old high school principal is in -- connected with the Polish Ministry of Education.</span> <span id="s681">See if you can write to him and maybe he can do something for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Hang on a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: So I -- I send him up a photograph, a picture of me, with a letter describing my high school graduating class.</span> <span id="s684">Giving him the names of my -- some principal -- some teachers that I had, just trying to refresh his memory.</span> <span id="s685">He asked me, “I remember pri -- I remember you perfectly well.</span> <span id="s686">I remember you and the people that were with you,” because, see here, a graduating class -- or high school graduating classes, several thousand.</span> <span id="s687">We had 30-odd people.</span> <span id="s688">So he remembered.</span> <span id="s689">He send me the papers, he send me the documents.</span> <span id="s690">I send him some packages, gifts and so on.</span> <span id="s691">He says, “Don’t send me any more, I don’t need it.</span> <span id="s692">I am well provided here.”</span> <span id="s693">And that allowed me to decide.</span> <span id="s694">I already had the paper.</span> <span id="s695">In the meantime, my mother left and I was left alone in Rome.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: Why did she leave?</span> <span id="s697">Why didn’t you go with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: She had the re-entry permit.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: And she -- she received the visa to go by herself.</span> <span id="s701">I was not a child.</span> <span id="s702">I was in my mid-20’s.</span> <span id="s703">I was not a minor.</span> <span id="s704">I said to her -- she wa -- she -- she was reluctant.</span> <span id="s705">I says, “You go.</span> <span id="s706">Then, when you are settled there, bring me back.”</span> <span id="s707">But, you can -- what’s the sense of both of us struggling here?</span> <span id="s708">You go and be there.</span> <span id="s709">Turin, which had a university, a medical school and a Polytechnic Institute.</span> <span id="s710">So it became like a Mecca for je -- for Jewish students.</span> <span id="s711">And the AJDC, the American Joint Distribution Committee rented a villa -- a villa on Corso Montcarlieri, I remember, right across the river Po, right on the other side of the bridge.</span> <span id="s712">Cr -- Cr -- It was -- It was not the river Po, I am sorry, it was another river, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s713">Po is in va -- the river Po is in -- in Florence.</span> <span id="s714">I don’t remember the name of the river.</span> <span id="s715">And I went there and they accepted me.</span> <span id="s716">It’s all -- The traveling was all done with American army fatigues.</span> <span id="s717">For the rail, I didn’t have to pay.</span> <span id="s718">It was an overnight trip from Rome to Turin by train.</span> <span id="s719">But we didn’t pay anything, we just got on the train and that’s it.</span> <span id="s720">You want to la -- you want to put me off, put me off.</span> <span id="s721">I don’t care.</span> <span id="s722">We were, in fact, I have ma -- I -- I was one of the original ones that started that student home in Turin.</span> <span id="s723">There was a -- Then, we had an administrator that ran that thing, and o -- the only thing we had to do is all of our UNRRA packages and all of our -- went into the home.</span> <span id="s724">The university accepted us because we were displaced people.</span> <span id="s725">I have never worried about paying tuition.</span> <span id="s726">I don’t know what happened, if they paid or they didn’t pay.</span> <span id="s727">I was just enrolled and that’s it.</span> <span id="s728">See, Italian universities were different from American universities.</span> <span id="s729">Here, when you go to college, it’s like going to -- to high school.</span> <span id="s730">They take attendance, they ch -- you know, they check you, it’s like -- you are like a kid.</span> <span id="s731">You had to sign your attendance list.</span> <span id="s732">If you signed it twice during a semester, you were given credit for attendance.</span> <span id="s733">You didn’t have to be there.</span> <span id="s734">And it didn’t make sense for me to be there, because I couldn’t understand the lectures anyway.</span> <span id="s735">I had to study on my own and -- and try to translate and try to memorize, try to understand it.</span> <span id="s736">Because even if I knew what -- if I knew the technical language, if I knew the course, I could not converse with the -- during the oral part of the exam, because I didn’t understand what he was talking to me about, but he was talking to me.</span> <span id="s737">If he went off on a tangent, or start asking me questions.</span> <span id="s738">I mastered it, to a point.</span> <span id="s739">And I didn’t have -- my grades in -- in Turin were not as high as they were in Lvov, but they were-- I passed, and that’s all that counted at the time, is I have passing grades.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: When did you know that the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: I knew that the war was over one day after my birthday, in 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: That’s July?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: July 27th.</span> <span id="s744">The Germans came -- The Germans were expelled -- left Lvov July 26.</span> <span id="s745">On my birthday, we wanted to get out from our hiding, but the woman that was hiding us said, “Please don’t get out of here.</span> <span id="s746">I don’t want my neighbors to know that I was hiding Jews.</span> <span id="s747">Stay another day and get out in the middle of the night.”</span> <span id="s748">The following day, that’s when all of us left, one by one.</span> <span id="s749">Of course, we were immediately arrested by the Russian army patrol, taken not to jail, taken like the city hall, where we slept on a table or something, I don’t -- and the following day, we were released.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: Why were you arrested?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: Because we were pa -- we were on the streets after the curfew.</span> <span id="s754">There was a sunset to -- s-sunrise -- no, sunset to sunrise curfew, where you could not be in the streets.</span> <span id="s755">We went immediately to the -- what you would call the authorities or whatever you call them, and they said to us, “Find yourself an apartment.”</span> <span id="s756">Wi -- Of course, we went back to the place where we used to live, before the ghetto in Lvov.</span> <span id="s757">The Poles were st -- were there and we couldn’t -- we couldn’t go there, but next -- next to there, there was an apartment which was occu -- was -- used to be occupied by a German general.</span> <span id="s758">We got in there and f-fortunately for us, it was not that the fact that the apartment was furnished, but they were -- there was some food left in the apartment that we could use, they ran away so fast.</span> <span id="s759">So we took over that apartment and we were there -- that was our apartment.</span> <span id="s760">We’re -- We’re -- We’re sort of requisitioned the apartment.</span> <span id="s761">B-B -- My mother, she spoke Russian very fluently, she could write -- I mean, I could write and I could speak, but she went -- she -- almost immediately, she got a job, what you would call, with the incoming Russian authorities.</span> <span id="s762">That’s not Russian, but Communist authorities.</span> <span id="s763">I didn’t do anything at the time.</span> <span id="s764">I was going to the marketplace, buying and selling things and I’ll never forget, my first big transaction was when a Russian army truck was parked in -- a Russian soldier called me and he said to me, “I have some American canned -- canned pork -- ham a -- the [indecipherable] cans of processed pork and I like to sell it.</span> <span id="s765">What are you going to give me for it?”</span> <span id="s766">Said, “I can’t give you anything, but I will take a couple of them.</span> <span id="s767">You will have to trust me.”</span> <span id="s768">And I took two, because they were quite heavy and I couldn’t carry them and I had to hide them.</span> <span id="s769">I went to the marketplace, I sold them, I came back, I gave him half the money.</span> <span id="s770">He was very happy.</span> <span id="s771">And I just kept going back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.</span> <span id="s772">And I don’t remember how many I sold, but I have made a lot of money that day.</span> <span id="s773">And fortunate -- fortunately, I was not arrested or caught.</span> <span id="s774">After that, I had -- There were rumors that the Russians are going to draft all the men my age, in the 20’s, who were not in the army.</span> <span id="s775">I -- I knew what the Russians were going to do.</span> <span id="s776">I mean, a friend of mine, who I found out later, their job was going through mine fields and trying to disarm the mines in front of the tanks, with mine detectors.</span> <span id="s777">He had a leg blown.</span> <span id="s778">He is -- He is alive, fortunately.</span> <span id="s779">He is in Israel.</span> <span id="s780">But I was trying to avoid a situation like that, so I went to the Polytechnic Institute.</span> <span id="s781">Th-The rumors were that the Polytechnic Institute is going to re-open.</span> <span id="s782">I went there and the archives were intact.</span> <span id="s783">They found all the papers, they found all -- all of the documents.</span> <span id="s784">They accepted me and they gave me the admission.</span> <span id="s785">So when I went back to the dra -- what you would call the draft board and I showed them that I am a student which is enrolled now, they gave me a deferment.</span> <span id="s786">And basically I feel that what saved my life.</span> <span id="s787">Another thing that saved my life was the fact that the Polytechnic Institute in Kiev was not functioning, was -- for some reason, was not working.</span> <span id="s788">And because Lvov was working, the professors that were in Kiev came to Lvov -- the ones that survived -- because Lvov had no -- had no faculty.</span> <span id="s789">The administersth -- the administrative personnel was -- remained there, but there was no one to teach.</span> <span id="s790">So they came from Kiev, from Moscow, do -- and some of the Poles that survived, they assembled enough faculty to teach, cause if Kiev was in existence, Lvov wouldn’t have opened.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: [inaudible] turn over.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span

got arrested, did you feel like you wer -- you know, oh my gosh, I’m not free after all?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: The original feeling was bad, because the original Russian comment was, “So what are you doing here?</span> <span id="s796">Why aren’t you with the partisans?</span> <span id="s797">Why aren’t you with the underground?</span> <span id="s798">Why aren’t you fighting?”</span> <span id="s799">Young, not disabled, maybe physically not in good shape, because after let’s say, several months of starvation.</span> <span id="s800">Because, prior to that, we were fed fair -- fairly decently, but the last few months, the -- i-it was just -- it was soup.</span> <span id="s801">Watery soup with -- with one piece of bread, maybe.</span> <span id="s802">And when ya -- they just wouldn’t understand.</span> <span id="s803">The Russians didn’t want to understand that that was the only way how to survive, because the population was against us.</span> <span id="s804">I was with the underground.</span> <span id="s805">I was with the Polish underground.</span> <span id="s806">The partisans in the area where we were, were definitely hostile toward Jews.</span> <span id="s807">And it was just as bad being in a --</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: What bird was that at -- at one o’clock?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: Oh, you want me tell you what bird --</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: No, it’s okay [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: I can tell you the name of the bird.</span> <span id="s812">The population was very hostile in -- in -- in that area.</span> <span id="s813">In fact, the Pole that was hiding us was such an exce -- such an exception, that I just can’t describe, I can’t g-ge -- I can’t thank him enough, in spite the fact that he perished because of -- I don’t know, because he was a Polish patriot --</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: What was his --</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: -- not because he was hiding Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: Tracholder.</span> <span id="s818">Jan Tracholder.</span> <span id="s819">That was one of the names I had to spell to the -- previously on the -- to the interviewer.</span> <span id="s820">I met him -- When we came to Lvov, from Lida, in 1940, Lvov was overpopulated.</span> <span id="s821">From 150, became 300,000.</span> <span id="s822">We couldn’t find a place where to live.</span> <span id="s823">So we finally found a -- an apart -- a -- a small apartment on the outskirts of Lvov.</span> <span id="s824">He rented it to us, I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s825">Because he was -- he knew that we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s826">He knew exactly what was happening, but I have maybe developed a rapport with him.</span> <span id="s827">On the beginning, I have -- I don’t say that I did help him, but I have showed some understanding in the things that he was doing.</span> <span id="s828">He was a builder, a -- a contractor.</span> <span id="s829">At that time, he was already in his 60’s.</span> <span id="s830">And I have expressed my admiration at that time for the Polish leaders from the 30’s, like Marshall Pilsiltski.</span> <span id="s831">And he was a great lover of Pilsiltski, a great admirer.</span> <span id="s832">We have developed, sort of like a friendship, so that when I -- we le -- when we found an apartment in Lvov later and we left him, I still kept in touch -- in touch with him.</span> <span id="s833">I used to go out there, walk that kilometer from the last trolley stop to his shop and sort of discuss politics with him.</span> <span id="s834">What’s going on in London, with the Polish government in London.</span> <span id="s835">What’s going on in the world.</span> <span id="s836">So when we -- when the ghetto became a dead end and my mother, after she came back from being in hiding -- after the Germans caught her on the way back -- they beat her up, they told her to dig her grave, and because a German patrol brought out other woman -- I think I have described that part -- a-another woman and that woman was shot, the -- the -- the -- the SS man let her go and she came ba -- she came back to the ghetto, I saw -- I went ba -- I was abl -- I was working outside the ghetto, so I skipped my -- from my -- from my job -- from my pa -- from whatever we were doing.</span> <span id="s837">I -- I removed the arm band and I went to talk to him, would he accept -- would he accept my mother to go in hiding?</span> <span id="s838">Because we were old friends, I would call it, he said, “Let me think about it.</span> <span id="s839">I’ll give you an answer.”</span> <span id="s840">And eventually, on the second trip, he did accept her.</span> <span id="s841">I smuggled her out -- out of the ghetto with my wa -- w-with my ma -- w-w-with my work detachment, what you would call it, that we used to work outside the ghetto -- outside the ghetto walls.</span> <span id="s842">I -- I got her there -- I came back to the ghetto, but when I got out of the ghetto, I went with the Polish underground, with the -- with the Akar, with the army of Cryova.</span> <span id="s843">And when I found that they were so hostile to me that I -- I ga -- I wouldn’t survive with them, I went to him to let me in, and he did.</span> <span id="s844">Maybe he took advantage of me at the time, because I was able to help him.</span> <span id="s845">He had, at that time already, grenades, rifles, ammunition, a short wave radio receiver and transmitter, where he was communitcating with the -- the -- the Akar, the army of Cryova, he was like a center post -- center point, where the army of Cr-Cryova was -- was commu-communicating through him.</span> <span id="s846">He was one of many.</span> <span id="s847">On -- On the other hand, he was with an anti-Semitic group and he was still hiding two Jews.</span> <span id="s848">Two Jews that were paying him to be there, but in order to be able to convert, with what -- my mother was paying him with gold coins, with American dollars.</span> <span id="s849">There’s what -- do -- they were of no value unless you could -- could convert them into the current currency.</span> <span id="s850">And in -- in order convert it into currency -- he didn’t trust anyone in Lvov.</span> <span id="s851">He used to go to the walls of ghetto, communicate with this man that eventually came into hiding with us, that did not survive.</span> <span id="s852">Through him, he got another woman and another family of seven that we didn’t know about.</span> <span id="s853">My mother and I didn’t know about them.</span> <span id="s854">When I came back to my mother, we saw stranger -- we heard strange noises and strange shadows in the middle of the night and we confronted him and then he put us all together.</span> <span id="s855">The -- The reason why we saw those shadows and so on, because they had to go to the bathroom -- to dispose of their body waste.</span> <span id="s856">We had to go to dispose of the body waste into a cesspool or something of that sort.</span> <span id="s857">Or get water from the -- from the di -- from the well that he had in the ba -- in -- in his basement.</span> <span id="s858">But they -- the part that a being -- he said, “I was saving u -- I was saving human beings.</span> <span id="s859">I am not a Jew lover, I don’t like Jews.”</span> <span id="s860">And they used to say, “But you like money.”</span> <span id="s861">So he says, “Money does -- did na -- money doesn’t do any harm.</span> <span id="s862">But think what I -- what I am risking with.”</span> <span id="s863">And eventually, through -- I think through triangulation, they found his radio receiver, transmitter, from -- the Germans.</span> <span id="s864">They came, they discovered the arms, they discovered the -- everything, but they never discovered the Jews.</span> <span id="s865">We have camouflaged ourselves in such a way that they couldn’t find us.</span> <span id="s866">And who built?</span> <span id="s867">I built it with him, because the Hasidisha family of seven wa -- th -- they -- they -- they didn’t have to lay a brick, they couldn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s868">They were praying all day long.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: What’s your feeling toward Hasid’s now?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: I think it’s a waste of time.</span> <span id="s871">Especially with what’s going on now in Israel, with the conflict between the Reform, then the -- and the Conservative and the -- and the ultra-Orthodox.</span> <span id="s872">It’s -- That’s wa -- I-If -- If the state of Israel does not survive, God forbid, it will be the fault of the Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: Where do you put yourself on the religious continuum?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: Obs -- Conservative observe -- Conservative.</span> <span id="s875">In fact, I have -- the last couple of holidays, I went to the Reform temple.</span> <span id="s876">Not that I -- I belong to a Conservative temple in here, but I -- I went to a Reform temple because of my -- because of connections and so on, because of it just happened so -- and I find that the Reform movement allows Jews to be more alle -- more contemporary and to be more -- it was not a -- is -- does not take him away from Judaism, it just make hi -- makes him more modern.</span> <span id="s877">Is just like the -- many of the religious laws, we try to explain by using hygiene.</span> <span id="s878">Why are there -- Why are they there, where they sh -- th-that’s the basic explanation, I don’t know who -- wh-which you -- wh -- wh -- what you are, but I consider myself Conservative, not Reformed and not -- definitely not Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: When you were growing up, what did you consider yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: When I was growing up, Reform did not exist.</span> <span id="s881">You were or you were not.</span> <span id="s882">My grandfather, where I spe -- where I li -- my -- my mother and father were not observant.</span> <span id="s883">They were Jews, but not observant.</span> <span id="s884">My grandfather and grandmother, that family, were Conservative.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: Grandmother and grandfather on which side?</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: My mother’s parents.</span> <span id="s887">I never knew my father’s par -- family.</span> <span id="s888">I never met them.</span> <span id="s889">They lived under Communism.</span> <span id="s890">My -- I know my parents were in touch with them, but they were asked, “Please, you can do more harm to us by corresponding with us, than good by giving -- by sending us things.”</span> <span id="s891">So we were never in touch with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: I knew they were of -- I had some very gifted cousins.</span> <span id="s894">Concert pianists.</span> <span id="s895">But myself, I am tone deaf.</span> <span id="s896">I love music, but I cannot carry a tune.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: So -- Did you get your feeling for the religion from your grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: I got respect for religion from my grandparents.</span> <span id="s899">But my grandfather’s sister was married to a Hossett.</span> <span id="s900">When my father died, for 11 months -- I was 10 years old, I was 11 years old, I said Kaddish every day, in the Hasidisha temple, because my grandfather didn’t go to temple every day.</span> <span id="s901">He went sometimes of -- on -- on -- on -- on Saturdays and all holidays, even minor holidays.</span> <span id="s902">We didn’t go to school on even minor holidays.</span> <span id="s903">Like Passover, first two days and the last two days.</span> <span id="s904">Sukkot, the first and the last.</span> <span id="s905">I mean, a -- Purim, every -- every holiday, we ob -- we observed every holiday.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: And now?</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: Now, I observe only the major -- the -- the Rosh Hashanah, and Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s908">And Passover, [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s909">My daughter makes a seder and that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: Did your wife do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: My wife always did.</span> <span id="s912">The advantage was my wife used to make two seders.</span> <span id="s913">My daughter makes only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: Your -- Your wife did first and second night?</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: First and second night.</span> <span id="s916">Her -- My wife -- and she asked me would I mind if she kept a kosher home.</span> <span id="s917">I said, “I don’t mind, but the problem is yours, not mine.”</span> <span id="s918">And the reason why she did it, because her mother was observant.</span> <span id="s919">Her father was not, but her mother was.</span> <span id="s920">So, in order for her mother to be able to eat in her house, she say -- I say, “I don’t mind, do you want to have two sets of dishes, that’s your problem.</span> <span id="s921">I will not obstruct it.</span> <span id="s922">I will no -- I will -- I will cooperate, but I don’t care what you do.”</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: So you eat your shrimp salad on the sly?</span> <span id="s924">Just joking, I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: We -- We used to bring in Chinese food and have it on paper dishes.</span> <span id="s926">And when we went to a kosher Chinese restaurant, we walked out, because without pork and shrimp, it doesn’t taste the same.</span> <span id="s927">Chinese food doesn’t taste -- doesn’t taste right.</span> <span id="s928">And I remember that first place, it was on King’s highway -- on Flatbush Avenue, there was a Chinese restaurant, called Shanghai kosher Chinese restaurant.</span> <span id="s929">We walked out of there because it just didn’t taste the same, it didn’t taste good.</span> <span id="s930">In Chinese food -- I remember when we were looking for a house in New Jersey, our standard joke was, don’t look for how many temples are in the neighborhood, but look for how many Chinese restaurants in -- are in the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s931">Then you know if it’s a Jewish neighborhood or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: So, apropos of what is going on right now in this country, is -- is the United States the political climate you thought you were coming to?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: No, no one could predicted this thing is going to happen like this.</span> <span id="s934">No one could predict.</span> <span id="s935">First of all, the president that allowed me to stay here, was completely the opposite morally of what’s going on, and it was Truman.</span> <span id="s936">It’s interesting, but after I got my BS in ‘49, I have received a letter from the immigration authorities in Chicago, to report for deportation, cause I came here on a student visa and when you come on a student visa, you have to have a place where to go.</span> <span id="s937">The only place that I could find that would accept me from Italy -- Italy would not accept me back, I was a Displaced Person, was -- I frankly don’t remember if it was Uruguay or Paraguay, but one of those countries.</span> <span id="s938">I think it was Uruguay.</span> <span id="s939">So I went to the dean of foreign students and I said to him, “You know, my plans are to go for a Master’s degree, because engineers are now a dime a dozen.”</span> <span id="s940">Fact, at that time, engineers were getting 37.50 a week.</span> <span id="s941">Was a g-graduating class had a lot of ex-GI’s in it, under the student bi -- say -- whate-whatever tha -- it was, that shu -- that ex-G -- ni -- that GI’s were allowed to study for nothing.</span> <span id="s942">So in order to compete in the -- in the -- in the -- in the wa-- in the -- in the market better, I said, “I’ll go for a Master’s degree.”</span> <span id="s943">So, he called the immigration in Chicago and he said to him, “What are you going to take, my best man from here?”</span> <span id="s944">I got a BS with honors at the time.</span> <span id="s945">He says, “He’s going to go for a Master’s degree.”</span> <span id="s946">So, “Okay,” he said, th -- th -- they said, “Se -- Let him send -- send me the proper document-documentation,” and in the meantime, Truman passed the bill that I was able to stay here without any problems.</span> <span id="s947">But in ‘51, I got -- I got married to an American citizen, I could have -- but I never di -- I never claimed citizenship on the basis of marriage.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: Why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: I had it the other way, why should I?</span> <span id="s950">It’s -- He -- It was a -- It didn’t make any difference if I become a citizen a year sooner or two years sooner.</span> <span id="s951">There was another year, so what?</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: Your wife -- Did you feel that as an American -- as someone who hadn’t been what you’d gone through -- what you’d gone through that she could even understand who you -- who you were and what you were about?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: I don’t think she would understand.</span> <span id="s954">I don’t think she did understand.</span> <span id="s955">I don’t think that any American can understand.</span> <span id="s956">The things that I or other people went through are so traumatic that unless you live through it, you cannot express it, you cannot describe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: Did you talk about it with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: No.</span> <span id="s959">Very little.</span> <span id="s960">Very little.</span> <span id="s961">In fact, I haven’t spoken to it abou -- with my children.</span> <span id="s962">It’s my grandson that is asking more questions than anyone else.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: Why didn’t you speak to your wife or your children about this?</span> <span id="s964">A: Could have been maybe two reasons, basically.</span> <span id="s965">One, they didn’t want me to talk about it, not to bring it out more, to more or less, let’s forget about it.</span> <span id="s966">The attitude was, let’s forget about it.</span> <span id="s967">Let’s put it in the past.</span> <span id="s968">And the other one was that -- that things were so horrible and so bad that I just didn’t want them to know about it.</span> <span id="s969">There was no reason.</span> <span id="s970">They knew basically what happened, but not in fine detail.</span> <span id="s971">I don’t think anyone knows it in fine detail, because when I try to visualize that time now, the different situations that happened to me, the only thing I can say, like someone asked me, “How -- How did you manage to survive?”</span> <span id="s972">I said, “It’s nothing but pure luck.</span> <span id="s973">It’s nothing but luck,” because just like when you are in the -- in -- doy -- i-i-in a war, and you are with another man next to you and a bullet hits him and not you, what determines it?</span> <span id="s974">Nothing but luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Seems it was more than luck.</span> <span id="s976">You were really canny.</span> <span id="s977">You knew how to assume other identities, even to the point of wearing the fatigues on the trains in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: That was not a matter of survival.</span> <span id="s979">That was a matter of survival, but not a matter of life and death.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: It was --</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: When it cames to li -- When it came to life and death, it was purely luck.</span> <span id="s982">I -- I have many situations where you would call -- it was the right decision at the right time.</span> <span id="s983">Now, why did I make that decision?</span> <span id="s984">And I -- many times, I tried to analyze myself, why did I decide -- just like why did I go to the right and a -- a -- a -- or -- or not to the left?</span> <span id="s985">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s986">It just -- Something guided me internally.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: Do you think God had anything to do with it?</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: Could be.</span> <span id="s989">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s990">Could be.</span> <span id="s991">I -- I -- I can’t say I believe in God, but I believe in a -- in a super being, in something that is there, that guides our destiny.</span> <span id="s992">I went -- Look, I came here.</span> <span id="s993">I mean, I had my problems when I -- i-i-in the United States.</span> <span id="s994">When I discovered my mother had cancer, I had Bell’s Palsy, which never came back.</span> <span id="s995">I still have my left side of the face paralyzed.</span> <span id="s996">I had what they call a decompression.</span> <span id="s997">They remove one ear, they drill a hole in your head and let the nerve expand.</span> <span id="s998">After that, I had to make a major decision.</span> <span id="s999">There was a su-suspicion, not that many years ago, that I had a cancerous kidney, so I decided to remove the kidney.</span> <span id="s1000">Well, I am fine.</span> <span id="s1001">Not so recently, I had angioplasty, with a couple of stents put in.</span> <span id="s1002">Mean, those are all decisions that I had to make on the spot, with the help of my children.</span> <span id="s1003">My daughter is a doctor, a physician.</span> <span id="s1004">My son is a pharmacist.</span> <span id="s1005">They can give me educated guesses, but you know, it’s like anything else.</span> <span id="s1006">The dec -- the final decision is mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: Do you think that the God or higher power, whomever may have -- who may have helped you survive, is the same one who oversaw the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: If there is a proof that there is no God, that’s the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1009">There is a proof there is God is the people that survived the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1010">I mean, where -- that thing will remain unanswered, I guess.</span> <span id="s1011">There’s no answer to that -- a question like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: Did you pray at all during that period when you were in hiding in [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: Probably, in my own way.</span> <span id="s1014">Not from a Hebrew book, or not from a seder or from memory, because I didn’t have any.</span> <span id="s1015">My memory, basically, of Hebrew prayers boils down to the four questions and the Kaddish, and the beginning of each prayer.</span> <span id="s1016">And, you know, all the blessings over the bread and the matzoh and wine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: Y-You mentioned that you thought Truman was an upstanding fellow, but I’m curious, for one -- couple things.</span> <span id="s1018">One, what’s your feeling toward this countries attitudes toward the Holocaust as it was occurring?</span> <span id="s1019">Two -- You know, the restrictions on -- on immigration, and -- and Truman, of course, himself, ordered the bombing on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</span> <span id="s1020">He killed -- He was responsible for the order that killed thousands -- tens of thousands of civilians also.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: I have very strong feelings when it comes to the guilt of this country and England, when they came to the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1022">Not a single train and not a single railroad, not -- nothing was ever bombed.</span> <span id="s1023">The trains, they knew about it, it’s documented that they knew what was going on and if they couldn’t have stopped it, they could have slowed it down.</span> <span id="s1024">They could have done things -- those people were as good as dead anyway.</span> <span id="s1025">They could have at least destroyed the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1026">They could have destroyed the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the mass killings.</span> <span id="s1027">The Russians were actually -- were more sympathetic, because the Russian underground -- the Russian partisans were more sympathetic toward Jews, they -- they accepted Jews on a -- on a basis where you didn’t have to say who you were, as long as you were willing to fight, as long as you were willing to do something.</span> <span id="s1028">And the proof of it is -- are my own friends, who survived -- many survived in the -- in the swamps around my hometown, in the area.</span> <span id="s1029">The Bellski brigade -- meehava -- I’m quite friendly with the -- with these people, I know them quite well.</span> <span id="s1030">I used to play cards with Tevya.</span> <span id="s1031">Tuvya, not Tevya.</span> <span id="s1032">Or the Polish a -- the -- the Poles never gave any directions or any instructions to the Polish underground, go ahead and help the Jews or do something that would more or less minimize the killings.</span> <span id="s1033">The fact that I was saved by a Pole, that’s strictly an exception.</span> <span id="s1034">It’s -- It’s such an exception that he deserves anyth -- any -- any recognition possible.</span> <span id="s1035">All I know is, the man perished, himself.</span> <span id="s1036">His wife refused any contact afterwards.</span> <span id="s1037">Sh -- Cause she left Lvov and she went to her child -- to their children in Kraków, and she never gave anyone any address or any location where she is or where she was.</span> <span id="s1038">Anyway, by now she would have been over a hundred years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: What’s your feeling toward Poles in general now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: It’s strange, but the feel -- my feeling towards Poles is -- End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: Tape three, side A, interview with Jack Ahrens.</span> <span id="s1042">-- that feeling towards the Polish language, since you hadn’t tried to relearn it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: So when I see some of my friends that are conversing -- talking in Polish between themselves, I sort of try to switch their conversation to English.</span> <span id="s1044">And some of them do, because -- many of them do, in fact, because if husband and wife were both brought up in Poland and both wi -- have a Polish background, and their children are not present, they’ll speak to each other in Polish.</span> <span id="s1045">I tried to avoid it because I -- I just -- the same thing -- I feel a strong reaction toward German.</span> <span id="s1046">I just cannot stand the -- the language.</span> <span id="s1047">In fact that I am very, very friendly with this professor of German literature, who is Jewish, from the -- a Jew from Switzerland, a professor of German literature, who is re -- teaching at NYU, I didn’t ask him what he’s -- he has a course this year, I didn’t ask him what it was, but I think last year, one -- he skipped one semester, I think, last year he had a course on German literature about a Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1048">The -- The post-Holocaust German literature, about -- about the Holocaust, which is very interesting literature.</span> <span id="s1049">Well, he gave me names of some books to read in translation, which were unbelievable, unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1050">One was the transformation of a German police unit into a -- into a unit of notorious killers, how they justified it and how they became immune to killing.</span> <span id="s1051">That you can kill eight hours a day and after the eight hours, you become a family man, a -- a church loving man and so on.</span> <span id="s1052">A -- A -- La -- A God fearing man, if you would call it.</span> <span id="s1053">Just like the Jews were not human beings, like they were -- like it was a mitzvah to kill them, in a way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: Do you feel any of that duality toward this country?</span> <span id="s1055">I mean, here you’re -- you’re slamming the US and -- and England for doing nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: And yet you -- you find asylum in this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: That was at that time.</span> <span id="s1059">Now, there is still a lot of anti-Semitism in here.</span> <span id="s1060">There is a lot and the only way that Jews are doing what they are doing for the survivors, let it be here, let it be in the state of Israel, let it be anywhere, is because [indecipherable] Jews have the power to do it.</span> <span id="s1061">They have the money, they have the power to do it and they have the will to do it.</span> <span id="s1062">They have -- I don’t know of any minority group which constitutes I don’t know how many millions of people, in quantity, that has that many organizations, which are more or less directed toward self help and the help of state of Israel.</span> <span id="s1063">There are hundreds and hundreds and hun -- maybe thousands of organi-organizations, whose aim is to do something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: When you came here, did you experience anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: Very little.</span> <span id="s1066">I was in a Jewish fraternity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: I was more or less a foreign student at the university and what they are -- what -- the question was, where do you came -- where do you came from?</span> <span id="s1069">Of course, I came from Poland.</span> <span id="s1070">I mean, there was no connection between what was happening.</span> <span id="s1071">People were quite -- they were and they still are quite ignorant after what happened, how it happened.</span> <span id="s1072">I have to tell to many am -- many Americans that I talk to, the history of 1939, for example, where Poland was attacked from both sides and divided into two parts.</span> <span id="s1073">The -- The town where I came from actually, it’s not that disappeared, but when you asking wh-where it is, I don’t know where it is.</span> <span id="s1074">It’s in Belarus now, but when I was born in Poland, it was Poland.</span> <span id="s1075">Before I was born, not that many years before I was born, it was Russia.</span> <span id="s1076">So, actually, what is it?</span> <span id="s1077">Europe was so fluid.</span> <span id="s1078">I think it’s one of the longest times now, the last 50 years or whatever it is, where borders are -- the artificial borders are sort of -- more or less steady and you can say where I come from.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: Do you do much speaking to -- about the Holocaust to groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: I never spoke to any groups.</span> <span id="s1081">I never spoke to any groups about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1082">I spoke to -- I speak to some people, I -- but not enough, definitely not enough and I feel that whatever is being said is not enough.</span> <span id="s1083">Because people should learn how to tolerate, how to -- I don’t say how to love other people, but how to tolerate the other -- other beliefs and other -- other cultures.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: I want to -- I want to rewind a little bit, conceptually and go back to, you were in graduate school, what was your specialty in engineering?</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: Mechanical engineering.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: And after you gradu -- you got your Master’s degree?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: I got the Master’s degree.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: And then what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: My mentor in school was a Japanese professor, Seki Consol.</span> <span id="s1090">He was one of the Japanese professors -- one of the Japanese who was not interned during the war, by orders of President Roosevelt.</span> <span id="s1091">He was one of the main researchers and one of the originer -- originators of residential air conditioning, especially for housing and army barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: So that all -- you did your Master’s degree at the University of Illinois as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: Was this in Carbondale, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: No.</span> <span id="s1096">Champagne-Urbana.</span> <span id="s1097">When I finished my thesis and I spoke to him, I -- we were on a first name basis, we came good friends.</span> <span id="s1098">I said to him, “What am I going to do now?”</span> <span id="s1099">He says, “Don’t worry,” he said, “go to Cleveland.</span> <span id="s1100">Go to Viking Air Conditioning, there is a good friend out there of mine, Mari-Marion Levy.</span> <span id="s1101">Tell him I sent you.”</span> <span id="s1102">I said, “Give me a letter.”</span> <span id="s1103">He said, “You don’t need it.”</span> <span id="s1104">I said, “Call him.”</span> <span id="s1105">He said, “I’m not going to waste a call.”</span> <span id="s1106">So I came home, I spent a little time home, I went to Cleveland.</span> <span id="s1107">I -- I think I checked into a hotel, I come to Viking Air Conditioning.</span> <span id="s1108">I made myself an appointment with Marion Levy and he says -- and I -- he says to me, “Who are you?”</span> <span id="s1109">And so on, I introduce myself.</span> <span id="s1110">And he says to me, “I have nothing here.”</span> <span id="s1111">Now, Viking Air Conditioning was a manufacturers of fans and blowers.</span> <span id="s1112">Said, “I have nothing here.”</span> <span id="s1113">He said, “We are on a -- We are more or less winding down.</span> <span id="s1114">We did a lot of war production in here, but there is nothing doing.”</span> <span id="s1115">And I said to him, “But you know, but Seki Consol sent me here and said come o -- go.”</span> <span id="s1116">That was before the weekend.</span> <span id="s1117">He says, “All right,” he says, “go find yourself a room where you’re going to stay and come here Monday.</span> <span id="s1118">I’ll -- We’ll talk about it.”</span> <span id="s1119">So, I f -- I went out, I said, “I’m not going to find a room.</span> <span id="s1120">He’s going to send me back.</span> <span id="s1121">What am I going to look for a room?”</span> <span id="s1122">I came Monday.</span> <span id="s1123">He says to me, “You know, you’re going to be in the research and development department.”</span> <span id="s1124">I said, “Fine.”</span> <span id="s1125">I said, “What am I supposed to do?”</span> <span id="s1126">He says to me, “Talk to the head of the department.”</span> <span id="s1127">I said, “Who is the head?”</span> <span id="s1128">He says, “You.”</span> <span id="s1129">He says, “We are just starting a research and development department.”</span> <span id="s1130">I said, “What do you want me to do?”</span> <span id="s1131">He says, “It’s your problem now.”</span> <span id="s1132">S -- Anyway, I was there for a year.</span> <span id="s1133">In the meantime, you know, we did a lot of interesting things, I did a lot of interesting things.</span> <span id="s1134">I have designed a -- an exhaust fan unit, which was sold by Sears and Roebuck.</span> <span id="s1135">In fact, it’s still being sold.</span> <span id="s1136">The same unit, exactly the same way -- the same way I designed it.</span> <span id="s1137">Here ha -- They put a few electronic controls on it, but basically, it’s exactly the same unit.</span> <span id="s1138">Cause the company is not in existence any more.</span> <span id="s1139">It was sold to another company and taken over by another company.</span> <span id="s1140">But the unit still remained and Sears still has it as a window exhaust fan.</span> <span id="s1141">I was more or less what you call keeping company with my future wife at the time.</span> <span id="s1142">We were corresponding.</span> <span id="s1143">I used to take off Friday after work, from Cleveland, by car, drive all night -- that’s 500 miles -- drive all night, come here Saturday morning, have a couple of hours of sleep, spend Saturday and Sunday, leave Sunday, late in the afternoon and go report Monday morning to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: That’s love.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: Then, when I saw that that thing is a little bit too much and she wouldn’t -- she would -- she would not move.</span> <span id="s1146">Says come here and that’s it.</span> <span id="s1147">If your -- So I gave up the job and I came to New York and I found another job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">Q: What was that job?</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">A: That’s it.</span> <span id="s1150">I went to work for a company -- through another company, actually, whose main product was environmental testing equipment.</span> <span id="s1151">But they developed line of heating equipment, baseboard and heating units and I became more or less the manager of that division.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: You said that one of the things you never wanted to do was fail.</span> <span id="s1153">Never wanted to fail at anything.</span> <span id="s1154">Has that been true then, for your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: I didn’t fail at it.</span> <span id="s1156">I don’t think I failed.</span> <span id="s1157">I did -- I did things the b -- to the best of my ability.</span> <span id="s1158">I was not very successful, but I sort of ca -- held my own in a dog eat dog business, because there was a lot of major companies.</span> <span id="s1159">I had to compete with companies -- with billion dollar companies.</span> <span id="s1160">That -- That particular division.</span> <span id="s1161">So, I sort of branched off in there and did some design.</span> <span id="s1162">Besides running that division, I did design of e-environmental testing equipment, which was a very challenging subject.</span> <span id="s1163">United States used to send up satellites and rockets into space, which used to come with all kinds of data.</span> <span id="s1164">What are the conditions in outer space?</span> <span id="s1165">We were designing equipment that would simulate the change and the condition in the outer space.</span> <span id="s1166">So, for example, if a rocket, equipped with electronic equipment, would be sent up, you start with ground conditions.</span> <span id="s1167">While it’s going up, because of skin friction with air, the temperature can build up to a couple of hundred degrees on the -- on the surface.</span> <span id="s1168">But the pressure -- the va -- will change and it will come up to almost absolute vacuum.</span> <span id="s1169">But then we found out that it isn’t so, that there is a Van Allen belt, or actually the vacuum from a high vacuum, it -- it changes and there is a little more ionization in there.</span> <span id="s1170">So we had to simulate it in a chamber.</span> <span id="s1171">So when people were building their electronic equipment, or their products, they could actually put it into a chamber and the chamber would sa -- would simulate -- not the fl -- the flight, but the ca -- the -- the changing conditions.</span> <span id="s1172">So we knew -- th-those were all classified data, so we knew what -- what is going on, how the -- how the conditions progress.</span> <span id="s1173">And the -- the -- that was a challenging design, when they used to give a set of specifications.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: Did your wife --</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: But that was also -- that was also a -- a -- a competitive business.</span> <span id="s1176">We were not the only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: Did your wife work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: My wife worked on the beginning.</span> <span id="s1179">She had a degree in edu -- elementary education from NYU.</span> <span id="s1180">She even started her Masters.</span> <span id="s1181">But then the two children came and we decided both, she’ll raise the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: Did you want children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: Why was that important to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: I sort of wanted to leave a legacy in this world.</span> <span id="s1186">And my daughter was born and then my son.</span> <span id="s1187">Did I want the daughter first?</span> <span id="s1188">No, I think I wanted a son first.</span> <span id="s1189">But I’ll accept them the way they are.</span> <span id="s1190">I’ll accept them then, just the way they are.</span> <span id="s1191">And one thing I was able to instill in them is the value of education and the -- and the value of -- moral values.</span> <span id="s1192">I think both of them are pretty good people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: Did you raise them as Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1195">I raised them as Jews, but then I was disappointed twice -- more than twice.</span> <span id="s1196">My daughter went to Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s1197">She didn’t have a Bas Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s1198">Bas Mitzvahs were not fashionable at that time, if you can call it that way.</span> <span id="s1199">Now, they are fashionable, but at that time, they were not.</span> <span id="s1200">My son had a very nice Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s1201">He even went to the -- what you call the Hebrew high school at the East [indecipherable] Jewish Center.</span> <span id="s1202">He had a scholarship in there and he was quite proficient.</span> <span id="s1203">My daughter married an Italian.</span> <span id="s1204">My daughter was -- I think she was number -- in the top 10, I think she was number six or number four or something.</span> <span id="s1205">In with -- In the graduating class of Medwood High School.</span> <span id="s1206">The famous principal out there was, I think, Dr. Bernstein.</span> <span id="s1207">Was quite known for his standards and his arc -- educational requirements.</span> <span id="s1208">At the fifth year, that was the first year, with Downstate Medical and Brooklyn College started a program of selecting 10 students for an accelerated medicals program, seven years instead of eight years BA MD, they make it -- made it in seven years, BA MD.</span> <span id="s1209">My daughter applied, she was one of the people that were accepted in the BA MD program.</span> <span id="s1210">So was her future husband, from Savarian High School in the -- also in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s1211">Ca -- A real Catholic High School.</span> <span id="s1212">They fell in love -- They’re getting divorced right now, by the way.</span> <span id="s1213">They met there and they got married, I think two weeks before graduation from medical school.</span> <span id="s1214">My son, when he s -- he was accepted in the same program, but when he saw that -- the kind of work my daughter had to do, he says to me, he says, “I’m not going to do it.”</span> <span id="s1215">So I -- My wife and I, we up -- we wrote a letter to the director of the program, please give him one year delay, a one year -- put him on a one year waiting period.</span> <span id="s1216">Maybe he can change his mind.</span> <span id="s1217">And we couldn’t change his mind.</span> <span id="s1218">First of all, he didn’t want to way fro -- go away from home.</span> <span id="s1219">He wanted to go to an ophthalmology college in -- which was in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s1220">So he didn’t want to go away from home, there was none in New York.</span> <span id="s1221">So he ended up in ph-pharmacy school.</span> <span id="s1222">He finished Brooklyn College, with a biology major and he went to Brooklyn College, to Long Island University for pharmacy.</span> <span id="s1223">He is quite successful now, as a pharmacist.</span> <span id="s1224">Then again, he married a girl which -- it’s a question I don’t know, is she Jewish or isn’t she Jewish?</span> <span id="s1225">She says she is not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: Why is it a question?</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: Because I don’t know if her mother is Jewish or not.</span> <span id="s1228">Her mother married a Holocaust survivor, with numbers tattoos on -- tattooed on his arm.</span> <span id="s1229">The second husband.</span> <span id="s1230">The first husband was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s1231">And my daughter-in-law is bringing up her two daughters as Episcopalians or something.</span> <span id="s1232">Which I might -- I object, deep in my heart, but I have -- I -- I told my son I don’t like it, and he says, “It’s not your choice.</span> <span id="s1233">You can object, but that’s what she wants, and -- and --” and he says, “wh-what did God do for me?</span> <span id="s1234">Took away my mother when she was so young?”</span> <span id="s1235">His mother died, she was 47 years old.</span> <span id="s1236">So he is in complete denial of Judaism.</span> <span id="s1237">And instead of trying to convert him or instead of trying to do anything, I sort of -- I accept the status quo and I ignore it.</span> <span id="s1238">I love them all, I accept them all, I am very supportive.</span> <span id="s1239">I try to help them when I can and this is one subject which is not discussed.</span> <span id="s1240">In fact, when my granddaughters went to a -- that was very recently, in a church to a confirmation or something?</span> <span id="s1241">I -- I don’t remember the title of it.</span> <span id="s1242">I went there, in spite the fact that I didn’t care for it and I didn’t like it.</span> <span id="s1243">My grandson had a Bar Mitzvah, which I was very supportive of, which I helped to -- which his father la -- his father have -- until today doesn’t know that he had a Bar Mitzvah -- officially doesn’t know.</span> <span id="s1244">Maybe he knows, maybe he doesn’t, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1245">But his father’s family was there.</span> <span id="s1246">His aunt, his cousins were there, his immediate family was at the Bar Mitzvah, but he was never told and because of the divorce being in progress for many, many years, I na -- his pa -- his parents -- his mother -- his father, I don’t know what he is, but his mother say, I -- I think they support him.</span> <span id="s1247">But the fact that this thing is so wrong, that his own aunt, his mother’s sister, doesn’t talk to her sister because of this divorce.</span> <span id="s1248">Mean, it’s a family feud, but it’s their problem, not mine.</span> <span id="s1249">And I hope that I can see daylight already in this divorce, it’s coming to an end, hopefully.</span> <span id="s1250">But, it’s time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: You -- you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: But he is willingly -- he still has occasionally, not all the time, a woman come in -- his last he -- not his last, I think it’s the hebr -- she is a Hebrew teacher.</span> <span id="s1253">He does not study Hebrew more or less, but he studies Jewish culture.</span> <span id="s1254">About holidays, about history of Israel and so on, which is very commendable in my book.</span> <span id="s1255">And he wa -- does it -- and he does it willingly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: Do you now, or have you ever considered yourself a Zionist?</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: I was a Zionist when I was young.</span> <span id="s1258">In fact, I belonged to the same party -- he -- he -- g -- I knew Begin.</span> <span id="s1259">I knew Zharbortinsky, which are the -- the -- that’s the -- that’s the Likood, that’s the Ergoon -- this is the -- the most reactionary part of the Jewish -- of the Zionism.</span> <span id="s1260">The so-called, in quotation, Jewish terrorists.</span> <span id="s1261">But, I sort of mellowed.</span> <span id="s1262">I see that Israel is maybe a democracy, but a democracy with a question mark -- with a big question mark.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">Q: Have you thought about living there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">A: No.</span> <span id="s1265">I could not stand for their being governed and being dictated by the Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q: When you were a young Zionist, what was your vision, what was your purpose behind being affiliated with the movement?</span> <span id="s1267">What did you see as the possibility?</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: My purpose at that time was basically -- is to show my identity.</span> <span id="s1269">I was not accepted by the Poles.</span> <span id="s1270">In order to be accepted by my peers, I had to -- Zionism was a part of being -- of acceptance by my peers.</span> <span id="s1271">Now, there are the two groups.</span> <span id="s1272">There was the Socialist Zionist, the Hashomer Hatsiere and th-that was the Begorians party and there was the other one, the -- the ones that the only way we are going to get our countries through bloo -- sweat and blood and fight.</span> <span id="s1273">That was the -- the Revision -- Revisionist, the Shabortinksky party or the Leekud, now.</span> <span id="s1274">There’s the Shamir and -- and -- and -- and Begin.</span> <span id="s1275">I felt closer to the other one.</span> <span id="s1276">However, I had friend with the in -- on the other side, and we talked to each other, we were not enemies.</span> <span id="s1277">We -- We had discussions.</span> <span id="s1278">And we used to play Ping-Pong in each other’s club.</span> <span id="s1279">We were not mortal enemies, in fact that we are politically opposite.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: It -- It sounds like you keep in touch with a lot of the people you used to be friends and associates with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: How have you kept this up all this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: With age, basically, many of us have passed on.</span> <span id="s1284">I mean, they are -- they are disappearing, because o -- strictly of age.</span> <span id="s1285">But group -- the group of my peers, quite a few survived.</span> <span id="s1286">I have a woman in Brooklyn, for example, with whom I have started kindergarten together, and we went through the four years of public school, not -- it was a private public school, and eight years of high school, the 12 years of education, not together, but in the same class.</span> <span id="s1287">I have a number of other people in here that I grew up together, that we know each other from the time -- friends of mine say, “How do you -- How do you keep in touch?”</span> <span id="s1288">We sort of stick together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A: Because we have a lot in common.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: Do you talk about the past together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: We talk a lot about the past, but the strange part, when we get together, the common language now, especially with the ones that live in here, use English.</span> <span id="s1293">The ones that don’t live here, is Yiddish, because we have quite a -- I have a few of them, several let’s say, and we are scattered all over the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">Q: How many people are we talking about do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A: How many?</span> <span id="s1296">All together, you make -- I may count to 20.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Q: That’s a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A: I may count 15 - 20 at least.</span> <span id="s1299">And we started, I ha -- I had a friend that passed on, in London.</span> <span id="s1300">I have still a friend with whom I grew up together, in fact, my best childhood friend lives in Munich, Germany since 1946, I think.</span> <span id="s1301">Over 50 years in Munich.</span> <span id="s1302">Basically, no one in Poland.</span> <span id="s1303">I had -- I had some in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1304">Now they came ba -- Now they are living in here.</span> <span id="s1305">I have in Israel, several.</span> <span id="s1306">I had -- I have someone in our -- as far as Australia.</span> <span id="s1307">I have them in New York.</span> <span id="s1308">In the immediate area -- area of New York, there are quite a few.</span> <span id="s1309">Some I knew from before the war and when I say before the war, I mean before 1939.</span> <span id="s1310">Some knew me before 1939, because see, in ‘39, I was 18.</span> <span id="s1311">If someone was 12 - 13, I didn’t bother with them.</span> <span id="s1312">That age difference has disappeared.</span> <span id="s1313">So now we are basically in the same age group.</span> <span id="s1314">Or, if they were older than I was, that age difference has narrowed and we know -- wa -- and a -- and right now we know each other, so we talk to each other.</span> <span id="s1315">It’s an interesting place, but -- I lived in Lida.</span> <span id="s1316">In that general area, there were three basically bigger towns.</span> <span id="s1317">Lida, Novaroda, Kabanareetcha, that formed a triangle.</span> <span id="s1318">In the middle of the triangle, there was a little place where we used to go and spend our summers.</span> <span id="s1319">It was in the pine woods, in hef cottages.</span> <span id="s1320">The families used to rent a cottage.</span> <span id="s1321">It also had some pension -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1323">So, I’m sorry to go back on material.</span> <span id="s1324">Let it be noted, the interviewer screwed up by getting too interested and the tape ran out, and so I tried to make it [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">A: No, she did not, she did not.</span> <span id="s1326">It --</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">Q: Mr. Ahrens is much too interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">A: Call me Jack.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1330">Thank you.</span> <span id="s1331">Yakob.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1333">Jake, Jacob.</span> <span id="s1334">In fact, in my -- in the frat house, they used to stick me as Jake.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: Jake.</span> <span id="s1336">Oh boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">A: Jake.</span> <span id="s1338">So my -- my future wife says, “Don’t let them call you Jake, I hate that.</span> <span id="s1339">If anything, let it be Jack.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: Fair enough.</span> <span id="s1341">Okay.</span> <span id="s1342">What did she call you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">A: Jack.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: Did she?</span> <span id="s1345">What did she meet you as?</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">A: On a blind -- I ha -- it was a blind date.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Q: Yeah, but what did she call you at first?</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">A: I don’t -- I think I told her my name is Jack or Jake or something.</span> <span id="s1349">She called me Jack immediately.</span> <span id="s1350">She would not accept Jake.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q: So when you met on a blind date, was this love at first sight?</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">A: No.</span> <span id="s1353">Absolutely no.</span> <span id="s1354">Absolutely no.</span> <span id="s1355">But the first major date that I had with her, I took her to Brooklyn Academy of Music on New Year’s Eve to see Madame Butterfly.</span> <span id="s1356">That’s the first time she saw an opera.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: How long did it take before the relationship became what it led to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: Well, we were dating and talking to each other for probably a year and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: What did her parents think of her dating a survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1361">I was accepted there.</span> <span id="s1362">I was accepted there, cause when I told her mother that your food is cold when you -- when you -- when you serve, she always tried to burn me with hot soup.</span> <span id="s1363">See, her mother was not -- not a modern woman.</span> <span id="s1364">She did -- She was a little bit on the old-fashioned side.</span> <span id="s1365">Her father was more or less modern, more modern than -- than mother.</span> <span id="s1366">So, we sort of developed a rapport and he was -- he -- he was a sweater manufacturer, together with two brothers.</span> <span id="s1367">And he was more or less guiding the -- they had a small plant where they actually get the -- used to get the yarn, knit the material, then cut it, sew it together and sell it.</span> <span id="s1368">So one brother was the machinery -- in charge of the machinery, the other one was in charge of the finishing and the third one in charge of selling.</span> <span id="s1369">He was in charge of the machinery.</span> <span id="s1370">So, the mechanical background sort of gave us a -- a rapport together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: I want to go back to your friends, you were talking about the group of friends you made from summers and getting together.</span> <span id="s1372">Do you have a different relationship with other survivors, not necessarily even the group of friends that you still associate with, than you do with other people?</span> <span id="s1373">Do you have different relationship with Jews than you do with other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: Frankly, I blame myself for keeping away.</span> <span id="s1375">I am sort of -- keep to myself a lot.</span> <span id="s1376">I mean, once I break through, I’ll break through, but otherwise, I don’t have -- I never had too many friends.</span> <span id="s1377">I sort of keep away and keep to myself.</span> <span id="s1378">I call it mind my own business.</span> <span id="s1379">With the -- With survivors -- With other survivors, I am not active in any survivor group or survivor organization or anything.</span> <span id="s1380">I am willing to share my experiences, my past, but I don’t know, I was never asked to go and lecture or tell other people -- but I know people that do it and I know the people that did it.</span> <span id="s1381">They aren’t here any longer.</span> <span id="s1382">And they said to me, “You can volunteer.”</span> <span id="s1383">I sort of have never volunteered to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">Q: In your interview -- previous interview, you said that one of the things you learned was never to volunteer, conserve your energy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">A: That’s true, because the volunteering, it served a different pur -- that was for a different reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">Q: But is it something that’s kept with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">A: Could be, could be.</span> <span id="s1388">Or maybe volunteering is not luck, not fate.</span> <span id="s1389">I mean, it’s sort of pushing -- pushing your future, actively.</span> <span id="s1390">It’s not ‘Que sera, sera.’</span> <span id="s1391">Maybe -- May -- Ma -- Maybe I’m a fatalist, I -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1392">I’m willing to accept whatever will happen, will happen, that’s all.</span> <span id="s1393">And then i-i-in a case like that, can no -- you cannot volunteer.</span> <span id="s1394">You have to accept what is asked of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">Q: Do you think that could change as you get older, that you might consider [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">A: I’m old enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: How about your -- other survivors that you meet?</span> <span id="s1398">Do you tend to bond with them more readily?</span> <span id="s1399">Do you -- Are you more open with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">A: No.</span> <span id="s1401">No, we don’t talk too much about -- sometimes you know, I don’t care to listen to how they -- what happened to them and how they survived.</span> <span id="s1402">I mean, on the beginning, yes, but now I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1403">I -- I -- I mean, I cannot look at somebody and say he did this and he did that and he -- and he was in here and he was in there.</span> <span id="s1404">I cannot -- I don’t -- I d -- identify in that way.</span> <span id="s1405">They here, that’s all that counts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q: When you -- How about your -- the -- this group of 15 or 20 people that -- that you get together with periodically, the -- the network really, of people you knew as a young man.</span> <span id="s1407">Do you talk about the past at all, or just -- you -- you accept that you had a common past that is not as pleasant as you might like and just get on with it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">A: No, we talk about the past.</span> <span id="s1409">We talk about the past.</span> <span id="s1410">In fact, I have a group of people with whom I used to get together.</span> <span id="s1411">In fact, no-not -- not in the last few years, but that was the -- they were the members of that Bellsky Brigade, if you know.</span> <span id="s1412">Y-You probably heard about them.</span> <span id="s1413">We used to meet socially, a-as much as once a week to play cards.</span> <span id="s1414">But then again, I was neighbors with the Bellsky’s for 20 years and I didn’t even know that they were there.</span> <span id="s1415">And then someone came from Israel, or someone came and I found out that they li -- they w -- who they are and where they are.</span> <span id="s1416">Otherwise, I just -- see, through my wife, we had -- we had a group -- my wife was very active in the Hadassah.</span> <span id="s1417">She was a groo -- not a ch -- I don’t know, it’s a ch -- ke -- se -- a chapter or a group?</span> <span id="s1418">The -- The smallest thing, president for awhile.</span> <span id="s1419">And those women, together, we were active social -- socially together.</span> <span id="s1420">Usually going to shows, going to -- having like little meetings together and so on.</span> <span id="s1421">Going out socially.</span> <span id="s1422">That kept me busy.</span> <span id="s1423">I was in a consulting -- a -- I was not on the job at the time.</span> <span id="s1424">I was in the consulting business and I also had the -- no fault of my own, I ended up with a -- owning a liquor store in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s1425">That was an inheritance.</span> <span id="s1426">My wife’s father, he bought, after he -- after he retired, or -- liquidated a liquor -- the -- his -- [indecipherable] his business, he bought a liquor store, because his son had no skill of any kind.</span> <span id="s1427">He got angry at his father, so he went and joined the army, volunteered.</span> <span id="s1428">So he bought the liquor store in Brooklyn, supposedly to leave it for his son.</span> <span id="s1429">So they ran it together and then when he died, the father -- the father-in-law, he must have had a half a dozen heart attacks.</span> <span id="s1430">I mean, he was a very sick man and his son did not help him.</span> <span id="s1431">My dau -- My wife and her brother inherited it.</span> <span id="s1432">Then, I had to help him run, because he didn’t know anything about it.</span> <span id="s1433">On major holidays, I -- you know, I had to go in and see what’s going on.</span> <span id="s1434">And then he decided -- my brother-in-law, that it’s -- that California grass is greener than new -- than new -- than Brooklyn, and that’s through his brother-in-law, his wife’s brother.</span> <span id="s1435">He packed up one day, he says, “Your,” -- while my wife was un -- going -- having chemotherapy, that, “You’ll have to buy me out and I -- I’m leaving.”</span> <span id="s1436">I could not sell the store at the time, there was no market for liquor stores.</span> <span id="s1437">So I bought him out, I kept the store.</span> <span id="s1438">Fortunately I -- I had a consulting business, I was a c-consulting engineer in my field.</span> <span id="s1439">So my time was my own, basically.</span> <span id="s1440">I could schedule my time the way I wanted and I had a good absentee manager.</span> <span id="s1441">So I ran the store, in Bed-Stuy, too.</span> <span id="s1442">At that time, it was called -- called Crown Heights.</span> <span id="s1443">It’s on the outskirts of Crown Height -- Saint John’s Street, that’s a -- I don’t know, if it isn’t bates -- Bed-Stuy, nothing is.</span> <span id="s1444">So I ran -- I ran this and I ran the other thing and then -- and then, unfortunately, my wife did not survive it.</span> <span id="s1445">She di -- Six months after that, or si -- si -- a little more than six months, she died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Q: You never remarried?</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: No, I never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q: Do you consider yourself a prejudiced person?</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">A: No.</span> <span id="s1450">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1451">I had enough -- You know, prejudice toward what?</span> <span id="s1452">I mean, the word prejudice can mean so many things.</span> <span id="s1453">Is it color, is it race, is it religion, is it what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">Q: Well, for ga -- I mean -- give you an example.</span> <span id="s1455">When you talked about your disappointment with your children, you mentioned specifically that your daughter married an Italian, and that your son’s wife was raising the children to be Episcopalian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">A: I am not -- That doesn’t make me prejudice, I accepted it.</span> <span id="s1457">I accepted it and I lived with it and I live -- I -- I -- I mean, one is getting divorced, but the other one, I’m going to live with it.</span> <span id="s1458">I love him just as much.</span> <span id="s1459">I don’t deny him anything and I’m not going to do anything that’s going to hurt them or harm them.</span> <span id="s1460">I would prefer otherwise.</span> <span id="s1461">As far as -- or -- now this is -- when I say Italian and Episcopalian, this is something that by looking, doesn’t show up.</span> <span id="s1462">I mean, I don’t -- you can’t say you look Episcopalian.</span> <span id="s1463">You can say you look Italian, but that could be -- that could be anything.</span> <span id="s1464">I did a lot of business -- not a lot of business, I did business and I lived with a -- aroun -- with Blacks, because of the liquor store.</span> <span id="s1465">The staff was all Black.</span> <span id="s1466">Th-The -- The manager and so on, they were all Black.</span> <span id="s1467">They remained friends.</span> <span id="s1468">The ones that are still alive, I am still in touch with them.</span> <span id="s1469">They call me occasionally and I call them.</span> <span id="s1470">Even after the fact that I have sold the store over 10 years, they say, “Why didn’t you keep it?”</span> <span id="s1471">And a Black person -- I sold it to a Black person and a Black per -- and here he sold it to another Black person.</span> <span id="s1472">He says, “It was nothing like being with you.”</span> <span id="s1473">I-It’s -- I was very tolerant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">Q: How about the politics of this country after you came here?</span> <span id="s1475">Not long after you came, there was McCarthyism.</span> <span id="s1476">There were -- sometime -- [indecipherable] political assassinations, Martin Luther King, Junior, JFK, RFK.</span> <span id="s1477">Yo-You’ve seen Civil Rights, you’ve seen incredible social change and political action, not always of a pleasant sort since you came here.</span> <span id="s1478">Not always of an open and tolerant sort.</span> <span id="s1479">How did you feel toward, say McCarthyism, toward McCarthy?</span> <span id="s1480">Toward that whole period in our history?</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">A: I have never participated in any expression of feeling.</span> <span id="s1482">That’s one thing.</span> <span id="s1483">The second thing, I have never -- I have never expressed it.</span> <span id="s1484">I have -- Whatever I felt, I kept to myself and maybe I spoke to my wife and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1485">I remember watching [indecipherable] McCarthy hearings and what’s he -- was his name?</span> <span id="s1486">Schein or something?</span> <span id="s1487">And Cone, I -- and I was a great avar -- admirer of Edward R. Murrow, for -- for -- especially for that broadcast.</span> <span id="s1488">Friendly was one of my -- I still -- I love to listen to his lectures.</span> <span id="s1489">It’s on public radio and public television.</span> <span id="s1490">I have never expressed it, I have never participated in it and I -- of course I -- I could not -- I was always for the om -- oppressed minority.</span> <span id="s1491">However, to me the minorities, at times, they were asking too much and they were too violent.</span> <span id="s1492">During the riots of ‘68, or whene -- the -- whenever it was, during the Blackout in New York, they came to my liquor store with had -- which had a -- a harmonica type gate.</span> <span id="s1493">Not a -- Not a pull down gate, I -- I do -- I don’t know how to describe it.</span> <span id="s1494">You could see through it.</span> <span id="s1495">They came with a station wagon and a chain to pull the gate off to rob the store.</span> <span id="s1496">And who saved me, you think?</span> <span id="s1497">I had a man -- a Black guy, who was my manager at that time, working for me.</span> <span id="s1498">400 pounds.</span> <span id="s1499">They called him Slim.</span> <span id="s1500">He says, “You’re going to -- You’re going to rob this man over my dead body.”</span> <span id="s1501">So they said to him, “Why you protecting Whitey?”</span> <span id="s1502">They says, “What is it -- What is there -- What is [indecipherable] for you?”</span> <span id="s1503">He says, “Look, you rob him today, you’ll loot him, you’ll take everything away, but I’ll be out of work, I’ll be out of a job.</span> <span id="s1504">I am protecting my living.</span> <span id="s1505">See, you are a bunch of hoodlums, I am protecting my living.”</span> <span id="s1506">Because when the -- when the bl -- when they had the blackout, they send me home immediately, my crew.</span> <span id="s1507">He says, “Don’t hang around here.</span> <span id="s1508">What are you going to stay here for?</span> <span id="s1509">You’re not going to accomplish anything.</span> <span id="s1510">Get out.”</span> <span id="s1511">They stood there overnight, they watched the store.</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">Q: At this point in your life, how do you identify yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">A: I identify myself as liberals.</span> <span id="s1514">I don’t say very liberal, but liberal.</span> <span id="s1515">I am not for political killings, political assassinations and -- but for something like live and let live.</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">Q: Do you think of yourself -- who -- who are you?</span> <span id="s1517">Who are you now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1519">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1520">I don’t vote -- I’m a registered democrat for only one reason in here.</span> <span id="s1521">I vote for the person, not for the party.</span> <span id="s1522">And I feel that democrats have more primaries than the republicans.</span> <span id="s1523">So at least I can express my opinion twice, in the primary and voting.</span> <span id="s1524">Republicans had no primaries, so what’s the sense of being a republican?</span> <span id="s1525">Or being a registered republican?</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">Q: Is voting important to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1528">I have missed one election in my life and that was the last election, because November second, I had angioplasty, on a Monday and Tuesday was -- and -- and so Shumer missed my vote.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: Thankfully, he didn’t need it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">A: He didn’t need it, he didn’t need it.</span> <span id="s1531">But I had to have angioplasty.</span> <span id="s1532">I said to the doctor, “How about making it the following?”</span> <span id="s1533">Now he says, [indecipherable], “Forget it.</span> <span id="s1534">You must -- You do it now.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">Q: Tuesday, after you vote.</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">A: And I -- It was too late to get an absentee ballot.</span> <span id="s1537">I haven’t missed an election since I was eligible to vote.</span> <span id="s1538">And not always democratic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">Q: Was getting the citizenship in -- in any way part of -- wanting to be part of the political process, or didn’t it -- or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">A: To me, there was a routine.</span> <span id="s1541">I mean, I live here, I like this country, I might as well become part of it.</span> <span id="s1542">Just like I have -- by being a part of it, I -- I remember when I came, I used to sit in my -- in a study room in the frat house and we had out there, the dorm -- was a big roo -- dorm on top.</span> <span id="s1543">Then, two or three kids had little study rooms where you could sit down and study with the -- with something, where you can lie down to rest if you wanted to, with earphones, listening to the radio.</span> <span id="s1544">Not to listen to anything, but to get used to the sound of the language.</span> <span id="s1545">Because I think the hardest part in studying any language is to know when one word ends and the other one starts.</span> <span id="s1546">To be able to separate the words and the sounds.</span> <span id="s1547">Wh-Wh-What’s a word?</span> <span id="s1548">So I used to just listen to the radio and once I start thinking in the foreign languages that I -- that I knew at the one -- at the -- at the time, I felt that I really became a -- a -- a citizen of this country.</span> <span id="s1549">And then again, having an American born wife, having children that went to school in here, I mean, they grew up in here.</span> <span id="s1550">And I have never tried to communicate with my wife or -- with my wife being present, with some other -- using any other language.</span> <span id="s1551">I felt it’s an insult.</span> <span id="s1552">Even if it was completely innocent, I would tell her.</span> <span id="s1553">At times, when we were in Italy, for example, I used to tell her first what I’m going to say.</span> <span id="s1554">Or after I said, I used to tell her what I said, if she did -- because otherwise, I felt it was an insult.</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">Q: So, when you went to Italy, fo -- was that -- did you go back to Turin, did you back to Rome?</span> <span id="s1556">Did you go back to the places you had been?</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">A: I never been back to Turin, we went to Rome.</span> <span id="s1558">We went to Israel in ‘67, right after the six day war, and we stopped in Rome.</span> <span id="s1559">I don’t remember how many days.</span> <span id="s1560">I remember when we were coming from the airport by taxi, I was talking to my wife and the children in English and I see the taxi driver is going to take us for a ride.</span> <span id="s1561">I said to him, “Come on, I lived here -- I lived in Rome for a year and a half.</span> <span id="s1562">I know how to go.</span> <span id="s1563">You better go the right way.”</span> <span id="s1564">And I told my wife what I said to him.</span> <span id="s1565">You never saw a more embarrassed taxi driver.</span> <span id="s1566">He thought he was going to take me for a ride.</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">Q: What was it like going back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">A: It was an experience.</span> <span id="s1569">Not enough.</span> <span id="s1570">I would like to go again, it just didn’t come out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">Q: What do you mean, it didn’t come out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">A: It just -- I don’t know, I -- we -- I went to other places.</span> <span id="s1573">First my wife -- First, she was ill.</span> <span id="s1574">Then the children were of su -- were of such age that I wouldn’t lea -- wouldn’t want to leave them here alone.</span> <span id="s1575">Then when they grew up and left, I went to pla -- I went places.</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">Q: Did you ever go back to Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">A: No, I refused to go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s1578">I refused to go back to my hometown, which is Belarus and I know people that went there.</span> <span id="s1579">I have a movie -- a film -- a videotape of people that -- that did, in my hometown.</span> <span id="s1580">It’s completely unrecognizable.</span> <span id="s1581">It’s beyond comprehension what happened to it.</span> <span id="s1582">The Russians and the Germans had a major artiller -- artillery duel and all of downtown, which used to be Jewish, of course, like in all tow -- little towns, was completely destroyed, it does not exist.</span> <span id="s1583">It’s a field now.</span> <span id="s1584">When the Russians came, they built a housing complex, they didn’t know where.</span> <span id="s1585">It turned out they built it over a Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s1586">Because all the markings and gravestones were removed.</span> <span id="s1587">And it was a slab, not a -- a foundation, not a basement, because if they had a ba-basement, they would have dug and they would have found the caskets.</span> <span id="s1588">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1589">They -- People that were there, told me there is nothing to see.</span> <span id="s1590">And then I had another experience.</span> <span id="s1591">In Lvov, right after the war, that must have been August of ‘44, by accident I bumped into one of the -- one of my friends from my town, who was a musician.</span> <span id="s1592">Another friend of mine used to -- ha -- owned a bakery, coffee shop -- I don’t -- cafe, where you could go in the back, have a cup of -- cup of coffee and pastry and even dancing the -- in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s1593">There was an orchestra of a father and son.</span> <span id="s1594">The son used to play the accordion.</span> <span id="s1595">That son saved himself, ended up in the USO of the Russian army.</span> <span id="s1596">And I bumped into him on the market in Lvov.</span> <span id="s1597">I looked at him, he looked at me, I said, “I know you.”</span> <span id="s1598">And he says, “I know you, too.”</span> <span id="s1599">Said, “Are you,” and I mentioned his name and he said, “Yeah.”</span> <span id="s1600">I says and he recognized me too.</span> <span id="s1601">You know, it was just a few years, but a few years of tough a life.</span> <span id="s1602">He said he was just coming from that front.</span> <span id="s1603">He went through Deeta, there was absolutely nothing left.</span> <span id="s1604">There is nobody left.</span> <span id="s1605">He told me who survived.</span> <span id="s1606">My family, completely wiped out, completely disappeared.</span> <span id="s1607">There is absolutely nobody from my family.</span> <span id="s1608">So I didn’t go there.</span> <span id="s1609">My mother said to me, “What are you going to go for?”</span> <span id="s1610">Later -- Later I found out something very tragic and very disturbing.</span> <span id="s1611">My grandparents were quite wealthy.</span> <span id="s1612">They were banished from my town to a small place, because it was too close to the border, so the Russians banished them and they had to move out from there.</span> <span id="s1613">But once the ghetto started, they were able to move back.</span> <span id="s1614">And they had quite a bundle of dollars, gold, jewelry, gold coins.</span> <span id="s1615">So they buried it somewhere.</span> <span id="s1616">They were killed on the beginning, because the Germans procedure, what you called, was to get rid of the old ones first.</span> <span id="s1617">Kill the old ones first and the very young ones, the babies.</span> <span id="s1618">Get as much as you can out of the middle age and young and exterminate them in the -- in the -- the way -- the way they did it.</span> <span id="s1619">By hunger, starvation, sickness or whatever th -- whatever they did.</span> <span id="s1620">My aunt -- My -- The youngest sister, my mother’s youngest sister, the youngest one in the family.</span> <span id="s1621">She married and they had a little girl.</span> <span id="s1622">The girl at that time was about six or seven years old.</span> <span id="s1623">They knew where the stuff was buried.</span> <span id="s1624">They were in the ghetto and my aunt’s husband, my uncle, was an accountant, a very able man, extremely able man.</span> <span id="s1625">Very, very, very a -- from a poor family, what you would call.</span> <span id="s1626">He married into a rich family, but believe me, he was extremely able and -- and they got a bargain.</span> <span id="s1627">You know, at that time, you -- wa -- you try to marry someone off, it was love, all -- you want more coffee?</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">Q: No, I’m going to need to change tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">A: Do you have another one or you want me to get you one?</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">Q: Yeah, I do.</span> <span id="s1631">I’ve got one, thanks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">Q: Okay, this is tape four, side A, with the alarm, interview with Jack Ahrens on the 27th of January, 1999, in his clock filled home in Bayside Queens, New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">A: So I was talking about my aunt and uncle and their little girl.</span> <span id="s1635">My uncle thought somehow that he can buy up the German guy, with whom he made friends -- dragono -- I don’t know what -- what he thought they would let him do, because many, or rather some from that area went into the swamps, which were surround -- which were not too far, with the Russian partisans or with the underground.</span> <span id="s1636">He’d -- I don’t think he’d believed in it.</span> <span id="s1637">So he thought he was going -- tha-that he would be able to bribe the German and he will let him I -- I don’t know what.</span> <span id="s1638">Anyway, they took him -- He and my aunt, took him -- took the German guy to the place where the things were hidden.</span> <span id="s1639">They dug it up and on the spot, the Germans shot them both, killed them both.</span> <span id="s1640">That’s a hearsay from people that tell me that.</span> <span id="s1641">He shot the little girl, but he wounded her.</span> <span id="s1642">She was killed in -- in a massacre that -- in a subsequent ghetto liquidation thing.</span> <span id="s1643">She did not survive either.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">Q: When your grandso -- How old is your grandson now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">A: He’s 14 and a half.</span> <span id="s1646">He’ll be 15 in August.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">Q: What kinds of things does he want to know when he asks you questions about the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">A: He asks me sporadic questions.</span> <span id="s1649">He -- I know he wrote a composition in his -- in his school, that gi -- his grandfather is the most remarkable person he ever met, that in spite of the fact that he whe -- he went through, he’s still -- he still can help him with math, with science, that he remembers all those things.</span> <span id="s1650">And he is tolerant.</span> <span id="s1651">He’s curious.</span> <span id="s1652">He asks me questions of -- mostly general questions, not detailed questions and I try to avoid the gruesome facts.</span> <span id="s1653">Just give him like a general overview.</span> <span id="s1654">He’ll learn the gruesome facts when the time comes.</span> <span id="s1655">I think it’s too early for him to -- for me to tell him the -- the -- the -- describe the actual killings and -- and what I actually saw with my own eyes.</span> <span id="s1656">It’s enough that he knows that -- what the -- what happened, that he shows interest.</span> <span id="s1657">The granddaughters don’t.</span> <span id="s1658">They don’t ask questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">Q: How old are they?</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">A: They are too young yet, eight and 11.</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">Q: Ah.</span> <span id="s1662">Wh-What’s your feeling toward what’s almost become the commercialization of the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s1663">Or maybe I’m putting words into your brain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">A: I don’t s -- I don’t think there is any commercialization.</span> <span id="s1665">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1666">I think it’s a way how to keep it alive.</span> <span id="s1667">I mean, I’m not with Mayer Kahanai, don’t forget or we’ll never forget.</span> <span id="s1668">I mean, I am not with that.</span> <span id="s1669">But we still shouldn’t forget.</span> <span id="s1670">We should learn maybe how to forgive, but never forget.</span> <span id="s1671">Make sure that it does -- not it doesn’t happen again.</span> <span id="s1672">I mean, I’m really disturbed when I see what’s happening in Kosovo, in Serbia.</span> <span id="s1673">That’s really disturbs me, because I see the same hate and the worst part [indecipherable] the same people that did a lot of killing and a lot of damage during the -- f-for Hitler, now they are doing it for themselves.</span> <span id="s1674">And that’s very disturbing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">Q: Do you think in this case that once again, this country is not doing enough, we’re not doing anything, that it could be doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">A: I agree with you, they’re not doing enough.</span> <span id="s1677">They should be more forceful with their -- Milosevitch is getting away with too much.</span> <span id="s1678">Instead of threatening him, they should do it once.</span> <span id="s1679">Ste -- I mean they threaten him so many times, you can’t take it seriously.</span> <span id="s1680">I mean every time they -- every time something happens, it’s just we’re the -- he, just like with Saddam, they are letting him get away with everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">Q: What -- How -- What is your feeling toward the appropriation of the word for other genocide?</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">A: It’s genocide on a -- not on a such massive scale as the hol -- a-as the Holocaust, but it’s still -- the -- the reason for the killing is not what you did, it’s who you are.</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">Q: What is your feeling toward African-Americans applying Holocaust to slavery?</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">A: I see no relation between it.</span> <span id="s1685">I absolutely see no relation to it -- to it.</span> <span id="s1686">Because, frankly, from what I read and from what I -- I mean, I wasn’t there before, I read, the major sinners of slavery were African -- were Africans themselves, were Black people themselves.</span> <span id="s1687">They were selling their brothers and sisters into slavery.</span> <span id="s1688">It was not just that the White man -- the -- maybe the White man started, but they -- they took advantage of the situation also.</span> <span id="s1689">They were -- They perfetrated lot of slavery themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">Q: Cause there’s a lot of -- of course, people holding Jews responsible for much of the activities of slavery.</span> <span id="s1691">As being slave holders and slave sellers, and -- business people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">A: Jews were not slave holders.</span> <span id="s1693">To be a slave holder, you’ve -- you have to be a land owner.</span> <span id="s1694">Jews, by nature were never land owners.</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">Q: They -- Business people who sold slaves, who was pre -- who thought of slaves as property, a people as property.</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">A: That could have -- I don’t know, it’s quite possible that occasionally there could have been Jews, but there were so -- by the same token there were Christians, and there were Episcopalians and there were Baptists and you name any reli - and Moslems, they are now.</span> <span id="s1697">There are plenty of Moslems now that are slave owners, and why don’t they go against them?</span> <span id="s1698">If Jews were -- Jews did many things, not by choice, by force, because they had -- they couldn’t do anything else.</span> <span id="s1699">All the other ones, they have a choice.</span> <span id="s1700">There are certain za -- from what I have learned from history that there are -- there are certain professions like moneylending for example, whi-whic-which with Jews are associated, that were forced upon the Jews.</span> <span id="s1701">They -- Jews didn’t do it by choice.</span> <span id="s1702">In fact, they became moneylenders after they were expelled from the old land of I-Israel or whatever you call it.</span> <span id="s1703">When they were put into the D-Diaspora.</span> <span id="s1704">When they were prohibited from certain trades, from certain professions, from owning land and so on.</span> <span id="s1705">From being n-normal people.</span> <span id="s1706">Am I right?</span> <span id="s1707">That’s my strong feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">Q: Who do you feel was or were the most important people in shaping you as you were a young man and as you are now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">A: I grew up basically on my own.</span> <span id="s1710">I had more freedom than many of my friends and I am talking about the years from let’s say 13 - 14, til 18.</span> <span id="s1711">The critical years, I would call them, in growing up and shaking -- shaping character.</span> <span id="s1712">Because my mother was in the United States.</span> <span id="s1713">My grandparents didn’t bother me.</span> <span id="s1714">My aunt used to go to school ba -- more or less to get my reports from school.</span> <span id="s1715">I was more or less on my own.</span> <span id="s1716">However, the value of education was always stressed to me by everyone concerned.</span> <span id="s1717">Also, my uncle and aunt, we had a super radio at home, where I used to love to listen to n-not -- there was no rock and roll at that time, but I call classical music good music and also, to a lot of foreign stations, by even trying to guess what language they are speaking and what are they talking about.</span> <span id="s1718">I was exposed to many ideologists at the time, because I could listen to the Soviet Union direct, on radio, to their propaganda without being affected.</span> <span id="s1719">I was exposed to the Zionist trend, to both sides, thi -- what you would call Labor and Likud.</span> <span id="s1720">I would call myself at the time, as the young -- young intel -- Jewish intellectual.</span> <span id="s1721">I know that when my aunt and uncle, when their -- they -- their friends used to come, there was no drinking, there was no noise, there were usually serious discussions, which if I didn’t participate, I listened to.</span> <span id="s1722">Political discussions, what’s going on in the world.</span> <span id="s1723">They were talking about the situation -- about -- or the rise of Hitler.</span> <span id="s1724">The rise -- What’s going on in France, what’s going on in England.</span> <span id="s1725">About the Soviet Union, about Stalin’s purges.</span> <span id="s1726">This had to leave some sort of a re-residue in -- in my mind.</span> <span id="s1727">I could not participate, I was too young for them.</span> <span id="s1728">They were older and they wouldn’t listen to what I had to say.</span> <span id="s1729">With my friends, we used to get together, or -- or play cards or -- or -- or joke around.</span> <span id="s1730">But never anything malicious.</span> <span id="s1731">No malicious jokes, no malicious mischief.</span> <span id="s1732">Maybe that’s why those friendship lasted that long.</span> <span id="s1733">It was -- I would call the -- a lot of -- had a lot of good time together and strange -- strange enough, the group consisted -- I would -- more than 99 percent it was purely Jewish.</span> <span id="s1734">E-Even when -- Ev-Even if our parents, or rather the generation above us, hardly knew each other, the children could have been friends.</span> <span id="s1735">In many cases, the friendship -- the ch -- the children’s friendship originated with the parent’s friendship, or even grandparents friendship, but there were many friends in our group where the older generation hardly knew each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">Q: Who are the people in the photograph behind you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">A: That’s my family.</span> <span id="s1738">I am the little bald boy.</span> <span id="s1739">I am s -- [indecipherable] seven years old, I think.</span> <span id="s1740">Behind me is my father and my -- what would be on my left, is my mother.</span> <span id="s1741">The next two people sitting is my grandfather and grandmother -- that’s my mother’s parents.</span> <span id="s1742">The next two women is -- are my -- my mother’s sisters.</span> <span id="s1743">First is the younger sister, then is the older sister.</span> <span id="s1744">The hus -- The man behind her is her husband.</span> <span id="s1745">The man next is a uncle who perished of typhoid fever in Lvov ghetto.</span> <span id="s1746">And the tallest one is the one that ended up in the 20’s in Israel, who died b-being 93, I think, just about a couple of months ago.</span> <span id="s1747">I mean, of course, I could not have saved that picture.</span> <span id="s1748">That picture was given to me by -- when I was in Israel, they -- my uncle had it and he gave it to me.</span> <span id="s1749">That was -- The reason for this picture is this uncle, in the background, went to Palestine in 1926.</span> <span id="s1750">He came back, I think in ‘28, for a visit.</span> <span id="s1751">And that’s when they went and they took this picture.</span> <span id="s1752">My grandmother was so upset that she had a stroke after that, from which she recovered.</span> <span id="s1753">She was partially paralyzed on one side.</span> <span id="s1754">I mean, it could be like in the family.</span> <span id="s1755">She had like Bell’s Palsy, just like I had it when I discovered that my mother had cancer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">Q: I have one question out of something that you said ages ago, but it has been --</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">A: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">Q: -- bothering me ever since, is that when you first came to New York, that -- and you went with your mother around -- looking around the city, that the Fulton Fish Market was the biggest attraction.</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">A: No, that was not with my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">A: The Fulton Fish Market, when the agent -- the INS agent, he ma -- the immigration service agent was taking me to Ellis Island.</span> <span id="s1762">He took me by cab to ride around New York.</span> <span id="s1763">We stopped at the Empire State Building, he showed me the Chrysler Building, he showed me a bunch of things that existed at the time.</span> <span id="s1764">And going to the Battery, we start at the Fulton Fish Market.</span> <span id="s1765">That was a -- That -- That will -- I’ll never forget, because it smelled.</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">Q: Did you -- Did you stop to look out over the Statue of Liberty as well, or any of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">A: I was going to the Statue of Liberty.</span> <span id="s1768">In the -- In that general area.</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">Q: [indecipherable] Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s1770">Did you have any feelings when you saw the statue?</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">A: At the time, no.</span> <span id="s1772">But recently I went to the Statue of Liberty and to Ellis Island, a few years ago.</span> <span id="s1773">And it is strange, but I drew a complete blank, I still have a complete blank, where I was these two days.</span> <span id="s1774">What did I eat?</span> <span id="s1775">Where did I sleep?</span> <span id="s1776">I remember the building, I remembered where I was, the -- the balcony and all that.</span> <span id="s1777">But where did I sleep two nights?</span> <span id="s1778">What did I eat?</span> <span id="s1779">What did I do there?</span> <span id="s1780">I can’t remember a thing.</span> <span id="s1781">It just like -- I left Italy on the 15th, I arrived to the States on the 18th.</span> <span id="s1782">Where was I those two days?</span> <span id="s1783">In no man’s land.</span> <span id="s1784">The wa -- I was nowhere.</span> <span id="s1785">I didn’t travel, I was not in the United States.</span> <span id="s1786">It’s something that I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1787">I have no recollection.</span> <span id="s1788">It’s a blank.</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">Q: When you left Italy, was that your first plane ride?</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1791">And I remember when we stopped in Geneva, whatever m-money I had, I went, I bought Swiss chocolates.</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">Q: You still eat Swiss chocolate?</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">A: Occasionally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">Q: How about sugar beets?</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">A: Try to avoid it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">Q: Is there something I haven’t asked you to -- to talk about that you would like to talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">A: I don’t know, I -- you a -- let me take a look.</span> <span id="s1798">I made a couple of notes out there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">Q: Okay, great.</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">A: I’ll see what I have.</span> <span id="s1801">[inaudible].</span> <span id="s1802">Okay, one thing I want to mention, which is maybe I was forced into my educational backgrounds, trying to learn things and trying to -- to study.</span> <span id="s1803">My family, when I was growing up, kept me sort of isolated from the business end.</span> <span id="s1804">My grandfather had a -- together with -- with other partners, they had a major wholesale business, a hardware wholesale in -- in -- in -- in our town.</span> <span id="s1805">They had some factories, some other interests and so on.</span> <span id="s1806">I was never involved, never introduced to the business end of the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1807">So, actually, to start something on my own, to go and earn a living, I didn’t know how to do it.</span> <span id="s1808">It was -- I -- I bi -- I -- I -- I was afraid.</span> <span id="s1809">The only thing I knew is more or less how to offer my services and let someone else take advantage of me.</span> <span id="s1810">I didn’t know how to start a business, how to run a business, how to buy and sell and maybe I was afraid that someone will take advantage of me.</span> <span id="s1811">That’s why I -- I’ve -- I --I thought that if I pursue an education, we -- if I try to learn things, I might be able, through there -- offer my services to the highest bidder, in a way.</span> <span id="s1812">That’s what it boils down to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">Q: Did you find that you combined your education, the formal education you got with what we would now call your street education, with your great ability to finagle?</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1815">I think I did.</span> <span id="s1816">I think I did.</span> <span id="s1817">First of all, I was running a business, a division of a company.</span> <span id="s1818">Eventually I had to give it up, because the president of the company died.</span> <span id="s1819">In sfite the fact -- in spite the fact that they went on the stock market at one time, then they had to withdraw because the thing ca -- became too small.</span> <span id="s1820">It was a family affair and there was no room where to advance.</span> <span id="s1821">It’s -- The family took it over and it became sort of a stagnant.</span> <span id="s1822">Then I was able to run a business, a retail business in a -- basically in 99 percent, at that time Black area -- Afro-American area -- you want to ca -- any way you want to call it, and bees -- be halfway successful.</span> <span id="s1823">Because I think I was liked out there by my people with whom I made nice friendships.</span> <span id="s1824">We knew each other quite well and it translated into good business and to them into good service.</span> <span id="s1825">And we were friendly -- fr-friends with each other, supportive of each other in a way.</span> <span id="s1826">I mean, they needed help, I needed help.</span> <span id="s1827">My help was one way, their help was moral support and sometimes financial support and we -- we sort of survived.</span> <span id="s1828">Maybe that what -- that -- that helped me.</span> <span id="s1829">I tried to combine both.</span> <span id="s1830">I don’t say I am successful, but I became -- whatever I have now, no one gave it to me.</span> <span id="s1831">I had to start absolutely from scratch.</span> <span id="s1832">The only basic inheritance was my wife’s, you know, the end of the liquor store, which I had to pay my -- pay out my brother-in-law, cause he decided he -- he wanted -- decided to go to California.</span> <span id="s1833">Unfortunately, he passed on.</span> <span id="s1834">It’s -- The whole family is -- is dead, which is very disturbing.</span> <span id="s1835">No one to argue with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">Q: Anything else you want to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">Q: Anything else you want to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">A: No, but you have been very nice.</span> <span id="s1840">You ask very, very nice questions.</span> <span id="s1841">And if you can think of anything else, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">Q: Well, I -- I could probably keep you here for another few hours, because I keep on thinking back on --</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">A: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">Q: -- other details, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">A: You hungry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">A: So, we’ll go out and have some lunch.</span> <span id="s1848">You want to
