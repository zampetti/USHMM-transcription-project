We were a happy family.</span> <span id="s38">My mother had 5 sisters and 1 brother.</span> <span id="s39">The brother was a very rich man.</span> <span id="s40">He didn't live too long in this town but he moved to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s41">Warsaw was like 32 kilometers from Tarczyn, and with a bus it's 30 minutes away.</span> <span id="s42">So we very often went.</span> <span id="s43">My mother...like for a dress or for a hat or for something and always in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s44">And I had a happy life til 1939, til the war broked out.</span> <span id="s45">And in school, they told us we have to wear masks because they were afraid for the gas.</span> <span id="s46">They said they will supply, you know, the...uh...with gas so I came home from school and the war broke out in September the 5th, 39,and my life was shattered right away because my...we were afraid they will call my father to the army.</span> <span id="s47">My father was only 39 years old.</span> <span id="s48">So my father was a very religious man.</span> <span id="s49">To the mill what he possessed he had two partners.</span> <span id="s50">One partner which was like a relative to us and they started in school when they 1 beginning of the Second World War September 1, 1939 were young boys.</span> <span id="s51">My grandmother died when she was 28 years old.</span> <span id="s52">My father was 10 years old.</span> <span id="s53">And he had a stepmother like from a book, not a good one.</span> <span id="s54">So he was troubling and...uh...his friend was in the same position also without a mother.</span> <span id="s55">So they start like to doing business about 10, 11 years.</span> <span id="s56">And they remained after 60 years partners like they're just relatives, and with the kids...with the children we were also like relatives til today.</span> <span id="s57">So my father with this partner went to Warsaw to this Rabbi.</span> <span id="s58">What the Rabbi said if he will be going to the army or should he stay in Tarczyn or should he go to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s59">So the Rabbi said that he wouldn't go to the army.</span> <span id="s60">The Polish army doesn't need him.</span> <span id="s61">He's too old, 39 years old.</span> <span id="s62">But he should come to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s63">So my father came back the same day and when I came home I..</span> <span id="s64">.</span> <span id="s65">I saw that the maids are taking everything out from the closets and packing in sacks, in big, long sacks.</span> <span id="s66">So I said, "What's this?"</span> <span id="s67">So my mother took me aside and she said, "Eat your supper.”</span> <span id="s68">I still remember what the supper was.</span> <span id="s69">Fish, fried fish.</span> <span id="s70">And.</span> <span id="s71">.</span> <span id="s72">uh.</span> <span id="s73">.</span> <span id="s74">we're going to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s75">And right away the men came.</span> <span id="s76">He took all the possessions from the room, from our house and we had our own horses through the mill, you know, so everything like...was like a..</span> <span id="s77">.</span> <span id="s78">we called this a Wagen, you know, like you see in America when the...the...the Mexico, you know, and the horses, the big Wagens, and we took every...I mean they took everything on the Wagen and we went to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s79">Our family and my father's partner's family.</span> <span id="s80">My father stood still yet in Tarczyn, but my mother and the children and the maid and we came to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s81">It was a hectic night.</span> <span id="s82">The kids all were crying.</span> <span id="s83">We were upset, and what we heard was boom, boom, boom...the artillery and the shooting.</span> <span id="s84">So when we came to Warsaw we came to a beautiful apartment, friends of mine parents were still....on the summer house because it was summer in Europe and we...this was , and we took their apartment, but we didn't remain too long in this apartment because the Polish army moved in...in the building with the...you know, so we were afraid.</span> <span id="s85">So my mother called her brother if we could come to him.</span> <span id="s86">So my brothers and myself and my mother came to my uncle, 23 in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s87">Two days later my father arrived and we been together.</span> <span id="s88">And that day the war started and there was fires and it was hell.</span> <span id="s89">But we still together.</span> <span id="s90">Not only us because then was bombed this...uh...uh....house on the Granichna.</span> <span id="s91">So my father's partner came over with his family together to us, and we stood together til the German occuped Warsaw.</span> <span id="s92">So the first day we wanted to go back to Tarczyn because in ghetto...it wasn't yet a ghetto, but we were like, you know, just us, and we didn't have too much food because we left everything behind and what we had we left in the Granichna and it was bombed after two days.</span> <span id="s93">But my father went to a baker who bought from our business flour, and he gave us a whole, like 50 pounds, a 100 pounds of flour, and my father brought it to the...my uncle and my mother and my aunt baked hallahs, bread, so we had to eat.</span> <span id="s94">But was a hard time with water.</span> <span id="s95">We didn't have water.</span> <span id="s96">So we put on...on...for the children...for us...like for me, it was like a game you know.</span> <span id="s97">We were small.</span> <span id="s98">We didn't understand so much...on a pot, a belt to carry the water and we went to the Visla (ph) for the water.</span> <span id="s99">It was like a half hour maybe, a hour walk but til we were loaded with water, was heavy the pot, you know, to carry.</span> <span id="s100">That's the way we brought the water.</span> <span id="s101">Till my father one day said to us...this was also September, like 15 because before 15...15 was my birthday...and I remember sitting with my mother and with everybody there from hiding from the bombs and I said, "That's my birthday.</span> <span id="s102">I maybe get killed from the bombs.”</span> <span id="s103">And in the same day my father was...went to the Rabbi with my two brothers on the .</span> <span id="s104">He was...by the Rabbi...what he believed in this Rabbi, and a bomb went in...in this shelter and the whole building came down and my father start to scream to this Rabbi, "Is this how you so holy that I am getting killed, my children and everybody?"</span> <span id="s105">So the Rabbi said, "Don't worry.</span> <span id="s106">You'll be alive and you will still see your grandchildren.”</span> <span id="s107">And all of a sudden like a window was opening in the ground, and my father was out from the...from the, you know, bombed out house, from the shrapnels, and he pulled out my brothers, the two brothers.</span> <span id="s108">They were injured, the face and scratches and he took and then he slipped out the Rabbi too and they came to us in the evening and the Rabbi...and we couldn't stay in my uncle's apartment anymore because he lived in the third floor so we went to stay in a store in the same building.</span> <span id="s109">They had a dairy store with people.</span> <span id="s110">They didn't have children, two old people.</span> <span id="s111">So they agreed to let in this Rabbi because he needed a room by himself.</span> <span id="s112">He was a very holy man.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">And we also stood there.</span> <span id="s114">Not only us, but practically the whole building of people were standing like sardines because it was low for bombs so we were standing there.</span> <span id="s115">And then when the war was over...the war I mean the 39 the German occupied Poland, so my father...somebody came already and said our mill was bombed and we have nothing to go there.</span> <span id="s116">So my father started to the Rabbi to scream, "Where are you?</span> <span id="s117">What I am going to do.</span> <span id="s118">Everything is bombed?"</span> <span id="s119">And the Rabbi said, "Believe me.</span> <span id="s120">Not you....uh...not you mill is...is bombed.”</span> <span id="s121">In the same town was my uncle.</span> <span id="s122">My mother's brother was a very rich man.</span> <span id="s123">He had a mill in the same neighborhood what my father and actually my uncle's mill was bombed and burned and ours was partly burned but not completely.</span> <span id="s124">So my mother wasn't able to go.</span> <span id="s125">We didn't had any communication to go back to Tarczyn.</span> <span id="s126">So we start to walk.</span> <span id="s127">Myself, my father and mine...one of mine brothers, and my father's partner and his son.</span> <span id="s128">I will name him Mr. Leshno and another two people.</span> <span id="s129">It was a distant relative of ours.</span> <span id="s130">He also went with his son to Tarczyn.</span> <span id="s131">32 kilometers.</span> <span id="s132">We maked it in a few hours.</span> <span id="s133">We get to come home.</span> <span id="s134">But we came near to the town.</span> <span id="s135">The smell was terrible.</span> <span id="s136">From fire, from bodies, from sweat.</span> <span id="s137">It was very hot.</span> <span id="s138">And we saw as we came to the town...uh...I could...everybody could see our house, and it was like the edge burned the house and in behind was our mill.</span> <span id="s139">So we came back to the house.</span> <span id="s140">I opened the closet.</span> <span id="s141">It was still eggs and butter and cheese from the night what we didn't finished our supper and what everything and all sugar and jam and everything because the war was going we didn't suspect that we will have to run away.</span> <span id="s142">So that was good for us, that we had right away everything.</span> <span id="s143">Also a cousin of mine moved in to our apartment because her house was burned and she actually saved this house because...with water...was no firemen at the time...so with water, with buckets of water she saved this fire shouldn't go farther.</span> <span id="s144">And we were again happy to stay.</span> <span id="s145">Right?</span> <span id="s146">As a child you ask me what I remember.</span> <span id="s147">I remember I was afraid to sleep in my bed because after all...uh...the two, three weeks I didn't sleep in a bed.</span> <span id="s148">I was always sitting or lying on the floor, no bed.</span> <span id="s149">So I went to mine aunt, mine father's sister to sleep.</span> <span id="s150">She had a restaurant in town, and she had a girl, my cousin, mine age.</span> <span id="s151">And we like each other very much.</span> <span id="s152">I said I would sleep with my cousin Hilda, and I don't want to sleep at home.</span> <span id="s153">So my mother said, "Fine.”</span> <span id="s154">Oh...and at the time my mother came also to the town back.</span> <span id="s155">And I ran around to my aunt's to see if everybody is alive, and the town had a square and a lot of Germans in it.</span> <span id="s156">And I was very much afraid and people were running up to the Germans with a cigarette to sell bread or something and I slept this night by my aunt.</span> <span id="s157">In the morning about 7 o'clock, my father came in and talked something to my aunt and I was very anxious to know what happened.</span> <span id="s158">And they didn't want to tell me...a child...what happened during the night.</span> <span id="s159">That the German with the Poles come into our house and they took out my cousin, the woman's husband who let...who saved this house from the fire with my father with mine father's partner, Mr. Leshno.</span> <span id="s160">They took him on the attic.</span> <span id="s161">They wanted money.</span> <span id="s162">So my father said he has no money.</span> <span id="s163">He has the mill.</span> <span id="s164">And it's after the war and I don't have money.</span> <span id="s165">And the German...was few Germans, not only one...each one took a person like the three of them and start to beat them and start to scream they should run away.</span> <span id="s166">So my father was afraid to go to his room but on the attic a tailor was living there, without children, a nice old Jewish poor people.</span> <span id="s167">So he went into them and he sat til the morning there.</span> <span id="s168">But he was afraid to tell my mother that he's alive.</span> <span id="s169">And it was the first night in the town.</span> <span id="s170">So, of course, my mother was very upset in the morning and my father came to my aunt to tell her what's what...that from now on he will remain there too.</span> <span id="s171">It didn't took too long.</span> <span id="s172">It took about maybe 2 weeks.</span> <span id="s173">My father decided he's going to be free.</span> <span id="s174">He cannot live like this so he decided...he and my cousin and mine father's partner, Mr. Leshno will go to Russia.</span> <span id="s175">First, they go to Warsaw, and later will go to Russia to Bialystok (ph).</span> <span id="s176">They said goodbye to us and my mother was crying.</span> <span id="s177">She screamed, "I am already a widow.</span> <span id="s178">How do you leave me?"</span> <span id="s179">But he left the money and a lot of people owe us money also.</span> <span id="s180">So we remained in the town with the maid.</span> <span id="s181">The maid had no place where to go.</span> <span id="s182">It was a Jewish woman.</span> <span id="s183">She raised us and she was like a family with us, and we stood there.</span> <span id="s184">And my father disappeared.</span> <span id="s185">We didn't know what and where and what.</span> <span id="s186">Occasionally we got...I mean my mother got...just had the news.</span> <span id="s187">My mother said, Oh, your father's fine and everything is alright.</span> <span id="s188">Maybe we'll some day be able to join him.”</span> <span id="s189">So...uh...we stood together in this Tarczyn, and nothing specially, you know.</span> <span id="s190">We lived without... just with the hope that we will join our father and maybe the Germans will let us live in peace.</span> <span id="s191">(Sigh) Then one day what I remember, my mother said, "We're out of money and I have to go to Warsaw to Mr. Flynn.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Mr. Flynn was a Polish German.</span> <span id="s193">That means he was a German by birth, but he lived in Poland.</span> <span id="s194">And he had...uh....we call it here commissioned bakery, and he owned us a lot of money so maybe he could give us some money.</span> <span id="s195">So my mother left and my younger brother got very sick and I didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s196">I was like the woman of the house so I called a neighbor.</span> <span id="s197">She was a nurse.</span> <span id="s198">And she give him some medication and make us not cry and the maid was very good to us.</span> <span id="s199">And my mother went to my uncle and from my uncle they took a car and they went to this bakery.</span> <span id="s200">And on the way, as they was driving on this...I don't know if they went by druska we call this with two horses and a wagon, you know, like a rickshaw, another rickshaw met them but like back and forth and there was my father with partner and with my cousin and my...my father's partner said, "I think I see Frymet.”</span> <span id="s201">Frymet was my mother's name.</span> <span id="s202">So they stopped the rickshaws and my father when he...they arrived with my...with Leshno, they...they really don't have money, so they went right away to this Flynn to this...uh...man.</span> <span id="s203">And my mother went to him, not knowing, so actually they meet on the...met on the street.</span> <span id="s204">What a coincidence.</span> <span id="s205">So this was a happiest day for us.</span> <span id="s206">My brother's very sick and here I have my father back and my mother.</span> <span id="s207">Instead we're supposed to go to my father, they came back to us because in Russia they give us...they get them a few days to make their mind or they want to stay with them and they go to Sibiria or other places in Russia or they're going back.</span> <span id="s208">So it was not only for my father but all the people was like a mixup.</span> <span id="s209">Nobody wants to know...nobody knowed where they're going.</span> <span id="s210">This was my recollection as a little girl what I remembered.</span> <span id="s211">And...uh...my father came back and he was more calmly, wasn't afraid anymore, and he went in back to the mill and they started to do business again.</span> <span id="s212">And this...uh...German Pole from the bakery gave him money.</span> <span id="s213">I mean he payed him what little by little, and we had a comfortable life.</span> <span id="s214">I wouldn't say no.</span> <span id="s215">Again I didn't have any worry as a child.</span> <span id="s216">School wasn't any more for us.</span> <span id="s217">So my parents hired...uh... a tutor and 5, 6 children been together and we learned whatever.</span> <span id="s218">Wasn't much, but was enough to...to go along, you know.</span> <span id="s219">And then it started to be very bad and my mother was afraid that my father should go to Warsaw to collect the money for the...so I volunteered and I went with Mr. Leshno once to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s220">I carried the money and one day a German came over, not to me, to Mr. Leshno and he took him away to work.</span> <span id="s221">And I didn't know what to do with me, but I know what where to go.</span> <span id="s222">So I went to my aunt, my mother's...uh...brother.</span> <span id="s223">And I start to cry.</span> <span id="s224">They took him away and... So they said, "It's nothing.</span> <span id="s225">They catch people to work.</span> <span id="s226">He will be soon there.”</span> <span id="s227">And good enough he came in the night.</span> <span id="s228">He finished the work what they told him to do and he came and we came back to Tarczyn.</span> <span id="s229">This was my last time I went.</span> <span id="s230">I didn't want to go anymore.</span> <span id="s231">And we stood in this Tarczyn and life went on til it was very bad.</span> <span id="s232">And my uncle...they start to talk about the ghetto in Warsaw, so my uncle decide that he wants to come to live back in Tarczyn because he was from Tarczyn because he got so rich so he went to live in...in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s233">So in the meantime they make also from Tarczyn...uh...a ghetto...that all the Jews have to be in one side.</span> <span id="s234">Uh...Everybody in the town liked my father because by him it was no different.</span> <span id="s235">Jew, Christian.</span> <span id="s236">He didn't eat alone.</span> <span id="s237">He ate if everybody had food.</span> <span id="s238">He didn't sit down to the table to the seder.</span> <span id="s239">That was...you asked me what I remember.</span> <span id="s240">I just remember we were 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock still by the table, sleeping children because he run to the houses to see if this people had food.</span> <span id="s241">If not he carried from our home for them.</span> <span id="s242">As a little girl I remember many times before a holiday I was very like children in school.</span> <span id="s243">My father makes like a nut in a handkerchief.</span> <span id="s244">There probably was money, no doubt about it, and go here and here.</span> <span id="s245">Don't say from who.</span> <span id="s246">Just give it.</span> <span id="s247">So a Christian person who was...uh...couldn't say he's a friend, a person from the town came to my father and he says, "Mr. Karmaski, Too bad they're a making a ghetto, the son of a bitches.”</span> <span id="s248">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s249">"But can we change with apartments.</span> <span id="s250">I know you have a clean house and I have small children and I would like to change with you because he was living in the side what the German give us.</span> <span id="s251">And we changed with him.</span> <span id="s252">So my uncle, with his family...he had two sons and a wife and a maid...so they came to live with us.</span> <span id="s253">And it was also, as a child it was happy for me.</span> <span id="s254">It was harmless you know, a lot of children and we had our curfew.</span> <span id="s255">We couldn't go out like in the evening, but it was nice.</span> <span id="s256">We were...we lived nicely in this Tarczyn til they decide that it's not good.</span> <span id="s257">Everybody has to go to Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s258">Our small town had 350 families.</span> <span id="s259">So being in ghetto in Tarczyn a lot of people got...the poor got poorer, and the rich ones survived.</span> <span id="s260">They ate, but the money didn't come in so it was very very bad.</span> <span id="s261">(Sigh) So we packed our possessions, what we could.</span> <span id="s262">I, as the older daughter, I was sent to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s263">(Clearing Throat) Excuse me.</span> <span id="s264">I was sent to Warsaw, also on a Wagen, with mine friend, that's mean my father's partner.</span> <span id="s265">They still were partners, and we went to my uncle so my uncle went back too his apartment in Warsaw and being a few days with my uncle, he...uh ...uh... rent a room for us by a family.</span> <span id="s266">This was Carmaliska 15.</span> <span id="s267">So I stood there with our maid and with my two brothers and my mother and my father came the last day when they had to go out from Tarczyn.</span> <span id="s268">So we lived in ghetto already.</span> <span id="s269">And from the whole Poland, from everybody from each each town, everybody came into...to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s270">And Warsaw was already a ghetto.</span> <span id="s271">Was a small ghetto and a big ghetto.</span> <span id="s272">Carmaliska 15 belonged to the big ghetto.</span> <span id="s273">Uh...My father received every couple weeks, couple weeks I couldn't say, once a month, once in 2 months, and from time to time we knew from which time to...from the mill a salary.</span> <span id="s274">The good thing was because we had a partner also, beside Mr. Leshno.</span> <span id="s275">A Christian.</span> <span id="s276">He was in the government, in the Polish government, a big shot.</span> <span id="s277">A president, but not a president like you have...uh...President Bush or something, but he was something.</span> <span id="s278">I really can't explain it what that he was a big shot.</span> <span id="s279">When the war came out in 1939, he called my father and he said, "Listen, Karmaski, I am going to leave you.</span> <span id="s280">I am going to America with my wife.</span> <span id="s281">His name was President...President Shelpelski.</span> <span id="s282">And he left.</span> <span id="s283">After the war, when I came to America I met his wife.</span> <span id="s284">She was living in Long Island.</span> <span id="s285">And she said to me, "Please, Mrs. Karmaski...(she didn't know my married name)..."I want you to tell my neighbors from where I am coming and who I was in Poland because I don't know if they believe me.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">She...her husband died, and she was living very poor.</span> <span id="s287">Matter of fact, I bought her Chanel 5, and she hugged me and it was very happy.</span> <span id="s288">When we went to the ghetto, this President...this President Shelpelski left a daughter, a married daughter from the 5th marriage.</span> <span id="s289">This was the second of his...in Poland.</span> <span id="s290">Her husband was a major.</span> <span id="s291">The daughter's husband was a major in the Polish army, and she was by herself in the mill.</span> <span id="s292">Of course, she had workers and she...and a boy friend.</span> <span id="s293">The boy friend was a terrible anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s294">She was afraid for him, for Bollick that she's helping us.</span> <span id="s295">But Richard, the engineer, was a very nice guy.</span> <span id="s296">I met him many times and he gave me money when I was hiding.</span> <span id="s297">And I thank to the mill with his wife because nobody from from the Poles would take us in without money and without promises that after the war, they will be big shots or rich.</span> <span id="s298">(Sigh) Anyway...so that was our support from them.</span> <span id="s299">Coming back to the Warsaw ghetto, as we received money from them we saw it's getting tighter and tighter and tighter.</span> <span id="s300">Of course, I couldn't say that I felt anything, but as a child I wasn't going to say that I wanted to knew much secrets from the...from the growing up because they always shhhh shhhhh not to tell the children.</span> <span id="s301">But from day after day you pick up some words.</span> <span id="s302">Right?</span> <span id="s303">Uh...My father decided...he was afraid to go to court.</span> <span id="s304">It was a court on Leshno which was divided in half.</span> <span id="s305">Half was standing in the Christian side and half in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s306">The woman who brought us in the money came to court.</span> <span id="s307">My father had a piece of paper.</span> <span id="s308">It wasn't really....he ordered himself that he has a court this and this day.</span> <span id="s309">The German didn't know what it is when he willed in through the revealing doors.</span> <span id="s310">He went in.</span> <span id="s311">He met this woman, and she gave him the money.</span> <span id="s312">She got paid for it.</span> <span id="s313">She took right away up her percentage.</span> <span id="s314">And then my father shared with my...with his partner.</span> <span id="s315">So we had a few dollars to live.</span> <span id="s316">There weren't too hungry.</span> <span id="s317">We weren't too well off, but we were okay.</span> <span id="s318">One day my...my uncle came to us and he said it's not good.</span> <span id="s319">I heard this rumors and this rumors.</span> <span id="s320">You have a few dollars.</span> <span id="s321">I have a few dollars.</span> <span id="s322">Let's do something.</span> <span id="s323">So from the Rabbi what my father was believing so much, he had acquainting man.</span> <span id="s324">This man before the war he wasn't a farmer but he had cows in Warsaw, and for the sake of the cows he selled the mill and he lived.</span> <span id="s325">So this man talked in my father to buy cows, and they could buy them and they transport them...Polish people transport them to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s326">So my father and my father's partner and my uncle and another few Jews shared it.</span> <span id="s327">It was very expensive.</span> <span id="s328">And they had like a dozen cows.</span> <span id="s329">Analefski Street.</span> <span id="s330">It was a like from a big store made...uh...a place for the cows and they hired a couple, the man and the wife what they milked, you know... Is this word they call?</span> <span id="s331">milked...uh...cows.</span> <span id="s332">And the 5th you had to give the donations for the poor, and for the opens, the milk and then the rest you could sell.</span> <span id="s333">So from this we lived.</span> <span id="s334">My father woke up 5 o'clock.</span> <span id="s335">The minute he could work, you know, free to...it's safe to go, so he went to this...to see how many liters or quarts what we call here...the milk, the cows were giving and all the families lived.</span> <span id="s336">Not to make money, but we lived.</span> <span id="s337">Okay.</span> <span id="s338">And then I..</span> <span id="s339">.</span> <span id="s340">my mother said that father is very tired and maybe he shouldn't go and we children we should go because the minute when you walked out from the door to the street it was unbelievable to see.</span> <span id="s341">Young people and old people like flies, deaths, deaths, deaths.</span> <span id="s342">Fallen people, hunger people, on the street.</span> <span id="s343">So my father didn't go but us children we went.</span> <span id="s344">Me and my brothers and from the partner the son went and whatever was left we were carrying the milk in special cans, you know, to the apartment and from the apartment we had our places what we bought milk.</span> <span id="s345">We got paid from people say they pay another time the 20 cents or the 50 cents what it was container of milk.</span> <span id="s346">I lived there went there.</span> <span id="s347">And I think we lived I wouldn't a happy life, but we lived.</span> <span id="s348">Uh...We had...mine mother had a sister living in Sobolif near Lublin and another sister who lived in Warsaw also in ghetto got very poor.</span> <span id="s349">She didn't have any money.</span> <span id="s350">So they decide to shift her to this other aunt to Sobolif so she went with her sons there.</span> <span id="s351">And we stood in ...in Warsaw ghetto and many times people came with regards from their were very religious town so we could get from time to time a kosher meat, what they smuggled in from...not from this town, from Sobolif or from Otvorz (ph), and they came to the ghetto and they had their clients or sometimes we had meat also which was a holiday at this time.</span> <span id="s352">And this was til 1942.</span> <span id="s353">1942 my cousin came, my father's sister's daughter from a small town.</span> <span id="s354">I don't know the town.</span> <span id="s355">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s356">(clearing throat) That...uh...her brother-in-law and other relatives were kidnapped.</span> <span id="s357">She called this kidnapped.</span> <span id="s358">And she escaped.</span> <span id="s359">She doesn't how and she still doesn't know how she came to Warsaw ghetto, and we should have known that they killing Jews.</span> <span id="s360">And in the same time they said that the Jews will live til July 22.</span> <span id="s361">And it start to be like, you know, not easy.</span> <span id="s362">Not easy!</span> <span id="s363">And then it started that every Jew should work.</span> <span id="s364">I never worked.</span> <span id="s365">I was a child.</span> <span id="s366">So my father had a lot of connections.</span> <span id="s367">He came home and he said, "I think I managed something.”</span> <span id="s368">And what my father did started it.</span> <span id="s369">So they brought...they bribed somebody that I went into work.</span> <span id="s370">My work was by the Germans...it's called a shop.</span> <span id="s371">This was Tebin's shop.</span> <span id="s372">There was slavery, and they worked for the Germans, for the army, of course.</span> <span id="s373">Tailors and hat makers, a shop.</span> <span id="s374">A big shop.</span> <span id="s375">For me it was like, I never saw this.</span> <span id="s376">My work was...uh...sitting by a table and it was in a bags a lot of hats and the elastic in front by the heads were sewed down from the tailors, but there and there was a string, you know, so I had to clean up the thread and cut with the scissor.</span> <span id="s377">I had a scissor.</span> <span id="s378">It's not big work.</span> <span id="s379">It was...only if they would let us work because every minute a German came in and hit us or took us out.</span> <span id="s380">Some he took out never came back.</span> <span id="s381">Some they took out they raped.</span> <span id="s382">So we were always afraid.</span> <span id="s383">I..</span> <span id="s384">.</span> <span id="s385">my mother worked also in the same building.</span> <span id="s386">I worked on the fifth floor.</span> <span id="s387">She worked on the second floor.</span> <span id="s388">She stamped leather pieces.</span> <span id="s389">Little pieces what they...to suitcases or what you're wearing on the back the shoulder, you know.</span> <span id="s390">What you call this?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Shoulder patch.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: So this kind of... My bro...my father also worked by the same thing and the brother too.</span> <span id="s393">I had by the time already two brothers, not three because one was selected.</span> <span id="s394">It was...they came and they took him out.</span> <span id="s395">They took out everybody.</span> <span id="s396">And they took him.</span> <span id="s397">He was hiding in one of the hiding place in the apartment.</span> <span id="s398">They took him out to the Umschlag.</span> <span id="s399">Uh...As they were working one day they start to give us Kenncards.</span> <span id="s400">This was like a piece of paper which opens and said that you allowed to live...in German not in Polish.</span> <span id="s401">Everything was in German.</span> <span id="s402">I didn't know what the line is for it.</span> <span id="s403">They took us out to make a line so, of course, I stood in the line.</span> <span id="s404">So I was scared.</span> <span id="s405">I received a card like this.</span> <span id="s406">I didn't know what it is.</span> <span id="s407">And many people...the one who didn't receive, they told go in the right or in the left.</span> <span id="s408">Actually in the left.</span> <span id="s409">I was to the right.</span> <span id="s410">You know, as I am talking, I could... And after they said, "Let us go back to work.”</span> <span id="s411">And we saw it's missing a lot of people from these for...but we didn't know for what.</span> <span id="s412">We didn't know if they're going to live or we going to live.</span> <span id="s413">But we were the lucky one.</span> <span id="s414">The same day my father received a card like this.</span> <span id="s415">My mother wasn't working this day because they make the come in the nighttime for work.</span> <span id="s416">It was a 24-hour work.</span> <span id="s417">So my father received a card like this and I received a card.</span> <span id="s418">But then we knew it already what it is.</span> <span id="s419">That it's very important.</span> <span id="s420">Okay?</span> <span id="s421">So we the lucky one.</span> <span id="s422">And the same time they maked me...not to come during the day but to come...that's how they mixed up people...to come in the night to work.</span> <span id="s423">So I went like 4:30, 5:00.</span> <span id="s424">Most...I wanted to go earlier because you were more safe in the place where you walk because during the day you don't see anybody in the street and this...the apartments were looted.</span> <span id="s425">But the time I wasn't living anymore Karmiliska 15, but we were told into Novolitki (ph) 42.</span> <span id="s426">This was also a friend of my father's who went to live with his daughter and he give us up his apartment.</span> <span id="s427">So we lived there and my father's partner too.</span> <span id="s428">It was like four families living in one big apartment.</span> <span id="s429">We couldn't...we didn't have many beds.</span> <span id="s430">I was sleeping with my mother.</span> <span id="s431">My brothers were sleeping on the floor.</span> <span id="s432">I think my father also on the couch or something.</span> <span id="s433">It doesn't matter, but it wasn't already what it was.</span> <span id="s434">And we still had the maid.</span> <span id="s435">I mean she was like in the family.</span> <span id="s436">It was no more maid, but like a family.</span> <span id="s437">And then one day they came and they took her away with my cousin.</span> <span id="s438">And we went to work and by work they said that we're going to live...I mean people just gossip...til July 22.</span> <span id="s439">And was even a song about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: Do you remember it?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: The song...if I remember it.</span> <span id="s442">Was something from my long home I could get out some more, but very little.</span> <span id="s443">Very little.</span> <span id="s444">As I say til this point, til I went to work, I..</span> <span id="s445">.</span> <span id="s446">I..</span> <span id="s447">.</span> <span id="s448">childish...you know, I didn't give too much thought about it.</span> <span id="s449">I'm young and I didn't think about it.</span> <span id="s450">I didn't realize that there could be such a terrible thing done to people.</span> <span id="s451">Uh...So finally it came, this day.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">That's when we...that we heard...it was all over the whole ghetto.</span> <span id="s453">Papers pasted out that all the Jews had to come to one spot and this was this spot.</span> <span id="s454">It was three shops in the whole ghetto.</span> <span id="s455">One shop...(clearing throat)...one shop was Tebins, the biggest one.</span> <span id="s456">The other one was...uh...I just remembered.</span> <span id="s457">Fo Broczes (ph) I don't...I just remembered it.</span> <span id="s458">Schultz.</span> <span id="s459">Schultz was working the same work what we.</span> <span id="s460">So the...the...the rumors were that Schultz and Tebins were going to go together.</span> <span id="s461">And the Broczes (ph) which was in the small ghetto, they only work by Broczes (ph).</span> <span id="s462">They will remain.</span> <span id="s463">But it...it was just rumors, you know.</span> <span id="s464">(Sigh) So we were living....this was already a good life.</span> <span id="s465">Hungry, working, and no future.</span> <span id="s466">Uh...But when these signs on the streets were that everybody has to come in one place, my mother didn't have a card.</span> <span id="s467">So I took out this card and I said, "Mommy, this is your card and you go with daddy and you take both children"...because my brother is very small.</span> <span id="s468">My age I was 14 I guess.</span> <span id="s469">I was already big.</span> <span id="s470">I was very tall and thin.</span> <span id="s471">They wouldn't let me through anyway.</span> <span id="s472">I don't consider any more a child.</span> <span id="s473">So you go with this brothers.</span> <span id="s474">And we were sure we're going to work.</span> <span id="s475">And I said to my mother, "You write Mommy.</span> <span id="s476">You will write me.”</span> <span id="s477">And hardly my mother accept this Kenncard, but she did accept.</span> <span id="s478">Until the middle of 18 we still could work together in the lines.</span> <span id="s479">Was six people in the line, end of it, and the line it was really not to prescribe...not to describe how long it was.</span> <span id="s480">It was a terrible way down.</span> <span id="s481">The heat was maybe a 150.</span> <span id="s482">Nobody had a drink.</span> <span id="s483">The on the back, the shoulder bags...everybody had a bag.</span> <span id="s484">I had a few slices of bread and I think an onion in it and my clothes and like a girl, you know, a pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s485">I also...when my house was looted in...uh...Karmiska 15, I went back with the maid so I find my mother's beautiful pair of snake shoes and I always liked them so I took the shoes and I took them to mine so I was holding the shoes too.</span> <span id="s486">As we was marching I saw in the line my aunt and my uncle.</span> <span id="s487">That's the rich one.</span> <span id="s488">And her two sons.</span> <span id="s489">And another aunt, my mother's sister.</span> <span id="s490">And we couldn't talk, but we waved.</span> <span id="s491">With our eyes we make like "God knows where we're going.”</span> <span id="s492">but still going.</span> <span id="s493">We know we going to the Umschlagplatz because this was Miller 18, and around the streets there.</span> <span id="s494">I was also...on the sixth I was with my friend, Henry Leshno, my cousin and his brother and another two girls.</span> <span id="s495">I didn't know them.</span> <span id="s496">I know them only from the shop.</span> <span id="s497">And this girl was probably mine age, but she had her mother and her father.</span> <span id="s498">And I was really jealous because all three had cards and I didn't had a card.</span> <span id="s499">I think this was my first time when I start to be jealous of anybody.</span> <span id="s500">And thank God this girl survived and her parents survived.</span> <span id="s501">Not the war, but to come back.</span> <span id="s502">And we were in the line.</span> <span id="s503">Because I didn't had a card, and my uncle and my aunt didn't had a card, so we went to the...with them, and I separate from my mother in case...and no words to talk, but crying and crying and write and don't worry.</span> <span id="s504">Ma, your health you know, and you will survive and we'll survive this.</span> <span id="s505">As a child, you know, I could feel I didn't have too much words to...to comfort her, and she and my father went different place because they had the cards.</span> <span id="s506">My mother was struggling with me.</span> <span id="s507">She wants me to get a card, but I was very much against it.</span> <span id="s508">I felt young and strong.</span> <span id="s509">And they went away.</span> <span id="s510">As we came to Moranofska (ph), with us all and we stood and I said to this Henry...he was like a brother to me...I said, "Henry, we don't know where we are.</span> <span id="s511">We here with the aunt with this, but why can't we still go to be with my mother...with our parents.”</span> <span id="s512">He had a second mother, but very good woman and like I start...I was...I'm a little older.</span> <span id="s513">He's alive.</span> <span id="s514">We're very good friends.</span> <span id="s515">And I start to agitate him, "Let's go.</span> <span id="s516">Let's go.”</span> <span id="s517">And we went.</span> <span id="s518">Me...and I make his brother also to come, and the three of us start to look for my parents.</span> <span id="s519">And as we're looking on the Miligas we knew a lot of people and they said, "Oh, you're father is looking for you.”</span> <span id="s520">In the same time my father start looking for us because they saw it's...it's not true.</span> <span id="s521">Everybody could still still be together.</span> <span id="s522">Was a terrible hot day.</span> <span id="s523">Humid.</span> <span id="s524">Hot.</span> <span id="s525">Without a little water.</span> <span id="s526">Finally, we find my father.</span> <span id="s527">My father said, "Thank God, we find you.”</span> <span id="s528">And we came to Miller 22.</span> <span id="s529">There is the place where my mother sat on the floor by the house and about an hour or so even my uncle come with his wife because we saw we're not separate.</span> <span id="s530">We could be all together and we find a lot of people.</span> <span id="s531">But this time my father...not only my father, but everybody...was starting to look to buy this Kenncardes .</span> <span id="s532">So, of course, my father was starting to look for me for one.</span> <span id="s533">Couldn't get!</span> <span id="s534">But my mother said, They don't let parents with children through.</span> <span id="s535">Just the opposite.</span> <span id="s536">Let me give back to Cywia the card.</span> <span id="s537">And you go with Cywia and I stay behind with my family, with the brothers, with the sisters.</span> <span id="s538">She still had her brother.</span> <span id="s539">And with her friends.</span> <span id="s540">And if it's possible you come with us or send for us.</span> <span id="s541">People went out...uh...with on the wagons as dead people, shoveled in...in the casket you know and went out so we thought maybe this way.</span> <span id="s542">A lot of people had bunkers in the houses and they went in.</span> <span id="s543">They didn't give us too much time, as by 5 o'clock they already...the Germans come with the "Halt.</span> <span id="s544">Halt.</span> <span id="s545">Halt.</span> <span id="s546">Halt.</span> <span id="s547">Halt...and the machine guns went boom, boom, boom a whole day.</span> <span id="s548">(Big Sigh) And they start to organize the line, who's going to go left, who's going to go right.</span> <span id="s549">You never knew what the left line is or the right line is.</span> <span id="s550">Okay?</span> <span id="s551">So here it goes so quick.</span> <span id="s552">My father start to say goodbye and in the middle he fainted by saying goodbye to my mother.</span> <span id="s553">And I stay with the Kin card in the hand and I don't know what to do, and what to say.</span> <span id="s554">My mother's hand with me I should put down this...uh...how do you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: Knapsack.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: Knapsack.</span> <span id="s557">Right.</span> <span id="s558">Knapsack.</span> <span id="s559">You want to know that she give me her knapsack, not mine, hers, with all her dresses.</span> <span id="s560">There were a few pieces of bread and an onion inside.</span> <span id="s561">An onion, everybody had an onion because they said an onion is good for you.</span> <span id="s562">And she took mine.</span> <span id="s563">As my father was fainting, my aunt catched a piece of paper.</span> <span id="s564">Water...was no water, and start to, you know, revive him, and I said to my mother, "Go hide in this place.”</span> <span id="s565">And she kissed me and it's no more words.</span> <span id="s566">What can words say?</span> <span id="s567">And I am walking with my father out and Leshno with his son and the rest of the people who wanted without Kenncard is go...could also stay in the line.</span> <span id="s568">It doesn't matter if you have a Kenncard or not.</span> <span id="s569">Everybody was to make a line and to go.</span> <span id="s570">So this Leshno's brother...I handled him the picture frame.</span> <span id="s571">He was always 6 foot, strong like a ox, was will us in the line.</span> <span id="s572">They took him away this way and us in this way.</span> <span id="s573">We didn't know where we going.</span> <span id="s574">But what I witnessed before was a man before my line, before my face.</span> <span id="s575">He had on a enormous big knapsack.</span> <span id="s576">His name was Wassermann.</span> <span id="s577">He worked with me by Tebins, not cutting...this was the woman's work.</span> <span id="s578">He was sewing the hats.</span> <span id="s579">He was a very wealthy man before the war, but in the war he got poor and then got he he went into work to Tebins and he had a little girl about 3 years old.</span> <span id="s580">He had her every day by work and if the Germans came in, myself and Dr. Bussow...I was working, also cutting.</span> <span id="s581">Dr. Bussow was a nice lady.</span> <span id="s582">Her husband was a physician, children doctor...took this little girl in this box and covered her with the heads she should survive the, you know, the Germans what they came in to watch us work.</span> <span id="s583">He had this little girl in the knapsack.</span> <span id="s584">He gave her some pills to sleep and not to move and they took out this little girl and killed her in my eyes.</span> <span id="s585">I should say in our eyes we saw it.</span> <span id="s586">And they took him also away beating.</span> <span id="s587">So I was happy in my memory that my mother didn't see this and didn't go through because she had small children.</span> <span id="s588">My brothers were small.</span> <span id="s589">So we went this way and they went this way and sure enough...of course, when I passed I showed the card and they let me through.</span> <span id="s590">I was very tall on my age and very thin.</span> <span id="s591">And this Dr. Bossow said to me, "You have two bright eyebrows and the German don't like this.”</span> <span id="s592">So she took me in aside as we were walking, still in the shop, and she plucked out mine eye brows, and I was screaming because it was hurting.</span> <span id="s593">Come out.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">They didn't go out (laugh) the places.</span> <span id="s595">Okay.</span> <span id="s596">So I was fortunate that they took me back.</span> <span id="s597">I didn't mention that as we went to the Umschlag Plaza place, somebody fell in this line, and the German run and right away it's like a pyramid.</span> <span id="s598">One fell, other falls, other falls.</span> <span id="s599">So they shoot in to this pyramid and like before me.</span> <span id="s600">Maybe I would fell too if I didn't see where I am approaching, you know, what I am approaching to go on.</span> <span id="s601">They shoot everybody was the whole pyramid of people, young, old, whoever fell.</span> <span id="s602">So when we went back, everybody was already tired, in tears, and this street looks terrible.</span> <span id="s603">Very bad.</span> <span id="s604">Possessions from people, hanging people from balconies what the Germans shoot them because they want to escape.</span> <span id="s605">(Sigh) We didn't know where we're going.</span> <span id="s606">But they took us to the shop back.</span> <span id="s607">So we were lying a whole night on the floor.</span> <span id="s608">Mostly were men, not many woman.</span> <span id="s609">And I started this girl what I was jealous on her...with her mother and father.</span> <span id="s610">And in my heart I felt I never see my mother again so I really was very jealous.</span> <span id="s611">And there crying the whole night and my heart was breaking seeing for the first time in my life my father's crying, and he felt very uncomfortable like that he left my mother, like I felt this like maybe he exchanged me for her life.</span> <span id="s612">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: We have to stop here.</span> <span id="s614">The tape is about to run out.</span> <span id="s615">We're going to change it.</span> <span id="s616">Okay.</span> <span id="s617">If you'll just hold on a second.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s621">You can go ahead now.</span> <span id="s622">You were saying you that you felt that your father had exchanged you for your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: Yal.</span> <span id="s624">I felt like this, but he really didn't.</span> <span id="s625">He wasn't this person that he lived with the hope that he would still be able to do something because people came back from this...from this miller.</span> <span id="s626">But other hope was that we knewed where she is.</span> <span id="s627">She was not Miller 18, but Miller 22, and she stood, uh...together with my uncle and with my aunt and with friends and with the sisters from Mr. Leshno and his wife and children so...and I was only my father and Leshno with his son.</span> <span id="s628">And the same day my cousin come, my uncle's son.</span> <span id="s629">He went through this with my uncle and with my aunt and the other son, but they took them, the three of them away and he received the Kenncard so he came to the...to the shop so we heard from him some news.</span> <span id="s630">This was...uh...the same day...he came a day later, but the same day he went to the selection.</span> <span id="s631">So we knew they stayed together so our hope was maybe we could so something.</span> <span id="s632">So the night was a terrible grieve...so in a terrible grieve.</span> <span id="s633">My heart was breaking.</span> <span id="s634">How my father was crying, and all these men.</span> <span id="s635">Like I mentioned there was a lot of men, more than woman and I was still considering myself a child there.</span> <span id="s636">And so in the morning we got breakfast.</span> <span id="s637">The breakfast was watered like a soup but like water but off in the line standing for the line for the soup, this day wasn't a working day, but like after a funeral day you know.</span> <span id="s638">So we got the soup standing in the line and my father saw somebody so he went over and he said in the hope so he said to my father, "Give me your picture...give me your wife's picture which I have the picture still.</span> <span id="s639">He wrote it down.</span> <span id="s640">My mother's name and my two brothers name.</span> <span id="s641">He went back and forth.</span> <span id="s642">He was the foreman from Tebins.</span> <span id="s643">Through him I went into work in the beginning.</span> <span id="s644">My father paid but like a bribe, you know, and he took the picture went into the Umschlagplatz in the Miller and he couldn't find my mother.</span> <span id="s645">That was his response.</span> <span id="s646">The money he didn't give back, but he give back the picture, but he couldn't find.</span> <span id="s647">Okay?</span> <span id="s648">So was no hope that they will come.</span> <span id="s649">The day went on and this was already July 23.</span> <span id="s650">July 24 we start to work.</span> <span id="s651">You know the work has to be done.</span> <span id="s652">Uh...I was still by the same work with the Kennkarte.</span> <span id="s653">They make me work at night time and my father worked in the day.</span> <span id="s654">We came to the same apartment on the...it was like .</span> <span id="s655">From excuse me.</span> <span id="s656">From to the .</span></p> <p><span id="s657">And this was our apartment.</span> <span id="s658">There what my father obtained with his friend.</span> <span id="s659">He went to live with his daughter.</span> <span id="s660">I don't think he's alive at the time already, but it was too big apartment so we were there...my father and myself, Leshno and his son, and my cousin and another two people with two children.</span> <span id="s661">He worked for the Germans.</span> <span id="s662">He...uh...he wasn't a shoemaker.</span> <span id="s663">He was sewing the leather of the shoes.</span> <span id="s664">I don't know in English this word what this... Before you make the shoes...a shoe, you know, the leather has to be sewn together so then the shoemaker takes the shoes to make.</span> <span id="s665">Anyway he worked for the Germans, but he didn't have a place where to live so he lived with us because...he moved in by himself.</span> <span id="s666">Apartment was empty so.</span> <span id="s667">So then we agreed that he should have a room and we lived together.</span> <span id="s668">And day and night we went to work.</span> <span id="s669">We came back.</span> <span id="s670">We didn't have any food.</span> <span id="s671">We lived only what they gave us, but my father had a few gold pieces sewn in his shoes or on the suit and I also had before we went like the everybody had some money because we didn't go...maybe we knew it inside, but nobody want to say.</span> <span id="s672">We were sure we're going to work for the Germans, maybe to Germany, maybe by summertime or whatever you know.</span> <span id="s673">So we had a few dollars.</span> <span id="s674">I mean slotas not dollars in case we have to buy something, a piece of bread or to bribe somebody.</span> <span id="s675">The bribe was terrible in Poland at this time between the Jews also.</span> <span id="s676">So as a child I was wearing stockings but I didn't wear a belt, but elastic.</span> <span id="s677">So two eleastic together and in between was money sewn around.</span> <span id="s678">That was mine possession.</span> <span id="s679">So little by little we came over to this because we didn't have anything to live on it.</span> <span id="s680">And that's how we lived til 1943.</span> <span id="s681">The rumors were that the ghetto wouldn't stay too long, that they will finish us.</span> <span id="s682">And in between they opened the Umschlagplatz.</span> <span id="s683">No more transportations.</span> <span id="s684">I mean they liquidated the ghetto little by little.</span> <span id="s685">The same thing and they opened the ghetto and they heard we were free from work, that the ghetto was open, the miller.</span> <span id="s686">We run, myself, my father, everybody, the whole shop run there to look for relatives.</span> <span id="s687">We went straight to Miller 22 because we know we left there my mother.</span> <span id="s688">We came...on the street somebody screamed, "Uncle Mendel.”</span> <span id="s689">My father's name was Mendel.</span> <span id="s690">This was my aunt's little boy, 8...7...8 years old.</span> <span id="s691">He was together with everybody, with my mother, with the brother in the bunker.</span> <span id="s692">So we asked him, "Where is everybody?"</span> <span id="s693">We didn't have to go further.</span> <span id="s694">He gave us all the report.</span> <span id="s695">He told us what happened.</span> <span id="s696">Two woman in the building had a fight.</span> <span id="s697">I don't know all the words.</span> <span id="s698">And the Germans heard because they were snooping around with the dogs.</span> <span id="s699">So they came in and they find the place that there is a bunker and they were hiding there and they start to scream that they're going to put a tear bomb in the ducts.</span> <span id="s700">They should come out so they will be free to work and live.</span> <span id="s701">Otherwise, they will be shot.</span> <span id="s702">So everybody went down.</span> <span id="s703">This little boy didn't go out.</span> <span id="s704">He sit and he survived.</span> <span id="s705">My brother, the youngster, didn't go out, but my mother didn't want to leave, that she should come down.</span> <span id="s706">She wouldn't leave without him.</span> <span id="s707">So the Germans stayed til he came down.</span> <span id="s708">That's the version from this little cousin of mine.</span> <span id="s709">And then when he came down they left and took them all to the train.</span> <span id="s710">This was day before our New Year, exactly September 9, 42.</span> <span id="s711">So we know so much about it.</span> <span id="s712">But everybody said, "Let's go.”</span> <span id="s713">He's a child.</span> <span id="s714">Maybe he doesn't know.</span> <span id="s715">You have to touch it to believe it.</span> <span id="s716">So we came to this house and when they saw me...a few people..."Oh, my God, you're such a pretty child.</span> <span id="s717">Your mother showed us pictures from you.</span> <span id="s718">She was crying all the day.</span> <span id="s719">Poor woman if she wouldn't go out.”</span> <span id="s720">So we knew it already that's...that's the story what the little boy told is true.</span> <span id="s721">As we were there the German were smart, so they start a new selection and they start to catch people from the street because they had all amount that they wanted, card or no card.</span> <span id="s722">So we start to...to hide again.</span> <span id="s723">But luckily, to tell you the truth I don't know how, I..</span> <span id="s724">.</span> <span id="s725">we came...my father, myself and the rest of us back to the shop.</span> <span id="s726">We didn't go back to the apartment.</span> <span id="s727">We were afraid that maybe they will take us away.</span> <span id="s728">We wanted to spend as much as we could in the shop.</span> <span id="s729">It wasn't safe, but better than at home.</span> <span id="s730">You know I worked in the night time.</span> <span id="s731">I..</span> <span id="s732">.</span> <span id="s733">I fell asleep during the day.</span> <span id="s734">I couldn't sit in the shop.</span> <span id="s735">They wouldn't let me in.</span> <span id="s736">So I stood mostly in the apartment.</span> <span id="s737">And this same time my father met an acquaintance and he said, "You know, I am looking for you.</span> <span id="s738">Your son come to me from Miller 22"...he was also from the MIller 22..."and he said, "David, maybe you have a better...better bunker where I could hide with my brother and my mother.</span> <span id="s739">I have the money.</span> <span id="s740">I will give you.”</span> <span id="s741">And he told this my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">And I said, "In my bunker is just the amount of people what we could go in, so I couldn't take him.”</span> <span id="s743">So my father was very abusive that he couldn't...that my brother was saved with mother.</span> <span id="s744">But he said, "Please believe me.</span> <span id="s745">I couldn't do it.”</span> <span id="s746">This man was a very selfish man and a very rich man.</span> <span id="s747">So my father said, "And what you doing now.”</span> <span id="s748">"I have no place where to go.”</span> <span id="s749">So my father said, "It's okay.</span> <span id="s750">Come to my house.”</span> <span id="s751">And he with his wife and child came to live together in our house.</span> <span id="s752">I give even away my bed to his wife because she was a very sick woman.</span> <span id="s753">She didn't look like Jewish at all with a little girl 3 years old.</span> <span id="s754">This woman survived the war thanks to me.</span> <span id="s755">Many days I didn't go to the shop.</span> <span id="s756">I was afraid and my work was in the night.</span> <span id="s757">So I was hiding under my covers and I said, "I don't care if I live or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">What do I have to lose.</span> <span id="s759">My mother is not here.</span> <span id="s760">My father is working.</span> <span id="s761">I can't talk to him.</span> <span id="s762">And I have...I am always hungry.</span> <span id="s763">I don't know how to cook and I have nothing to cook.</span> <span id="s764">So what's the use of living.”</span> <span id="s765">So he said and I was already 16 or 17 years old and this woman was very nice, but she had what to eat and she never shared.</span> <span id="s766">She never would say, "Oh, Cywia take a biscuit or something.”</span> <span id="s767">No.</span> <span id="s768">Mine little cousin when we met him.</span> <span id="s769">He was a child.</span> <span id="s770">He stole from her things to eat and one day I give him an address and I said to him, "You know, you have nothing to lose.</span> <span id="s771">Go over the...the gates.</span> <span id="s772">Go to the Irish, to the Poles and go to my friend.</span> <span id="s773">She will know who you are, and tell her that you're hungry.</span> <span id="s774">Maybe she will give you a place to live.</span> <span id="s775">He went.</span> <span id="s776">He came back.</span> <span id="s777">He came back.</span> <span id="s778">He ate a good meal.</span> <span id="s779">He brought me a bread.</span> <span id="s780">Okay.</span> <span id="s781">So this family...he had a lot of money.</span> <span id="s782">She was hiding two little sacks under my mattress.</span> <span id="s783">She was afraid.</span> <span id="s784">I never looked in into the believe me and I didn't care.</span> <span id="s785">And one day, looking out from the window...was in the day time, I saw that the building was like this that Germans are in the building.</span> <span id="s786">They are looking for people.</span> <span id="s787">So I took the cover over my head.</span> <span id="s788">And I said, "I don't care.</span> <span id="s789">If they come, they will come.”</span> <span id="s790">So she put the little girl under my cover and she sat on the side and all of a sudden boom boom boom on the door, but nobody was open.</span> <span id="s791">It was like dumb.</span> <span id="s792">Pretend there is nobody there.</span> <span id="s793">After a few minutes it was quiet and so they went away.</span> <span id="s794">Okay?</span> <span id="s795">(Sigh) Since this day, I said I am not staying here anymore.</span> <span id="s796">Because it was in my head if they take this little girl and I will see how they kill her...how they will kill me, I don't care.</span> <span id="s797">I wouldn't know it.</span> <span id="s798">But to see before how they kill her, I don't want to see it.</span> <span id="s799">So I went to work.</span> <span id="s800">I mean I didn't work because my work was into the night.</span> <span id="s801">And I stood there as much as I could.</span> <span id="s802">So I stood there.</span> <span id="s803">Okay.</span> <span id="s804">My father find out that...uh...my two cousins are alive and they work by the brocz (ph) shop in the brocz (ph) shop.</span> <span id="s805">I also forgot to mention that in the ghetto when I still had this good life in the ghetto I went from day to day with mine...we were lived together with more people in the apartment.</span> <span id="s806">Uh...So I met .</span> <span id="s807">Maybe you heard about him.</span> <span id="s808">What I went there because cousin's little boys to...uh...were sheltered there.</span> <span id="s809">My father's sister's children.</span> <span id="s810">And I don't know.</span> <span id="s811">It was a holiday or something and it was like a children's theater and my aunt said to me maybe you would come to see.</span> <span id="s812">So I went.</span> <span id="s813">My grandfather was still alive.</span> <span id="s814">He died in ghetto in January 1941...or may it was in 42.</span> <span id="s815">I think 41.</span> <span id="s816">And my father maked a separate burial because there was...in dozens they put.</span> <span id="s817">But he was a very religious man and a decent man so he dug by himself the...the graves.</span> <span id="s818">So I went and I met there a lot of people and I met him too.</span> <span id="s819">(Sigh) So this was the life in ghetto til my father came and he was talking with people and the rumors were that the ghetto wouldn't be too long that Tebins and Schultz are going together.</span> <span id="s820">We have to look to escape the ghetto.</span> <span id="s821">Where to escape nobody knows.</span> <span id="s822">But people did if they were bought...uh...Polish papers that they not more Jews, but Poles.</span> <span id="s823">I couldn't do this because I looked very much as a Jew.</span> <span id="s824">I thought a German wouldn't recognize me if I am tall Jew or a Pole.</span> <span id="s825">But the anti-Semitism in Poland was terrible.</span> <span id="s826">Ninety percent of Poles worked hand in hand with the Jews....with the Germans.</span> <span id="s827">So...but in the other way you didn't have nothing to lose.</span> <span id="s828">So one day this couple came to my father.</span> <span id="s829">They didn't have children.</span> <span id="s830">They were from our town.</span> <span id="s831">They were also in ghetto.</span> <span id="s832">And they said, "We have somebody.</span> <span id="s833">We're going to go to them.</span> <span id="s834">If you want, maybe you could join us.”</span> <span id="s835">They maybe wouldn't confirm this to my father, but they were looking for money in case if the people wouldn't take them without money.</span> <span id="s836">So maybe my father could pay for them too and this way they will go.</span> <span id="s837">So my father said, "In this minute I am not considering so much myself but mine baby, my daughter.”</span> <span id="s838">So he...my father came to me and he said, "What would you say?</span> <span id="s839">Would you like to go with Lea and Abraham to the Irish side.”</span> <span id="s840">I said, "Not by myself.</span> <span id="s841">Only with you.”</span> <span id="s842">It was summer when they took away my mother.</span> <span id="s843">I didn't have any other clothes.</span> <span id="s844">I didn't have winter clothes.</span> <span id="s845">So my father went and bought me a pair of boots and he prepared me and still from ghetto not woman, mostly men, young boys went out to the Polish side.</span> <span id="s846">They called this the Irish side to work.</span> <span id="s847">They could have come in with two potatoes with a half bread, whatever, you know, and that's like the other people could buy and live also.</span> <span id="s848">So one day my father comes and says, "They are leaving soon and I am convinced that you should go.”</span> <span id="s849">So when Leshno heard that I am going, he wanted to send his son too.</span> <span id="s850">And by the time was a person who lived actually in...in the wilderness there in the small town, going from room...from farmer to farmer and they knew him and they give him something to survive.</span> <span id="s851">So he went out with Leshno, with this young boy.</span> <span id="s852">Uh...And my father came and he said, "Now is the time and you're going in 2 days and don't tell anybody where you're going.”</span> <span id="s853">But I couldn't hold a secret.</span> <span id="s854">I said, "If I want to survive, I would like my cousin to survive.”</span> <span id="s855">But this time this little boy wasn't with us.</span> <span id="s856">We send him out.</span> <span id="s857">Go and look you should live.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Because a child, they didn't know he is Jewish.</span> <span id="s859">He was a blond, pretty little boy.</span> <span id="s860">So he wasn't anymore with us.</span> <span id="s861">And everybody was laughing with that...his face like this.</span> <span id="s862">I had long braids, black and really looking like a Jewish girl, but my Polish was perfect.</span> <span id="s863">(Sigh) It's...I mean I had no other opportunity.</span> <span id="s864">My father says, "But I wanted to...leave my secret to my other cousin.</span> <span id="s865">He was a very intelligent boy.</span> <span id="s866">He was older than I was, few years.</span> <span id="s867">And I said, "Listen , anytime you escape the ghetto, come to this and this place, I knew already this place.</span> <span id="s868">My father told me because in 2 days I have to leave.</span> <span id="s869">But don't write it down.</span> <span id="s870">Just knew it.</span> <span id="s871">He was Warsaw born.</span> <span id="s872">He spoke already 5, 6 languages, very intelligent.</span> <span id="s873">Very intelligent boy.</span> <span id="s874">So, fine.</span> <span id="s875">So I had a little guilty on my chest that I let go my secret.</span> <span id="s876">And the German was bribed by somebody who went out for work that I would be on his workmanship today.</span> <span id="s877">So, of course, I been 7 o'clock in the morning in the winter dressed in the boots and a coat.</span> <span id="s878">The coat was mine, and nothing with me.</span> <span id="s879">.</span> <span id="s880">I couldn't hold nothing either one.</span> <span id="s881">But I was wearing like 10 shirts and my mother's dresses here and there.</span> <span id="s882">That's what I had with me.</span> <span id="s883">And I also could have had something because I am going to work so I had some package and I had a .</span> <span id="s884">You know, a .</span> <span id="s885">I didn't know I am not supposed to have this because the German were afraid that you have a bomb or ammunition inside, but I didn't know it.</span> <span id="s886">And from this place I was instructed to come next building and there is a..</span> <span id="s887">.</span> <span id="s888">like a..</span> <span id="s889">.</span> <span id="s890">also a German workshop where the Jews what they go out worked there.</span> <span id="s891">And they were working in leather.</span> <span id="s892">So I came in.</span> <span id="s893">These two...this couple came in before.</span> <span id="s894">They weren't on the same...uh...work out.</span> <span id="s895">This German was bribed.</span> <span id="s896">I don't know how much and what.</span> <span id="s897">But I was separated from this people and I went in to this shop and I supposed to be in hiding and this guy knew it, the foreman that I am coming in.</span> <span id="s898">When the foreman saw me...his father was a friend of my father.</span> <span id="s899">My father had a lot of connections.</span> <span id="s900">And he says to me, "You going in the Irish side.</span> <span id="s901">You fall like a fly.</span> <span id="s902">With a face like this, even if you polish your .</span> <span id="s903">So I said, "Benny, what do I have to lose?"</span> <span id="s904">I said to him.</span> <span id="s905">He didn't survive.</span> <span id="s906">I survived.</span> <span id="s907">Why.</span> <span id="s908">I am asking this question always myself.</span> <span id="s909">And my best.</span> <span id="s910">I ask, "Why, God, was I the fortunate?"</span> <span id="s911">And til late afternoon we stood there.</span> <span id="s912">I supposed to follow this couple because I don't know where we're going in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s913">From there we supposed to be transport again.</span> <span id="s914">This was Warsaw.</span> <span id="s915">This was .</span> <span id="s916">I knew very well Warsaw, but since they separated small ghetto, a big ghetto and here you could go and here you can't go so I was really was very mixed up.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">But I followed them.</span> <span id="s918">I followed them and I walked.</span> <span id="s919">We supposed to go .</span> <span id="s920">There is the airport from Poland from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s921">I followed them.</span> <span id="s922">And it was snowing and you didn't see many people.</span> <span id="s923">And I always hold a handkerchief to my nose because my nose was the main trouble because a long nose don't look like Irish.</span> <span id="s924">All of a sudden I heard, "Cywia, Go.</span> <span id="s925">Go.”</span> <span id="s926">I am afraid to look back, but whose calling Cywia?</span> <span id="s927">I am following these two people and I am afraid to lose my eye on them.</span> <span id="s928">My father.</span> <span id="s929">What happened?</span> <span id="s930">What happened that he heard...somebody came to tell him that he...if he wouldn't leave today, he could never leave again.</span> <span id="s931">So he and Leshno bribed also to somebody by the work somebody and they took a taxi on the Polish side and they went off.</span> <span id="s932">They knew Warsaw very well and he follows me.</span> <span id="s933">But til he told me the story was 5, 6 hours later.</span> <span id="s934">But, thank God, I see him.</span> <span id="s935">Right?</span> <span id="s936">He was dressed up like a farmer and he looked...he was very thin and the mustache what he never wore it in specially for this occasion, he let it go.</span> <span id="s937">His Polish wasn't too good.</span> <span id="s938">But he came.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">And as we're walking, this people...this couple, I didn't see them any more.</span> <span id="s940">I didn't know where I'm going, but my father knows, but he went into the wrong door.</span> <span id="s941">He opens the door.</span> <span id="s942">It was night.</span> <span id="s943">And this woman says, "Karmaski, what you doing here?"</span> <span id="s944">And my father got pale and I stay here and, "Who is this?"</span> <span id="s945">He said, "That's my daughter.”</span> <span id="s946">This was from Tarczyn, from mine town, a woman I didn't know her because she was mostly in Warsaw living in the same place.</span> <span id="s947">And when the German came she started work as a prostitute.</span> <span id="s948">And she lived with the Germans.</span> <span id="s949">And I..</span> <span id="s950">.</span> <span id="s951">we didn't know from this.</span> <span id="s952">Later on, we knew it.</span> <span id="s953">When she saw us, she said, "Well, as much as I like to help you, the Germans will be here in a half hour.”</span> <span id="s954">And she start to pull out drawers and pull out big pieces like the table clothes, the covers to cover the windows because we're here.</span> <span id="s955">My father says, "Don't bother.</span> <span id="s956">How is your father?"</span> <span id="s957">"Oh, he's fine.</span> <span id="s958">He lives in the same place.</span> <span id="s959">You probably will see him if you go to Tarczyn.”</span> <span id="s960">And "Where you going?"</span> <span id="s961">So my father says, "I am going to Tarczyn.”</span> <span id="s962">He was afraid that she's going actually next door.</span> <span id="s963">But we went out from her right away and my father begged her not to say anything and, "Oh, of course, not.”</span> <span id="s964">And we went into the right door already.</span> <span id="s965">We came into the right door, but this was nervous and heartbreaking.</span> <span id="s966">This couple were there.</span> <span id="s967">My father's partner, Mr. Leshno, was there already too and they took us right away in the attic and then these people send out...they were poor people.</span> <span id="s968">The daughter which was in her 20s went out and bought food for us.</span> <span id="s969">We didn't have nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s970">And, "Fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">We're supposed to be there.”</span> <span id="s972">This was Saturday night and Sunday overnight.</span> <span id="s973">In the middle of the night, the voice says, "Everything is ready.</span> <span id="s974">Who is going first?"</span> <span id="s975">They supposed to take us.</span> <span id="s976">It was 34 kilometers to Tarczyn.</span> <span id="s977">And we wanted not go to Tarczyn, but to the sides of Tarczyn, to...through the forest to go to the village.</span> <span id="s978">And they don't want him to know it, so they maked up that he will take us, the six of us.</span> <span id="s979">No.</span> <span id="s980">Leshno's son wasn't anymore with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">He left before with this guy.</span> <span id="s982">We were four...five.</span> <span id="s983">Uh...So this lady said, "She and her husband would go separate, and I should go with my father and this Mr. Leshno.”</span> <span id="s984">She looked like an Irish woman and her husband but she didn't want to go with us.</span> <span id="s985">So... but we were supposed to go to the same place.</span> <span id="s986">We met there.</span> <span id="s987">Fine.</span> <span id="s988">So this guy took us, a young son from these people.</span> <span id="s989">They got paid.</span> <span id="s990">How much I don't know.</span> <span id="s991">And with the horses, with the Wagen and we was like sitting like poor people, and they took us.</span> <span id="s992">And we went a few kilometers, somebody jumped out...it was still night, and Jews .</span> <span id="s993">Two Polish men.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">They maked up with these people, you know.</span> <span id="s995">We were sold out.</span> <span id="s996">"Give me your money.</span> <span id="s997">Give me a few jewels, what you have.</span> <span id="s998">Otherwise, we're going to take you to the Germans.”</span> <span id="s999">My father didn't know them.</span> <span id="s1000">The guy didn't know them.</span> <span id="s1001">I for sure not, but he start to shiver, this boy who took us...the son of this.</span> <span id="s1002">Probably he knew what...who it is.</span> <span id="s1003">Maybe the girl's boyfriend or whoever.</span> <span id="s1004">We never find out.</span> <span id="s1005">So they start from our, let's say, 5,000 slotas, but who had the money?</span> <span id="s1006">So between my father and Leshno they gave him a thousand or fifteen hundred slotas, which was a lot of money for us and they let us go.</span> <span id="s1007">So I had no saying in it.</span> <span id="s1008">I was a little girl.</span> <span id="s1009">So only my father and Leshno said, "You can go back.</span> <span id="s1010">We don't need you anymore.”</span> <span id="s1011">We were afraid more people like this will jump out and he could give us out to the German.</span> <span id="s1012">So we start to walk on the sideways (clearing throat again) til... We didn't have any much money, Polish money we didn't have any more.</span> <span id="s1013">So we walked.</span> <span id="s1014">We came to a small...uh...village and Mr. Leshno said to my father, "We're going into Saboski.”</span> <span id="s1015">His name was Saboski, a farmer, who was also dealing with my father, bought, you know, come to the...to the mill, borrowed sometimes money (clearing throat).</span> <span id="s1016">So we came in.</span> <span id="s1017">He right away like he said a prayer.</span> <span id="s1018">Who am I seeing and he was afraid, but fine, it's Sunday night so the children are out, dancing or anyplace else, but he just put a poor man into the barn so he tell him to go out.</span> <span id="s1019">He will give him a few slotas so he will go and look for another place and we'll...he will let us in just to rest in peace for a couple of hours.</span> <span id="s1020">In the meantime my father sold him a piece of gold, you know, a coin and he sold...Mr. Leshno coin so he has Polish money to buy something.</span> <span id="s1021">And we had a good meal.</span> <span id="s1022">Milk and bread, and they were talking a little bit.</span> <span id="s1023">But to hold us, he wasn't.</span> <span id="s1024">He didn't need us.</span> <span id="s1025">He was rich, a rich farmer.</span> <span id="s1026">He didn't want us.</span> <span id="s1027">Where we going?</span> <span id="s1028">We had a place but he is still the destination.</span> <span id="s1029">So we went into the forest.</span> <span id="s1030">We still had to make like 20 something kilometers and we went in the daylight.</span> <span id="s1031">We didn't want to walk because you could always see somebody so we stood mostly in the forest.</span> <span id="s1032">About 5 o'clock in the morning we went into a farmer.</span> <span id="s1033">We didn't where we're going in, but me and Mr. Leshno...my father couldn't go and Mr. Leshno spoke a little better this Polish and he knew more in this town.</span> <span id="s1034">.</span> <span id="s1035">not town, village.</span> <span id="s1036">.</span> <span id="s1037">people.</span> <span id="s1038">My father didn't know so many there.</span> <span id="s1039">So we went in and there wasn't there a guy, the owner from the farm, but a worker.</span> <span id="s1040">And he said, "Out, you Jews, you go.</span> <span id="s1041">What you doing here?</span> <span id="s1042">You're going to shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Out from here.”</span> <span id="s1044">So Mr. Leshno says to him, "Can I speak with the owner?"</span> <span id="s1045">"No, he's still sleeping.</span> <span id="s1046">His wife is sleeping.</span> <span id="s1047">Out from here.</span> <span id="s1048">If not, the Germans are going to be here any minute.”</span> <span id="s1049">So we were afraid.</span> <span id="s1050">So we start to walk again til we came like 5, 6 kilometers from the place where we want to go in, but we cannot go in the daytime and we have to wait for the night.</span> <span id="s1051">So we staying in this forest and my father says, "I know this forest very well, and I know the manager from the forest and you stay here with Leshno and I go by myself.”</span> <span id="s1052">So I didn't agree.</span> <span id="s1053">I said, "You'll never find us.”</span> <span id="s1054">Yes, he went with Leshno into this manager and he was very much afraid this manager when he saw them, but his conscious didn't let him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Yablonski was his name, and he took them in and he give them food and he wanted to see me and my father was very happy that he wants to go along but he didn't remember where he left me.</span> <span id="s1056">And I was sitting under a tree like this and all of a sudden a little deer comes around me, smells me...smells me and I said, "My God.</span> <span id="s1057">Is this an angel from my mother?"</span> <span id="s1058">I was...you know, it's like a dream.</span> <span id="s1059">And, well, he said, "Wherever you go"...he didn't know where we're going..."Good luck to you.</span> <span id="s1060">I cannot stay with you.”</span> <span id="s1061">And by the nighttime we went to this place.</span> <span id="s1062">We came to this place.</span> <span id="s1063">This woman with the husband were there already.</span> <span id="s1064">We came to a place to a German woman.</span> <span id="s1065">She wasn't...she was born in Poland, that Volksdeutsche, and she has a Polish husband and for the money, she takes us in.</span> <span id="s1066">I actually don't know exactly the money how many she got.</span> <span id="s1067">I know they giving away a lot of gold...uh...but she also will have monthly money.</span> <span id="s1068">When we receive the money from the partner, from the Christian partner, and a lot of lot promises from my father and him.</span> <span id="s1069">Okay?</span> <span id="s1070">So right away, they have food and the bunker is made.</span> <span id="s1071">We going in through the stables to a hole and middle is a pole.</span> <span id="s1072">You cannot sit.</span> <span id="s1073">You have to like this.</span> <span id="s1074">When you lie it just like sardines.</span> <span id="s1075">Uh...We been six people already.</span> <span id="s1076">Two days later my cousin came.</span> <span id="s1077">I was afraid to say that I said to him.</span> <span id="s1078">I didn't tell my father til he came.</span> <span id="s1079">.</span> <span id="s1080">that I told him the place, and we took him in to, so we have seven people already, like sardines.</span> <span id="s1081">And it wasn't bad.</span> <span id="s1082">You survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">And what'a going to be nobody knew.</span> <span id="s1084">But we're in a good place because she was German you know.</span> <span id="s1085">But what we didn't know til the last minute when it happened that her husband belonged to...what you call...organization against the German, but they were against the Jews too.</span> <span id="s1086">What's the difference?</span> <span id="s1087">But he wasn't okay.</span> <span id="s1088">Then they were pressing him that he should...uh...to be German to take care her nationality, and he didn't want it.</span> <span id="s1089">So we're staying there and a cousin of mine, second cousin came to stay next building.</span> <span id="s1090">This was in the village, you know, like...uh...farmer's house.</span> <span id="s1091">She came to stay also by our farmer.</span> <span id="s1092">They took her in because they know the family and my father and Leshno went in the night time so both the farmers know from each other.</span> <span id="s1093">So they went.</span> <span id="s1094">Sometimes she maked a better meal so she gave something to eat, you know.</span> <span id="s1095">And it was good this way.</span> <span id="s1096">We stood there for a nice couple of months til this couple said they're going to another place.</span> <span id="s1097">They afraid to be together with us because we are too many.</span> <span id="s1098">So they went to another place.</span> <span id="s1099">We knew it...the place.</span> <span id="s1100">And the sent the brother of his brother came to live with us...to live in this (laughter) beautiful surroundings.</span> <span id="s1101">In the evening a lot of times this...they came that we could come in...in the house.</span> <span id="s1102">So we came in.</span> <span id="s1103">We had the water what she cooked for us with two potatoes and that's how we lived.</span> <span id="s1104">It was like in this time before the holidays.</span> <span id="s1105">And my father had a letter from a..</span> <span id="s1106">.</span> <span id="s1107">from an estate.</span> <span id="s1108">This called like a big farmer a that he owes my father this and this money because my father bought from him were when he supposed...from the fields he brought already the...the...the corn already from him.</span> <span id="s1109">The choice is by God all will be alot or will be small, but he make a deal with him...let's say it will be a 100 or maybe 200, so I pay you for 170 or I pay you for 150.</span> <span id="s1110">And this was the bill and my father paid in advance.</span> <span id="s1111">So these from this estate had paid everything and we...this was a paper, and I was carrying this paper with me to go with this German woman...he should give us some flour so she could make bread for herself, for us, and also because my father was religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">We all been.</span> <span id="s1113">We didn't want to eat bread for Passover.</span> <span id="s1114">So she agreed that she will, with our help, will help make Matzahs for us.</span> <span id="s1115">I went with her to this...uh...man til he took me in.</span> <span id="s1116">He sat with me.</span> <span id="s1117">He saw the paper.</span> <span id="s1118">He said I should come another day.</span> <span id="s1119">And I said, "Frankly, I wouldn't like to come another day because I am taking my life in my hands like this.</span> <span id="s1120">This is some kilometers to go.”</span> <span id="s1121">And in this same talking I want him to kow that I didn't come along, that I come with a Christian woman.</span> <span id="s1122">I was fraid to say German woman because he could kill me and, you know, this way he has witnesses that somebody is dead, that I was told my father... told me what to say.</span> <span id="s1123">And I told him everything.</span> <span id="s1124">He didn't give me nothing this time.</span> <span id="s1125">So we appealed to the people in Tarczyn...to the mill people, and they give us flour.</span> <span id="s1126">50 pounds.</span> <span id="s1127">And 2 nights before the Passover, I, my father.</span> <span id="s1128">this cousin from the other guy, she came in to us and he told us and we stood and she maked the oven.</span> <span id="s1129">She had a oven in her house and we make the matzahs for Passover.</span> <span id="s1130">We didn't have many because they liked them better than us, this German with her children and her husband, but we didn't need anything else and we begged her...to my father didn't take any part in it.</span> <span id="s1131">When she boils the potatoes, just right potatoes, no fat, no Schmalz, you know, because sometimes they put pork, little bit, and also from beets (ph) she should have make Wurst for us, so that what this.</span> <span id="s1132">And in the night time another few Jews came from other places.</span> <span id="s1133">They know we're here.</span> <span id="s1134">And in the bunker everybody was crying.</span> <span id="s1135">We didn't have a seder, and my father make the seder.</span> <span id="s1136">Milk and water was our wine.</span> <span id="s1137">Not much, but everybody could get a drop.</span> <span id="s1138">And this Mr. Pavlock was his name, this German's husband...he was on top to see if nobody is around because it was a little higher the emotions than actually it should have been.</span> <span id="s1139">Everybody was crying and praying to God for a miracle, but we had a seder.</span> <span id="s1140">And everybody went home with a piece of matzah to celebrate the second night too.</span> <span id="s1141">And from then on, my name was Ceshick (ph).</span> <span id="s1142">Not Cywia, but Ceshick (ph).</span> <span id="s1143">Okay?</span> <span id="s1144">Everybody went back home.</span> <span id="s1145">And it was peaceful.</span> <span id="s1146">From sometimes in the day, she said I should come into the house.</span> <span id="s1147">It's quiet.</span> <span id="s1148">I should watch the baby.</span> <span id="s1149">She's going out in the fields.</span> <span id="s1150">One day she was still home and I was called in.</span> <span id="s1151">She says to me...this German, "I left the little dog outside, so if you know he's barking you should run in the oven.”</span> <span id="s1152">So I heard barking this little dog and I said...I was peeling potatoes and watching the baby also.</span> <span id="s1153">I was glad to be home, not to sit there.</span> <span id="s1154">(Sigh) I said...all of a sudden she heard voices.</span> <span id="s1155">Right?</span> <span id="s1156">So she ran out, and I ran in the oven.</span> <span id="s1157">And this little dog saved my life.</span> <span id="s1158">The Germans came in and they asked about her husband, and they start to speak to her German and I heard every word...two soldiers .</span> <span id="s1159">And they asked for her husband.</span> <span id="s1160">If she was very much tortured that her husband should take the nationality...the German nationality.</span> <span id="s1161">Okay?</span> <span id="s1162">So thank God, they left and I was saved.</span> <span id="s1163">From then on I was afraid to come.</span> <span id="s1164">I was always there.</span> <span id="s1165">One day it was really something.</span> <span id="s1166">I had to use the bathrooms.</span> <span id="s1167">I had probably a loose stomach.</span> <span id="s1168">I went in top and I didn't know that somebody inside from the bunker, the brother from this guy went upstairs already.</span> <span id="s1169">So I went.</span> <span id="s1170">It wasn't a toilet or anything.</span> <span id="s1171">I released myself, and I want to go out...down.</span> <span id="s1172">I see the doors are open and two men came with a woman in.</span> <span id="s1173">Uh huh.</span> <span id="s1174">is here.</span> <span id="s1175">A Jewish girl is here.</span> <span id="s1176">So they spotted him to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">So I said...it was a hole here and I came to hide here.</span> <span id="s1178">You understand?</span> <span id="s1179">Not that we're hiding here.</span> <span id="s1180">And please don't kill me.</span> <span id="s1181">Let me run away.</span> <span id="s1182">So he said, "Hush.</span> <span id="s1183">Hush.”</span> <span id="s1184">So I and this guy start to run.</span> <span id="s1185">We run.</span> <span id="s1186">We didn't want to say what, you know... But we had also learned that whenever we going out to this place, you have to cover it back with straw, with all the dirt, which I did which was good.</span> <span id="s1187">And they were looking for this man, for Pavlack.</span> <span id="s1188">Uh...We were running, we both of us, and we came to a place, a farmer.</span> <span id="s1189">He knewed everybody.</span> <span id="s1190">So we said that we very hungry, she should let us in.</span> <span id="s1191">A very old woman from a fry pan she must have ready for a dog...potatoes, you know, from who...whoever left them and she pulled red borscht on it and she put milk on it and water... like for a dog probably, and she brought us this for us.</span> <span id="s1192">It was in heaven.</span> <span id="s1193">We both start to eat.</span> <span id="s1194">I don't even remember if it was a spoon (laughter) and we stood there til in the night time.</span> <span id="s1195">In the night time we went back to the place which was, Thank God, that we survived the day.</span> <span id="s1196">A few days later the men came in and he said during the day...it was on a Monday...and the man said, "I am sorry, but you must leave.</span> <span id="s1197">I heard in town that I have Jews.</span> <span id="s1198">And any day they could come.</span> <span id="s1199">So I don't want any...you know, anything to happen to you.</span> <span id="s1200">So please leave.</span> <span id="s1201">And when it's quiet you could come back.”</span> <span id="s1202">This guy was sick.</span> <span id="s1203">He was a nice man.</span> <span id="s1204">What was the problem?</span> <span id="s1205">She got drunk, and she said in the...in the town there in the village...Sunday, Saturday, "You will see how rich I will get when the war is end.”</span> <span id="s1206">Nobody knew it but when the war is end she will be a German because she will get rich...or she have Jews.</span> <span id="s1207">They speculate.</span> <span id="s1208">They didn't know it.</span> <span id="s1209">So we have to run away.</span> <span id="s1210">So my father says, Where to go?</span> <span id="s1211">We have nobody.”</span> <span id="s1212">So this is like 11, 12 o'clock in the bright day in winter.</span> <span id="s1213">Go to the forest.</span> <span id="s1214">Mr. Leshno and his son, right way they go to this...they were a little relatives very distant with this couple, so they're going to this couple.</span> <span id="s1215">So my father said, "Who cares.</span> <span id="s1216">I am going too.”</span> <span id="s1217">We go, but we can't go together.</span> <span id="s1218">So they went separate in us.</span> <span id="s1219">As we going through the forest...everything through the forest, and we left everything here what we possessed.</span> <span id="s1220">I had my mother's dresses which sometimes my father took in the night time a dress and went out to another farm and sold the dress or bought a bottle of milk for it or this, but she took control of everything, this German woman.</span> <span id="s1221">I also had beads, under beads.</span> <span id="s1222">My father had this...he bought this for my mother as a souvenir, a gift, and since I took mine mother's knapsack...everything...</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: Knapsack.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: Knapsack.</span> <span id="s1225">So I had this there too.</span> <span id="s1226">So she took this too...this German woman until she returned after the war to me.</span> <span id="s1227">Not all of them, but a few and I still have them and cherish them very much.</span> <span id="s1228">So we came to this forest, me and my father, and my father was very much afraid that somebody finds me I should be raped.</span> <span id="s1229">I didn't know nothing about life.</span> <span id="s1230">It wasn't time to.</span> <span id="s1231">.</span> <span id="s1232">to tell me, you know.</span> <span id="s1233">And all of a sudden he sees this man.</span> <span id="s1234">He says, "I know you.”</span> <span id="s1235">A christian person.</span> <span id="s1236">You...this and this name.</span> <span id="s1237">At the moment I don't remember, but I did remember his name.</span> <span id="s1238">Maybe you could take my daughter in.</span> <span id="s1239">She's a young girl.</span> <span id="s1240">I will stay in the forest, but take my daughter in.</span> <span id="s1241">He said, "Karmaska, I would take you too, but they workers working by me.</span> <span id="s1242">They making oil, black oil from .</span> <span id="s1243">I don't know this word.</span> <span id="s1244">I never saw it.</span> <span id="s1245">It's like...uh...a flower, you know, by the Poles.</span> <span id="s1246">So I really can't take you, but I advise you should stay away from here because this day the German confiscate pork, cows, anything what's alive and dead, they confiscate...confiscate from the farmers.</span> <span id="s1247">So, Thank God, we're together again, me and my father, because he saw that he's not a dangerous man so we got together again.</span> <span id="s1248">And I said, "Dad, maybe we'll stay in the forest til the night and we go.”</span> <span id="s1249">He said, "No, if the Germans come they could come to the forest too.”</span> <span id="s1250">So we went to these people.</span> <span id="s1251">There was a lady with two beautiful daughters, not too rich, and she was really holding this couple to survive.</span> <span id="s1252">And these two people came also Leshno with her son and here we are also.</span> <span id="s1253">We weren't too happy at all.</span> <span id="s1254">My father was very famous in the town.</span> <span id="s1255">She liked to speak to him and everything but she doesn't want to hold so many people, and it's not healthy also.</span> <span id="s1256">So we stood a little bit and then was very late and she said, "Not right away in the ice"...to this couple or maybe just this couple said...didn't say anything...we speculate only.</span> <span id="s1257">"We will go.</span> <span id="s1258">If God give us our life"...I mean I didn't say anything because I still was looking up to my father.</span> <span id="s1259">To me he was God.</span> <span id="s1260">And we survived so much, and everything what he said it came out the right way so what can I say?</span> <span id="s1261">(Sigh) So we went out with this that we're going back to this place.</span> <span id="s1262">.</span> <span id="s1263">we have no...to this German woman, first to have the possession there.</span> <span id="s1264">Second, we'll stay there.</span> <span id="s1265">So...but we were hungry.</span> <span id="s1266">So I went into a store in the...by the forest.</span> <span id="s1267">I knew the person.</span> <span id="s1268">He built in Tarczyn in mine house...in our house, an oven from tiles, you know, so I asked my father, "Shall I say who I am?"</span> <span id="s1269">And he said, "If he recognize you, fine.</span> <span id="s1270">But don't say anything?"</span> <span id="s1271">My father was standing on the outside.</span> <span id="s1272">So I went in and I asked, "Could you please sell me a bread, a half kilo of bread.</span> <span id="s1273">I'm very hungry.”</span> <span id="s1274">He said, "I know who you are and would I have bread I would sell you.</span> <span id="s1275">But it's too late and I don't have it.</span> <span id="s1276">Maybe when you come another time.”</span> <span id="s1277">Okay.</span> <span id="s1278">So I went out and I said this to my father and we had to make like another 3, 4 miles...kilometers to this place where we been.</span> <span id="s1279">So here we come in, it was like...I would say 7, 8 o'clock in the night, but it was dark, very dark already by the forest still, and this German woman...this where we lived standing and washing already my mother's nice things.</span> <span id="s1280">I said, "Why're you doing this?"</span> <span id="s1281">And also the shirts from my father and from Mr. Leshno...what ever we had.</span> <span id="s1282">She grabbed every...cleaned up the bunker and she's washing.</span> <span id="s1283">"Oh, when it gets dry, you will get it back.”</span> <span id="s1284">We never get it back.</span> <span id="s1285">We had nothing anymore, and I start to ask for shoes from my mother's what I had.</span> <span id="s1286">I had...from...in the knapsack and for the beads.</span> <span id="s1287">"Oh, what do you need it.</span> <span id="s1288">What do you need it.”</span> <span id="s1289">Okay.</span> <span id="s1290">"Can we stay.”</span> <span id="s1291">She said, "I prefer this place should be a little clean at least for a few days.”</span> <span id="s1292">She was right.</span> <span id="s1293">But tonight you have to stay.</span> <span id="s1294">Otherwise ... where would you go?</span> <span id="s1295">So I went in back with my father to this bunker and we stayed there.</span> <span id="s1296">And the same night Leshno came with his son, so we back four people there.</span> <span id="s1297">My cousin went away, and we didn't see him for a couple of days and he didn't know what the changes were here.</span> <span id="s1298">(Sigh) So we stood, but they weren't happy with us, and we knew any day something will happen.</span> <span id="s1299">(Sigh) So we knew from one place where it's hiding a man, a acquaintance Mr. Leshno.</span> <span id="s1300">He lost the whole family, but to take out a girl, for a wife, you know, to live with her and she has really the looks from a Christian with a brother.</span> <span id="s1301">So we decide...they decide we going to them.</span> <span id="s1302">But this is so far away.</span> <span id="s1303">Like this is in the east and this is in the west.</span> <span id="s1304">So the night is big.</span> <span id="s1305">So we start to walk.</span> <span id="s1306">And we came there, and they agreed to hold us.</span> <span id="s1307">It was no parents there.</span> <span id="s1308">Just a young boy, maybe 18, 19 years and small children.</span> <span id="s1309">A sister was maybe 16, little boy 10 but he walks like he was 25, this little boy.</span> <span id="s1310">I just drink something.</span> <span id="s1311">If I could or not, but I can't talk.</span> <span id="s1312">So they agreed to hold us.</span> <span id="s1313">So this couple, this man went in another place...but the same farmer boy, he went to live in an attic from the house, and we took over his bunker, but for the day time he came to stay with us because with us was more people.</span> <span id="s1314">They played cards.</span> <span id="s1315">They talked.</span> <span id="s1316">So we stayed together.</span> <span id="s1317">(Sigh) How long...maybe 2 months, 3 months probably.</span> <span id="s1318">Anyway we heard the news from around what happened.</span> <span id="s1319">One nice day we heard that the place by these German people... the Gestapo came they couldn't live without Jews, so they took in a family with two children and the Gestapo killed her husband, not with a shot, but like with a butt, not because he holds Jews.</span> <span id="s1320">Because he was against to take the citizens as a German.</span> <span id="s1321">They would have killed her too but she was pregnant at the time.</span> <span id="s1322">So they let her live and as they were looking...I don't know, maybe for Jews, they find the two Jews...the family.</span> <span id="s1323">The little boy escaped.</span> <span id="s1324">Two little boys were...the kids escaped.</span> <span id="s1325">The parents were killed.</span> <span id="s1326">That's...I knew them.</span> <span id="s1327">They were also from mine town.</span> <span id="s1328">It was a sister from this couple what I went out together from the ghetto, from the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s1329">And the time we heard also that the liquidate the ghetto and that was the time when my cousin came and we had...we saw in the morning even the men brought us in burned pieces of paper from the ghetto when the ghetto was burning, like from seders or from Torahs.</span> <span id="s1330">Who knows what it was.</span> <span id="s1331">Probably just books.</span> <span id="s1332">You know.</span> <span id="s1333">The wind brought it back, and the smell was also... Okay.</span> <span id="s1334">So we were living there.</span> <span id="s1335">(Sigh) Nothing comfort.</span> <span id="s1336">Hungry.</span> <span id="s1337">But the best we could do, we're doing only to survive.</span> <span id="s1338">One night...</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: I think we better stop.</span> <span id="s1340">They're going to change the tape.</span> <span id="s1341">End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1344">You can go ahead now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1346">We stayed with this family in Pomyonka.</span> <span id="s1347">That's how they call this place.</span> <span id="s1348">And there was no father, just a boy, a sister and...uh...two or three more children, and we were staying in this bunker one beautiful night...mustly we are people on the night, not on the day, so they brought us in the night.</span> <span id="s1349">The first we could speak clearly.</span> <span id="s1350">As we were sleeping, Poles came...young boys.</span> <span id="s1351">Matter of fact, I recognized one who borrowed my homework from school, and he said, "Give me your money.</span> <span id="s1352">You rich people.</span> <span id="s1353">Give me your gold.</span> <span id="s1354">GIve me everything.”</span> <span id="s1355">I said, " , you took books from me.</span> <span id="s1356">How was it you never wanted to make copy from me, and you're going to take my books.”</span> <span id="s1357">He slapped me and he pulled my boots off.</span> <span id="s1358">Okay?</span> <span id="s1359">He took away from my father this picture, all the pictures.</span> <span id="s1360">A night or two before I had a dream from my mother and she said, "My dear child, if you want to save your pictures, maybe you could make a little...uh...bag on your neck and this way you will save the pictures.”</span> <span id="s1361">And I mentioned this to my cousin, and she said, "Why not?</span> <span id="s1362">I help you, and let's make it.”</span> <span id="s1363">We didn't have any material so she took off her bra and in the bra was a double lining so she took the lining and make for me a..</span> <span id="s1364">.</span> <span id="s1365">a little bag, and I put in all these pictures, and the pictures thanks to this you have it now.</span> <span id="s1366">And the pictures survived.</span> <span id="s1367">My father had a lot of pictures from his family from his father, from his mother.</span> <span id="s1368">He was an orphan when he was 9, 10 years old, so he had...still had pictures from his mother who died when she was 29 years old.</span> <span id="s1369">And they all take the pictures.</span> <span id="s1370">Don't ask me why...what they need the pictures, but they took it.</span> <span id="s1371">But the sad story was that the Poles didn't come along.</span> <span id="s1372">They come with a Jewish boy.</span> <span id="s1373">The Jewish boy was from our town.</span> <span id="s1374">His name was .</span> <span id="s1375">And we saw him.</span> <span id="s1376">He looked like a Pole, and maybe he saved his life by giving out us to them.</span> <span id="s1377">Money...they...we didn't have money.</span> <span id="s1378">If we had it, we had only in, you know, what we had hid in hiding, sewn in the garment what we had.</span> <span id="s1379">And they took us to the room, together with this people, already with this couple, this man and this girl who took out from the attic, and they put us in a line and when my father...uh...saw this and they took away already his pictures, he run.</span> <span id="s1380">He has...he had only his slacks and a jacket, and he had his pyjama under and he run.</span> <span id="s1381">And from Leshno from my father's partner, they took the boots also.</span> <span id="s1382">In the boots was a gold piece, so he was barefoot.</span> <span id="s1383">And they took my boots so I start to ask and beg in the room, "Please give...take everything, but I know you.</span> <span id="s1384">We grow up together.</span> <span id="s1385">I went with your sister to school.</span> <span id="s1386">Why you taking my boots?</span> <span id="s1387">We're fighting for our life.</span> <span id="s1388">Please.”</span> <span id="s1389">And I was crying.</span> <span id="s1390">So one give me a slap in the face, and I fell to the ground.</span> <span id="s1391">After the war, I took care of him.</span> <span id="s1392">That's the whole family came to Lodz to me to beg to me he should be released from prison.</span> <span id="s1393">Through Russian soldiers and through a Pole I got to him.</span> <span id="s1394">What's with him, I don't know, but the story was told.</span> <span id="s1395">Not from me but from this Pole who was a friend.</span> <span id="s1396">He was a Senator before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Anyway we ran out.</span> <span id="s1398">Then they left.</span> <span id="s1399">When they left, the guy didn't want to hold us.</span> <span id="s1400">It's no use to hold us.</span> <span id="s1401">RIght?</span> <span id="s1402">So...and it was raining.</span> <span id="s1403">It was early morning, like 6 o'clock, 7 o'clock.</span> <span id="s1404">So I cannot walk in the...in the forest because it was after the...how you call this?</span> <span id="s1405">When they take from...up the...the... I forgotten?</span> <span id="s1406">When the farmers take off from the...from the ... I need this word.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">Q: Plowing or the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">A: Plowing...no they didn't take up the plowing.</span> <span id="s1409">The harvest!</span> <span id="s1410">You know when I get nervous I (laughter) I lose the... the harvest.</span> <span id="s1411">It was the harvest...after the harvest, so you know the straw what they took off it went...it goes in your legs.</span> <span id="s1412">I couldn't walk.</span> <span id="s1413">But still they had the straw staying to get dry so me and my cousin went into...to like on the straw like you saw in a picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">Q: Haystack.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">A: The haystack.</span> <span id="s1416">So we went in but we couldn't get in to.</span> <span id="s1417">.</span> <span id="s1418">and here we have a whole day to get through with this.</span> <span id="s1419">And my cousin also went into one, but he was by himself and he start to talk to us, what we doing next and where are we going?</span> <span id="s1420">It start to rain and it was windy, and all of a sudden one minute it fall apart, the straw and we staying like this.</span> <span id="s1421">No people surrounding.</span> <span id="s1422">Nobody was there.</span> <span id="s1423">So we decide we had nothing to lose.</span> <span id="s1424">We start to walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Where are we going?</span> <span id="s1426">We're going to a forest.</span> <span id="s1427">But we had this maked up with my father.</span> <span id="s1428">Only thing what happened we meet but this Senator, .</span> <span id="s1429">He was a friend of ours.</span> <span id="s1430">My father had hidden this stuff what he always sold for us...a dress, a garment, something...a piece of furniture, we should be able to live.</span> <span id="s1431">So by him is the best part to live.</span> <span id="s1432">His brother was the one who brought into the Warsaw ghetto sometimes money and she was the one from the mill what she got the pension and brought for us also.</span> <span id="s1433">Very confident people.</span> <span id="s1434">He was the one who brought to trial this guy who took my boots.</span> <span id="s1435">Okay.</span> <span id="s1436">So we supposed to meet by him, which in the night time we met there.</span> <span id="s1437">We came to him.</span> <span id="s1438">He said, "You go out here and here.</span> <span id="s1439">You'll find your father.”</span> <span id="s1440">So my father had already boots.</span> <span id="s1441">Through the day, Lesh...my father had the boots, but Leshno had boots and had something to eat, so my father said, "We have no place, but let's go and look for somebody also from the town.</span> <span id="s1442">He mentioned once that he could have a place for us.”</span> <span id="s1443">This was already the night.</span> <span id="s1444">So we went and we...we got this man.</span> <span id="s1445">It was like oasis, with little trees, like a forest, and all of us went in there and my father said, "We will probably go to this place.”</span> <span id="s1446">But he went, this guy went.</span> <span id="s1447">He said he's a relative...I don't know exactly to my father....to this and this guy to ask him if he wants to make money so we could be by him.</span> <span id="s1448">So during the day we went in this oasis.</span> <span id="s1449">We had nothing to eat, just what we'd brought up, but at least we were been all together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">Leshno's son ran away so he went to another place, to another village where also there were Jews, and I and my cousin and my father and Leshno and the cousin...the lady was in this oasis and this guy went to ask this guy.</span> <span id="s1451">He came back with good news, that they want to take us, and set the amount of money and the gained the promises after...after...after.</span> <span id="s1452">We went into this place.</span> <span id="s1453">There was two very old people, and...uh...a bachelor's son and a younger son and a widower, a son-in-law.</span> <span id="s1454">But the son-in-law was better than all of them.</span> <span id="s1455">His wife died and he remained in the village, and he was working for the German by...uh...milk, but the...the farmers brought him milk there and he make ...uh...uh...sour cream and he shoveled this to the German.</span> <span id="s1456">So a few dollars, for a few slotas he sometimes brought us a bottle of milk which it wasn't already milk, but was sour, but it was good for us.</span> <span id="s1457">Okay.</span> <span id="s1458">So we were living on this and we were very comfortable.</span> <span id="s1459">At night time they let us in inside and we had not a meal, but fine.</span> <span id="s1460">So we took our cousin also, the very intelligent boy and there he got very sick, my cousin.</span> <span id="s1461">And he was afraid to go to the doctor, and he start...because he knew so much, he start to cure himself, and he died there.</span> <span id="s1462">And now like will have his and after the war we want to take his body out but the town didn't allowed us.</span> <span id="s1463">My father did a very much, a lot a lot, but we were afraid to start it, so he remains still his bones there, in his field.</span> <span id="s1464">We stood there and this old lady went occasionally to town and she brought bread and she baked bread.</span> <span id="s1465">And we give them...my father give them money, and they live a little...a life a little more comfortable because they were very, very poor.</span> <span id="s1466">And we had a nice place by them.</span> <span id="s1467">And also the same pattern...to go in, I have pictures here how we went into this bunker, how many people we were there and nobody knew it.</span> <span id="s1468">And this guy also stood with us.</span> <span id="s1469">We even like paid for him too.</span> <span id="s1470">And one beautiful day...uh...they came to the town, and they said that the German come to the town and they going to occupy you, you, you...I mean the farmers' places, and we had to go.</span> <span id="s1471">We had to leave.</span> <span id="s1472">We had to leave.</span> <span id="s1473">This was winter, and it was very, very cold.</span> <span id="s1474">A storm in Poland and we are not dressed.</span> <span id="s1475">I don't still have boots.</span> <span id="s1476">I don't have nothing what to wear.</span> <span id="s1477">(Sigh) So what do I have to lose.</span> <span id="s1478">I went to town.</span> <span id="s1479">And I knocked on the door for my neighbor.</span> <span id="s1480">Her husband worked us...worked in our mill and I said... she has no children.</span> <span id="s1481">He used to like me very much because he said I said I was used to sing.</span> <span id="s1482">When I went to school late and I said, "I don't have boots.”</span> <span id="s1483">I put down the latest hiding and they like 2, 3 sizes smaller and I came and please...here...when you get the money from from the mill, please buy me a pair of boots and a coat.”</span> <span id="s1484">So she went down, and she bought me shoes, and she bought me...high shoes, not boots, but high shoes, and she bought me a coat, and she gave me a good meal to eat, and I maked up with the woman what she took me to town and she went shopping to me and I survived.</span> <span id="s1485">I came to...to the hiding place back with a few dollars, with bread.</span> <span id="s1486">That's how I got the shoes for me.</span> <span id="s1487">And we were there.</span> <span id="s1488">Okay.</span> <span id="s1489">And she always borrowed my shoes...the lady, the old lady.</span> <span id="s1490">It was three sizes big.</span> <span id="s1491">One day she said she wouldn't give me back but I didn't need it, I don't walk anymore.</span> <span id="s1492">But when I..</span> <span id="s1493">.</span> <span id="s1494">when we suppose to leave, she didn't give me my shoes.</span> <span id="s1495">She give me her shoes.</span> <span id="s1496">And they still were too small.</span> <span id="s1497">Where do we go?</span> <span id="s1498">We have no place where to go.</span> <span id="s1499">So we know from this place where the Jews are, by this old lady.</span> <span id="s1500">We go to her.</span> <span id="s1501">So we came there.</span> <span id="s1502">And the Jews they were hiding there, didn't let us in.</span> <span id="s1503">They said they want to live.</span> <span id="s1504">Too many Jews cannot be here.</span> <span id="s1505">It's very dangerous.</span> <span id="s1506">But me and my cousin are young girls, they would take in.</span> <span id="s1507">My father and Leshno they don't want to take in.</span> <span id="s1508">Okay.</span> <span id="s1509">But the woman wanted to take in my father.</span> <span id="s1510">She didn't care.</span> <span id="s1511">This is the picture what I showed you and which I brought.</span> <span id="s1512">So I said, "If not my father, I don't want to go either.”</span> <span id="s1513">So I, my father, Leshno, my cousin, and Leshno's son went back to this place, to the oasis, to the forest, in the middle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">This was a Sunday.</span> <span id="s1515">And we sitting, lying like this, not sitting, but from the from the forest.</span> <span id="s1516">All of a sudden we hear from the town...from the village, boys are playing cards , you know, and we are like mouses.</span> <span id="s1517">Quiet.</span> <span id="s1518">All of a sudden, bang, bang, bang.</span> <span id="s1519">We heard a shooting.</span> <span id="s1520">I saw the Germans.</span> <span id="s1521">I saw the police, the Polish police.</span> <span id="s1522">I picked my head up and the worse part what it was, they had white cheese, like farmer cheese, apiece and a boy who I know it, had a whole farmer cheese.</span> <span id="s1523">He was so happy.</span> <span id="s1524">He went out.</span> <span id="s1525">He was killed.</span> <span id="s1526">So I said because we have farmer cheese, we're going to be killed.</span> <span id="s1527">So my father said, "Don't pick up your head.</span> <span id="s1528">Just lay down.”</span> <span id="s1529">So I was lying after him.</span> <span id="s1530">I don't know what make me do, but I picked up my head and I saw the bayonet...the... the...the...from the German and from the Polish...uh... policeman.</span> <span id="s1531">They were looking...and for the...I can't remember exactly how the Polish organization .</span> <span id="s1532">They were looking for this organization because they were an organization also against the German, but also against the Jews.</span> <span id="s1533">Okay.</span> <span id="s1534">So this shooting what we heard...we been 7, 8 people.</span> <span id="s1535">The players were also .</span> <span id="s1536">They were shot from this Polish police and from the German.</span> <span id="s1537">We survived thanks to them because they shot them they head them off of us.</span> <span id="s1538">But we saw them.</span> <span id="s1539">My father, I mean, the rest of the people, everybody saw them.</span> <span id="s1540">They didn't see us, but we could see them.</span> <span id="s1541">Not the faces exactly, but they have bodies.</span> <span id="s1542">Okay.</span> <span id="s1543">So in the night time we said, "We can't stay here.</span> <span id="s1544">We cannot stay here.</span> <span id="s1545">We have to run again.”</span> <span id="s1546">So a delegation went to this woman that she took...has to take us in.</span> <span id="s1547">So she took us in.</span> <span id="s1548">Okay?</span> <span id="s1549">When she took us in, this Jewish people what they were hiding there, went away from her because the whole town know that she has Jews.</span> <span id="s1550">They were so hungry that they was eating leaves from...from like , you know, spinach, from the...from the farm.</span> <span id="s1551">They didn't have nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s1552">And they give us some money, some promises.</span> <span id="s1553">We lived on promises, which we...we...thank God we remained.</span> <span id="s1554">The world was good.</span> <span id="s1555">They all had paid for it.</span> <span id="s1556">And this woman took us out...took us in.</span> <span id="s1557">Was very, very cold already, and was a storm, and it was near like to the liberation already.</span> <span id="s1558">So in the night time in the storm, we didn't had meat and my father and...uh...Leshno went, but we have to go in for the towns they maked holes so we had to go like two.</span> <span id="s1559">.</span> <span id="s1560">two flopped down and then to come out.</span> <span id="s1561">Otherwise, there was no way to get through to this...uh.</span> <span id="s1562">.</span> <span id="s1563">village.</span> <span id="s1564">So we went in.</span> <span id="s1565">Fine.</span> <span id="s1566">But we couldn't get up.</span> <span id="s1567">So my father with a cane...he was thin and very, you know, so he went up and then he start to slip me up.</span> <span id="s1568">So I lost this bread what I had with me.</span> <span id="s1569">I just had in my pocket...from the coat pocket...uh...I think I had...uh... something...I don't know what I had.</span> <span id="s1570">It doesn't matter.</span> <span id="s1571">I had something, a biscuit maybe.</span> <span id="s1572">And...uh...he started to take Leshno up.</span> <span id="s1573">He wasn't heavy, but he was 6 foot, maybe more even.</span> <span id="s1574">Very hardly, he was begging, "I want to die here.</span> <span id="s1575">Please, you go.</span> <span id="s1576">You live.</span> <span id="s1577">Go.</span> <span id="s1578">Go.</span> <span id="s1579">Go.”</span> <span id="s1580">My father says, "No.</span> <span id="s1581">You take it.</span> <span id="s1582">You fell one time.</span> <span id="s1583">You fell two times because there's the water, and there's the snow inside.</span> <span id="s1584">We came up.</span> <span id="s1585">But now how do you go?</span> <span id="s1586">If you go into snow, you make a lot of steps so the steps will lead to her.</span> <span id="s1587">Right?</span> <span id="s1588">So we went.</span> <span id="s1589">Anyway we came there, and there we staying.</span> <span id="s1590">Staying there was a hard life there too.</span> <span id="s1591">Til these the other Jews left.</span> <span id="s1592">They had a hard time with them.</span> <span id="s1593">Why?</span> <span id="s1594">Because it was too many of us in one place.</span> <span id="s1595">She couldn't cook.</span> <span id="s1596">She didn't had where to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">She had a pot with a hole because it was dripping out if she put water in.</span> <span id="s1598">They were very poor.</span> <span id="s1599">Primitive.</span> <span id="s1600">Very primitive.</span> <span id="s1601">(Sigh) So one beautiful day, we heard screaming.</span> <span id="s1602">The police there.</span> <span id="s1603">"Hey, Lady, where do you have the Jews?"</span> <span id="s1604">She said, "What Jews?"</span> <span id="s1605">So one policeman...I knew him.</span> <span id="s1606">.</span> <span id="s1607">I had...I recognized the voice.</span> <span id="s1608">He was by father plenty in the good days.</span> <span id="s1609">Malechewski (ph) was his name.</span> <span id="s1610">With his son I went to school too.</span> <span id="s1611">Was a small town.</span> <span id="s1612">Everybody want know each other.</span> <span id="s1613">Tarcyzn was very small.</span> <span id="s1614">So he slapped the girl.</span> <span id="s1615">She was 10 years old.</span> <span id="s1616">"You.</span> <span id="s1617">Tell me where the Jews are.”</span> <span id="s1618">She said, "We don't have Jews.”</span> <span id="s1619">So the little boy who was 8 years old heard that she denies, so he denied too.</span> <span id="s1620">They took away our stuff, a few pieces of silver, you know, what this woman had taken from us.</span> <span id="s1621">My father or Leshno give it to her, but this shouldn't be in first place this place because she hasn't got a pot or nothing to eat, and here she has silver cup what you make Kiddush on it you know.</span> <span id="s1622">And we had them to sell...to get some money or bread for it.</span> <span id="s1623">Okay.</span> <span id="s1624">When they left, these Jews left us too and we're by her hiding and hiding.</span> <span id="s1625">Then her daughter came.</span> <span id="s1626">A married daughter.</span> <span id="s1627">Her husband was a terrible anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s1628">And they discovered us.</span> <span id="s1629">Money.</span> <span id="s1630">Good words.</span> <span id="s1631">We talked.</span> <span id="s1632">We had nothing to lose.</span> <span id="s1633">Where do you go?</span> <span id="s1634">And we know it's soon it's going to be over because the American planes were on our heads.</span> <span id="s1635">We saw it already in the night time when we went out from bunker we could see.</span> <span id="s1636">We prayed for this moment.</span> <span id="s1637">Right?</span> <span id="s1638">So we stood there.</span> <span id="s1639">No other returning.</span> <span id="s1640">And one night people came.</span> <span id="s1641">We were in bunker.</span> <span id="s1642">By her it was more in home because it was a cellar, and they were talking Russian and this was the partisans and they took the older boy away, and this week was a terrific day because the boy came from church.</span> <span id="s1643">They were very religious people, the Christian people.</span> <span id="s1644">So he went to church and the Priest gave a sermon that he should help people but many times he came home and he said, "Hey, Maw.</span> <span id="s1645">Maybe we should throw out these Jews?"</span> <span id="s1646">The priests said that we shouldn't hold Jews or partisans because they will kills us.</span> <span id="s1647">We had already news that they took two Jewish girls for five pounds of sugar to the Germans and they escaped.</span> <span id="s1648">And this was my father's cousins.</span> <span id="s1649">I include the pictures here...them.</span> <span id="s1650">They survived the war.</span> <span id="s1651">They are not living anymore.</span> <span id="s1652">They lived in Israel.</span> <span id="s1653">They left a nice family, but they don't live there anymore.</span> <span id="s1654">Natural death.</span> <span id="s1655">And so we were afraid.</span> <span id="s1656">Right?</span> <span id="s1657">So the church didn't work for the Jews.</span> <span id="s1658">That's for real.</span> <span id="s1659">The anti-Semitism was terrible.</span> <span id="s1660">If a neighbor knocked the door, they knew that this neighbor has Jews you couldn't stay another day.</span> <span id="s1661">Even by the people what they took from you the money and they very nice and they wait we should be liberate so they will get rich, even they were anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s1662">Why I don't know.</span> <span id="s1663">I would never know.</span> <span id="s1664">I am not a prejudice person.</span> <span id="s1665">By me everybody's good and all the flowers are the same.</span> <span id="s1666">One is yellow, one is white and red.</span> <span id="s1667">So am I. One...a person's a humanbeing and that's it.</span> <span id="s1668">But the church had a lot to do with anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s1669">So this boy came home and he wasn't in a good mood, and in the night time during the night, this partisans came and they lie down on the floor under the opening from the...how we are afraid, and they talking Russians.</span> <span id="s1670">I don't understand their...now I understand Russian.</span> <span id="s1671">But my father understood.</span> <span id="s1672">So he bent over like this to me and hold my arms like this I shouldn't cough.</span> <span id="s1673">I shouldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s1674">Thank God.</span> <span id="s1675">We were healthy in there.</span> <span id="s1676">And everybody quiet til it got light, so he took him with his horse to some destination.</span> <span id="s1677">I don't know where.</span> <span id="s1678">Three days later he came running...the same boy.</span> <span id="s1679">Jew.</span> <span id="s1680">Jude.</span> <span id="s1681">Get out.</span> <span id="s1682">Your're free.</span> <span id="s1683">So we were like...we didn't want to go out.</span> <span id="s1684">We were like paralyzed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">And this same day we got flour for this woman and she baked bread.</span> <span id="s1686">Each bread was like a table round.</span> <span id="s1687">So my father...he didn't see anything, but he touched the big bread and he's running.</span> <span id="s1688">And here the front is going.</span> <span id="s1689">And this was the...the...great..., you know,the holes...where for the tanks.</span> <span id="s1690">And the stopped the whole army, the Russian army, and he screams in Russian...he's Jewish and he's liberated and he is kissing this cop, this Russian, and the whole army stopped.</span> <span id="s1691">And he's explaining and he catched this boy Ganick.</span> <span id="s1692">His name is Ganick Vitishinski.</span> <span id="s1693">I have pictures include from his mother.</span> <span id="s1694">This is my man.</span> <span id="s1695">By him we survived and I am going to do everything from him, and we are free.</span> <span id="s1696">And he's telling him, so the captain says...major captain...uh...he's telling that his wife and his sons got killed from Germans, so he said, "So's the whole world.</span> <span id="s1697">Everybody's killed a little.</span> <span id="s1698">I mean he meant Jews because he came from Russia through with the front, and he know what is going on.</span> <span id="s1699">Okay?</span> <span id="s1700">So and we were afraid that maybe it's not so.</span> <span id="s1701">Maybe this will be German.</span> <span id="s1702">But we saw the German running...German soldiers running, and got killed also from...from this soldiers...from the Russian.</span> <span id="s1703">And they took the bread and my father came back to.</span> <span id="s1704">.</span> <span id="s1705">to us, and this night we didn't sit anymore in bunker.</span> <span id="s1706">But from another town, , there was also a very rich persons with an estate.</span> <span id="s1707">He also...Leskinski in Polish is the name.</span> <span id="s1708">He came...he heard this Kamalski, my father and Leshno is here so he came to visit.</span> <span id="s1709">And they sat and kissed, but a few days before when my father sent this lady to say that Kamalski is around and occasion I see him, give him something to eat or give him a few dollars, Polish slotas, that's not....</span> <span id="s1710">They were afraid already for communism you know.</span> <span id="s1711">So he sat a whole night and speak to them and in the morning we are liberated.</span> <span id="s1712">So everybody from us, myself, my father and my cousin, Leshno we went to town.</span> <span id="s1713">By this time my cousin, which was my father's second wife, remained in the place by this people what we had to go away because the Germans really came to them.</span> <span id="s1714">They occupied all the stables.</span> <span id="s1715">But she looked a little like...uh...a Polish girl so she stood behind and she didn't want...she didn't care already for life.</span> <span id="s1716">You know, she was very depressed also.</span> <span id="s1717">She was older than me naturally.</span> <span id="s1718">So...uh...we met her too as we went...continue.</span> <span id="s1719">I didn't know.</span> <span id="s1720">I didn't know much that my father and her was a little romance.</span> <span id="s1721">And Leshno also would like to marry her.</span> <span id="s1722">It was like a competition a little.</span> <span id="s1723">But...uh...I think my...she married my father for mostly the promise was to my father.</span> <span id="s1724">She was never married, and she was a true family...she was a far cousin to me.</span> <span id="s1725">Okay.</span> <span id="s1726">So when we were liberated, my father married her.</span> <span id="s1727">And they had a very happy life, and I loved her very much.</span> <span id="s1728">And she gave me a brother and a sister which I adore and I love them.</span> <span id="s1729">My brother was born in Poland and my sister was born Israel and very tight family.</span> <span id="s1730">She died when she was 46 years old.</span> <span id="s1731">Naturally, she had a heart failure...failure so she died.</span> <span id="s1732">Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">And my father died in '77.</span> <span
