<p><span id="s11">Question: Now today, I’m speaking with Juergen Simonson in a town called Ibthorpe in England.</span> <span id="s12">The date is the 28th of March, 1998.</span> <span id="s13">And Mr. Simonson is a minister and I’m going to let him talk about what got him to this country, where he lived, where he was born and I will start now.</span> <span id="s14">Mist -- in this country, you’re called mister, even thought you’re ordained, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Answer: Yes.</span> <span id="s16">That’s correct, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: Would you be kind enough to give your name in there and tell me where you were born and where you lived as a young child and how you got to this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: My name is J-Juergen Simonson.</span> <span id="s19">I come from Germany.</span> <span id="s20">My father was a judge in Germany.</span> <span id="s21">His parents had been Jewish and then converted to the Christian faith in the last century.</span> <span id="s22">But, under Nazi laws we’re regarded as Jews and so was my father, who was married to an Aryan, and so I was considered a mishling -- a 50 percent Jew or Aryan, whichever way you take it.</span> <span id="s23">We were in a small town in east Germany, where my father was working as a judge and then when Hitler came in, in ‘33 -- he was dismissed as judge in 1935 and lived in -- in this small town called Forst, until 1938.</span> <span id="s24">But because life was more difficult for somebody with a Jewish background in a small place, where everybody knew you, they were beginning to look for a move to a bigger place, where they might be more anonymous.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Do you have memories of that period?</span> <span id="s26">A: Oh, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: What are your memories of that period?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: My memories are that I went to this -- to this school in small town as second grade school and my main and most painful memory is that -- well, I noticed that for some time, my school friends distanced themselves from me.</span> <span id="s29">I used to walk with them to school and then there came a time when they said they wouldn’t want to walk with me any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: And you were how old?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: I was then -- 1938 -- 14 years old.</span> <span id="s32">Born in 1924.</span> <span id="s33">And one day, after break, I went back to my classroom and there on the notice board, written with chalk, it said, “The -- the Juda mus game.”</span> <span id="s34">The Jew must be out.</span> <span id="s35">Which of course was awful sh-shock to me.</span> <span id="s36">So -- my class teacher was very embarrassed about it.</span> <span id="s37">I left immediately.</span> <span id="s38">My parents had gone to Dresden -- because my father’s sister lived in Dresden -- to look for somewhere to live, just at that very moment.</span> <span id="s39">And I was being looked after by a niece.</span> <span id="s40">And in the afternoon, I went to the acting headmaster to see what I should do and was told that he was resting, he could not see me.</span> <span id="s41">I mean -- this, sort of -- so typical, this lacking the courage of their convictions, didn’t want to be involved.</span> <span id="s42">So after the weekend, my parents came back, they’d found a flat and within, I think 24 hours, I was on the train to Dresden.</span> <span id="s43">Never looked back again.</span> <span id="s44">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: You felt you’d be safe in Dresden?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: In Dresden, m-more.</span> <span id="s47">And, in fact, my father found a very good school for me, where I was admitted by the headmaster, who knew my background, but was prepared to take me on.</span> <span id="s48">And, until ‘42, I went to that school, had very good school friends and even managed to do my -- take my matric in 1942.</span> <span id="s49">I’ll come back to that in a moment.</span> <span id="s50">I just want to mention that two years ago I was back in East Germany, with a Christian group, we were -- we were visiting some churches right on the Polish border.</span> <span id="s51">And I suddenly realized I was only about 50 miles from Forst, where I was brought up and where I had this [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: How do you spell that name?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: F-o-r-s-t.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Just as it sounds, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s56">And decide to go by train back to Forst.</span> <span id="s57">It was a harrowing experience, because the town had been just on the Polish border, had been overrun by the Russians and really looked like a very neglected eastern town.</span> <span id="s58">It had been quite a thriving factory place, so -- in -- before ‘33, in the early days of Hitler.</span> <span id="s59">And went round the place to identify my school and one or two other places.</span> <span id="s60">Went back to the station, had a few minutes to spare.</span> <span id="s61">Went back, waited at the station for a moment.</span> <span id="s62">Walked down station roat and remembered that one of my school friends used to live there and he -- his father had a agricultural place, shop.</span> <span id="s63">And I was totally amazed that the place was still there, with the same name, Lishgut.</span> <span id="s64">So I walked in, the daughter-in-law was in the shop and said, “Yes, my father-in-law is here, I’ll go call him.”</span> <span id="s65">And he was out in the yard, I went out and said, “Hello, could I speak --”.</span> <span id="s66">He didn’t recognize me after 50 years.</span> <span id="s67">And I mentioned my name.</span> <span id="s68">And he looked at me, took my hand and before he said anything else, said, “I’m so very sorry for what we did to you.</span> <span id="s69">And it’s been always on my mind.”</span> <span id="s70">And we --</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Did you think he meant what he said?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: -- and we embraced each other and I said to -- quote, “That was a long time ago, let’s forget about it.”</span> <span id="s73">And we only had 15 minutes before my train was due, to catch up on 50 years.</span> <span id="s74">And then of course we kept in touch by letter afterwards.</span> <span id="s75">And w -- he said, “I’m so glad that we’ve met again.”</span> <span id="s76">But it was an extraordinary experience.</span> <span id="s77">And he died a week ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Is that right?</span> <span id="s79">Did you keep up with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: So -- yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Yeah, after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: So I was so glad that --</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: That you’d gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: -- I went to Forst --</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: -- and that we met again by pure chance, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Luck, luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s89">And there a sort of reconciliation took place, anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: He probably didn’t know what had happened to you, either.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: No.</span> <span id="s92">No idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: So he must have been so glad to see --</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: No.</span> <span id="s95">Didn’t know that I was in England or anywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s97">Amazing, that’s amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: So then, as I say, I took my matric -- matric in ‘42.</span> <span id="s99">Because of my Jewish background, fortunately I was n-not allowed to be called up to the armed forces.</span> <span id="s100">All my school friends were.</span> <span id="s101">Most of them perished, many on the eastern front.</span> <span id="s102">And quite a few were in Stalingrad.</span> <span id="s103">And in the end, there were only four of them left and we still meet, every other year, in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Really, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: So I had to do some kind of forced labor -- first in armaments factory in Dresden, on the shop floor and then in the offices.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: And where were your parents now, this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Oh, yes now, my father knew that his life was really in danger, but was very difficult to get out.</span> <span id="s108">You had to be sponsored by somebody abroad.</span> <span id="s109">And as it happened, years before, he had met a young, English student, in Forst, who was staying with a family of friends in Forst.</span> <span id="s110">And my father had written to him.</span> <span id="s111">He’d, in the meantime, become a British diplomat and was out in the Far East, but came on leave in ‘38, saw this letter and wrote back to say that yes, he was prepared to sponsor him.</span> <span id="s112">And so in March, ‘39, he left us.</span> <span id="s113">With 10 shillings, that was all he was allowed to take.</span> <span id="s114">And really no -- no job in sight.</span> <span id="s115">I mean, as a judge, he really had no chance to find a job in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: How many siblings did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: I was the only one.</span> <span id="s118">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: You were the only child?</span> <span id="s120">So when you say he left us, he left your mother and you?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: My mother and me, that’s right, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: And, do you remember your reaction?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Well, of course was a terribly sad moment for all three of us, to be separated and not to know what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s124">Now, I think I will first tell you about my father, perhaps, at this point, because in the sequence of events, that comes next.</span> <span id="s125">He came to England, was met by this wonderful man, Dudley Cheek, who has since died, who later became an ambassador, British ambassador.</span> <span id="s126">And stayed first with -- he had some distant relatives in London and then stayed with other people, but of course had no prospect of an opening for a job.</span> <span id="s127">He had become an active Christian towards the end of his time in Germany.</span> <span id="s128">He used to go -- there was an Anglican church in London, in -- in Dresden, which he used to attend.</span> <span id="s129">And there was, in London, an organization called the British German Christian Fellowship, with which Bishop Bell was associated.</span> <span id="s130">He was the --</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: The British German Christian Fellowship?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Of which he, I think, was the chairman.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: And father was introduced to him and there were -- in his typical way, sort of pulled out all of the stops and eventually, in September ‘39, father was given a case at congregational theological college in Cambridge.</span> <span id="s137">Cherchant College in Cambridge.</span> <span id="s138">As a student again.</span> <span id="s139">He’d been a judge and started again from scratch --</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: -- there, as a -- as a student.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: Theological student.</span> <span id="s144">And in the meantime, he had also arranged for us to follow him.</span> <span id="s145">Again, some kind people had offered accommodation and there was even a place for me at a school near Cambridge.</span> <span id="s146">And we wer-were supposed to follow in September ‘39.</span> <span id="s147">September ‘39 of course was too late.</span> <span id="s148">We literally missed the boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: By about a week before that.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: What -- what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: So we went on living in Dresden.</span> <span id="s153">My mother was eventually declared a widow, because my father was no longer regarded as being alive or -- for all intents and purposes.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Did you -- she was not Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: No, she wasn’t, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: So therefore, she would have been allowed privileges.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: But you would not have been allowed them, because you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: Yes, but I was partly protected by my mother.</span> <span id="s160">I’ve just been going through it all again, because I’m now writing quite a few notes about the Holocaust in Germany, because the Holocaust was not only in Auschwitz and all the other places.</span> <span id="s161">Have you come across -- do you know German, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: No, I don’t speak German.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: There is a -- there are some diaries by a German professor called -- it -- I’ll look it up later -- who t -- who was a -- again, a Jew married to an Aryan lady and what they endured in Dresden.</span> <span id="s164">Th-They -- it was from Dresden, of all places, this diary.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s166">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: And he writes every day, secretly, his diary is about this period.</span> <span id="s168">And what they endured is just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s169">In the end, out of 5,000 Jews in Dresden, 60 were still alive at the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: 5,000 Jews in Dresden, 60 alive at the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: All the others were deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: All the others were deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Ta-Taken away.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Let me stop here.</span> <span id="s175">I just want to --.</span> <span id="s176">What was your -- what was your main fear?</span> <span id="s177">You hadn’t made it, you didn’t know whether you’d renite -- reu -- reunited with your father.</span> <span id="s178">What -- what were the signs around you that -- that were most frightening?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: That one really had no idea what the future was going to bring.</span> <span id="s180">That one really lived from day to day.</span> <span id="s181">We lived a relatively normal life, because of my -- thanks to my mother being Aryan.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: And how did she protect you?</span> <span id="s183">You were -- you yourself were half-Jewish, how did she protect you?</span> <span id="s184">Did she not discuss what you were, or did you -- did people know or what?</span> <span id="s185">I mean, it sounded like it was very evident.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: Well, fortunately, as a -- I mean Jews from ‘41 on, had to wear the yellow star.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: The yellow star, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: I didn’t have to wear that, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: But how did you get away with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: Because, I -- as a half-Jew or half-Aryan, I didn’t have to, it was only full Jews.</span> <span id="s191">This wh-whole crazy legislation of 100 percent and 75 percent and 50 percent.</span> <span id="s192">I was 50 percent and so I could not be treated like a normal human being, but on the other hand, I was not treated as a Jew.</span> <span id="s193">I was sort of in-between.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: What -- what did that mean for you, in terms of having friends who were Aryan, who were not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: They -- I mean, looking back on it now, I am absolutely amazed, because I mean, obviously I was, to a certain extent, probably being watched.</span> <span id="s196">But they -- they stayed low and treated me as -- just like a -- very good friends and so I owe a great deal to them.</span> <span id="s197">Then, of course, the critical time came in ‘44, when things were pretty desperate, sort of, in the west and in the east.</span> <span id="s198">And at this point, mishlings were also being called up, but not into the armed forces, but into the Tut Organization.</span> <span id="s199">The Tut Organization was a -- run by one of Hitler’s ministers, to be engaged in emergency work, for instance, the building of the Atlantic wall and the repair of bombed railway stations, lines and all that sort of thing, in east and west.</span> <span id="s200">So we were not soldiers, but we were sort of -- in fact, we were regarded as second class citizens.</span> <span id="s201">We didn’t wear a uniform, we just wore an armband which said, Tut Organization.</span> <span id="s202">And we were made -- made up of people with my background, political prisoners and also minor criminals.</span> <span id="s203">A queer mixture of people.</span> <span id="s204">And when was it?</span> <span id="s205">April ‘44, I said good-bye to my mother, I did not know what was going to happen to her in Dresden.</span> <span id="s206">Obviously we had no real contact with my father in England.</span> <span id="s207">I didn’t know where I was going to land up, they didn’t tell us, we were just loaded onto a train in Dresden and eventually we realized that we were on our way to France.</span> <span id="s208">And we’re then sort of detailed to work on railway sites that had been bombed, to repair them -- very often, with time bombs going out -- going off at place-places.</span> <span id="s209">And that went on til September -- from April ‘44 to September ‘44.</span> <span id="s210">Mainly in the Paris area.</span> <span id="s211">Again, we were subject to quite a few air raids, but survived.</span> <span id="s212">And then there were four -- one, two, three, four of us -- five of us, I’m sorry -- who realized that one day this train would be dur -- and this was all during the allies invasion.</span> <span id="s213">The allies were sort of advancing, we were slowly being withdrawn and we knew that one day we would return to Germany and then of course, what was going to happen then?</span> <span id="s214">Especially towards the end of the war.</span> <span id="s215">We had no idea.</span> <span id="s216">So we had determined that if there was the slightest opportunity, we would jump off the train and try to find the French Resistance movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: Could you say that a little louder, I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Jump off the plane?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: We jumped off the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Train.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: We would jump off the train and try and find the French Resistance Movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: And eventually in Se -- one day in September ‘44, we got that opportunity as the train was being pulled back towards Germany.</span> <span id="s225">One evening, the five of us jumped off, disappeared in the undergrowth and found some refuge with some French farmers.</span> <span id="s226">And we gather that only a day or two later, the whole train was destroyed by British or American fighters.</span> <span id="s227">So, we were --</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Why do you think the French farmers would have given you refuge, given --</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Because we were all part of the French Resistance.</span> <span id="s230">And we -- we had said that we -- we’d run away and --</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s232">And they believed you?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: They believed us, but day or two later, we were being arrested by the official French forces, because they thought we were German spies.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: That’s what I was thinking.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: And they didn’t quite know what to do with us.</span> <span id="s236">We weren’t soldiers.</span> <span id="s237">We claimed we were of Jewish origin.</span> <span id="s238">And so, at that time there was sort of complete chaos in France.</span> <span id="s239">There were refugees from various countries which had been caught up by the Germans and also run away.</span> <span id="s240">And we were all taken down to the south of France to be repatriated to our various countries, but of course, they couldn’t repatriate us.</span> <span id="s241">So we were eventually -- the Jews didn’t want us, because we weren’t proper Jews.</span> <span id="s242">So we -- there was an organization called Free Germany, which was really a -- a Communist organization, we landed up there.</span> <span id="s243">And we were indoctrinated to learn about Stalin and Marx and Lenin and all the rest of it.</span> <span id="s244">And that was not a very pleasant time and food was very short in France -- in the south of France at the time and there was no heating, terrible winter.</span> <span id="s245">But, eventually, I got a job with the American army.</span> <span id="s246">And also, about December, I mean post communications were [indecipherable] almost non-existent, but I wrote to the Bishop of Chichester -- Chichester, because that’s all I knew, in very halting English, “Sir, I’m Juergen Simonson, I think you know my father.</span> <span id="s247">I would like to go to England and be reunited with him.”</span> <span id="s248">And eventually he got the letter.</span> <span id="s249">I got a cable from him to say, “Letter received.</span> <span id="s250">I will put you in touch with my -- your father and I’m trying everything with the British Home Office, to get you a visa to England.”</span> <span id="s251">That was still very difficult for a German.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Why did you pick Bishop Bell?</span> <span id="s253">What did you know that made you think --</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: Because we had the occasional -- there was a Red Cross letter, that you could write every six months, with 25 or 50 words, which really said very little.</span> <span id="s255">In addition to that, we were extremely fortunate that we had friends in Switzerland and we could write to them and they in turn could write to my father and vice versa.</span> <span id="s256">So, very occasionally, we had some news through them and they had mentioned this link with the Bishop of Chichester.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: And -- and Bishop Bell by this time, had -- he’d been working in the 30’s -- am I correct -- with the German church, trying to --</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: -- initially get them to speak out against Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: That’s right, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: And then once the war started, of course, their tone changed.</span> <span id="s262">I suppose they felt it had to, and he was much more persona non grata --</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: Oh, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: -- at this juncture.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: And of course, he had met Dietrich Vonhuffer.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: In Stockholm and I think in ‘42.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: Did he ever talk to you about Vonhuffer?</span> <span id="s269">[telephone ringing]</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: Would you like to just switch it off, please?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: I just --</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: -- say that he didn’t -- he didn’t talk to you about Vonhuffer.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: He didn’t talk to me about Dietrich Vonhuffer.</span> <span id="s275">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: So you -- he got you and [indecipherable] your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: So he did manage to get this visa for me, and -- which took some time, but in June ‘45, I came over and really when I arrived at Newhaven, I felt like the Pope, I wanted to touch British so-soil.</span> <span id="s278">For the first time, I really felt safe again after -- what?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: All those years.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: Over 10 -- 11 -- 12 -- 12 years.</span> <span id="s281">And met my father at Victoria and then sometime later I was introduced to George Bell.</span> <span id="s282">I wish I could describe --</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Where was your mother?</span> <span id="s284">Excuse me, I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: She was still in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: Yeah, that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: No, you mean in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: I-In Germany, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: What was it like seeing your father after all that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: He didn’t recognize me.</span> <span id="s292">Because he’d left me when I was a boy of 14.</span> <span id="s293">I was a young man of 21.</span> <span id="s294">We -- we’d been separated for seven years.</span> <span id="s295">From -- over six years, from March ‘39 to June ‘45.</span> <span id="s296">It was incredible.</span> <span id="s297">And he, in the meantime had become -- been ordained and become an Anglican priest.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Did he ever discuss, or did you ever think about the fact that -- that the tradition, the religious tradition that had so let your family down -- let his family down, was the one that he joined?</span> <span id="s299">Was that a -- was that a -- a -- an issue, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: No, because on the one hand, I seem to remember, when I was still a boy, father was forcibly retired, we lived in Forst.</span> <span id="s301">There was a church outside Forst where a member of the Confessional Church --</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: -- ministered, who later became a bishop in the German church.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: After the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: After the war, yes.</span> <span id="s306">So our links were very much with the Confessional Church.</span> <span id="s307">And they were really a great encouragement to us, because they were really the only organization in Germany that was left, which offered some kind of resistance to Hitler.</span> <span id="s308">And of course, many of their pastors were arrested and taken to concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s310">You never knew Paul Schneider, did you, the tr --</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: No, but I know the book and his [indecipherable] story, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: His son was in Washington, we -- we --</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: We honored him last fall.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Oh, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s317">[indecipherable] his son read something from Frau Schneider, who’s still alive, who had hoped -- hoped to come, but could not make the trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Oh, how amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: So it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: I’ve just looked at his book the other da -- the other day.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: The very thick one?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: No, just a little one -- book.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Oh, I don’t -- I don’t know that.</span> <span id="s324">No, I know Claude Foster’s book is the one I have --</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: -- with 900 pages.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: No, no I don’t know that one, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: So, you’re with your father, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: So, I -- I mean our experiences of the German church were not as unfavorable as that of others.</span> <span id="s330">And also, of course he -- he joined the Anglican church.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: And that --</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: Well, where had the Anglican church been in Germany during all this?</span> <span id="s334">Where --</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: Well, I mean they were just colonial churches, which catered for the English people --</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: The English -- the English speaking people in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: That’s right, that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: The English were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: So, there were not -- in other words, there were no Anglican churches in Germany that were German?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s342">No, no, no, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: Oh, I see -- I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: -- only -- they only catered for English speaking people.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: Well, they were really in a peculiar position, weren’t they?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Yes, of course, I mean they just did their job of looking after the -- their English nationals.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: And did they leave, most of them, did they --</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: Oh, I would think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: -- flee to England --</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: Yes, yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: -- when the war came.</span> <span id="s352">They’d have to --</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: I would have -- think so --</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: -- I’d imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: Yes, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: And the Anglican church in [indecipherable] must have come to an end, probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s359">So that was -- that was your tradition.</span> <span id="s360">Now, you met George Bell later, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: I met him later, quite a number of times.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: What do you remember about him?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: The most -- I wish I could describe him.</span> <span id="s364">The only thing I can describe about him -- that he had the most translucent blue eyes that I’ve ever seen.</span> <span id="s365">You really saw through him -- through the eyes, into his soul.</span> <span id="s366">A very fine face.</span> <span id="s367">A man who’d obviously stood up and been rejected himself, as you probably know.</span> <span id="s368">I mean he -- you probably wouldn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: Well, I don’t know -- perhaps you could tell us.</span> <span id="s370">I know that the bishop -- Bishop Hedlum, I believe was the Bishop of Gloucester, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: Yes, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: I know that Hedlum had written to the Archbishop about Bell and thinking Bell should keep quiet, because he was so vociferous against --</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: -- what Hitler was doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: But I don’t know, other than Hedlum, I had a feeling that perhaps Bell was very supported by the British church an-and -- wh-what what was your -- you tell me what you know.</span> <span id="s377">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: It’s more that he spoke up very strongly in the House of Lords, against the bombing of German cities.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: And so he was considered a pacifist --</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: And so --</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: -- or was he just considered a person who should not have --</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Who should not have -- have spoken up --</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: -- took a -- took a position that --</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: And Churchill obviously didn’t take kindly to him.</span> <span id="s385">I mean, there’s no doubt, I think, nowadays that when Lang retired, that Bell --</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Archbishop Lang, we’re talking about --.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: -- would have -- would have -- yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: -- the Archbishop of Canterbury.</span> <span id="s389">Yes.</span> <span id="s390">And that year was what?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: I think it would have -- most probably ‘42 --</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: Two.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: -- that Bell would have become Archbishop of Canterbury, because he was the outstanding ecumenical figure of his time.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: In his place, Temple was made archbishop -- who also made an outstanding archbishop.</span> <span id="s396">I mean both of them are -- were outstanding figures.</span> <span id="s397">Sorry -- no, I’ve got it wrong.</span> <span id="s398">It’s the other way around.</span> <span id="s399">Temple was made archbishop in ‘42.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Yes, that’s right, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: But sadly died in ‘44, which was a great tragedy.</span> <span id="s402">From -- I can’t remember now what his illness was.</span> <span id="s403">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: So he didn’t live to the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: No.</span> <span id="s406">And in his place, Bell should have been made archbishop.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Oh, I see.</span> <span id="s408">Bell shouldn’t have succeeded Lang.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: He should have succeeded Temple.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: Temple, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: And -- and who did succeed Temple, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Well, it would have been Fisher, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: So Bell --</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: Remained Bishop of Chichester and played a very important role in the ecumenical scene.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: In what way?</span> <span id="s421">Do you know [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Well, he was -- he was one of the -- became one of the chairman of the Royal Council of Churches.</span> <span id="s423">And was re -- lauseal sponsor for the first assembly of the Royal Council of Churches in Amsterdam in 1948, when, for the first time, all the churches were able to come together again.</span> <span id="s424">He also made visits to Germany and welcomed German church leaders to England and sort of reestablished the contact between the --</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: With the German church.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: With the German church.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Which must have been difficult, because he had been so close to them at one time --</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Mm, that’s right, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: -- and then -- there’s a -- a letter in Andrew Chandler’s book about -- I believe it’s Bell writing to Carl Bart and expressing such surprise that Neimuller, from prison, had offered to command another U-boat.</span> <span id="s430">Do you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: And -- and he writes to Bart and says, “How could Neimuller have even remotely suggested that he would fight in a war for people with whom he differed on every level?”</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: I know, that’s right.</span> <span id="s434">Mm, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: And Bart wrote back to Bell and said, “Neimuller is too much of a German --</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: -- and too much of a Lutheran.”</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Now, that’s an interesting statement.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: That’s right, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: How would you interpret Bart’s comment back to Bell?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: That’s -- Neimuller was -- I suppose, deep down his heart, a patriot, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s444">And that -- that -- that superseded the moral sense of what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: Must have done.</span> <span id="s446">That’s right.</span> <span id="s447">And also, of course, there was a terrible -- I mean this is -- was one of the reasons and I read this again now -- terrible fear in Germany that the Russians, the Bolshevists as they were called, would overrun Germany.</span> <span id="s448">And they would rather be under Hitler, a -- a --a German Nazi, then under a Russian Bolshevists.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Well, of course, this is the argument that the church used all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: Hm.</span> <span id="s451">That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: And the church of -- of -- I mean, both Protestant and Roman Catholic.</span> <span id="s453">Certainly that was much of what I think generated the lack of support from Pius the -- the 12th.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Hm.</span> <span id="s455">That’s right, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: Was that -- that fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: Oh yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: And -- and because there were some people who were Jewish who were Communists, that was, of course, something that was always ascribed to the Jews, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: Yeah, that’s all true, yes.</span> <span id="s460">Oh, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: -- that so often as a -- and then created some antagonism there.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: Was your -- were -- when you met Bell, in later years, did he ever talk about his difficulties in the 30’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: No, di-didn’t talk to me, because I was a -- a junior.</span> <span id="s465">I really met him partly because I was -- at that time -- looking for a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: That’s all right.</span> <span id="s467">I want to know where we are.</span> <span id="s468">I want to -- I’m going to stop this right -- excuse me, tell me -- finish by what you were saying.</span> <span id="s469">You were looking for a?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: A -- a job i-in the church.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: And so was seeking his advice.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s474">Let me just.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: So -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B [blank] Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: -- silence and then we’re just discussing more general things, less the exact events, chronological events than some thoughts and opinions, then we’ll get back to some chronological events perhaps, too.</span> <span id="s477">I was just asking Mr. Simonson, who’s the Reverend Mr. Simonson, how he felt about the Goldhagen book and how that jibes with his own memories of Germany and -- and -- and what were you saying?</span> <span id="s478">It was a bit of revelation to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: It was really quite a shock to me, because in the wer -- I mean, he comes to the conclusion that really the whole German people are responsible for what happened and I’m just reflecting on this and putting some of these thoughts on paper.</span> <span id="s480">And really, other -- I find very difficult, because some of my school friends have been very loyal to me and have stood by me.</span> <span id="s481">But they were, of course, involved in the war.</span> <span id="s482">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: This is your mother’s family, though, too.</span> <span id="s484">I mean, this is your background, also.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: Oh yes, that’s right, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Did you -- did you sense that growing up?</span> <span id="s487">Was your mother’s family ever voicing anything that was that -- were they upset with your mother for marrying someone Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Strangely not, because I think they very much respected my father.</span> <span id="s489">And -- I mean they must have been in -- in a great conflict.</span> <span id="s490">I wonder what went on in their minds about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: Did your mother ever talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: Not really, no, no.</span> <span id="s493">In fact they said very little after the war.</span> <span id="s494">I don’t think they -- they could talk about it, was too difficult a subject.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: But --</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Well, were there -- let me phrase it differently, then.</span> <span id="s498">When you were in Dresden, you had people who stood by you, who were kind to you, who were good to you.</span> <span id="s499">Were there those who were like the people in the forest, also?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: Not so much in Dresden, because we moved in a fairly small circle and they were all people who stood by us.</span> <span id="s501">So we -- which to some extent sheltered and protected.</span> <span id="s502">But you always -- of course you always lived in fear, that -- I mean tha -- this is the awful thing that comes through in these diaries by Klemperer, that every day they lived in fear that the Gestapo would knock on the door and call and either beat them or take them away.</span> <span id="s503">So one had this sort of --</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: Did you ever see that?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: No, the only thing I do remember was in the -- after the Kristallnacht --</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: 1938, November.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: 1938, when Jews were driven through the main street, the Praggerstrasser in Dresden, on their way to the station to be taken to the concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: And you actually saw people hoarded?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: I saw it, yes.</span> <span id="s510">And also I -- on the morning after the -- the synagogue was burned down --</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: In Dresden?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: I cycled past the synagogue and saw the -- just the sort of remains of it, like.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: Did you wonder about whether you might have been caught up in that?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Not so much about myself, but I knew that my father would have been caught up in it and I w -- but --</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: But you must have had Jewish friends in Dresden, did you not?</span> <span id="s516">Or did you not?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: Very -- well, very few.</span> <span id="s518">No, most of my friends were -- you see, we really -- my father was a Christian, was brought up as a Christian.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: So was I.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: And we had very few links with the -- the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s523">I mean I’m absolutely shocked now, to read these diaries of a man who lived not very far away from me and I knew nothing of what went on in those circles.</span> <span id="s524">And all these hundreds of people who were deported.</span> <span id="s525">The only thing that I do know, which sort of affects us more immediately, was that affe -- concerns my grandparents.</span> <span id="s526">My -- my father’s father had been one of the senior judges of the central court in Leipzig in the central German court in Leipzig.</span> <span id="s527">And so they lived in Leipzig, fairly comfortably, because he had a fairly senior post.</span> <span id="s528">Then, eventually, again, I only discovered this the other day, they moved from Leipzig to Dresden -- to Berlin, because Leipzig was declared Judenfrie -- free of Jews.</span> <span id="s529">So they had to be -- clear out.</span> <span id="s530">And they had to move into rented accommodation in Berlin, which was allocated to them.</span> <span id="s531">And mercifully, my grandfather died there in ‘42.</span> <span id="s532">Now, with them lived my aunt, my father’s sister, who was single, who’d always lived at home.</span> <span id="s533">And several times before ‘39, I think my father had also tried to bring her out to England.</span> <span id="s534">And she hesitated, because she couldn’t bring herself to leave her parents.</span> <span id="s535">And so she was left behind.</span> <span id="s536">And in -- I’ve only just had all the f-file from Berlin, my aunt -- eventually they just lived in two rooms in Berlin.</span> <span id="s537">My aunt went to the t -- some office to collect her rations for the month, for Jews.</span> <span id="s538">They were treated as Jews, they had to wear the yellow star, of course.</span> <span id="s539">And was told that -- to get herself ready to be deported the following day.</span> <span id="s540">And my grandmother who was then 83 or 84, could not -- could not bear the thought of being left behind, so she decided to go with her daughter to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s541">Does that name mean anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Which of course was for the more privileged Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: And -- I mean she would have been deported anyway, later on.</span> <span id="s546">And what I found in these papers -- this were -- this was all about the disposal of their property and their possessions, because everything went -- went back automatically to the state.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: And what particular branch of the state would have taken that?</span> <span id="s548">The Department of Treasury, Commerce, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: Finance.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: Department of Finance.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: But, through the auspices of the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s552">I mean th-that was really --</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: So Himmler’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s555">And so, in March ‘43, they went to Theresienstadt and I think my grandmother must have died fairly soon after that.</span> <span id="s556">And I’ve written now -- it’s extraordinary that all this has taken so long.</span> <span id="s557">I’ve written now to Theresien -- to -- no, to -- to an agency in Prague.</span> <span id="s558">They can’t trace my grandmother at all.</span> <span id="s559">They’ve given me another address, which I haven’t tried yet.</span> <span id="s560">Whether there’s still any -- I mean -- whether anyone knows where she was cremated --</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: And your father wouldn’t have known any of this --</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: No, no, no, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: -- because he was in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Not til after the war.</span> <span id="s565">And then my aunt was later on deported.</span> <span id="s566">Moved on to Auschwitz and probably gassed immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: And you don’t know what happened when they -- either of them were killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Do you -- do you know the Red Cross?</span> <span id="s570">Th -- I don’t know who liberated Theresienstadt, so I don’t know who has those records.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: Do you know which nation did?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: I can show you.</span> <span id="s574">I can -- I’ll look at the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: Well, when we’re through this, let me get --</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: -- some information from you.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: So you went --</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: Su --</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: -- when did you find this out?</span> <span id="s582">In ‘45?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: Well, we -- no, what happened was that my other aunt in Dresden, my father’s sister, wa-was also married to an Aryan and she was allowed to send monthly food parcels to my grandmother in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s584">And I -- again -- only discovered this now, that all they were allowed to write back by way of n -- acknowledgment, was a printed card which said, “Parcel received, we are well.”</span> <span id="s585">They were not allowed to add any other information.</span> <span id="s586">And once that information -- that acknowledgment stopped, we knew that they had gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: So probably after a few months, the -- these -- she must have died and my aunt was then moved on to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s589">The awful thing was that in one of these papers from Berlin, I found that the official document says they were -- my grandmother and my aunt were aukershoben, which simply means -- it’s -- it’s a word that you use for cattle transports.</span> <span id="s590">They were just shoved away.</span> <span id="s591">I mean that’s how people treated them.</span> <span id="s592">That’s how they were looked at.</span> <span id="s593">Not as human beings.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: When did your father find out?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: Well, immediately after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Right after the war he found out what happened to his mother and his sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: It’s unbelievable, isn’t it?</span> <span id="s599">What -- what a -- a funny sense it must have given you, of having been able to survive, when your own family was dying.</span> <span id="s600">It’s a hard thing to deal with too, isn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: That’s right, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s602">And again I’ve only just sort of realized that had my father not found this diplomat as a sponsor, he probably wouldn’t have been able to go.</span> <span id="s603">He would have had the yellow star and what happened to all the other Jews, he would have been deported eventually.</span> <span id="s604">And we would have all moved into -- after some time, all the Jews were moved into Jewish quarters, where the Gestapo could kee-keep a close -- watch them.</span> <span id="s605">And -- so we would have been --</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: This in -- this in Dresden?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: In Dresden, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: In Dresden.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: So we would have had to move into Jewish quarters.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: So there was a ghetto there also?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: Yes, that’s right, yes.</span> <span id="s612">And so my father probably would have been -- and I wouldn’t have had the same protection.</span> <span id="s613">And also, after -- from ‘42 on, I -- as a mishling now, would no longer be allowed to go to a German school.</span> <span id="s614">I was extremely lucky, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: It’s a miracle.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: And also that I came through all the forced labor in France, and so --</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: What did you do in the forced labor?</span> <span id="s618">You -- you talked a little bit about it earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Can you tell me anything about what that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: Well, we were working on railway stations, just sort of --</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: Physically building?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: No, exhuming.</span> <span id="s624">Quite a lot of trains were hit by these bombs and German soldiers were sort of covered by the debris and we had to exhume them and take them to the local cemetery to in-inter them and then reinstate the railway stations, that the trains could run through, the convoys to the front.</span> <span id="s625">And very often in areas infested by the French resistance movement.</span> <span id="s626">So, on the one hand, we had the bombs raining down from the allied forces.</span> <span id="s627">We were under the Nazis, who kept a close eye on -- on us and we were also threatened by the French resistance movement, because they saw us as being on the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: Saw you as the enemy of, course.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: It’s interesting how much of your life you spent being two different things.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: Yes, that’s right.</span> <span id="s632">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: Goodness.</span> <span id="s634">You got to England --</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: You -- you met Bell.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: Bell.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Did you ever meet cos -- well, Lang was gone by ‘42 --</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: Yes, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: -- so you would not have met him.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: B-But you -- and Temple was gone, really, by the time you got here, too, wasn’t he?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: Yes, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: So yeah, so he was -- so they would not have played a role.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: No.</span> <span id="s646">Bell --</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Bell --</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: -- was m -- our great hero and my father owed really everything to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Because --</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: Tell me what your father said about him.</span> <span id="s652">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: Well, you can read it in his book.</span> <span id="s654">He’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: In -- in your father’s book --</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s657">He’s written a book about it.</span> <span id="s658">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: Your fa -- I did -- I didn’t know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: No.</span> <span id="s662">Andrew didn’t tell me that.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: Is there any way I can get a co -- another copy of that book?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: I can lend it to you, if you want to.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: I’ll -- I’ll send it back, but I’d feel better if I could buy one.</span> <span id="s667">You don’t think I can purchase one?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: No, no, that’s out -- out of print.</span> <span id="s669">Completely out of print.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: Well, I’d hate to take yours.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: Well, there’s a --</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: We’ll talk about that later.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s674">Okay, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: But your father’s memories of Bell, he’s -- he -- he saved his life, did he -- did he -- perhaps this is the question.</span> <span id="s676">Why was Bell what Bell was?</span> <span id="s677">Does anybody know?</span> <span id="s678">He never talked about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s680">No idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: I mean Bell was -- was so rare in his concern for the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: Mm, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: You don’t -- among Christian clergy anywhere.</span> <span id="s684">Here -- James Parks, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: Yes, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: But Bell, at a time when the best of the clergy would say, “Well, it’s terrible what’s happening to the Jews, but --”</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: “-- we don’t really like them, so it’s easy to understand.”</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: You had a Bell, who wasn’t saying any of those things, he was saying we care for these people, we want to help them.</span> <span id="s691">But you don’t know why?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: I wonder if Bell ever wrote anything about his feelings at all.</span> <span id="s694">Do you remember your father mentioning if -- Bell writing at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: [indecipherable] his letters, it -- it comes through --</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: -- so clearly.</span> <span id="s699">Interesting.</span> <span id="s700">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: No, father had very close -- I mean, I’ve got quite a bit of correspondence from Bell upstairs.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: Do you really?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: I hope you --</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: Oh, I treasure it.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Treasure that, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: Yes, yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: And the -- oh, I’ll talk about that later.</span> <span id="s709">When you -- when you were with Bell, did he ask you about your years in Germany?</span> <span id="s710">Was he interested in --</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: Oh, of course, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: Very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: And -- and what could he do after the war?</span> <span id="s715">Or let me go back to what he did during the war.</span> <span id="s716">We know he went to the House of Lords.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: Did Bell also go to Parliament to speak at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: Well, as a bishop, you could only go the House of Lords.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: You could only go the House of -- of the Lords.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: But --</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: And -- and -- was there -- what was the reception?</span> <span id="s725">I mean the bombing, we know the bombing --</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: -- of Dresden and -- and the -- I mean the bombing of the big cities --</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: -- people were not happy with him.</span> <span id="s730">When he went, did he -- did he not plea -- make a plea for refugees, though, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: Yes, but again, I’m amazed -- I’ve just been reading another book, by a -- actually a Polish lady, who then lived in Berlin and then became refugee and came to England.</span> <span id="s732">And is now married to one of the labor lords.</span> <span id="s733">And she speaks very disparagingly of the British leadership as being anti-Semitic.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: Mm.</span> <span id="s736">And of course, several instances where, to her -- I mean she is very outspoken and I’m not sure whether I can trust her judgment, but she believes that there was a great deal of an-anti-Semi -- and that even England could have done much more and let in more refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: To what degree do you think that the -- the teachings are what -- Jules Ithzak of course has coined that phrase that is used so much, teaching of contempt, the 2,000 year history of -- of saying that the Jews were responsible for the death of Jesus, that the Jews were a -- a group that had been really disowned by God, that the covenant had been passed on, the mantle had been passed on to Christianity.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: Mm, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: And that degenerate religion and -- and all of those things that -- that were so much a part of our Sunday school teaching, our church teaching.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: How much do you think the anti-Judaism played into the anti-Semitism of the church here, the church in Germany -- what -- do you -- you probably don’t have much sense, because you weren’t involved with the church --</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: -- in Germany at that time, but -- but picking it up here then, let’s look at it in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: No, even -- I mean, looking back on it, I -- both in Germany and here, I’m sure it hurt quite a lot to --</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Quite a lot of impact.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: I think so, yes.</span> <span id="s747">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: Do you ever meet with clergy from Germany?</span> <span id="s749">Did you, in -- in those early years, when you were here and -- and did your father have contact with clergy in Germany and -- after the war, much?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: He -- some of them, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: And -- and, you remember your father talking about there was reaction to the Jewish people [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: No, I we -- unfortunately he’s dead now.</span> <span id="s753">I wish I could ask him all these questions now.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s755">Of course you do.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: Too late.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: Too late.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: You and your work.</span> <span id="s760">Tell me a little bit about what you did after the war, when you came here and before you became a clergyman yourself.</span> <span id="s761">What -- what -- what prompted you to go into ministry?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: Because of the experiences a-at the end, i-i -- during the forced labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: Would you explain that a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: I especially -- as I told you, I was down in the south of France, working for the American army.</span> <span id="s765">And one day a British padre who was a -- a chaplain in the forces, who was also a friend of my father’s, they’d been in theological college together -- appeared and said he was also looking after a big, German prisoner of war camp, down in the south of France and didn’t have the language.</span> <span id="s766">Could I come and help him?</span> <span id="s767">And, of course, I’d never done anything like it, before.</span> <span id="s768">And so I preached my first sermon in a German prisoner of war camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: Now, are you saying you preached, but you weren’t ordained --</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: -- at this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: So what --how did that come about?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: He just picked me up and --</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: And said, “I want you to preach”?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: That’s right, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: Well, what did you preach on, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: I preached -- when you’re confirmed in Germany, which is a lovely custom, you’re given a verse subscripter to -- as a sort of motto for your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: And what was yours?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: And my pastor, who obviously knew about my circumstances, gave me John, chapter six, verse 68, “Lord, to whom shall we go?</span> <span id="s781">You have the words of eternal life.”</span> <span id="s782">And that time I did not know where I was going to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: Going, yeah.</span> <span id="s784">Isn’t that amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: And that was really the only verse I knew.</span> <span id="s786">So I preached on that.</span> <span id="s787">And of course that was true of the German POW’s as well.</span> <span id="s788">They were in total chaos.</span> <span id="s789">They had no contact with their families at home.</span> <span id="s790">Their cities had been bombed at home.</span> <span id="s791">They were defeated and --</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: We don’t think much about the young German boys --</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: No, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: -- who were lost or who were suffering so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: Mm, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: Caught -- conscripted and caught up in a war they didn’t understand and didn’t have any responsibility for --</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: Mm, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: -- and had no choice and -- and well, we frankly hated them.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: Oh yes, oh yes, yes</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Was a -- that was the enemy, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: Mm, that’s right, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: And -- and because of what happened with the Gypsies and the handicapped and the Jews and many groups, we focus so much on them, we do forget how much suffering --</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: And of course it was the second time this had happened in a major scale, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: Mm, that’s right.</span> <span id="s806">Oh, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: -- find it hard to be so -- I’m sure a voice such as yours would have been a very welcome one for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: So that was really the beginning, that I had sort of began to feel perhaps that --</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: That you were called.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: Then you were in England.</span> <span id="s812">What did you do, originally, when you got there?</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: Well, then I had to do -- immediately after the war, I was the first enemy alien to arrive in Britain.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: Oh, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s816">Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s817">Thanks to Bell.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: Bishop Bell, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: Mm-hm, that’s right.</span> <span id="s820">In June ‘45.</span> <span id="s821">Only, oh, less than a month from the end of the war in Europe and I had to do some import -- I mean some essential work, so I worked for the -- really some clerical work, a filing clerk in London for a time.</span> <span id="s822">Partly also, because I had to retake my matric, because the German matric wasn’t valid.</span> <span id="s823">So I had to take a sort of equivalent.</span> <span id="s824">And also really more -- to become more fluent in English.</span> <span id="s825">And then in ‘48, I went to theological college.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: And was again --</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: Where -- where [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: In -- near London.</span> <span id="s830">In Surrey.</span> <span id="s831">And was ordained in ‘52.</span> <span id="s832">And my college principal later became Archbishop of Canterbury, Donald Coggin.</span> <span id="s833">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s835">And where was your first assignment?</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: First in -- in London, really in a very tough area, 40,000 people in Paddington.</span> <span id="s837">And then we wondered whether we should go abroad and serve the church overseas.</span> <span id="s838">So we were in Nigeria for seven years, in the theological college, teaching.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: Good heavens.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: And then came back to England and I was in two parishes in south London.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: N-Now, were you there until you retired?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: Did you have any contact with any Jewish Christian organizations, any organizations of ecumenical nature?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: Did you have any interest in them?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: Probably -- probably not at the time, because I was so involved in my own work.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: I’ve only really so -- I’m catching up now.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: I’ve done the Council for Christians and Jews now.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: I wonder if that’s -- I’m meeting tomorrow with somebody from that group, with -- with Dorothy, I’m having lunch with --</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: Well, down in Southhampton?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: Yes, I don’t know who it is.</span> <span id="s854">She says there’s a new -- maybe it’s just in Southhampton --</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: It’s a new [indecipherable] that’s right.</span> <span id="s856">That -- that I belong to.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: Oh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: I’m going to have lunch then.</span> <span id="s862">So this is a late -- a late in life interest?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: Yes, yes</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: You’ve got your father’s papers, some of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: Did your father write any memoir -- he wrote about Bell.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: Bell certainly must feature in his book very much, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: I-I’ll show it to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: But his own experiences, he didn’t write much?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: He did?</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: There’s his whole -- his whole story.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: I’ll give it to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: And -- and looking at it today, what would you say about the state of Jewish Christian relations here?</span> <span id="s879">Is there a lot of interest and -- for example, the liturgy -- on -- on Good Friday, that whole Holy Week liturgy is so riddled with Johanine text --</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: I know.</span> <span id="s881">That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: That make us so uncomfortable --</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: -- and we’re really working to do something about the reading of those texts, perhaps selecting others, in America.</span> <span id="s885">Is that true of England, or is there not much of a movement in that area?</span> <span id="s886">A: Not a great deal I would have thought.</span> <span id="s887">And also I would have thought, there must be still quite a lot of latent anti-Semitism about.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: Anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s889">Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s890">Must be strange --</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: I think if I looked into the hearts of my neighbors here, who are very much establishment and conservative, I think, deep down in their hearts -- I mean they wouldn’t express it to me, because they respect me for what I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: But I think deep down in their hearts, probably, it would be still there.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: I would think that would be very upsetting.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: Yes, but I mean it’s -- it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: You live with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: -- such a long history, isn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: It’s a long history.</span> <span id="s899">It’s a long history.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: You can’t sort of suddenly snap out of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s902">We’ve had a long time to try and snap out of it, though</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: What -- what does this -- the Christian and Jewish organization do to work on this, do you know?</span> <span id="s905">I mean, you just joined it, so you probably don’t know a great deal about what they’re doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s907">No, and also I think that it’s only a special interest for some people and it doesn’t really penetrate into the heart and soul of --</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: -- the majority.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: Would you think that the -- I mean one of the questions that one has to ask, really, is -- is it possible to rid Christianity of this anti-Judaism?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: I mean, is it?</span> <span id="s913">Is it something we’re just going to always have to --</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: -- say is part of us, and if so, is that -- does that -- seems to me the church never lived up to the ideals it set for itself during that period and -- and I -- I -- if we can’t do something to foster a change, then -- then we’ve really got a -- a bit of a crippled tradition here.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: Mm.</span> <span id="s917">Oh yes.</span> <span id="s918">But I mean, in the first place, what do you do with the gospels?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: Well, that’s a problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s921">What do you do about, St. John?</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: Well, of course, what I do, is I don’t preach from St. John --</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: -- and I don’t read St. John --</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: -- I read the -- the others and -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: No, but -- that’s right -- but I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: Or I -- or I put it in it’s te -- context though --</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: Yeah, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: -- I think that’s what you have to ask clergy to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s932">So I think depends very much on the way it’s being interpreted by the church today.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: And I suppose that really, then, to me, is what the crux of it all was about, that -- that we need to get into our seminaries --</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: Mm, that’s right.</span> <span id="s935">Here, here.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: -- and teach students how to understand those texts.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: That’s right, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: In the sitsinlabin and --</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: Mm, that’s right, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: -- and that’s the only thing that’s going to help us in our preaching, is if clergy trained in the future and I guess my question then is -- this is being done in some seminaries in the United States, the Roman Catholic Church is doing it, but do you think it’s being done in this country in the seminaries today?</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: I would doubt it, on the whole.</span> <span id="s942">I don’t think it plays a very important --</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: I mean that’s a -- tho -- there are three -- now four conciliar documents of the Roman Catholic church that have called for this.</span> <span id="s944">So, that has quite an imprimatur.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: Mm, mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: And -- and sends a very strong message to the Catholic seminaries -- and I’m a product of a Catholic seminary.</span> <span id="s947">But I -- it distresses me as a Protestant, that I don’t think this is as much a concern in our country --</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: -- in the Protestant seminaries.</span> <span id="s950">But if I hear you correctly, you’re saying it’s not really one here.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: I don’t think that’s the way in Britain, I -- certainly not as far as I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: I think I would have picked it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: When you talk --</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: I mean what --</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: Please --</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: -- in-interests me is that now, after 50 years, people are only beginning to address the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: I mean in the churches.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: That’s right, that’s right, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: I mean the Pope maping -- making this announcement only a few weeks ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: The French church, last year I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: Beautiful statement of the French bishop’s, isn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: I know.</span> <span id="s966">Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: Do you have a copy of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s969">Mm.</span> <span id="s970">The various other things which only -- why has it taken us all this time to face up to it?</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: I think that’s the question.</span> <span id="s972">And I think that’s the question we need to keep asking.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s975">What about your fellow clergy?</span> <span id="s976">What do you hear from them, anything?</span> <span id="s977">Do they -- do you ever discuss it with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: No, [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: Who comprises the -- this council of Christians and Jews here?</span> <span id="s980">Is it clergy, is it hum -- just --</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: No, it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: -- regular lay people?</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: No, it’s -- it’s clergy and laity.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: Obviously some very good people, but only -- it’s only very small number of people, a tiny minority who are anxious to foster good relationships.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s987">Well, it’s -- that must be a disappointment for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: I mean, one who has played an important role is my former principal, who then became Archb -- Canterbury, Donald Coggin, who has been one of the presidents of the Council of Christian and Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s990">And that’s a -- that’s a nice feeling, isn’t it -- to have it be that.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: Hm, that’s right, yes.</span> <span id="s992">And as -- as you probably know, Stoneberg has just received the Templeton prize.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: Yeah, yeah [inaudible] that.</span> <span id="s994">Well, as you look back on those years, knowing now what you know about the church -- I mean one of the things you would not have been probably thinking about so much when you decided to take this route, you wouldn’t have been looking in depth at the role of the church at that time, you were looking at what it said -- what it meant to you and how it helped you.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: And how you felt it could help others.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: What -- and you have no contact with German clergy today, do you, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: Not directly, no -- no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: So you don’t really know what they’re -- what the teaching and preaching is from the seminar -- did you ever hear much about Marberg and Tubing and -- I mean, when the Aryan clause came in in -- in ‘33, it looks as if there was the acquiescence of all the seminaries, except Marberg seemed to be the one that held a little bit to it’s belief.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: No, I didn’t know that, hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: But y -- that was not an iss -- you never discussed these kinds of things?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: No, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: This was not part of your life, was it, at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: No, no -- you see, I was only a young boy, really, when --</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: You were so young, of course, of course.</span> <span id="s1007">This was not --</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: -- when [indecipherable] me.</span> <span id="s1009">So again, I’m only just catching up on things that I should have known long time ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: Let me go back to your mother.</span> <span id="s1011">Your mother joined your father in what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: ‘45.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: ‘45 she came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: ‘46, ‘46.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: ‘46.</span> <span id="s1016">Must have been a difficult -- almost more difficult for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: Oh, very difficult</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: How many years had they been apart then, eight?</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: Well, seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: Seven years apart.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: Seven years apart, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: So each had learned to live --</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: And she had -- again -- been through the terrible destruction of Ger -- of Dresden.</span> <span id="s1024">Lost everything [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: Run for 12 days through the countryside, to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: I’m sorry, say that again.</span> <span id="s1028">She ran for 12 days through the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: Through the countryside --</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: Countryside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: -- to find somewhere to -- where she could find refuge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: Then she was under the -- in the Russian zone.</span> <span id="s1034">Tried to escape twice with her parents into west Germany and failed.</span> <span id="s1035">And then partly through Probst Grueber, of whom you may have heard, he was -- he did [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: Could you spell that name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: G-r-u-e-b-e-r.</span> <span id="s1038">Probst -- Probst was a German -- he was a senior German clergyman in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: Grueber.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s1042">Yes, of course, of course.</span> <span id="s1043">Well, tell me, go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: And he was instrumental in getting my mother out of the Russian zone to Berlin, into the western zone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: Pastor Grueber.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1048">That was one of the great names, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: And of course he worked very closely with Bell.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1051">One of the real shining lights in the church.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: That’s right, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: Now, how did he get your mother out exactly, though, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: Well, I suppose my mother must have sort of appealed to him or written to him and asked for his help.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: Or no, again, I’m sure this came through Bell.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: Bell --</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: So you think Bell got in touch with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: -- got in touch with Grueber.</span> <span id="s1061">“Could you please do something for this lady?”</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1063">Was he doing this with lots of people, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1065">Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: Do you know what happened to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: No, I -- I -- I’m not sure, no.</span> <span id="s1068">No, I don’t think I can tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: Yeah, well I just wondered what the -- what the post-war experience --</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: I mean, there would be something about Grueber in my father’s book, probably.</span> <span id="s1071">[inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: In your father’s book, yeah.</span> <span id="s1073">There wo -- wo -- the -- your mother got here, what -- what was life for her then like?</span> <span id="s1074">Did she speak much English?</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: No, I wouldn’t think she would.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: She -- she was very German and found quite difficult to -- and of course she hadn’t married a clergyman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: That’s right.</span> <span id="s1079">She married a judge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: That’s right, yes.</span> <span id="s1081">And suddenly she found herself the wife of a clergyman.</span> <span id="s1082">So she found it quite -- quite difficult.</span> <span id="s1083">And she was a -- there’s a picture of her, under the [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: I’ll have to go look at that, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: Un-under this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: And she probably felt some hostility, did she not?</span> <span id="s1087">Because she was German?</span> <span id="s1088">Maybe not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: I think she was so delighted to be reunited with my father and with me.</span> <span id="s1090">And for all three of us to come together again, I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: -- it was a miracle.</span> <span id="s1093">It was an absolute miracle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: Well, it was a miracle.</span> <span id="s1095">And the fact th-that there were English who didn’t like the Germans would not have been the issue here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: The issue was that she was so finally --</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: -- back together.</span> <span id="s1100">And -- and your father retired when?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: Father retired at the age of 75.</span> <span id="s1102">He was the vicar in Hampstead, in London.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: Was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: And then he lived til he -- another 25 years and died at the age of hundred -- 101.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: Your father died at the age of 101?</span> <span id="s1106">And how long did your mother live?</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">A: She died a little earlier, she was 88.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q: So they had -- they -- they made up --</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: Yes, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: -- to some degree, for those years they lost, didn’t they?</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1112">But I mean, considering what they’d been through, it’s amazing that they lasted so long.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: It’s absolutely extraordinary.</span> <span id="s1114">Just extraordinary.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: Mm, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: What a -- what an amazing thing.</span> <span id="s1117">So your father and mother were together those years, did they talk much at all about what had happened --</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: -- like, did they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: Again that’s -- again something that I’ve only just realized, how much more they could have talked about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1122">Why do you think that is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: I think -- I think they found it too difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: Just too hard to mention, yeah.</span> <span id="s1125">Too frightening.</span> <span id="s1126">What about nightmares, did you ever have nightmares as a -- when you got here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">A: Strange enough, no.</span> <span id="s1128">Because really, the extraordinary thing was that from the moment I arrived here, I felt at home and
