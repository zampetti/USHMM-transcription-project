into the camp in Algeria.</span></p> <p><span id="s4">Answer: I was caught in Nice, France.</span> <span id="s5">I was on the run.</span> <span id="s6">I was put in jail in Nice.</span> <span id="s7">A place called Ka-sem-dee-o-wah (ph).</span> <span id="s8">After a few days, I was told that I was going to be handed over to the Gestapo to be shot.</span> <span id="s9">I didn't take kindly to it and I was able to break out.</span> <span id="s10">I opened most of the cells, they were occupied by Jews, like me.</span> <span id="s11">They were __________ for they're lives.</span> <span id="s12">And I told them, _________, may you have a go of it.</span> <span id="s13">The answer was, where shall we go?</span> <span id="s14">Nobody wants us.</span> <span id="s15">Nobody will help us.</span> <span id="s16">I didn't accept this.</span> <span id="s17">I went over the wall.</span> <span id="s18">I now became a fugitive from justice.</span> <span id="s19">I became a hunted man.</span> <span id="s20">Sure enough, there was no place for me to go.</span> <span id="s21">I had no papers, I had no money, I didn't speak the language.</span> <span id="s22">I was caught and put into a camp near Kon-dee-ash-la-schi-mier (ph).</span> <span id="s23">From there they transported us together.</span> <span id="s24">They put us on a cattle boat, about 400 or 500 of us.</span> <span id="s25">And they transported us to North Africa.</span> <span id="s26">Algiers.</span> <span id="s27">There we were put in jail with several months solitary confinement and then transported to a camp.</span> <span id="s28">Two hundred and fifty files outside Algiers.</span> <span id="s29">There is a high desert at the foot of the Aplis (ph) Mountains.</span> <span id="s30">There in the middle of the desert was the camp, barbed wire, tents and that's all.</span> <span id="s31">We were put in there and I remained there in this Hell for two years.</span> <span id="s32">From 1941 to 1943.</span> <span id="s33">I was liberated by the Polish who advanced at that time and I was taken to a hospital, the 96 General Hospital outside Algiers.</span> <span id="s34">And after several weeks of convalescence, they asked me what I wanted to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: Let's stay with the camp a little bit and talk about the camp itself.</span> <span id="s36">Tell me, did you work in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: The camp, we worked in the camp ten hours a day.</span> <span id="s38">And they were trying to build a train through the Sahara called the Transcontinental.</span> <span id="s39">Of course, they never succeeded.</span> <span id="s40">The conditions, they were very bad.</span> <span id="s41">We had 75 grams by the day, 2 cups of water and the heat that came up to 110 degrees.</span> <span id="s42">At night it was so cold our teeth would chatter.</span> <span id="s43">We had no blankets, we had nothing to sleep on.</span> <span id="s44">Like I said, we slept in the tents, they were made for ten people.</span> <span id="s45">Fifty people in the tent.</span> <span id="s46">We were eaten up with lice.</span> <span id="s47">We dealt with desert rats, snakes, scorpions, malaria, malnutrition, beatings.</span> <span id="s48">The camp commander would come in who was a drunkard and a sadist.</span> <span id="s49">He would come in every day, pick out ten men and beat them up.</span> <span id="s50">Tie them to a pole, naked, and whip them with his horse whip, the whip he used for his horse.</span> <span id="s51">Just to show the rest of us.</span> <span id="s52">We were about 4,000 in there.</span> <span id="s53">To show the rest of us what would happen if we tried to escape or if we didn't behave ourselves.</span> <span id="s54">Or if we refused to work, or whatever.</span> <span id="s55">Infraction of the rules.</span> <span id="s56">This is going to happen to us.</span> <span id="s57">We were buried up to our heads in the sand, you couldn't move the head.</span> <span id="s58">There were a lot of bugs in the sand, they would bite.</span> <span id="s59">We wouldn't move, if we did they would crack our heads.</span> <span id="s60">The guards that would guard us were Spa-hees (ph), called Spa-hees (ph).</span> <span id="s61">The __________ was the Arab elite troops.</span> <span id="s62">They were very brutal.</span> <span id="s63">It was a brutal camp and I say, we survived, we really didn't.</span> <span id="s64">Out of the camp, 330 or 340 were still alive from 4,000 when we were liberated.</span> <span id="s65">So after a while, we got use to the punishment, we got use to taking very little water, we got use to taking, eating very little food.</span> <span id="s66">We utilized, the rats we use to eat, we use to catch and eat.</span> <span id="s67">Snakes we would eat.</span> <span id="s68">Dogs that passed by, wandering perhaps, that lost they're way into the barb wire.</span> <span id="s69">We would eat them.</span> <span id="s70">Anything edible, just to stay alive.</span> <span id="s71">We got use to all this.</span> <span id="s72">It's amazing how people get use to these things.</span> <span id="s73">We always had hope of getting out some day, of surviving.</span> <span id="s74">But more or less, we talked ourselves into that hope.</span> <span id="s75">We never didn't really have hope anymore.</span> <span id="s76">After two years, you begin to lose your hope.</span> <span id="s77">The work was very tough.</span> <span id="s78">We had to carry sand from a mile down the road to the desert, back to the desert.</span> <span id="s79">We had to clean the dunes up so they could lay the tracks for the railroad train.</span> <span id="s80">But a day later or two days later, they went blue.</span> <span id="s81">The mist-al (ph) it came, mist-al (ph) is a sandstorm, and put the dunes right back where we took it away from.</span> <span id="s82">So it was a hopeless situation.</span> <span id="s83">We walked along and we sunk into the sand.</span> <span id="s84">We got beaten, the guards use to be on horseback and they would whip us with their, what do you call these?</span> <span id="s85">Whips, there.</span> <span id="s86">Then we got up, either got up or died.</span> <span id="s87">Like a friend of mine said, who was before me, he says, you know?</span> <span id="s88">I can never get use to this.</span> <span id="s89">I'm trying very hard but I can never get use to this life.</span> <span id="s90">It was said in humor but I never forgot that phrase.</span> <span id="s91">I can never get use to it.</span> <span id="s92">Well, he died too, in the camp.</span> <span id="s93">They would take us to a __________ from the French Foreign Legion.</span> <span id="s94">And any infraction of the rules we would spend 14 days at the fort.</span> <span id="s95">Now, 14 days meant you hang on your arms every other day for 24 hours.</span> <span id="s96">We had very little food, we had very little water and beatings every night.</span> <span id="s97">And you did good if you came out alive.</span> <span id="s98">I was in there a few times.</span> <span id="s99">It was a bad situation.</span> <span id="s100">But we survived it, a few of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Who else was in the camp with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: In the camp?</span> <span id="s103">Mostly Jews.</span> <span id="s104">But we had arsons, we had people from the brigade, the international brigade, from Spain.</span> <span id="s105">The Tale-mon-brigada (ph).</span> <span id="s106">From the civil war in Spain.</span> <span id="s107">And we had many nationalities in there.</span> <span id="s108">Many languages were spoken.</span> <span id="s109">And we sort of stuck together.</span> <span id="s110">We were all in the same boat and we sort of had people in charge, that told us what to do and how to do.</span> <span id="s111">We helped one another.</span> <span id="s112">If one was sick, he is weak, all of us gave him a bit of bread, crumb of bread or a drink of water or whatever.</span> <span id="s113">Because they could get no rations.</span> <span id="s114">We tried to save as many as we could, help as many as we could.</span> <span id="s115">There was only so much we could do.</span> <span id="s116">It was a real hell.</span> <span id="s117">You cannot describe this hell, you were in there for two years.</span> <span id="s118">We thought it would never end, but it did.</span> <span id="s119">We came out.</span> <span id="s120">They took us, we were of course in very bad condition, physical and mentally, psychologically.</span> <span id="s121">And they took us to a prison hospital to get us back on our feet.</span> <span id="s122">And then it started.</span> <span id="s123">I had no place to go.</span> <span id="s124">I had no family, I had no home, I had no country.</span> <span id="s125">I just didn't know what to do or where to go, now that I was free and back on my feet.</span> <span id="s126">I just bided my time.</span> <span id="s127">I was about 22, 23 years old, so they asked me, I could have gone any place, to England, to France, to Israel.</span> <span id="s128">Is there anywhere in the free world, we will take you.</span> <span id="s129">You now are a free man.</span> <span id="s130">Well, once I felt better, I felt I had to do something, one more thing.</span> <span id="s131">Get the ____________ back, go into the army, which I did.</span> <span id="s132">At that time, of course, you must understand, I had a lot of resentment, a lot of hate in me.</span> <span id="s133">Towards the people that did all this to me.</span> <span id="s134">They took my family, my home.</span> <span id="s135">They took away my youth, they took away a part of my life, the best part of my life.</span> <span id="s136">My education.</span> <span id="s137">So, I joined the British Eighth Army.</span> <span id="s138">I couldn't speak a word of English but that didn't stop me.</span> <span id="s139">I eventually learned how to handle a gun and I spent 4 years and 3 months in the British Army.</span> <span id="s140">Two more years in Africa, that was over.</span> <span id="s141">They sent me to England, to the war office in London, and they attached me to the army intelligence.</span> <span id="s142">By now I could speak English, I could speak French, I could speak German.</span> <span id="s143">They send me to school, intelligence school.</span> <span id="s144">Gave me a course and sent me to Germany, they said they needed people to speak German.</span> <span id="s145">And they sent me to Germany.</span> <span id="s146">Went to Dusseldorf.</span> <span id="s147">I went to Half-ort (ph), Field Marshall Montgomery's headquarters.</span> <span id="s148">They gave me another schooling and I did the job, whatever they wanted me to do.</span> <span id="s149">I hunted war criminals for over 18 months.</span> <span id="s150">My job was, they gave me a picture, that's the man or woman you want and we went out to get them.</span> <span id="s151">Most of the time we succeeded, we caught some in Holland, some in France.</span> <span id="s152">We could travel anyplace, do anything, go anywhere, fly over there.</span> <span id="s153">And we got most of them but our job was to arrest them, to bring them in.</span> <span id="s154">And headquarters would take care of them, they had their particulars and their investigators and we translated the statements and that was the end of our job.</span> <span id="s155">What happened afterwards, we don't know.</span> <span id="s156">I did that for 18 months and didn't, of course, we were a bit rough, we were a bit hard on them.</span> <span id="s157">Because we traveled three at a time, a crew of three.</span> <span id="s158">Between us we spoke ten languages.</span> <span id="s159">And every one of us had a story to tell.</span> <span id="s160">It wasn't a good one.</span> <span id="s161">So we, we were the ones they couldn't bribe.</span> <span id="s162">We were the one's that had no pity.</span> <span id="s163">We were the one's that didn't understand their plight.</span> <span id="s164">And we were the one's that went out and did the job.</span> <span id="s165">No matter what, no matter what it took.</span> <span id="s166">Like, we caught one worker who killed many women and children, I will never forget this.</span> <span id="s167">We caught them in Holland and him, he was hiding in a back oven in a bakery.</span> <span id="s168">We went, four o'clock in the morning, we went in there and we told him, he wouldn't come out, we told him, he has a choice.</span> <span id="s169">Either we would put the back oven on and burn him to death or we will shoot him.</span> <span id="s170">That was more of a choice than he gave our people.</span> <span id="s171">Our people had no choice at all.</span> <span id="s172">They just killed them.</span> <span id="s173">They just gassed them or hanged them or burned them alive, and shot them and starved them.</span> <span id="s174">We gave him a choice.</span> <span id="s175">In fact, we gave him time to talk to his maker.</span> <span id="s176">This is the kind of situations we had.</span> <span id="s177">We were all in agreement with the way we did things and how we did it, and after 18 months they called me into the office and just said, we are as bad as the Germans, we are no better.</span> <span id="s178">We have to rebuild.</span> <span id="s179">We have to be better than they are.</span> <span id="s180">We have to show them how civilized people live, how civilized people do things.</span> <span id="s181">I looked at the captain, I said, are we uncivilized?</span> <span id="s182">He says, well, the way you do things is not just the right thing anymore.</span> <span id="s183">The war is ended.</span> <span id="s184">We can't go on doing this anymore.</span> <span id="s185">God will pay them back.</span> <span id="s186">I said, with my help.</span> <span id="s187">And I'll tell you what he says, you've had enough.</span> <span id="s188">We discharge you.</span> <span id="s189">Send you to England and you'll start a whole, new life.</span> <span id="s190">The war is over.</span> <span id="s191">And I said to him, the war may be over for you, the war isn't over for me.</span> <span id="s192">And as far as starting a new life, how do you do that?</span> <span id="s193">How do you start with no family, no home, no country, no money, no trade, no skill, no education?</span> <span id="s194">How do you start a new life?</span> <span id="s195">They had taken all this away from me and they haven't given me, any of them back.</span> <span id="s196">How do you start a new life?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: When you were investigating war criminals, were you also trying to find out what had happened to your own family?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s199">They gave me a jeep and I could travel into British zones and the American Zone of Germany.</span> <span id="s200">I traveled for three weeks, I went to one DP camp to another.</span> <span id="s201">Nothing.</span> <span id="s202">Nothing from my three sisters, three brothers, my mother, my father.</span> <span id="s203">Nothing.</span> <span id="s204">I came back empty.</span> <span id="s205">But I have never stopped looking to this day.</span> <span id="s206">I still write to organizations and places, but there is very little hope, if there is any at all, to find any of them.</span> <span id="s207">I don't really have any hope anymore.</span> <span id="s208">I've been looking for fifty years.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: What about just finding information about people that you knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s211">So, I went to England.</span> <span id="s212">What other place could I go?</span> <span id="s213">France wasn't very good to me.</span> <span id="s214">Italy wasn't very good to me.</span> <span id="s215">Switzerland wasn't, no body helped.</span> <span id="s216">So, I went to England.</span> <span id="s217">And that's were my life started, my so-called new life.</span> <span id="s218">There I roomed with another guy, I couldn't afford it on my own.</span> <span id="s219">And I waited, I didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s220">As I said, I had to experience.</span> <span id="s221">It was the first time I had lived on my own.</span> <span id="s222">I didn't have a place to go for lunch or dinner.</span> <span id="s223">I didn't have a place, any place to go, I had no body to talk to.</span> <span id="s224">At least in the army, you have some people, some friends.</span> <span id="s225">Here I had no one.</span> <span id="s226">I was all on my own, all alone in a strange land.</span> <span id="s227">A land that didn't even want me.</span> <span id="s228">Let's face it.</span> <span id="s229">If you don't speak English like the English do, you're an outsider.</span> <span id="s230">They don't like you and they show it.</span> <span id="s231">I had no other place to go, what could I do?</span> <span id="s232">I got into a lot of fist fights.</span> <span id="s233">I was bitter.</span> <span id="s234">I was disappointed.</span> <span id="s235">I was hurt.</span> <span id="s236">Inexperienced to stand on my own two feet.</span> <span id="s237">For a year, I wandered around.</span> <span id="s238">Did odd jobs.</span> <span id="s239">And then I decided I'd go to America.</span> <span id="s240">I'm going to leave it all behind.</span> <span id="s241">All the nightmares.</span> <span id="s242">All the bad experiences.</span> <span id="s243">All the bad times.</span> <span id="s244">I get all out of my system, I want to start a whole new life somewhere else.</span> <span id="s245">It can't get any worse than it is.</span> <span id="s246">What do I have to lose?</span> <span id="s247">I was able to get the money together.</span> <span id="s248">I got a visa immediately.</span> <span id="s249">I went to the American Consulate in Liverpool and I got the visa immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: What year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: That was in 1947.</span> <span id="s252">And I went in.</span> <span id="s253">After three days, he called me in, the American Ambassador, and he knew more about me than I knew myself.</span> <span id="s254">It's amazing what these people know.</span> <span id="s255">And he says, I wish you good luck in your new home.</span> <span id="s256">And I got the visa and I went to America.</span> <span id="s257">I ended up in New York.</span> <span id="s258">Now, here's the story.</span> <span id="s259">I ended up in New York with three cents in my pocket.</span> <span id="s260">I said to myself, this ________ me down.</span> <span id="s261">I befriended the cook, on the ship, on the Britannic, that one _________ jumped it a couple of years ago.</span> <span id="s262">And I befriended him and when I left the boat he gave me a shoe box.</span> <span id="s263">He said, you'll need it.</span> <span id="s264">Well, I needed it.</span> <span id="s265">He put some food in there for me.</span> <span id="s266">Like roast chicken and hard boiled eggs, milk, sandwiches, and all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s267">And I sat at a dock in New York and I opened up this shoe box and I ate and I said to myself, you know, you had it worse than this.</span> <span id="s268">At least you are a free man.</span> <span id="s269">No body behind you with a gun and a bayonet.</span> <span id="s270">No body behind you threatening to punish you, to beat you, to shoot you, or bury you alive.</span> <span id="s271">At least you breath fresh air, free air.</span> <span id="s272">It's not that bad.</span> <span id="s273">Then I went to a bus and I asked the bus driver where he was going.</span> <span id="s274">He says, he's going to Newark.</span> <span id="s275">I didn't know what Newark was.</span> <span id="s276">I says, I'll go there too.</span> <span id="s277">He looked at me and he said to me, where you come from?</span> <span id="s278">I said, just stepped off the boat.</span> <span id="s279">Do you have money?</span> <span id="s280">I said, yes, three cents.</span> <span id="s281">He laughed at me, he says, get in the back, I'll take you.</span> <span id="s282">Where do you want to get off?</span> <span id="s283">I figured I needed a job.</span> <span id="s284">I needed something.</span> <span id="s285">I had no place to go, no place to sleep, none to eat.</span> <span id="s286">I had to do something to sustain myself.</span> <span id="s287">I said, leave me over there by the gas stations.</span> <span id="s288">In the Eighth Army I was part of a tanker so I knew things about gas.</span> <span id="s289">So he says, all right.</span> <span id="s290">He left me off at the street there.</span> <span id="s291">One gas station after another.</span> <span id="s292">And I went to the first station, I think I went to the second station.</span> <span id="s293">They were two young Jewish guys, partners.</span> <span id="s294">He said to me, why should I give you a job?</span> <span id="s295">I says, I tell you, you should give me a job because I have no money, no place to go.</span> <span id="s296">I just stepped off the boat.</span> <span id="s297">I don't know any body and I need help.</span> <span id="s298">And furthermore, I can change a tire faster than you.</span> <span id="s299">He looked at me, was a nice guy, he looked at me and he says, well, you're good with cars?</span> <span id="s300">I tell you what.</span> <span id="s301">If you have a lot of math, let's see if you can back it up, they give me a chance.</span> <span id="s302">He says, I'll tell you what I'll do.</span> <span id="s303">I'll give you $40 right now, so you can at least get something to eat.</span> <span id="s304">Then, you can sleep in the back of the station.</span> <span id="s305">There's a cot there.</span> <span id="s306">And we'll see tomorrow, get you some papers.</span> <span id="s307">The next day, he came for me, we went to Manhattan and all over the place and got me the papers and whatever I needed.</span> <span id="s308">I don't remember exactly what he did.</span> <span id="s309">He was nice.</span> <span id="s310">That's how I started my day.</span> <span id="s311">Got myself a room in an attic and I worked for him.</span> <span id="s312">After a while I got myself a job in a factory that paid more money.</span> <span id="s313">I was making about $35 or $40 a week, there I was making $60 a week.</span> <span id="s314">And I was the machine maintenance man.</span> <span id="s315">And loaded on the platform, I was loading trucks and I said, this is not for me.</span> <span id="s316">I can do a lot better than that.</span> <span id="s317">And I started looking for schools.</span> <span id="s318">Now here's the first time in my life I went to a school.</span> <span id="s319">When I got thrown out of, back home from the school, I was about 11-years-old, 12-years-old.</span> <span id="s320">That's all the learning I had, I had no other learning.</span> <span id="s321">I went to school and I looked through the papers and I saw watchmaking.</span> <span id="s322">Now, that's not exactly what I wanted.</span> <span id="s323">I always wanted to do surgical instruments, make them.</span> <span id="s324">I'd lost ten years of schooling.</span> <span id="s325">I didn't have near the means nor the time, I was not a young man anymore.</span> <span id="s326">By this time I was 27 or 28-years-old, I have no time.</span> <span id="s327">And this had to be the right move.</span> <span id="s328">I couldn't change any more.</span> <span id="s329">Not moving here, moving there, I had to, that was it.</span> <span id="s330">I go in, I had to do it.</span> <span id="s331">I went to school.</span> <span id="s332">The head instructor looked at me and I saw the blueprints on the wall and people working, around eighty students.</span> <span id="s333">I said, I can never do that.</span> <span id="s334">I could never to that.</span> <span id="s335">And I was on the way out and he grabbed me by the neck and pulled me back, he says, you can do it.</span> <span id="s336">If you say you can do it.</span> <span id="s337">Give it a chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: At that point, how well could you read and write?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: Oh yes, by that time I could read and write in English, I had learned.</span> <span id="s340">Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: You had learned, along the way?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s343">Along the way, picked it up here and there.</span> <span id="s344">In the army I was the only foreigner in the whole outfit, 300 men, I was the only foreigner.</span> <span id="s345">All I could speak was German.</span> <span id="s346">And the guys really helped me.</span> <span id="s347">Whenever they took ____________ they translated it for me.</span> <span id="s348">_____________ table, chair, spoon, fork, eat, meat.</span> <span id="s349">And I use to remember, they use to, it didn't take me long to pick it up.</span> <span id="s350">By the time I picked it up I could have sentences and they were talking to me all the time and, really big help.</span> <span id="s351">I went to that school, it was $80 a month.</span> <span id="s352">I have no $80 a month.</span> <span id="s353">I went to the instructor, I said, look, let's face it, I don't have $80 a month to pay for this, I made $60 a week.</span> <span id="s354">I had to pay all the rent, I had to pay rent by the week.</span> <span id="s355">By the time I pay all my bills, I have no money left to eat.</span> <span id="s356">He said, tell you what.</span> <span id="s357">You take care of the tool grip, take care of the tools at the end of the session, of all the guys, and you can come to school for $40 a month because I can't let you go.</span> <span id="s358">You're good.</span> <span id="s359">I said, you know, I really only want to do surgical instruments.</span> <span id="s360">The course was eighteen months, the watchmaking course.</span> <span id="s361">He says, you told me that, I know, but go through with this.</span> <span id="s362">At least you have something in your hands.</span> <span id="s363">So, I worked.</span> <span id="s364">I started at 7 o'clock in the morning, I got up at 6 o'clock, by 7 o'clock I was at the factory in Kurdy, New Jersey, in the factory.</span> <span id="s365">I worked there until 4 in the afternoon, by 5 o'clock I had to be in school until 10 o'clock at night.</span> <span id="s366">10 o'clock I cleaned everything up, tool grip and everything for the other guys.</span> <span id="s367">There's no subway in Newark.</span> <span id="s368">I'd wait for a bus.</span> <span id="s369">I didn't get home until 1:30 or 2 o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s370">When I get home, I studied books.</span> <span id="s371">I studied books.</span> <span id="s372">Ratios, mathematics, algebra.</span> <span id="s373">You had to know this if you want to be a good watchmaker.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">End of Side 1 of Tape 1</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: You were talking about the hours you were working.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Yeah, and it was not easy because I also forgot how to read.</span> <span id="s377">In the neighborhood, by the grocery store, they use to roast chicken on a rotisserie and after 12 o'clock at night they would give it to me for half price.</span> <span id="s378">Well, that was a sell.</span> <span id="s379">I was a good customer.</span> <span id="s380">Now I wasn't allowed to take any food into my furnished room so I had to put the greasy chicken under my shirt and smuggle it in.</span> <span id="s381">I was good at that anyway, smuggling things in.</span> <span id="s382">And I go upstairs to my room and I sat on the bed and I use to eat the pieces of chicken and a piece of potato that I bought also, old ______, you know, that didn't sell.</span> <span id="s383">And, now how would I refrigerate the rest of it?</span> <span id="s384">There was no refrigerator, so I put a nail on the outside wall of the house and I put the stuff into a cloth and I hang it outside the wall so it should stay fresh somehow.</span> <span id="s385">And I ate that chicken all week.</span> <span id="s386">I was happy to have it.</span> <span id="s387">I was use to this kind of eating anyway, so a piece of bread and a piece of chicken.</span> <span id="s388">So my instructor knew about that and every now and then he would take me out to lunch.</span> <span id="s389">He said, you cannot study on an empty stomach.</span> <span id="s390">And he always knew I had an empty stomach.</span> <span id="s391">So, until you get on you're feet, he says, we will keep you going.</span> <span id="s392">Out of, there we are, three sessions in school, the morning, the afternoon and the night.</span> <span id="s393">Now these were all guys that came out of the GI Bill of Rights.</span> <span id="s394">Now, they didn't ___________, they played flaps in the back, they played cards, just to put in the time and they use to go home.</span> <span id="s395">They didn't really want to be watchmakers.</span> <span id="s396">There were only two guys that really took it serious.</span> <span id="s397">That was another German and me.</span> <span id="s398">After some fourteen months, he called me into the office.</span> <span id="s399">And he said to me, I tell you what.</span> <span id="s400">There's nothing more we can teach you in this school.</span> <span id="s401">Go out into the field.</span> <span id="s402">So, I was scared.</span> <span id="s403">Out into the field, what does that mean?</span> <span id="s404">I'm on my own again.</span> <span id="s405">I wasn't, I was too good to be in school and not good enough to be out in the field.</span> <span id="s406">So he said to me, look, if you get stuck on anything you can always come and ask me, but go out into the field.</span> <span id="s407">He said, I know I'm throwing the puppy out into the woods to fend for itself, but you have to learn to walk on your own two feet and fend for yourself.</span> <span id="s408">And that's the only way I know how to do it.</span> <span id="s409">I know it sounds cruel, it's cruel, but I'm always there for you.</span> <span id="s410">And that's what I did.</span> <span id="s411">I went out into the field.</span> <span id="s412">I got myself a job and what I couldn't do on the job, I would take home.</span> <span id="s413">I had to produce so much and if I didn't produce it they wouldn't keep me.</span> <span id="s414">So what I couldn't produce I would take home and do it at night on my own time.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: Was it hard to get a job?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: No, I was cheap.</span> <span id="s417">As long as they could get me for cheap.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: And where did you work at first?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: I had a job with Ableson Jewelers, the biggest jewelry store in Newark.</span> <span id="s420">And what the foreman let me do is, do little jobs.</span> <span id="s421">___________ stems and __________ and mainsprings and things like that.</span> <span id="s422">Little jobs, and repeat it.</span> <span id="s423">Then he gave me to another, he said, he was all right.</span> <span id="s424">He helped me.</span> <span id="s425">He said, I'm not going to give you complicated jobs, give you easy ones.</span> <span id="s426">And then I walk you over to the difficult jobs.</span> <span id="s427">I said, all right.</span> <span id="s428">And I worked there for two years, after three years I asked for a raise.</span> <span id="s429">And he said to me, you're not good enough to get a raise.</span> <span id="s430">I wanted the fact of a raise.</span> <span id="s431">You're not good enough.</span> <span id="s432">I said, all right, now I'll watch.</span> <span id="s433">And it was a cheap one.</span> <span id="s434">And they were all mass produced.</span> <span id="s435">So I was in the boss's office with the foreman.</span> <span id="s436">I said, do you feel that I am not good enough to get a raise?</span> <span id="s437">I'll tell you what I'll do.</span> <span id="s438">I looked at the foreman's wrist and he had the same cheap watch that I had.</span> <span id="s439">Give me you're watch a second.</span> <span id="s440">He took it off and gave it to me.</span> <span id="s441">I put it on the floor and stepped on it.</span> <span id="s442">I said, can you fix that?</span> <span id="s443">He said, what is that, a joke?</span> <span id="s444">No, it's not a joke.</span> <span id="s445">It's what I said, can you fix it?</span> <span id="s446">He said, no.</span> <span id="s447">I'll take it, tomorrow I'll fix it for you.</span> <span id="s448">I fixed it.</span> <span id="s449">I went to the supply house, got a brand new one, put his band on it, came back the next day.</span> <span id="s450">Here is you're watch.</span> <span id="s451">You mean you fixed that watch?</span> <span id="s452">I said, yup.</span> <span id="s453">You said I'm not good enough.</span> <span id="s454">The boss said, give the man a $10 raise.</span> <span id="s455">As he walked out, the foreman said to me, you son-of-a-gun, I know what you did.</span> <span id="s456">You're a wise guy.</span> <span id="s457">I said, yup, the only way I could get a raise.</span> <span id="s458">The only way.</span> <span id="s459">You got a new watch and I got a raise.</span> <span id="s460">We are both happy.</span> <span id="s461">So, this is how I had to stop on my way through to get a little more money or to get a little more, better situation, get a better room.</span> <span id="s462">Then I started working very hard.</span> <span id="s463">I picked it up and I started working very hard.</span> <span id="s464">Fifteen, eighteen hours a day and started making a little money.</span> <span id="s465">And I liked the touch of money.</span> <span id="s466">It was the first time in my life that I found a little independence with money.</span> <span id="s467">I found out that money gives me independence.</span> <span id="s468">And a full stomach.</span> <span id="s469">I hungered so much in the last ten years that I was forced to make me feel good.</span> <span id="s470">To make me feel good, that I can eat what I want, when I want, how much I want.</span> <span id="s471">And I did better and better.</span> <span id="s472">I got better, I got to be a better watchmaker as time went on.</span> <span id="s473">I got to one job to another, every one was better paying.</span> <span id="s474">I even bought a better job.</span> <span id="s475">I finally became a manager in a big jewelry store and I stayed there for a while.</span> <span id="s476">Then I met my wife.</span> <span id="s477">She was born in New York, Brooklyn, Flushing.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: You talk about how it felt to have money for the first time.</span> <span id="s479">And then, I'm wondering, those first few years in America, or the first years after the war in general, what life was like in general?</span> <span id="s480">Just how you felt about it?</span> <span id="s481">What was the social life like?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: I had no social life.</span> <span id="s483">What social life?</span> <span id="s484">I had no social life.</span> <span id="s485">I never had a social life.</span> <span id="s486">I was always pushed to one place and to another.</span> <span id="s487">I never had, I wasn't in one place long enough to have a social life and the only one's that I met were in my predicament and we were too busy staying alive.</span> <span id="s488">And getting something to eat and getting a __________, no body had time for the other guy.</span> <span id="s489">And all you could talk about was the misery we lived in there.</span> <span id="s490">I had my own misery to live with.</span> <span id="s491">I didn't need anybody else's.</span> <span id="s492">I couldn't take anybody else anymore.</span> <span id="s493">I had enough of my own.</span> <span id="s494">We never had time to make friends.</span> <span id="s495">We were too busy getting someplace.</span> <span id="s496">We were too busy getting someplace and having something and going someplace and accomplishing something.</span> <span id="s497">We didn't know what to do, we had to do, how to go, we had to go, with whom to go.</span> <span id="s498">Once in a while, I have a girlfriend, I would tell her bring me a sandwich, because she knew I was always hungry.</span> <span id="s499">You don't want to see me, you want to see you eat a sandwich.</span> <span id="s500">I said, that's right.</span> <span id="s501">I'm hungry.</span> <span id="s502">It may sound funny, but if you would be in that predicament, you would understand.</span> <span id="s503">No body understands what hunger is until they experience it.</span> <span id="s504">No body understands what thirst is.</span> <span id="s505">No body really understands what it is to be afraid, to be scared.</span> <span id="s506">To want to live and you see that you're going to die.</span> <span id="s507">No body understands that.</span> <span id="s508">I want to go back for a moment, if I may, the way I broke out of jail.</span> <span id="s509">When I was told that I was going to be handed over to the Gestapo and that they are going to shoot me.</span> <span id="s510">It was not a happy thing.</span> <span id="s511">I was scared.</span> <span id="s512">I was frightened.</span> <span id="s513">I was desperate.</span> <span id="s514">Here I was, in confinement.</span> <span id="s515">Here I was in prison and handed over like a scared rabbit.</span> <span id="s516">I'm going to die.</span> <span id="s517">If I'm going to die, I am going to die, I'm going to go down fighting.</span> <span id="s518">I'm not going to go to the slaughter house, inspector.</span> <span id="s519">You know, when you have that kind of life and you run, when you smuggle boarders, when you are going place to place and you're hunted like an animal, you learn things.</span> <span id="s520">And one of the most important things that you learn is to observe.</span> <span id="s521">When you get into a place, the first thing you do, you look around.</span> <span id="s522">You observe.</span> <span id="s523">Where am I and how can I get out?</span> <span id="s524">You learn that very quickly.</span> <span id="s525">When they put me in that cell, I noticed there was a little wall, there were only five cells, there wasn't a front wall, the wall boarded on the street.</span> <span id="s526">And there was a lamp post right in front of the wall.</span> <span id="s527">There was one guard only that marched back and forth outside that wall.</span> <span id="s528">I noticed some nuts.</span> <span id="s529">There was this loose, sealed door where they shove in the pot that you urinate in.</span> <span id="s530">And it was only tied up from the outside with a little wire.</span> <span id="s531">They didn't even have a lock on them.</span> <span id="s532">Well, it opened a bit.</span> <span id="s533">About a half a foot.</span> <span id="s534">Not enough for you to get out but enough to keep you in.</span> <span id="s535">And I went back into the cell.</span> <span id="s536">I had to do two things.</span> <span id="s537">I had to count how many minutes it takes for the guard to make his round.</span> <span id="s538">And how long it would take me to break the wire on the outside by pushing it back and forth, it would crack.</span> <span id="s539">I knew that.</span> <span id="s540">So I had to do two things.</span> <span id="s541">I had to wait for that guard to come around and after he left, I had to work on the wire.</span> <span id="s542">I never forget this.</span> <span id="s543">I worked on the wire, it cracked, I could open it.</span> <span id="s544">I now could open the door, that trap door.</span> <span id="s545">I opened it, crawled out, I was in the court yard.</span> <span id="s546">Surrounded by that little piece of wire which was covered with pieces of glass, sharp glass.</span> <span id="s547">So you cannot get over the wire.</span> <span id="s548">Again, I knew two things.</span> <span id="s549">Get my fellow comrades out of the prison, open the, they had no locks on the outside, they had bolts.</span> <span id="s550">You open the bolt, you could open the door.</span> <span id="s551">I opened all the bolts and let them all know that they are now free if they want to take advantage of it.</span> <span id="s552">I will never forget the look on their faces.</span> <span id="s553">Where will we go?</span> <span id="s554">I said, you want to stay and die that's your business.</span> <span id="s555">At least I give you a chance to get the hell out.</span> <span id="s556">I was a young kid, what was I?</span> <span id="s557">21-years-old.</span> <span id="s558">Skinny, young kid, I jumped over that wall, 1-2-3, and I went in between the pieces of glass and I looked down.</span> <span id="s559">I had to jump onto this lamp post here, it was only a few feet away from the wall.</span> <span id="s560">And I saw the guard down there, going back and forth, and when he turned his back I went the other way.</span> <span id="s561">I jumped on that, I was bleeding, my feet, and my hands were bleeding.</span> <span id="s562">I was going on all fours, I cut myself on the glass.</span> <span id="s563">I jumped on the lamp post, went down, and walked right away so he would not see anybody standing there, that stood there, that didn't stood there before.</span> <span id="s564">These are the things that you learn.</span> <span id="s565">And not run.</span> <span id="s566">Walk.</span> <span id="s567">Although you may be scared to death and frightened and any moment he will call you're name and, hey, where you going?</span> <span id="s568">Where you coming from?</span> <span id="s569">No body said anything but you expect them to say that.</span> <span id="s570">Now you're a hunted animal.</span> <span id="s571">You're a hunted human being.</span> <span id="s572">And I walked away from it.</span> <span id="s573">I still had no place to go.</span> <span id="s574">Now I was in the city, in the town of Nice.</span> <span id="s575">Couldn't speak French.</span> <span id="s576">I had no money, no passport, no papers and no place to go.</span> <span id="s577">You couldn't walk the streets, they catch you.</span> <span id="s578">You couldn't go into a house, the concierge is going to report you.</span> <span id="s579">You couldn't sit on a park bench too long because you would be suspected of something.</span> <span id="s580">The police would ask you, who are you waiting for?</span> <span id="s581">Where are you going?</span> <span id="s582">Where are you coming from?</span> <span id="s583">Where are you going to hide?</span> <span id="s584">Where are you going to get a piece of bread to eat?</span> <span id="s585">Where are you going to stay at night?</span> <span id="s586">They would round up a couple of blocks of the city, put police all around it, and they would go inside and everybody has to show they're identity cards.</span> <span id="s587">I had none.</span> <span id="s588">What was I going to do?</span> <span id="s589">It was a pity now that I was free, I was out of prison, they couldn't hand me over to the Gestapo, where was I going to go?</span> <span id="s590">What was I going to do?</span> <span id="s591">Where was I going to hide?</span> <span id="s592">I now knew that I was a fugitive.</span> <span id="s593">I was a hunted man, I was a wanted man now.</span> <span id="s594">They had a price on my head.</span> <span id="s595">I escaped from prison.</span> <span id="s596">I'm an escapee from jail and I opened up all the cell doors.</span> <span id="s597">They didn't take kindly to this.</span> <span id="s598">I don't know why I knew it, I was caught in a trap and that is how I got into Africa.</span> <span id="s599">They put us into Con-de-aud-ja-lis (ph) and . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: How were you caught?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: This was, rounded people up.</span> <span id="s602">I was in the round up.</span> <span id="s603">He came to me, I had nothing to show them, I had nothing.</span> <span id="s604">I couldn't speak a word of French yet and I had nothing.</span> <span id="s605">They caught a lot of people and they send us to Ard-ju-los-so-mia (ph), a camp.</span> <span id="s606">That's where I saw almost 30,000 men, women and children, in that camp.</span> <span id="s607">And in that camp they had another camp and one tent where they put all of us.</span> <span id="s608">All the guys under 21 years of age.</span> <span id="s609">There were 10-year-olds, 12-year-old, 14-year-olds, 8-year-olds crying for their Mama's.</span> <span id="s610">They gave us one candle that flickered in the dark there and we weren't allowed to go out.</span> <span id="s611">They were going to shoot us the next day, they said.</span> <span id="s612">And they got us outside a few times.</span> <span id="s613">We had to line up and they had people with rifles and we heard the order, shoot.</span> <span id="s614">And they shot over our heads.</span> <span id="s615">They had no intention of shooting us.</span> <span id="s616">We didn't know that.</span> <span id="s617">Finally they called us together, they put us on that boat.</span> <span id="s618">We didn't know where the boat was going to go.</span> <span id="s619">I had no idea.</span> <span id="s620">They chained us all together and they put us on the boat, into a hole, the belly of the boat.</span> <span id="s621">They had the heavy machine gun mounted on top, that pointed at us in case we tried anything, they would shoot us down.</span> <span id="s622">We looked through the openings of the belly of the boat, there was some openings there.</span> <span id="s623">And some guy said we are passing the coast of Spain, we are going to Africa.</span> <span id="s624">We thought they were going to use us as target practice with their planes.</span> <span id="s625">We didn't know.</span> <span id="s626">Again, we were scared, we were frightened.</span> <span id="s627">We are about panicked.</span> <span id="s628">We were shaking.</span> <span id="s629">We didn't know, we were drowning like rats.</span> <span id="s630">Well, what do they intend doing with us?</span> <span id="s631">So we finally got to Algiers.</span> <span id="s632">We were happy we landed.</span> <span id="s633">They put us in the prisons there.</span> <span id="s634">And the attack of famine, the __________ don't know nothing.</span> <span id="s635">They had rats in there the size of cats.</span> <span id="s636">Vultures, the rats, you name it, they had it.</span> <span id="s637">It must have been, maybe, six weeks, seven weeks.</span> <span id="s638">We lost track of time.</span> <span id="s639">We didn't know what day or night, the day of the week, the month.</span> <span id="s640">We lost everything but our senses, and we were close to that.</span> <span id="s641">We kept our senses by knocking on the cell.</span> <span id="s642">The other guy, he answered back and we knew we weren't alone.</span> <span id="s643">They finally took us out and put us in the cattle cars and took us into that hell hole.</span> <span id="s644">Four days in 100 to 110 degree heat.</span> <span id="s645">We were crowded in the cattle cars.</span> <span id="s646">They put maybe four cows or two camels, we were probably 40, 50 people.</span> <span id="s647">People died standing up.</span> <span id="s648">The ones who were dead _________, they threw the water in, opened the door, threw water and some bread.</span> <span id="s649">Few made it.</span> <span id="s650">By the time we got there many had died standing up.</span> <span id="s651">And this heat.</span> <span id="s652">Unbearable heat.</span> <span id="s653">We already felt but when we got out of the cattle cars, now we had to walk maybe 10, 15 miles because that was the last stop of the railroad.</span> <span id="s654">We had to walk to the camp.</span> <span id="s655">And the _________ on horseback would beat us as we, because we were all chained together.</span> <span id="s656">There the French were, chaining you're legs and you're arms to one another.</span> <span id="s657">And the one's that fell we had to drag them along.</span> <span id="s658">And even the ones that were dead, we still had to drag them along.</span> <span id="s659">There was no reason.</span> <span id="s660">We felt already better when we saw the camp from afar.</span> <span id="s661">What was the camp?</span> <span id="s662">Barb wire in a circle and a couple of tents.</span> <span id="s663">I'm now going back a bit.</span> <span id="s664">Because they were really bad times.</span> <span id="s665">And when we got in the camp we stood there for hours.</span> <span id="s666">The camp commander came to us and he says, now listen up.</span> <span id="s667">I have never forgotten what he said.</span> <span id="s668">His name is Kabosh.</span> <span id="s669">He said, you all came here to die.</span> <span id="s670">It's just a matter of time.</span> <span id="s671">Some will live a little longer and some won't.</span> <span id="s672">But you all came here to die.</span> <span id="s673">That is my job and I'm good at my job.</span> <span id="s674">Oh, people cried and people sat there in desperation.</span> <span id="s675">People wanted to die, wanted to kill themselves.</span> <span id="s676">It wasn't a pretty sight.</span> <span id="s677">They told us the next day we start work.</span> <span id="s678">Because the guards saw this, yeah, he's here for the duration . . . of life.</span> <span id="s679">No body gets out of here.</span> <span id="s680">They had about four concentration camps and four or five, I figure, in Algiers.</span> <span id="s681">None were very good.</span> <span id="s682">Ours was considered the worst of them all.</span> <span id="s683">And it was.</span> <span id="s684">I don't know how good the others were, but if ours was the worst, they were very bad.</span> <span id="s685">I tell you, how I survived the two years.</span> <span id="s686">You know, two years, that's a long time.</span> <span id="s687">How I survived that for two years, that hell hole, I will never know.</span> <span id="s688">To this day, I think about all these things, all these experiences, how I survived weeks and weeks in solitary confinement in Algiers, in that dirty prison where we had to lick the walls for a little moisture.</span> <span id="s689">I can't even go into details because it's too cruel.</span> <span id="s690">How I survived the _________ and the hunger and the being so scared and the hiding and the smuggling borders.</span> <span id="s691">And the nights we cried because my mother isn't there.</span> <span id="s692">Nobody was there.</span> <span id="s693">And the desperation, the hopelessness.</span> <span id="s694">How we had the strength to deal with this is beyond my understanding.</span> <span id="s695">And to this day I can't understand this.</span> <span id="s696">It's been fifty years and I'm still living it.</span> <span id="s697">It's like it happened yesterday.</span> <span id="s698">I see in front of me like it happened, I, if there's a way to get it out of my head I will find it.</span> <span id="s699">You can't live with it and you don't live without it.</span> <span id="s700">Can you understand that?</span> <span id="s701">It's there always, all the time.</span> <span id="s702">It's with you.</span> <span id="s703">All that life.</span> <span id="s704">They robbed me of my life.</span> <span id="s705">They robbed me of ten years of the best years of my life.</span> <span id="s706">And then they robbed me for the rest of my life because I'm living with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: After you got out of the camp, how did you remember those experiences?</span> <span id="s708">Did you try to forget about it a little bit for a while, when you came to America?</span> <span id="s709">Did you seek out other people who had had similar experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: No.</span> <span id="s711">It was many years that I couldn't even talk about it.</span> <span id="s712">I couldn't even talk about it.</span> <span id="s713">My wife knows very little to this day.</span> <span id="s714">Because she cannot bear to hear it.</span> <span id="s715">The brutality and the cruelty from this so-called civilized, world community has done to the Jewish people is unbelievable.</span> <span id="s716">She cannot even understand that, she does not want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s717">And I have never really tried to force it on her because it is not fair.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: When did you first talk about it after the war?</span> <span id="s719">Who did you first talk about it with?</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: It took many years.</span> <span id="s721">Maybe thirty-five, thirty-three years before I even mentioned it to anybody.</span> <span id="s722">My children to this day don't know anything about me.</span> <span id="s723">I have a daughter that is educated, a school teacher, very intelligent.</span> <span id="s724">Has a beautiful home, husband, two children.</span> <span id="s725">She knows nothing about me.</span> <span id="s726">My son, 3 years of college, an educated boy, smart.</span> <span id="s727">Very intelligent boy.</span> <span id="s728">He has a picture of the fellow agents, fellow, what you call it?</span> <span id="s729">He's a fellow agent, he's a smart boy.</span> <span id="s730">He doesn't want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s731">He knows nothing about me.</span> <span id="s732">And I say to him, Paul, I have a need to talk.</span> <span id="s733">You want to hear?</span> <span id="s734">He says, oh, that's great, but I really don't want to hear.</span> <span id="s735">When we went to Israel, I'm in the upper sham, my children wouldn't go in.</span> <span id="s736">It shows you, you have to be a special type of a person to understand, to endure this, to be able to talk about it, to be able to discuss it.</span> <span id="s737">That the average person cannot even comprehend.</span> <span id="s738">How do you understand, don't even want to talk about it, don't even want to know about it.</span> <span id="s739">Because it's too cruel, it's too brutal, it's too terrible.</span> <span id="s740">And why should they?</span> <span id="s741">Why should they feel sad, why should they feel pain, why should they feel hurt, like I did.</span> <span id="s742">It was put on me.</span> <span id="s743">I didn't chose this.</span> <span id="s744">I endured it because I wanted to live.</span> <span id="s745">One reason, I wanted to live.</span> <span id="s746">That was the only reason.</span> <span id="s747">Not that I liked it or wanted to do it or wanted to be a hero.</span> <span id="s748">I just wanted to live, I wanted to stay alive.</span> <span id="s749">If I would never have experienced this I wouldn't want to know about this either.</span> <span id="s750">People have told me, go write a book.</span> <span id="s751">A book on what?</span> <span id="s752">On cruelty and brutality?</span> <span id="s753">What the world did to us?</span> <span id="s754">I ask myself, there was so much room in this world to put a few Jews.</span> <span id="s755">Why didn't they?</span> <span id="s756">Look how big countries are, Canada is so big.</span> <span id="s757">Australia.</span> <span id="s758">Whatever you call it, everybody could have taken a few.</span> <span id="s759">Hitler said in a speech in 1937, he said, take the Jews or we'll kill them.</span> <span id="s760">As simple as that.</span> <span id="s761">Take them, we don't want them, you take them or we'll kill.</span> <span id="s762">To the world, he said that.</span> <span id="s763">There was no response.</span> <span id="s764">There was no response, nobody, in fact, not only didn't they respond to it, but they all closed their borders.</span> <span id="s765">They left us . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s766">End of tape 1.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: Let's talk again, let's go back.</span> <span id="s769">Life in the United States, after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: Life in the United States, after, when I got here was very difficult.</span> <span id="s771">There were no such things as help or organizations to help you, do anything for you.</span> <span id="s772">Again, I was alone.</span> <span id="s773">All by myself and I had to make decisions all by myself.</span> <span id="s774">These were different kinds of decisions.</span> <span id="s775">It wasn't decisions of how to fight a war or how to capture the Nazi's or whatever.</span> <span id="s776">This was just, again, how to fight for my daily bread.</span> <span id="s777">I had to fight for something to eat, a place to live and I may not have been chased by anybody but, nevertheless, I had to find a place to sleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: We left off before where you had started to do well in the watchmaking business.</span> <span id="s779">I'm wondering, did you also start to seek out how you felt about religion and Jewish organizations and did you start to search out social groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s781">I had no time for social groups.</span> <span id="s782">And I had lost my belief in God.</span> <span id="s783">I do not believe in God.</span> <span id="s784">I am what they call a traditional Jew.</span> <span id="s785">I'm a Jew, I fight for being a Jew and I die for being a Jew, but I'm not religious.</span> <span id="s786">Religion was taken away from me.</span> <span id="s787">You know, when I left home I went to Italy.</span> <span id="s788">My mother gave me a set-o-thrown (ph), do you know what that is?</span> <span id="s789">A talus, you know what that is?</span> <span id="s790">And she says, this will bring you luck, take it with you.</span> <span id="s791">I got as far as Italy, Milan, and I would talk to it.</span> <span id="s792">I was homeless there, I slept on a park bench and I still have a buddy over there.</span> <span id="s793">I wasn't the only one, there were thousands of us.</span> <span id="s794">And I said, why isn't God helping me?</span> <span id="s795">Really.</span> <span id="s796">I believed in Him.</span> <span id="s797">I went to the Synagogue every Friday and Saturday.</span> <span id="s798">I went to _________, I went to, I did everything I was suppose to do.</span> <span id="s799">We were religious, we had a religious home.</span> <span id="s800">The kosher, religious home.</span> <span id="s801">We celebrated every holiday.</span> <span id="s802">I spoke by the Hebrew and Jewish ___________.</span> <span id="s803">Why isn't He helping me?</span> <span id="s804">And after I had a few days of hunger, I said, He's not going to help me.</span> <span id="s805">No way.</span> <span id="s806">I better, I went ahead and I got very angry and I buried it.</span> <span id="s807">I went into a park and buried it.</span> <span id="s808">I want no part, I said, I want no part of you anymore.</span> <span id="s809">If you're not there when I needed you, I don't need to, I don't want you, and I don't need you.</span> <span id="s810">You're not going to help me, not now, not ever.</span> <span id="s811">I can see that.</span> <span id="s812">Whether you don't see, whether you don't hear, whether you are there, whether you're not there.</span> <span id="s813">There is no God.</span> <span id="s814">I did it in anger.</span> <span id="s815">I was, what, 17-years-old.</span> <span id="s816">And that was the last I ever was religious.</span> <span id="s817">I haven't set foot in the Synagogue, oh yes, last, the first time in 50 years.</span> <span id="s818">Last Yom Kipper.</span> <span id="s819">When I went with my grandson.</span> <span id="s820">My grandson says, Grandpa, come with me to the Synagogue.</span> <span id="s821">And I couldn't deny him this.</span> <span id="s822">I have rather mixed emotions about that.</span> <span id="s823">When I went into the Synagogue with my grandson and I had to cantor and I knew all this by heart still, because I was brought up that way, I said, who are you praying to?</span> <span id="s824">To a God that took away my family?</span> <span id="s825">My home?</span> <span id="s826">My country?</span> <span id="s827">To a God that didn't help me when I needed Him?</span> <span id="s828">To a God that never saw me suffer?</span> <span id="s829">That didn't bring me a drink of water or a piece of bread when I needed it?</span> <span id="s830">What am I doing here?</span> <span id="s831">And, on the other hand, went through my mind, my mother would have wanted me to go.</span> <span id="s832">If my mother was here before me, she would say, son, go.</span> <span id="s833">Go to the Synagogue, it is good for you.</span> <span id="s834">It wasn't good for me, I went, but it wasn't good to me.</span> <span id="s835">Because there is too much pain and too much hurt and too much disappointment in me.</span> <span id="s836">This sense of loss.</span> <span id="s837">There was so much.</span> <span id="s838">Like my three brothers, my three sisters, my mother and my father, I sense of that loss.</span> <span id="s839">And a sense, my whole life, the best years of my life.</span> <span id="s840">I can never get that back.</span> <span id="s841">That I went through what I did and the rest of my life, the memories that I have to live with.</span> <span id="s842">What is that?</span> <span id="s843">What is there for me?</span> <span id="s844">What joy?</span> <span id="s845">What happiness?</span> <span id="s846">In between, I had to work.</span> <span id="s847">I worked fifteen hours a day, not just for the money.</span> <span id="s848">I didn't want to think about it.</span> <span id="s849">Because my mind thinks.</span> <span id="s850">Because if I let my mind go on, I'll go crazy.</span> <span id="s851">I would go out of my mind.</span> <span id="s852">I no longer know what's right, what's wrong, what's good, what's bad.</span> <span id="s853">I no longer know why I feel the way I do.</span> <span id="s854">Many times I don't even understand myself.</span> <span id="s855">Why do I say, the hell with it all.</span> <span id="s856">Start a new life?</span> <span id="s857">How can you do that?</span> <span id="s858">How can you say that?</span> <span id="s859">How can you forget many years of your life?</span> <span id="s860">How can you forget a family?</span> <span id="s861">A home?</span> <span id="s862">I was torn out of a home and put into a world of brutality and cruelty.</span> <span id="s863">A world I did not understand.</span> <span id="s864">Or how to deal with.</span> <span id="s865">____________ ______________?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">How I did it, I can't go on and on, I don't know where to stop and I don't know where to start.</span> <span id="s867">It took me some forty years before I was even able to talk about it.</span> <span id="s868">Sure, I mellowed with time.</span> <span id="s869">I don't have that much hate in me anymore.</span> <span id="s870">Oh, I didn't get merely depressed.</span> <span id="s871">Disappointed.</span> <span id="s872">The anger.</span> <span id="s873">I don't feel that anymore.</span> <span id="s874">I'm numb.</span> <span id="s875">I don't care anymore about my ________.</span> <span id="s876">I have a few more years to go, so what difference does it make, that's what they say.</span> <span id="s877">What difference does it make?</span> <span id="s878">They really don't know, nobody cares.</span> <span id="s879">Write a book about this?</span> <span id="s880">Who would read it?</span> <span id="s881">Who wants to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: You're first years in the U.S., you said you didn't want to talk about this with anyone.</span> <span id="s883">Were there not times when you wanted to seek out people who had similar experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: Never?</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: I didn't want to know, no.</span> <span id="s887">To be honest with you.</span> <span id="s888">I didn't want to, I just wanted to keep busy.</span> <span id="s889">There were people there that I could have talked to, that had similar experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: Did you search out for information on other hands?</span> <span id="s891">What had happened to other people's families, anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s893">I heard about it.</span> <span id="s894">There's one boy that I know and he's in San Francisco.</span> <span id="s895">He is writing a book on it.</span> <span id="s896">He came to see me.</span> <span id="s897">And he gave me a list of people that I knew that he found out about.</span> <span id="s898">So, what good is it?</span> <span id="s899">I knew these people, so what good is it?</span> <span id="s900">So, they died in the meantime, and, whatever, I couldn't come over with him, talk about the misery.</span> <span id="s901">Talk about the cruelty.</span> <span id="s902">Oh yes, we had a meeting in my house.</span> <span id="s903">There must have been maybe a dozen of us.</span> <span id="s904">We were in the same camp at the same time.</span> <span id="s905">Sure, we started to have a talk about it, we remembered.</span> <span id="s906">Then we talked some more.</span> <span id="s907">Then we said good-bye to each other.</span> <span id="s908">So what?</span> <span id="s909">Is that going to bring anybody back that we lost?</span> <span id="s910">Is it going to bring back the, it can't make us feel good.</span> <span id="s911">Feel better.</span> <span id="s912">Not good, better.</span> <span id="s913">So what?</span> <span id="s914">Does it change you're feelings?</span> <span id="s915">You're bitterness?</span> <span id="s916">Against this society that allowed such a thing to happen.</span> <span id="s917">Against the world community that didn't care.</span> <span id="s918">No, I don't see the point.</span> <span id="s919">And I don't see the point in talking to anyone.</span> <span id="s920">I have been talking about this all these years, knowingly or not knowingly, to myself.</span> <span id="s921">I'm tired of talking about it.</span> <span id="s922">Talking to myself.</span> <span id="s923">Not to anybody else.</span> <span id="s924">But I'm tired of talking about it.</span> <span id="s925">I don't want to talk about it to myself anymore.</span> <span id="s926">Once in a while, I say to my grandchildren, I say, when they _______ ________ around, and I know that we died for a _________ ____________.</span> <span id="s927">I say, why?</span> <span id="s928">You mustn't do that.</span> <span id="s929">Do they understand?</span> <span id="s930">Our Jessie, 6-years-old, you don't waste.</span> <span id="s931">Do they know from waste?</span> <span id="s932">They have everything.</span> <span id="s933">What they don't have, I give them.</span> <span id="s934">It's still things, that's with me.</span> <span id="s935">Even with my son.</span> <span id="s936">I say, don't sin for.</span> <span id="s937">He don't want this and he don't want that.</span> <span id="s938">I said, Paulie, don't sin.</span> <span id="s939">Paulie, my little Paulie.</span> <span id="s940">He's 30-years-old, but he's still my little boy.</span> <span id="s941">When he went away, I cried.</span> <span id="s942">When my daughter got married, I hated my son-in-law.</span> <span id="s943">He took away all I had.</span> <span id="s944">He took away my family.</span> <span id="s945">All the family I have is my son and my daughter.</span> <span id="s946">He took away my daughter from me.</span> <span id="s947">I hated him.</span> <span id="s948">I didn't say anything, but he saw it.</span> <span id="s949">And to this day he can't forgive me.</span> <span id="s950">I know I'm going to end up the way I started, with no one.</span> <span id="s951">You see, my wife goes out at nine in the morning, he comes over in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s952">She goes to Brooklyn college, she goes, yes, you have ______________.</span> <span id="s953">My daughter lives in Jersey.</span> <span id="s954">I talk to her a couple of times a week.</span> <span id="s955">My son in Long Island, I talk to him once in a while.</span> <span id="s956">I'm still alone.</span> <span id="s957">And my son left to go to college in Canada.</span> <span id="s958">Carlton University.</span> <span id="s959">I cried.</span> <span id="s960">Is this normal?</span> <span id="s961">He said to my wife, he has to get use to it.</span> <span id="s962">We are not going to stay with him forever.</span> <span id="s963">He has to get use to it, I go to college.</span> <span id="s964">He has to get use to, I'm moving out.</span> <span id="s965">But I never got use to it.</span> <span id="s966">He didn't understand why.</span> <span id="s967">And neither do I. I don't understand why I do what I do, I act the way I do.</span> <span id="s968">I can't let go.</span> <span id="s969">That's all I've got.</span> <span id="s970">And yet, I have to.</span> <span id="s971">So it's, you learn things in the past, you gain, you lose, you have to let go.</span> <span id="s972">But it's not easy.</span> <span id="s973">It's very difficult to be alone.</span> <span id="s974">Here, I am alone, look at this big house.</span> <span id="s975">And I know the inevitable is going to come.</span> <span id="s976">But all the experiences of the past hasn't taught me enough to accept the inevitable.</span> <span id="s977">You understand that?</span> <span id="s978">Nothing.</span> <span id="s979">I have to accept what comes.</span> <span id="s980">Just like in the camps.</span> <span id="s981">I had to accept and adjust.</span> <span id="s982">Whatever came my way.</span> <span id="s983">No food, no food.</span> <span id="s984">No water, no water.</span> <span id="s985">No this, no this.</span> <span id="s986">No liberty, no freedom, no freedom.</span> <span id="s987">I accept.</span> <span id="s988">I can no longer accept anything anymore.</span> <span id="s989">You know the old battle cry?</span> <span id="s990">Issay.</span> <span id="s991">That's French.</span> <span id="s992">Enough.</span> <span id="s993">Enough is enough.</span> <span id="s994">You can accept so much, so many times, so often, that it's enough.</span> <span id="s995">You can't paddle anymore, you're tired.</span> <span id="s996">Tired of fighting, tired of battling, tired of, that is why they call me wishy-washy in my family.</span> <span id="s997">Wishy-washy.</span> <span id="s998">Grandpa's wishy-washy.</span> <span id="s999">Why am I wishy-washy?</span> <span id="s1000">No fight.</span> <span id="s1001">You want it, go take it.</span> <span id="s1002">You want a doll, I buy it for you.</span> <span id="s1003">She has fifteen, I'll buy it for you.</span> <span id="s1004">No, my son wants another car, another car.</span> <span id="s1005">No, that's okay.</span> <span id="s1006">My daughter wants something, fine.</span> <span id="s1007">My wife wants to go here, go here.</span> <span id="s1008">She wants to go there, go there.</span> <span id="s1009">There is no resistance anymore left in me.</span> <span id="s1010">No resistance.</span> <span id="s1011">I'm aware of it, they are not.</span> <span id="s1012">I'm aware of it.</span> <span id="s1013">And I ask myself what has happened to me?</span> <span id="s1014">Is this what this did to me?</span> <span id="s1015">All these years, these bad years?</span> <span id="s1016">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1017">Things are hard to understand, even for me.</span> <span id="s1018">I've been living with it all these years.</span> <span id="s1019">My experiences, I wouldn't even talk about the little details.</span> <span id="s1020">Talking about jumping a lot of, over jumping a lot of details.</span> <span id="s1021">I'm living with it.</span> <span id="s1022">It's like it happened yesterday.</span> <span id="s1023">When I broke out of jail, it's like it happened yesterday.</span> <span id="s1024">Let me go back a ways, to Germany.</span> <span id="s1025">I smuggled myself from Italy into France.</span> <span id="s1026">Before I did this, we got a train and went to Marie-a-sal-amour (ph), I know they're familiar with this area, but it's the border between Italy and France.</span> <span id="s1027">We laid there for four or five days.</span> <span id="s1028">There must have been hundreds of us.</span> <span id="s1029">We couldn't get back into Italy.</span> <span id="s1030">We couldn't get into France, across the borders.</span> <span id="s1031">They called that 'The St. Mora Incident' (ph), nobody knows about it.</span> <span id="s1032">Or very few people know about it.</span> <span id="s1033">I can't forget it.</span> <span id="s1034">Finally, the fishermen, there was a fishing village, a small fishing village, they said, we'll take you around the bend.</span> <span id="s1035">This was where the mountains meet the ocean, we will take you around the bend into the beaches of France.</span> <span id="s1036">If you give us everything you've got.</span> <span id="s1037">Every man, woman and children.</span> <span id="s1038">People did.</span> <span id="s1039">How long can they lay there and starve to death?</span> <span id="s1040">Nobody wanted, nobody helped.</span> <span id="s1041">There were two gun boats, an Italian gun boat on one side and a French gun boat on the other.</span> <span id="s1042">This was just before the war broke out, a few days before the war broke out.</span> <span id="s1043">So people gave them everything they had, errings, their rings, gold, everything.</span> <span id="s1044">It was the, fishermen had a chance to make some easy money.</span> <span id="s1045">They were poverty stricken.</span> <span id="s1046">They never saw any money there.</span> <span id="s1047">They put them on the boats, the boats were old.</span> <span id="s1048">They went out on the ocean, the ocean breakers were high.</span> <span id="s1049">You know, breakers are always high, when they hit the mountains, the rocks.</span> <span id="s1050">They cracked in two.</span> <span id="s1051">They overloaded the boat, they got greedy.</span> <span id="s1052">The boats cracked in two.</span> <span id="s1053">People fell into the water.</span> <span id="s1054">I saw that so I'm sure.</span> <span id="s1055">And you could hear the cries.</span> <span id="s1056">Help us.</span> <span id="s1057">Save us.</span> <span id="s1058">Somebody help, most of them said, God, help us.</span> <span id="s1059">Save us.</span> <span id="s1060">There was the father, the wife and two kids.</span> <span id="s1061">Who do you save?</span> <span id="s1062">The wife can't swim.</span> <span id="s1063">The kids can't swim.</span> <span id="s1064">And the kids are, save me Daddy.</span> <span id="s1065">The other one says, save me Daddy., and the wife was going down.</span> <span id="s1066">And you can't swim.</span> <span id="s1067">The screams and the yells.</span> <span id="s1068">And the people on the boat, we are laughing when that happened.</span> <span id="s1069">They were laughing.</span> <span id="s1070">They didn't put down the boat to save them.</span> <span id="s1071">They could have.</span> <span id="s1072">They were laughing.</span> <span id="s1073">I saw that.</span> <span id="s1074">And the cries of pain and the cries of desperation.</span> <span id="s1075">I hear it to this day.</span> <span id="s1076">To this day, the screams.</span> <span id="s1077">Help me.</span> <span id="s1078">Help us, somebody please help me.</span> <span id="s1079">And nobody helped.</span> <span id="s1080">Nobody saved.</span> <span id="s1081">And the next day the bodies, they are washed ashore.</span> <span id="s1082">In with the tide, hundreds of them, they took on the boats.</span> <span id="s1083">They call that "The St. Mora Incident".</span> <span id="s1084">I was there.</span> <span id="s1085">I saw it.</span> <span id="s1086">You ask me if I believe in God?</span> <span id="s1087">That is when I decided to smuggle into France.</span> <span id="s1088">I couldn't go over the mountain.</span> <span id="s1089">I never climbed a mountain in my life.</span> <span id="s1090">I never saw a mountain in my life.</span> <span id="s1091">The highest mountain I ever saw was the garbage dump in my town.</span> <span id="s1092">I couldn't swim, the breakers, I would drown.</span> <span id="s1093">I couldn't go on the other side, I couldn't go back to Italy.</span> <span id="s1094">There the guards were standing with the rifles.</span> <span id="s1095">I couldn't get into France, they were standing by the borders the other way.</span> <span id="s1096">Where do you go?</span> <span id="s1097">What do you do?</span> <span id="s1098">And there was all of them, not even 18-years-old.</span> <span id="s1099">Never made a decision in my life.</span> <span id="s1100">The first time away from home.</span> <span id="s1101">Where do you go?</span> <span id="s1102">What do you do?</span> <span id="s1103">I had a little kid that turned out to be, he was 12, 13-years-old, he lost his family, running, suddenly he lost his family, he was alone.</span> <span id="s1104">I said to him, you know, if we don't make a move, we are going to die here.</span> <span id="s1105">Nobody came to help us.</span> <span id="s1106">There was a whole wide world out there.</span> <span id="s1107">Nobody cared, nobody gave a damn.</span> <span id="s1108">So we went to the barb wire.</span> <span id="s1109">I said to him, I got smart very quickly, I said, the only way we're going to get out of here are by doing the things that nobody expects us to do.</span> <span id="s1110">By going into France, I tore the barb wire.</span> <span id="s1111">Nobody expects to be that bold.</span> <span id="s1112">And that's what he did.</span> <span id="s1113">He went right through.</span> <span id="s1114">Sure, we got bloody, we got dirty, we were ________ anyway.</span> <span id="s1115">Nobody's going to help us.</span> <span id="s1116">I realized right then and there, I am on my own.</span> <span id="s1117">There is nobody out there in this whole world that's going to give me a hand out to help me.</span> <span id="s1118">If I don't help myself nobody is.</span> <span id="s1119">That's how we got into France.</span> <span id="s1120">And that's how it started.</span> <span id="s1121">The French are a very kind people, you know.</span> <span id="s1122">They were just as cruel and nasty and brutal as the Germans.</span> <span id="s1123">If they could, first of all, you go to jail for a month, four weeks in jail.</span> <span id="s1124">Before they even talk to you.</span> <span id="s1125">That's for causing the politically.</span> <span id="s1126">That's the first thing they do, they throw you in a cell and that's it, you stay there for a month.</span> <span id="s1127">That's just for causing the ____________.</span> <span id="s1128">And then they ask you your name.</span> <span id="s1129">They don't care who you are.</span> <span id="s1130">And these jails in France are not hotels.</span> <span id="s1131">You can take my word for it.</span> <span id="s1132">And then they call you a spy.</span> <span id="s1133">They called me a German spy.</span> <span id="s1134">Seventeen and a half years old, hungry, dirty, with torn clothes, bloody.</span> <span id="s1135">I'm a spy.</span> <span id="s1136">That is the intelligencia of the French police.</span> <span id="s1137">The level of intelligence.</span> <span id="s1138">If I was a German spy I wouldn't look like that, I wouldn't be like that, I wouldn't come in like that.</span> <span id="s1139">There was too much for the intelligence to deal with.</span> <span id="s1140">And then you had endure.</span> <span id="s1141">There was so much you had to endure.</span> <span id="s1142">The whole life was enduring, accepting, dealing with it.</span> <span id="s1143">And you never had a chance.</span> <span id="s1144">You were always the underling, you were always the one that had to deal with it.</span> <span id="s1145">That had to put up with it, that had to accept things.</span> <span id="s1146">You were never on top, you were always on the bottom.</span> <span id="s1147">And today, I have a home and everything I want, everything I need.</span> <span id="s1148">I say to myself, what was this all about?</span> <span id="s1149">How did I do it?</span> <span id="s1150">How did I came out on top?</span> <span id="s1151">You figure that one out.</span> <span id="s1152">That's one for the books, how did I come out on top after all that?</span> <span id="s1153">After being on the bottom all that time.</span> <span id="s1154">I struggled, that's how I came out on top.</span> <span id="s1155">I struggled.</span> <span id="s1156">I did without.</span> <span id="s1157">I didn't ask for anybody's help, I did it myself.</span> <span id="s1158">Even America, it was a struggle for me.</span> <span id="s1159">It took me a good five years until I got out from under.</span> <span id="s1160">It wasn't easy.</span> <span id="s1161">But I've learned enough in my past to deal with my present and there is my future.</span> <span id="s1162">I learned to make decisions, and mostly the right ones.</span> <span id="s1163">I learned to deal with it, without any kind of hesitation, I came my way.</span> <span id="s1164">Mostly I came out on top.</span> <span id="s1165">And that was, not because I'm smart, or super smart.</span> <span id="s1166">It's because my experiences have taught me a lesson, it taught me things.</span> <span id="s1167">You see, when I go out in my car and I go into a strange area or neighborhood, I know my way out because I'm ___________.</span> <span id="s1168">And I know we're building there, and a church there, and a place there, there's a restraunt there, oh, I came in the other way.</span> <span id="s1169">Observing.</span> <span id="s1170">Learning.</span> <span id="s1171">You always learn.</span> <span id="s1172">You keep an open mind.</span> <span id="s1173">You always seem to be doing the right thing now.</span> <span id="s1174">And I say to myself, how come I did all the wrong things in my life before?</span> <span id="s1175">How come?</span> <span id="s1176">I had to learn.</span> <span id="s1177">We all go through school, only the school I went to wasn't the school that you went to.</span> <span id="s1178">And I fought in the underground, in the French underground.</span> <span id="s1179">Let me go buy the ___________.</span> <span

have to fight with?</span> <span id="s1184">We had nothing.</span> <span id="s1185">But somehow we managed, with little, with nothing, we managed.</span> <span id="s1186">And how did we manage?</span> <span id="s1187">By using ingenuity, natural ingenuity.</span> <span id="s1188">Not learn from books.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q: You said there were certain things that you always come back and remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: Any particular details on them?</span> <span id="s1192">Are there a couple of specific details that you always sort

Foreign Legion, the last outpost.</span> <span id="s1194">What they did to us, it was, night's were so bitter cold and we were at the foot of the As-fas (ph) mountains and the cold would come down from the mountains.</span> <span id="s1195">And they would hang us on our arms and hose us down with ice cold water and beat us with the back of their rifles every night, and they use to come in drunk, or they use to be doped up, and that was fun for them.</span> <span id="s1196">Fun, they called that.</span> <span id="s1197">Let's have some fun.</span> <span id="s1198">Things like this for the smallest infraction of the rules.</span> <span id="s1199">The camp commander came in, you saluted him.</span> <span id="s1200">And you, one way he walked by you away, but the other way he wanted,

these feelings and these memories and these experiences and this hurt and this pain for so long, for so many years.</span> <span id="s1329">Once in a while, you think your past is going to come out and you don't let it out because you know that nobody understands it.</span> <span id="s1330">And nobody wants to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">Q: Let me ask you about that because upstairs, in you're office and in you're living room, there are photographs, there are books about the Holocaust and, obviously, it's present in you're life, but you say that you're kids and you're wife don't like to hear about it too much.</span> <span id="s1332">They don't know that much about you're experiences, is that the reason?</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">A: Very little.</span> <span id="s1334">They know very little, and I don't push.</span> <span id="s1335">Why should they know.</span> <span id="s1336">Can they change anything?</span> <span id="s1337">Can anybody make up for what they did?</span> <span id="s1338">I think the world is just as guilty as Germany.</span> <span id="s1339">Can anybody make up for this?</span> <span id="s1340">For these losses?</span> <span id="s1341">The hurt and the pain and the cruelty and the barbaric ways?</span> <span id="s1342">Who can make good?</span> <span id="s1343">Is it enough to say you're sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: Do you're kids ever ask?</span> <span id="s1345">I mean, do you ever, how have you talked about it in the past?</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Q: How has it been brought up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">A: They may know my past but they wouldn't talk about it.</span> <span id="s1349">They may know where I came from, but they don't want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1350">And I don't push it.</span> <span id="s1351">Why should I?</span> <span id="s1352">What good will it do?</span> <span id="s1353">Will anything make up for what the world has done?</span> <span id="s1354">What Hitler did?</span> <span id="s1355">And the Germans?</span> <span id="s1356">And what the world had allowed to do it?</span> <span id="s1357">It's been fifty years.</span> <span id="s1358">People say, enough of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1359">To them, it's enough.</span> <span id="s1360">How can it be enough for the survivors?</span> <span id="s1361">It can never be enough, you can never forget.</span> <span id="s1362">Can you forgive, can you forget?</span> <span id="s1363">Should you forgive, should you forget?</span> <span id="s1364">Who knows.</span> <span id="s1365">Who has the answers?</span> <span id="s1366">They say you only hurt yourself by keeping it alive.</span> <span id="s1367">Would you rather have died?</span> <span id="s1368">You don't know the answer.</span> <span id="s1369">I don't know the answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">Q: Over the last thirty years, have you found it important to talk about it or not talk about it at different times?</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">A: I don't need to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1372">Because I doubt if most will listen.</span> <span id="s1373">And if they listened, what good would it do?</span> <span id="s1374">I look at the things, I look at the photographs, I look at the, between my memories and between the photographs and between the things I write.</span> <span id="s1375">I write poems.</span> <span id="s1376">I wrote more poems than this.</span> <span id="s1377">I have no desire to keep it alive, you have to need to keep it alive.</span> <span id="s1378">That's why you give up talking about it to anyone because nobody wants to know.</span> <span id="s1379">Everyone has their own problems.</span> <span id="s1380">And what could anyone say to make you feel better, tell me that?</span> <span id="s1381">How could anyone make me feel better?</span> <span id="s1382">What could they possibly do or say to say enough is enough?</span> <span id="s1383">What is enough?</span> <span id="s1384">How do you define the word, enough?</span> <span id="s1385">There can never be enough.</span> <span id="s1386">We lost 6 million people, 200,000 children burned alive.</span> <span id="s1387">How is enough, enough?</span> <span id="s1388">I've spent ten, twelve years of my life in misery and suffering.</span> <span id="s1389">How is that enough?</span> <span id="s1390">And the rest of my life having nightmares about it.</span> <span id="s1391">How is enough, enough?</span> <span id="s1392">When my wife gets up in the morning, sometimes she says, she worries about this and worries about that, she doesn't feel good.</span> <span id="s1393">I says, you know, what would you have said in a concentration camp?</span> <span id="s1394">Or we go out to eat and she's eating them like this, and she doesn't see anything she likes and I said, what would you have said in a concentration camp?</span> <span id="s1395">They gave us no menu.</span> <span id="s1396">In fact, they gave us no food.</span> <span id="s1397">What would you have said then?</span> <span id="s1398">Everything I, I connect everything with the camps.</span> <span id="s1399">________________, what would you have said?</span> <span id="s1400">You have a pain, at least you have a doctor to go to.</span> <span id="s1401">What would you have said in a camp, there was no doctor to go to.</span> <span id="s1402">You laid down and died.</span> <span id="s1403">What would you have said then?</span> <span id="s1404">I always seem to be going back to the experiences, for some reason or another.</span> <span id="s1405">So what good is it, where does it get me?</span> <span id="s1406">Instead of me saying, well, we'll go and see a doctor.</span> <span id="s1407">I say to her, what would you have said in the camp?</span> <span id="s1408">It's tough.</span> <span id="s1409">You seem to think that we are tough people.</span> <span id="s1410">We are, age maybe made us a little tough and we are hard people.</span> <span id="s1411">We can absorb and we are able to take hardship and disappointments.</span> <span id="s1412">You're wrong.</span> <span id="s1413">We are just as you and everybody else.</span> <span id="s1414">We laugh, we cry and we remember.</span> <span id="s1415">And we deal with anything that comes our way.</span> <span id="s1416">We have emotions.</span> <span id="s1417">We have feelings, just like anybody else.</span> <span id="s1418">That's just the way it is.</span> <span id="s1419">We have no, there is no way to deal with this.</span> <span id="s1420">This was a bad time.</span> <span id="s1421">There's no way to deal, there are no answers.</span> <span id="s1422">God is not the answer.</span> <span id="s1423">Man is not the answer.</span> <span id="s1424">Revenge is not the answer.</span> <span id="s1425">Make time go back.</span> <span id="s1426">Give me back what was mine.</span> <span id="s1427">Make it happen.</span> <span id="s1428">How else could I be happy?</span> <span id="s1429">People say I never laugh.</span> <span id="s1430">What have I got to laugh about?</span> <span id="s1431">Oh, I have a sense of humor anyway, but what have I really got to laugh about?</span> <span id="s1432">Like they said to me, we want you to live with it.</span> <span id="s1433">I am living with it.</span> <span id="s1434">And I can't get out of it.</span> <span id="s1435">You see, you can't live with it and you can't live without it.</span> <span id="s1436">What's the answer?</span> <span id="s1437">Nothing is going to happen.</span> <span id="s1438">It's never going to get any better.</span> <span id="s1439">Many times, I sit down here, _________________, I'm sitting down here.</span> <span id="s1440">Like this.</span> <span id="s1441">And he says, now, at last God, I didn't believe in you anymore, give me the answers.</span> <span id="s1442">Give me a little happiness.</span> <span id="s1443">Take this sadness away from me, give me a little, let my mind feel a little better, don't give me so much trouble.</span> <span id="s1444">Nothing is happening.</span> <span id="s1445">I can sit here for an hour, two hours, down here.</span> <span id="s1446">And nothing.</span> <span id="s1447">My wife comes up, what are you sitting in a dark room for?</span> <span id="s1448">I say, it's something you don't understand.</span> <span id="s1449">How do you give up on things?</span> <span id="s1450">It's hard.</span> <span id="s1451">It's difficult.</span> <span id="s1452">It's there.</span> <span id="s1453">When you can't find it with all that you had.</span> <span id="s1454">It's been fifty years, maybe more.</span> <span id="s1455">And it's still like it was yesterday.</span> <span id="s1456">But my mother said to me, when I get out of prison.</span> <span id="s1457">I was in prison, in my home town, two or three months, they scooped me up from the side of the street.</span> <span id="s1458">My mother said, ______________, they will come right back.</span> <span id="s1459">Don't stay outside.</span> <span id="s1460">Why we lived in fear?</span> <span id="s1461">I went out to get a loaf of bread, I came back.</span> <span id="s1462">On the way back, a car on the side, they arrested me.</span> <span id="s1463">You're a Jew boy?</span> <span id="s1464">Yes.</span> <span id="s1465">He arrested me.</span> <span id="s1466">I was, what, 16, 17-years old.</span> <span id="s1467">And they threw me in jail.</span> <span id="s1468">I remember.</span> <span id="s1469">Cell Number 10.</span> <span id="s1470">Never forgot it.</span> <span id="s1471">When I got out, my mother got me out.</span> <span id="s1472">I don't know how she did it, she must have paid somebody off.</span> <span id="s1473">We had a great deal of money.</span> <span id="s1474">I remember coming home from prison, the jail.</span> <span id="s1475">My mother is sitting by the door with my little sister in her arms.</span> <span id="s1476">And she said to me, son, here is 10 marks.</span> <span id="s1477">I didn't even get into the house.</span> <span id="s1478">Here is 10 marks, that's all you're allowed to take with you.</span> <span id="s1479">Go to Milan, Italy.</span> <span id="s1480">Why Milan, Italy?</span> <span id="s1481">You didn’t need a passport, they were friends.</span> <span id="s1482">Mussolini and Hitler were friends, that was the only border I could go through.</span> <span id="s1483">Go to Milan, Italy.</span> <span id="s1484">Son, run, son, run, and don't ever look back.</span> <span id="s1485">Those were her last words.</span> <span id="s1486">So I said to her, we will see you again?</span> <span id="s1487">I be back soon.</span> <span id="s1488">I didn't know what is happening to me.</span> <span id="s1489">She says, I doubt it.</span> <span id="s1490">Go, boy.</span> <span id="s1491">Go, son, go.</span> <span id="s1492">Go to the railroad station, here's you're ticket for the train.</span> <span id="s1493">Take the train and go.</span> <span id="s1494">She gave me a little bundle to take _____________.</span> <span id="s1495">And that's what I did.</span> <span id="s1496">And to this day I feel guilty for having left her.</span> <span id="s1497">I should have said to her, Mama, we all go.</span> <span id="s1498">You go, I go, the kids go, we all go, or I don't go.</span> <span id="s1499">I was not even 17, I didn't know.</span> <span id="s1500">Perhaps some kids you could have hidden in the Italian mountains.</span> <span id="s1501">I have all kinds of excuses now, in my mind.</span> <span id="s1502">What you could have, what you could have done, or should have done, or would have done.</span> <span id="s1503">I know somebody would give us a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1504">If we would have gone into Italy, gone into the Italian mountains where nobody would know, very deep in the mountains.</span> <span id="s1505">Perhaps we would have survived.</span> <span id="s1506">Perhaps.</span> <span id="s1507">Perhaps some mountain people would have given us something to eat, would have hidden us.</span> <span id="s1508">That's fifty years later, when you say to yourself, why didn't I do this or why didn't I do that?</span> <span id="s1509">They sacrificed their lives for me.</span> <span id="s1510">And I give them nothing back.</span> <span id="s1511">How do you live with this?</span> <span id="s1512">How do you live with guilt?</span> <span id="s1513">Oh, perhaps some people can.</span> <span id="s1514">I know I can't.</span> <span id="s1515">I've been living with this for fifty years.</span> <span id="s1516">The only way that's going to die is to die with me.</span> <span id="s1517">I've got to tell you.</span> <span id="s1518">It is not easy.</span> <span id="s1519">It is not easy to live with it.</span> <span id="s1520">And now I write poems.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">Q: Have you, since you came to the U.S., have you gone back to Germany, to you're home town?</span> <span id="s1522">To see the house where you grew up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">A: Yes, I went back twice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">Q: And what was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">A: It was not good.</span> <span id="s1526">I went back twice.</span> <span id="s1527">I saw our house, we had a big house.</span> <span id="s1528">Standing, not touched by any bombs or anything.</span> <span id="s1529">People live in it, pay rent to the state, the city or whatever.</span> <span id="s1530">They own it, they say.</span> <span id="s1531">I saw the house.</span> <span id="s1532">I went into the house and it broke my heart.</span> <span id="s1533">The people that answered the door asked me what I wanted.</span> <span id="s1534">I said, if you would allow me I would like to come in and look at the house.</span> <span id="s1535">But the house is not for sale.</span> <span id="s1536">I can tell you that the house is not for sale.</span> <span id="s1537">So, I must have looked strange to them.</span> <span id="s1538">They said, come in.</span> <span id="s1539">I looked, I looked at my bedroom, all the others.</span> <span id="s1540">It broke my heart.</span> <span id="s1541">I walked out.</span> <span id="s1542">I went into the Temple ____________.</span> <span id="s1543">The Temple is abandoned, it never burned out.</span> <span id="s1544">Because it was in a building where people lived so they are afraid to burn down the building, so they never touched it with any fire.</span> <span id="s1545">The woman opened the door, the caretaker.</span> <span id="s1546">The door squeaked.</span> <span id="s1547">I walked in and there was just like I left it.</span> <span id="s1548">The __________ were still in there, hanging there.</span> <span id="s1549">We had the name plates on every seat.</span> <span id="s1550">I was choir boy.</span> <span id="s1551">My name plate was on the choir seat, where the kids would sing with the cantor.</span> <span id="s1552">I stood there, looked.</span> <span id="s1553">My mother's name, my father's name, all there.</span> <span id="s1554">And suddenly the Temple filled with the same people, they are full of people, the same people that I knew.</span> <span id="s1555">All the people.</span> <span id="s1556">And they were praying and I saw them all there.</span> <span id="s1557">I was in the middle of, I was in another world.</span> <span id="s1558">I saw the Temple full of people, until I finally heard the voice from the caretaker, you've been here an hour.</span> <span id="s1559">I have to lock up.</span> <span id="s1560">I went out, I went to the office, where they call the yidda-jig-a-minda (ph), you know what that means?</span> <span id="s1561">The Jewish office, Jewish relation, something like that.</span> <span id="s1562">I said, do you have the file of all the Jews that use to live here?</span> <span id="s1563">Yes, we have most of the files.</span> <span id="s1564">You German's are good at keeping files.</span> <span id="s1565">I looked through the files.</span> <span id="s1566">Where my brother's were shot, left Germany, place unknown.</span> <span id="s1567">Harry Alexander, that's me.</span> <span id="s1568">Left Germany in 1939.</span> <span id="s1569">Place of, where he lives, unknown.</span> <span id="s1570">Never returned.</span> <span id="s1571">Possibly dead.</span> <span id="s1572">That was my file.</span> <span id="s1573">I saw my own file.</span> <span id="s1574">I looked, I said any other Alexander's alive on here?</span> <span id="s1575">He said, no, he doesn't know anyone.</span> <span id="s1576">They either left the country or died.</span> <span id="s1577">I spent about three hours looking through the files, until I found my file.</span> <span id="s1578">So I left, I had nothing more to stay for.</span> <span id="s1579">I looked around the city, all the familiar places I use to grew up.</span> <span id="s1580">And I met a few people.</span> <span id="s1581">They were children then, now they are older people.</span> <span id="s1582">I remember them.</span> <span id="s1583">But that was about all.</span> <span id="s1584">I had a friend here that died.</span> <span id="s1585">I use to be in a concentration camp with him, I met his family.</span> <span id="s1586">And they said, here, they had pictures of me.</span> <span id="s1587">They said, he talked a lot about you.</span> <span id="s1588">The only thing, he was so sorry, always sorry, that he was, you were so young at the camps, that he felt so sorry for you.</span> <span id="s1589">That's what the wife told me.</span> <span id="s1590">____________________.</span> <span id="s1591">I visited his grave, I put flowers on it.</span> <span id="s1592">And then I left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">Q: What's been the best information you've been able to figure out about your own family?</span> <span id="s1594">What happened to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">A: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: You say you think you're sisters might have been at Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">A: Yeah, they were deported to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1598">Some survived, some didn't.</span> <span id="s1599">I have no, I have inquired about all kind of organizations.</span> <span id="s1600">Ah yes, I have crossed you're name with, I have a stack of papers up there even to the ceiling.</span> <span id="s1601">And I haven't stopped.</span> <span id="s1602">I'm still looking.</span> <span id="s1603">Until the day I die I will be looking.</span> <span id="s1604">And I've prayed, just if I find one of my sister's for one day.</span> <span id="s1605">That would make my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">Q: What do you think happened to them?</span> <span id="s1607">Do you image?</span> <span id="s1608">Do you think about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">A: No.</span> <span id="s1610">I imagine many things.</span> <span id="s1611">I hate to think about it.</span> <span id="s1612">My little sisters.</span> <span id="s1613">Maybe they were used in medical, you know, the research by the ___________, could they have been gassed in the gas chambers, could they have been hanged, could they have been buried alive, could they?</span> <span id="s1614">Just the thought, what could have happened that makes me chill, makes me cry.</span> <span id="s1615">Just with what could have happened to them.</span> <span id="s1616">You know, people killed their own children in the camps.</span> <span id="s1617">To keep them from suffering, did you know that?</span> <span id="s1618">What did my mother do, I don't know, maybe __________ her kids already.</span> <span id="s1619">You feel sad, a lot of sadness, a lot of unhappiness.</span> <span id="s1620">And this is the one thing you don't know really how to deal with.</span> <span id="s1621">You just feel that depression, that heavy load on you and you can't get rid of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">Q: How do you think it's effected your own views about your own family and having a family?</span> <span id="s1623">Did you know that you wanted to have a family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">A: Yeah, I wanted a family.</span> <span id="s1625">I only had two children.</span> <span id="s1626">Makes me very possessive.</span> <span id="s1627">I can't let go of them.</span> <span id="s1628">I love them too much.</span> <span id="s1629">I have a lot of love to give.</span> <span id="s1630">I love them too much.</span> <span id="s1631">I see, when I'm in my daughter's house and she yells at the kids, I say, don't yell at them . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">End of tape 2.</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">Q: And we are talking about your own family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">A: Yeah, I am very possessive of them.</span> <span id="s1636">I perhaps am easy-going.</span> <span id="s1637">I love them a great deal.</span> <span id="s1638">And nothing seems to be important, but there were the kids too.</span> <span id="s1639">Don't be so critical.</span> <span id="s1640">In other words, it could always be worse.</span> <span id="s1641">Be happy you have them, be happy they are healthy.</span> <span id="s1642">Be happy they are normal.</span> <span id="s1643">Kids act like kids, that's normal.</span> <span id="s1644">They will spill things, that's normal.</span> <span id="s1645">They will break things, that's normal.</span> <span id="s1646">And always there, I wish I had my sisters.</span> <span id="s1647">They could break everything they want.</span> <span id="s1648">They could do anything they want, I would be happy just to have them.</span> <span id="s1649">And all that you appreciate these things.</span> <span id="s1650">Do you know you have to have a history.</span> <span id="s1651">One day my son came home, now he's with law enforcement, you know?</span> <span id="s1652">But he comes home and he says, guess what happened today?</span> <span id="s1653">I said, what happened?</span> <span id="s1654">Somebody smashed the whole side of my car, brand new car.</span> <span id="s1655">So I said, Paul, what did you do?</span> <span id="s1656">Well, we took his name and in a few minutes the police were there in time with law enforcement, he says, everything was taken care of right away.</span> <span id="s1657">So, come down and look at it.</span> <span id="s1658">I came down and look at this car, the whole side was smashed in.</span> <span id="s1659">So I said, Paul, is that all?</span> <span id="s1660">Are you all right?</span> <span id="s1661">He says, fine.</span> <span id="s1662">I said, is that all?</span> <span id="s1663">No problem.</span> <span id="s1664">We get it fixed.</span> <span id="s1665">You take my car and do you're business and I'll have the car fixed for you.</span> <span id="s1666">We have conditions.</span> <span id="s1667">I take care of it for you.</span> <span id="s1668">He has no time, he works nights, days.</span> <span id="s1669">He said, how can you stand there and tell me that it's all going to be a brand, new car?</span> <span id="s1670">I says, Paul, it's only a car.</span> <span id="s1671">It's not a life.</span> <span id="s1672">He says, doesn't that bother you?</span> <span id="s1673">I said, no.</span> <span id="s1674">Why should it bother me?</span> <span id="s1675">God, it's only if something had happened to you that it would have bothered me.</span> <span id="s1676">This doesn't bother me at all.</span> <span id="s1677">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1678">No problem.</span> <span id="s1679">I went to a guy, no, he'll fix it in three days, I had the adjuster there, car got fixed, looked like new, I picked up the car.</span> <span id="s1680">I says, here Paul.</span> <span id="s1681">He says, it looks like new.</span> <span id="s1682">Wouldn't know anything happened.</span> <span id="s1683">I said, see Paul.</span> <span id="s1684">No big deal.</span> <span id="s1685">So he said to me, is anything a big deal to you?</span> <span id="s1686">I said, Paul, I had a lot of big deals in my life.</span> <span id="s1687">This doesn't compare to my big deals.</span> <span id="s1688">And I survived through big deals.</span> <span id="s1689">He walked away, he said, you are hard to understand.</span> <span id="s1690">I said, maybe so, but if you would give it a little effort, a little try, you'll understand what I mean.</span> <span id="s1691">If you'd had the experiences I had in life, this is not a big deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">Q: So with you're family, you refer to you're experiences a lot?</span> <span id="s1693">But you don't apparently talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">A: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s1695">I refer to them all the time.</span> <span id="s1696">All the time.</span> <span id="s1697">My granddaughter is coming tomorrow, she spills a glass of milk, no problem, don't worry about it.</span> <span id="s1698">I wished I had a glass of milk to spill when I was in the camp.</span> <span id="s1699">I would have licked it off the floor.</span> <span id="s1700">No problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">Q: Do you not think it's important to talk to your family about you're experiences?</span> <span id="s1702">You're kids, you're grandkids?</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">A: No.</span> <span id="s1704">No.</span> <span id="s1705">They get it in the Jewish schools, the Sunday School, they always talk about it, yeah.</span> <span id="s1706">It's not, I don't know, I have mixed feelings about that.</span> <span id="s1707">Why should I, my little grandson is 9-years-old.</span> <span id="s1708">Why should he hear about these things?</span> <span id="s1709">One day I will leave him all my books on the Holocaust, I leave it to my grandson.</span> <span id="s1710">And then it's going to be his decision, to read it or not to read it.</span> <span id="s1711">I want it to be his decision.</span> <span id="s1712">I want him, I want my son to come to me and sit down and say, now, I have time.</span> <span id="s1713">Tell me about you're life.</span> <span id="s1714">I want him to say it, I want it to be his decision, not mine.</span> <span id="s1715">With my daughter, the same.</span> <span id="s1716">I want it to be her decision, not mine.</span> <span id="s1717">If my daughter would come to me and say to me, no telephone, no interruptions, talk to me.</span> <span id="s1718">Daddy, talk to me about you're life.</span> <span id="s1719">Perhaps then, but it has to be her decision, not mine.</span> <span id="s1720">My wife knows very little.</span> <span id="s1721">It was her decision to talk about it, not mine.</span> <span id="s1722">I won't push it on her.</span> <span id="s1723">I have no right to do that.</span> <span id="s1724">I have to live with my life and they have to live with theirs.</span> <span id="s1725">Everybody takes out of life what's important.</span> <span id="s1726">And everybody has to absorb what's not important, or what they think is important.</span> <span id="s1727">It's as simple as that.</span> <span id="s1728">I've lived with my life, it's got to be, that's the way, whether I want it this way or whether it's, I cannot help it or whether I cannot get rid of it.</span> <span id="s1729">It's my life and it's my head, it's my memories, my brain.</span> <span id="s1730">I have to put up with it.</span> <span id="s1731">I have to, I absorbed it, I lived it.</span> <span id="s1732">I did it.</span> <span id="s1733">Why should I forget about it?</span> <span id="s1734">For my own sake?</span> <span id="s1735">I can't.</span> <span id="s1736">How do you forget these things?</span> <span id="s1737">No, it's a very difficult thing.</span> <span id="s1738">I guess we have, we survivors, we all live with guilt, every one of us.</span> <span id="s1739">Why are we living and they are dead?</span> <span id="s1740">You know, the old guilt, the Jewish guilt.</span> <span id="s1741">Why didn't we just die, why didn't we do the other?</span> <span id="s1742">Maybe it would have worked out this way or worked out the other way.</span> <span id="s1743">But that is the way it worked out and that's the way we have to live with.</span> <span id="s1744">Those are our feelings, those are our emotions, those are our lives.</span> <span id="s1745">We are not happy people.</span> <span id="s1746">He didn't kill just 6 million, he killed a hell of a lot more.</span> <span id="s1747">I'm one of the victims.</span> <span id="s1748">Do you think this is a life that I'm living?</span> <span id="s1749">Sure, we eat, we drink, we talk, sometimes.</span> <span id="s1750">We go out, we go take a walk.</span> <span id="s1751">This is life?</span> <span id="s1752">But our minds are still there.</span> <span id="s1753">We still think about it, we still live it.</span> <span id="s1754">We not only think about it, we re-live it.</span> <span id="s1755">Every time.</span> <span id="s1756">Let's go back for a moment, how we went, we were in Dunkirk.</span> <span id="s1757">You've heard of Dunkirk?</span> <span id="s1758">The North of France, on the beach where they shot the ________ into the ocean?</span> <span id="s1759">The last two hours before the German tanks came, the British took their people over, back to England.</span> <span id="s1760">Where was the fairness, they left us alone, they wouldn't take us.</span> <span id="s1761">We ended up on Dunkirk.</span> <span id="s1762">Do yourself a favor.</span> <span id="s1763">Two hours before the German tanks came, you know what they said to us?</span> <span id="s1764">We can't help you anymore.</span> <span id="s1765">Dee-boy-ee-mou (ph).</span> <span id="s1766">You know what that means?</span> <span id="s1767">Help yourself.</span> <span id="s1768">You're free to go.</span> <span id="s1769">You are not under any command anymore.</span> <span id="s1770">We had no guns, old guns that didn't work.</span> <span id="s1771">We had the wrong ammunition with the wrong guns.</span> <span id="s1772">The French.</span> <span id="s1773">Dee-boy-ee-mou (ph).</span> <span id="s1774">Go help yourself.</span> <span id="s1775">Save yourself.</span> <span id="s1776">And we had to run from Dunkirk all the way from the North of France to the South of France.</span> <span id="s1777">On the way we talked German.</span> <span id="s1778">The farmers were going to attack us with their pitch forks because they thought we were the Fifth Column.</span> <span id="s1779">You've heard of the Fifth Column?</span> <span id="s1780">They hated us.</span> <span id="s1781">The Frenchmen attacked us with the pitch forks, the Germans tried to shoot us.</span> <span id="s1782">And the hunger overcame us and we were exhausted from running - a thousand miles.</span> <span id="s1783">I want to tell you, we were so hungry we broke into a chicken house.</span> <span id="s1784">What do we know about chickens?</span> <span id="s1785">We are not farmers.</span> <span id="s1786">And the chickens started to go crazy and we tried to steal a few eggs and the farmer woke up, he came after us with pitch forks.</span> <span id="s1787">We run for our lives.</span> <span id="s1788">This is crazy.</span> <span id="s1789">We can't even steal an egg.</span> <span id="s1790">We run for our lives.</span> <span id="s1791">They would have pitch forked us.</span> <span id="s1792">So we went into the fields and stole grapes, where they were planting grapes.</span> <span id="s1793">We ate the grapes.</span> <span id="s1794">Only one problem, the grapes are covered with insecticide.</span> <span id="s1795">We all were very sick from it.</span> <span id="s1796">These are little incidences that you remember, little things, like yesterday, it's in you're head like yesterday.</span> <span id="s1797">Sometimes you laugh, but it's a bitter laugh.</span> <span id="s1798">Why?</span> <span id="s1799">Why all that?</span> <span id="s1800">Has humanity sunk that low?</span> <span id="s1801">You find a reason why it happened, you find an excuse, you find why the world acted the way it acted.</span> <span id="s1802">Why nobody came to help us.</span> <span id="s1803">Why the Germans did what they did.</span> <span id="s1804">No answers.</span> <span id="s1805">We found the questions, we didn't find the answers.</span> <span id="s1806">So there are many incidences like that.</span> <span id="s1807">We went into Neim (ph), near Nice, about forty miles from Nice.</span> <span id="s1808">There was the headquarters of the underground.</span> <span id="s1809">Somebody gave us away, the guards surrounded us and says, come out with you're hands up.</span> <span id="s1810">We knew they were going to shoot us.</span> <span id="s1811">We were saboteurs, we were underground fighters, we were FFI.</span> <span id="s1812">So the older guy says, you young guys, we were about 18 or 20-year-olds, make it over the fields and we keep them busy.</span> <span id="s1813">Make your way into Nice.</span> <span id="s1814">We'll keep them busy here while you get out.</span> <span id="s1815">There were guys 14-years-old with a pack they could hardly carry.</span> <span id="s1816">Throw me you're guns and run for you're lives.</span> <span id="s1817">We did.</span> <span id="s1818">They were shooting at us, but there were mostly shooting at the other guys.</span> <span id="s1819">They keep them busy so we could get away.</span> <span id="s1820">I never know what happened to these guys.</span> <span id="s1821">If they got away, if they shoot it out with them.</span> <span id="s1822">So what's there in Nice for me?</span> <span id="s1823">I got caught there.</span> <span id="s1824">There was no way you could save yourself unless you had a friend there or somebody to hide you.</span> <span id="s1825">You just couldn't get away from it.</span> <span id="s1826">No matter where you turn, no matter what you did, or what action you took.</span> <span id="s1827">You lost.</span> <span id="s1828">You were a loser.</span> <span id="s1829">You were condemned to be a loser from the day you left home because nobody wanted you and nobody helped you.</span> <span id="s1830">And you had to fight so many odds.</span> <span id="s1831">Just to stay alive.</span> <span id="s1832">I don't know how to explain these things, there are just too many things that go through my head.</span> <span id="s1833">And the miracle, I am alive today.</span> <span id="s1834">A miracle.</span> <span id="s1835">You see how I live.</span> <span id="s1836">I live in the past, I don't live in the present or the future and I can't be rid of it.</span> <span id="s1837">I cannot shake it.</span> <span id="s1838">And somehow I feel good.</span> <span id="s1839">You see, I feel at home in the past.</span> <span id="s1840">Because that's what I know.</span> <span id="s1841">Today I could fight them all because I know how.</span> <span id="s1842">I could outsmart every one of them.</span> <span id="s1843">I could out do or out run or out smart or out play anyone, because I have the experience.</span> <span id="s1844">But it took me a lot of life, a lot of living to get that experience.</span> <span id="s1845">A lot of suffering that I get that experience.</span> <span id="s1846">I laugh out loud sometimes, when my wife asks me, why are you laughing?</span> <span id="s1847">I said, I remember.</span> <span id="s1848">In Nice I use to steal a bread and I wouldn't _________, and the baker could never catch me.</span> <span id="s1849">That was funny for me.</span> <span id="s1850">I look at it now and it's funny.</span> <span id="s1851">I stole a bread.</span> <span id="s1852">And I went to the hide-out and I shared it with another three or four guys.</span> <span id="s1853">We each got a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1854">That was glory to us.</span> <span id="s1855">We won the war.</span> <span id="s1856">We got a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1857">We beat them all.</span> <span id="s1858">We didn't die over self starvation.</span> <span id="s1859">It's funny.</span> <span id="s1860">Hey, guys, come, a piece of bread, we beat them this time.</span> <span id="s1861">And they said, nobody is going to beat them.</span> <span id="s1862">But this time we beat them.</span> <span id="s1863">Next time we worry about it, there will come __________ we worry about it.</span> <span id="s1864">You see, in France, they use to take the big baskets outside the bakery.</span> <span id="s1865">They had the breads in there, long breads outside the store.</span> <span id="s1866">We were hungry.</span> <span id="s1867">We went into the small towns, villages, we saw the bread basket out there, _________ and ____________ walk on, grab two breads, and run like hell.</span> <span id="s1868">Of course, that was a victory.</span> <span id="s1869">There are so many incidents.</span> <span id="s1870">I would walk right up to trees and people scoffed, but I stealed the figs from the trees.</span> <span id="s1871">And then run like hell and they wouldn't catch us.</span> <span id="s1872">We were always scared, always afraid.</span> <span id="s1873">The guards will be able to beat the hell out of you if they catch you.</span> <span id="s1874">But how could we live?</span> <span id="s1875">How could we stay alive?</span> <span id="s1876">How else?</span> <span id="s1877">We didn't worry too much about it in those days, we were young.</span> <span id="s1878">We could run, we were skinny, we could run, we could climb.</span> <span id="s1879">And we had no nerve, brains, we didn't worry about the consequences.</span> <span id="s1880">We knew they couldn't catch us, we were too fast for them.</span> <span id="s1881">We were use to running.</span> <span id="s1882">But that was all we did, running, that was the whole life, then running, grab and run, grab and run.</span> <span id="s1883">Grab something and run.</span> <span id="s1884">That was a life?</span> <span id="s1885">Sleeping under a bride.</span> <span id="s1886">Sleep on a park bench and always one eye open.</span> <span id="s1887">See the cops, make his rounds, he will catch you.</span> <span id="s1888">Sleep in bushes where they couldn't see you.</span> <span id="s1889">That was our existence.</span> <span id="s1890">We never knew what tomorrow's going to be.</span> <span id="s1891">Yesterday is past, today we are still making it, tomorrow we don't know.</span> <span id="s1892">That's how we lived, from day to day.</span> <span id="s1893">Like I said to my Paul, we lived for today, there was no tomorrow.</span> <span id="s1894">That is how we lived.</span> <span id="s1895">And I think about this today and you say, I don't know how I made it.</span> <span id="s1896">And when I look at my son, I say, I think to myself, may you never have to go through, my son, what I have.</span> <span id="s1897">May it never happen to you.</span> <span id="s1898">And I look at my grandchildren, so innocent, so beautiful, so little.</span> <span id="s1899">And I cry.</span> <span id="s1900">My heart gets heavy.</span> <span id="s1901">I look at them, little faces.</span> <span id="s1902">And my little grandson says, Grandpa, you always kiss me.</span> <span id="s1903">Do they understand why?</span> <span id="s1904">My grandson says, let me go, Grandpa.</span> <span id="s1905">I hold him around, no, Grandpa, you've had me 10 minutes already, let me go.</span> <span id="s1906">Does he understand why I can't let him go?</span> <span id="s1907">I'm not just hugging him.</span> <span id="s1908">I hug my sisters.</span> <span id="s1909">I hug my mother.</span> <span id="s1910">I hug my father.</span> <span id="s1911">I hug my life, that I have lost.</span> <span id="s1912">Do they understand, does anybody understand that?</span> <span id="s1913">I can hold my grandchildren and tears come to my eyes.</span> <span id="s1914">Does anybody understand that?</span> <span id="s1915">How do you, __________ things like this.</span> <span id="s1916">It's difficult.</span> <span id="s1917">It's very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">Q: Do you think that there are things that are important to you, and what sort of things were important to you, that may not be important to people who haven't been through what you've been through?</span> <span id="s1919">You said that God isn't important to you, that for a long time friends and socializing wasn't important to you.</span> <span id="s1920">I'm wondering, over the last thirty, however many years, what has been important?</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">A: My children, my wife.</span> <span id="s1922">After having my children, my family.</span> <span id="s1923">That's all.</span> <span id="s1924">I work, my family, my work made me forget my wife.</span> <span id="s1925">I would keep myself busy from 8 in the morning until 1 or 2 o'clock the next morning.</span> <span id="s1926">And when, then I was so tired I would fall into bed and go to sleep.</span> <span id="s1927">I had to be active like that, it was important.</span> <span id="s1928">Before I had children and I was married, it was important to make money, to make a living, to get myself out of the rut.</span> <span id="s1929">To get myself on my feet.</span> <span id="s1930">Once I got married and had the children, my family was important.</span> <span id="s1931">Not even my wife so much, as my children.</span> <span id="s1932">Because they needed me most.</span> <span id="s1933">They are very important to me.</span> <span id="s1934">And that was my whole life, my children.</span> <span id="s1935">I was always the one that was over-protective.</span> <span id="s1936">I was always the one that was always there when they needed me.</span> <span id="s1937">I always was, whether they had the runny nose or whether they had a fever, ache, or whatever it was, I was always there.</span> <span id="s1938">This was my whole life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">Q: Has politics been important?</span> <span id="s1940">Has being Jewish been important?</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1942">I don't care.</span> <span id="s1943">I don't care.</span> <span id="s1944">I know that this world will take care of itself, with or without my help.</span> <span id="s1945">I don't have to help them, carry a gun there.</span> <span id="s1946">They manage very well.</span> <span id="s1947">And about the world?</span> <span id="s1948">I couldn't care less.</span> <span id="s1949">I don't give a damn.</span> <span id="s1950">I care about them that cared about me.</span> <span id="s1951">I am totally indifferent.</span> <span id="s1952">I hardly read the paper.</span> <span id="s1953">I page through it, one-two-three, that's the end of it.</span> <span id="s1954">I couldn't care less.</span> <span id="s1955">They couldn't care when I needed them and I needed them for 10 years, in hell holes.</span> <span id="s1956">They didn't come to my aid.</span> <span id="s1957">There was no country that came to my aid.</span> <span id="s1958">No country sent me a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1959">You know, I wrote a poem.</span> <span id="s1960">May they rot in Hell, all the Kings, all the lands, that would not let us in.</span> <span id="s1961">All the Gods, all the Priests, may the blood never wash off their skin.</span> <span id="s1962">There was no priest, there was no Pope, there was no King, there was no land that opened their border and said, come in, Jews, come in here.</span> <span id="s1963">You'll be safe here.</span> <span id="s1964">Oh, there was room.</span> <span id="s1965">Do you mean to tell me there was no room for 3 million people, all over the world?</span> <span id="s1966">There were 800 people on the St. Louis, that boat that came over here, they wouldn't let them land, they were about to die.</span> <span id="s1967">In America.</span> <span id="s1968">Do you know that?</span> <span id="s1969">Have you read the book on that?</span> <span id="s1970">800 people and they wouldn't let them land in America, 800 people.</span> <span id="s1971">They could have gotten lost in one city block.</span> <span id="s1972">And they went back and they got killed, they died.</span> <span id="s1973">You tell me that's justice?</span> <span id="s1974">You tell me that's humanity?</span> <span id="s1975">You tell me that's compassion, that's pity?</span> <span id="s1976">Oh, I know none of these things.</span> <span id="s1977">No compassion, no pity.</span> <span id="s1978">Yet, I will not pass by a beggar and not give him a dollar.</span> <span id="s1979">I go to 13th Avenue, I will not pass by a little old lady that I think could be my mother and give her $2 or $3 dollars for the ________, poor woman.</span> <span id="s1980">And my wife tells me, you say you have no compassion?</span> <span id="s1981">No, I have no compassion.</span> <span id="s1982">I feel sorry for her, but I have no compassion.</span> <span id="s1983">There's a big difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s1984">Q: What's the difference?</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">A: You don't have to have compassion to be sorry for somebody.</span> <span id="s1986">To give them a couple of dollars if he's hungry, you give a couple, you don't have to care for that person.</span> <span id="s1987">You don't have to care for anything.</span> <span id="s1988">Just to give a couple of dollars, it doesn't mean anything.</span> <span id="s1989">I have it.</span> <span id="s1990">I wouldn't give her one of lungs or one of my kidneys, but I'll give her a couple of dollars.</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">Q: What about being Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">A: Doesn't mean anything to me.</span> <span id="s1993">I don't care.</span> <span id="s1994">Don't you understand?</span> <span id="s1995">I have lost everything that would be in high esteem for anybody else.</span> <span id="s1996">I have lost all that.</span> <span id="s1997">What good is it being Jewish?</span> <span id="s1998">What does that get me?</span> <span id="s1999">Yet, I'll die for it.</span> <span id="s2000">If anybody called me a dirty Jew, I smack him.</span> <span id="s2001">But I don't care about that anymore.</span> <span id="s2002">Jewishness has never done anything for me.</span> <span id="s2003">My mother was Jewish, kosher house, villages, my father, what did it get them?</span> <span id="s2004">What did it get them?</span> <span id="s2005">They have nothing.</span> <span id="s2006">I use to go to the __________ every Friday night, every Saturday morning.</span> <span id="s2007">The whole family went.</span> <span id="s2008">We got dressed up.</span> <span id="s2009">The boys in blue pants and white shirts and the girls in blue skirts and white blouses, that's the Jewish flag, the Jewish colors.</span> <span id="s2010">And we had to, we celebrated every holiday.</span> <span id="s2011">What did it get us?</span> <span id="s2012">What did it get them?</span> <span id="s2013">God saved, God saved the children?</span> <span id="s2014">God protected them?</span> <span id="s2015">What God?</span> <span id="s2016">We are God.</span> <span id="s2017">What God?</span> <span id="s2018">Where was He?</span> <span id="s2019">Oh, I heard people scream, [foreign words], but they would die while they were being killed.</span> <span id="s2020">[Foreign words repeated].</span> <span id="s2021">Where was he?</span> <span id="s2022">Did he hid them?</span> <span id="s2023">In the prison, when I lost my senses, ________, I pray, I said, God help me.</span> <span id="s2024">Send me into the water.</span> <span id="s2025">A piece of bread, anything.</span> <span id="s2026">Take away the loneliness.</span> <span id="s2027">Take it away, never mind food, never mind water, take away the loneliness.</span> <span id="s2028">Lighten my heart, I'm crying.</span> <span id="s2029">Do you think we didn't cry in the prisons?</span> <span id="s2030">We didn't despair?</span> <span id="s2031">We didn't lose hope?</span> <span id="s2032">We didn't want to die?</span> <span id="s2033">How often did I say, God, help me, please.</span> <span id="s2034">Take away the loneliness.</span> <span id="s2035">A piece of bread, a drink of water.</span> <span id="s2036">God, please help me.</span> <span id="s2037">Take me out of here.</span> <span id="s2038">Where was the answer?</span> <span id="s2039">We didn't get any bread.</span> <span id="s2040">He didn't send an angel with a little water.</span> <span id="s2041">He didn't send, he didn't take away the hopelessness.</span> <span id="s2042">He didn't give us courage.</span> <span id="s2043">I said to the Rabbi, he came to my house, he said, come to Shul-high (ph), and I said when you give me the answer to my question, to my satisfaction.</span> <span id="s2044">Give me one good reason why I should go to Shul-high (ph).</span> <span id="s2045">To empty my consciousness of guilt?</span> <span id="s2046">I have done nothing wrong in my life that I have to ask forgiveness.</span> <span id="s2047">God has nothing to forgive me for, but I have plenty to forgive Him for.</span> <span id="s2048">Straighten that out and I'll come to Shul-high (ph).</span> <span id="s2049">Convince me that there is a God and I'll come to Shul-high (ph).</span> <span id="s2050">He said he hasn't got the answers.</span> <span id="s2051">I said, then I don't go to Shul-high (ph).</span> <span id="s2052">Go home and when you come back you give me the answers.</span> <span id="s2053">We are like two adult people, we are intelligent, reasonably intelligent, grown up people.</span> <span id="s2054">There are questions.</span> <span id="s2055">I have gone through a great part of my life and nobody has the answers to why.</span> <span id="s2056">I haven't got the answer and you haven't got the answer, so let's leave it at that.</span> <span id="s2057">I have to live with my life the best I can, and you believe whatever you believe in.</span> <span id="s2058">The only thing I believe in is me.</span> <span

What do you want to know, tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">Q: Well, we were just talking about, we just finished talking about answers and questions.</span> <span id="s2071">I wonder if you have had answers to some of you're question?</span> <span id="s2072">If there's some lessons that you have learned?</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">A: The only lesson I have learned, my friends, is to listen.</span> <span id="s2074">It is the realization that there are no answers.</span> <span id="s2075">There are simply no answers to my questions.</span> <span id="s2076">There is nothing I can change and nobody else is going to change it.</span> <span id="s2077">There's nothing I can do to make my life any easier or to understand, to just understand my life.</span> <span id="s2078">Why and how.</span> <span id="s2079">I realized there are no answers that can change my life.</span> <span id="s2080">After fifty years, I sit down and write poems about the Holocaust, what does that tell you?</span> <span id="s2081">My mind is on it and I can't get rid of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">Q: Is you're mind on it more now than it was, say, twenty years ago?</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">Q: Why is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">A: I was busier twenty years ago.</span> <span id="s2086">I was in the work field.</span> <span id="s2087">I was in the field out working and I was raising my kids.</span> <span id="s2088">The kids were little then, they needed me, and I just was too busy.</span> <span id="s2089">And since I retired, it hit me like a ton of bricks.</span> <span id="s2090">My kids are out.</span> <span id="s2091">You see how quiet it is in the house?</span> <span id="s2092">The whole house, just the two of us.</span> <span id="s2093">And I can't give the house up.</span> <span id="s2094">It's so big, look what we have, we've got here, upstairs.</span> <span id="s2095">I can't give it up, this is where I raised my children.</span> <span id="s2096">This is where I spent a good part of my life, in my memories, and I can't give the house up, I can't move.</span> <span id="s2097">Since I retired, I have no time.</span> <span id="s2098">Some say it's the golden years of you're life, it isn't the golden years.</span> <span id="s2099">Don't you believe it.</span> <span id="s2100">Because that's when everything really comes out.</span> <span id="s2101">Because now you have the time.</span> <span id="s2102">Everything comes out.</span> <span id="s2103">It's not the golden years.</span> <span id="s2104">People say, you make your own golden years.</span> <span id="s2105">That's not true.</span> <span id="s2106">The golden years make you, you don't make the golden years.</span> <span id="s2107">Maybe you don't have, you don't think as much, the years gone by, like I do now.</span> <span id="s2108">But it's with you.</span> <span id="s2109">It was with you all the time.</span> <span id="s2110">It never left you, you know that.</span> <span id="s2111">It never really left you.</span> <span id="s2112">It stayed with you.</span> <span id="s2113">Only you put it in the background.</span> <span id="s2114">You shoved it back.</span> <span id="s2115">I'm busy with the boy now, I'm busy with the girl now, you shove it back.</span> <span id="s2116">I have to take her to school, I have to take him to school, I have to do homework with them and yet, you keep shoving it back until you get so tired, you went to sleep.</span> <span id="s2117">Now you're not tired anymore.</span> <span id="s2118">You don't shove it back anymore.</span> <span id="s2119">It's taken over.</span> <span id="s2120">Now it's all coming out, that you're being punished.</span> <span id="s2121">That you put all this in the back of you're head, all these years, now it's coming out with all the brute force.</span> <span id="s2122">What do you see upstairs?</span> <span id="s2123">My sisters, my mother, the pictures.</span> <span id="s2124">My wife says, why do you have it out?</span> <span id="s2125">Put it away.</span> <span id="s2126">How can you do that?</span> <span id="s2127">They were once part of my life.</span> <span id="s2128">They are still a part of my life.</span> <span id="s2129">They maybe somewhere, wound up surviving, two or three of them, I don't know.</span> <span id="s2130">I just don't know where, I just don't know where to look anymore.</span> <span id="s2131">But why should I put it away?</span> <span id="s2132">It's hard to understand, you can't philosophize.</span> <span id="s2133">You know, all these things, you're whole life, all these years.</span> <span id="s2134">It's with you.</span> <span id="s2135">There is no way you can get out of it.</span> <span id="s2136">It gets a hold of you.</span> <span id="s2137">I don't let go.</span> <span id="s2138">There are sometimes you shake it off and it does not go.</span> <span id="s2139">No matter how hard you shake.</span> <span id="s2140">What else would you like to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">Q: I do wonder, we've talked some about you're life and becoming a watchmaker and life in the United States.</span> <span id="s2142">We didn't talk much about getting married and raising a family and all that, but I'm wondering just in general, if you could quickly talk about if there is anything over the last twenty, thirty years that you think, were decision you made, were things that were directly related or effected by you're experiences during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">A: No, I always took things lightly.</span> <span id="s2144">Because no matter what happens, whether to me, whether to the children, or my wife, no matter what happened, it couldn't have ever been as bad as I had it.</span> <span id="s2145">I could never sink that low anymore, like I did.</span> <span id="s2146">I sank rock bottom.</span> <span id="s2147">This could never happen again.</span> <span id="s2148">As long as there is a piece of bread to eat, a drink of water and a roof over my head.</span> <span id="s2149">It would never be as bad as it was.</span> <span id="s2150">I can always build from there.</span> <span id="s2151">There was nothing I couldn't build.</span> <span id="s2152">I remember stupid things like, in Jaffra and Africa, the logga (ph), I speak German already, the camp.</span> <span id="s2153">We had to go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s2154">Now, you would think, you go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s2155">In the tent, you have to call, Guard?</span> <span id="s2156">Guard would come.</span> <span id="s2157">I have to go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s2158">He always says, put you're hands up and come out.</span> <span id="s2159">And then we had to dig a hole in the ground and you had to kneel down and do it.</span> <span id="s2160">And he stood behind you with a loaded gun.</span> <span id="s2161">He had his finger on the trigger, he could blow you're backside off.</span> <span id="s2162">You went to the bathroom out of being scared.</span> <span id="s2163">If he had a twitch, I've had it, I fall right into the garbage.</span> <span id="s2164">Now, things like this.</span> <span id="s2165">Then, when we got out, once in a while, in the courthouse, I would say, Guard?</span> <span id="s2166">I'm free?</span> <span id="s2167">You always felt that they are walking behind you with a loaded gun.</span> <span id="s2168">It took us a while to get rid of it.</span> <span id="s2169">That is how it takes us so long to get rid of these nightmares.</span> <span id="s2170">You're so use to them, having them, so you say, how did it effect me?</span> <span id="s2171">Nothing effected me.</span> <span id="s2172">If my wife got sick, and the doctor gave bad news, I would say, it isn't as bad as they make it out to be.</span> <span id="s2173">Come, I'll find you someone.</span> <span id="s2174">I will help you.</span> <span id="s2175">I made a few calls, I found someone to help her.</span> <span id="s2176">I went to them, they helped her.</span> <span id="s2177">That was ten years ago, she's fine, for the last ten years.</span> <span id="s2178">Nothing can be as bad.</span> <span id="s2179">I have learned not to take things on a scale, like don't make a big deal out of anything.</span> <span id="s2180">Because nothing could ever happen to me again, what happened to me there.</span> <span id="s2181">Nothing.</span> <span id="s2182">Because I've had the experience to deal with it.</span> <span id="s2183">I've had the experience of fighting it, I had the strength to fight it, and I would never allow this to happen again.</span> <span id="s2184">Now they would have to kill me to get me back into that kind of a situation.</span> <span id="s2185">I would never allow this, from anybody.</span> <span id="s2186">I could save myself now, I could have escaped from Jaffra.</span> <span id="s2187">Sure, I had to go through the desert for two hundred miles.</span> <span id="s2188">One man did it, and he made it.</span> <span id="s2189">Perhaps I would have died in the desert, who the hell knows, maybe a house would have taken me in.</span> <span id="s2190">I don't know.</span> <span id="s2191">That man was Be-gar-bick (ph), so he must have had connections with the outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s2192">Q: So you replay it back in you're mind?</span> <span id="s2193">Thinking about other ways that you might have survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s2194">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2195">The wrong ones, the right ones.</span> <span id="s2196">Where I could have done something, where I couldn't do something.</span> <span id="s2197">Why didn't I do it?</span> <span id="s2198">Why did I do this, why didn't I do that?</span> <span id="s2199">Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2200">Q: Are there other examples of things that, specific instances, details, specific moments or decisions that you regret or wish you had done differently?</span></p> <p><span id="s2201">A: Yeah, decisions.</span> <span id="s2202">I walked over, with the under conductor, the ____________, yeah, just the __________ Rhine.</span> <span id="s2203">I was up there.</span> <span id="s2204">We went up there with donkeys.</span> <span id="s2205">I saw it, nothing but mountains, mountains, mountains, where ever you go there was mountains.</span> <span id="s2206">And we went all the way up there because it took us all day to _______________.</span> <span id="s2207">And then, we had food.</span> <span id="s2208">I said to myself, what the hell.</span> <span id="s2209">There was nobody up there.</span> <span id="s2210">I could have spent the last time there, they wouldn't have caught me.</span> <span id="s2211">There were people, little mountain people, that would live up there.</span> <span id="s2212">They had a cow or two cows, they had the mild, and they had the cheese, they had __________.</span> <span id="s2213">I could have spent the last days there, nobody would have caught me.</span> <span id="s2214">I looked down.</span> <span id="s2215">I said, why in hell didn't I take my sisters up here, we could have spent a lifetime up here.</span> <span id="s2216">When the war would be over, we could have gone down to the end of the mountain again.</span> <span id="s2217">There are many years that my sisters could have lived.</span> <span id="s2218">Once I did it, maybe they were transferred from one camp to another and I was in the back of a truck and I went from ___________ to _____________, and it happened.</span> <span id="s2219">We prayed, and they made the turn, and I jumped out of the truck.</span> <span id="s2220">I jumped out, went down the embankments, and joined the underground.</span> <span id="s2221">I did it.</span> <span id="s2222">Isn't it shocking?</span> <span id="s2223">And I sort of disappeared in the ___________.</span> <span id="s2224">I got away.</span> <span id="s2225">But for how long?</span> <span id="s2226">What were my chances?</span> <span id="s2227">I had no chance.</span> <span id="s2228">I believe if you have a 20/80 chance, a 90/10 chance.</span> <span id="s2229">I had not 1% chance to get away.</span> <span id="s2230">So, what have I gained?</span> <span id="s2231">I was in the woods, in the middle of France with no food and no nothing.</span> <span id="s2232">No clothes, no nothing, freezing.</span> <span id="s2233">What have I accomplished?</span> <span id="s2234">To be free?</span> <span id="s2235">For how long?</span> <span id="s2236">Being frightened and scared every time the wind rushes into the leaves.</span> <span id="s2237">Being scared.</span> <span id="s2238">Huddling in the dirt, in the garbage and the leaves and the bushes.</span> <span id="s2239">What have I accomplished?</span> <span id="s2240">Free?</span> <span id="s2241">For how long?</span> <span id="s2242">Freedom won, at what cost?</span> <span id="s2243">There was no freedom.</span> <span id="s2244">Do you think France is a big country, where you can hide?</span> <span id="s2245">You can't hide.</span> <span id="s2246">There is no place to hide.</span> <span id="s2247">Sooner or later, especially when they're looking for you.</span> <span id="s2248">Once they got to the other camp, they knew they are one man short.</span> <span id="s2249">So the hunt was on.</span> <span id="s2250">So?</span> <span id="s2251">What choice, what chance?</span> <span id="s2252">What could I do?</span> <span id="s2253">Where could I hide?</span> <span id="s2254">And no food.</span> <span id="s2255">And there was no food in sight anywhere.</span> <span id="s2256">You think I was a hunter?</span> <span id="s2257">You think I could kill a fox or a rabbit?</span> <span id="s2258">I wouldn't know how.</span> <span id="s2259">I would know how to eat it.</span> <span id="s2260">No, like you say, I had a difficult time.</span> <span id="s2261">Now, I would know what to do.</span> <span id="s2262">Now, I don't need to do it.</span> <span id="s2263">I could fight now.</span> <span id="s2264">I'm observing, I see things more than others.</span> <span id="s2265">I know things more than others.</span> <span id="s2266">I have intuition now.</span> <span id="s2267">I have feelings, intuitions.</span> <span id="s2268">I can, I feel things.</span> <span id="s2269">I, somehow I know, get out of the way, a truck is going to come through.</span> <span id="s2270">You know, one of these stupid things?</span> <span id="s2271">I have these feelings.</span> <span id="s2272">And I say to my daughter, how can you let Brian go down to the corner, wait for the school bus by himself?</span> <span id="s2273">These things go through my mind.</span> <span id="s2274">Some nut could come and get him.</span> <span id="s2275">Although she sends the dog with him.</span> <span id="s2276">A Rotweiler, a 110 lbs.</span> <span id="s2277">Rotweiler.</span> <span id="s2278">He goes down with him.</span> <span id="s2279">He goes on the bus, the Rotweiler comes back.</span> <span id="s2280">Ha.</span> <span id="s2281">Big.</span> <span id="s2282">So?</span> <span id="s2283">That's what she does now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2284">Q: Are there, we just talked about things you might have done differently.</span> <span id="s2285">Experiences in the war, I'm wondering after the war?</span> <span id="s2286">Is there anything in you're life over the last twenty years?</span></p> <p><span id="s2287">A: Yes, I should have gone to college.</span> <span id="s2288">Big mistake.</span> <span id="s2289">I had the smarts, I had the head, I had a good head.</span> <span id="s2290">I should have gone to college.</span> <span id="s2291">Mistake.</span> <span id="s2292">I reached the heights in my profession.</span> <span id="s2293">I have every, that's as high as I could go, could go no higher.</span> <span id="s2294">But I should have dropped, I should have gone to college.</span> <span id="s2295">I should have taken up engineering.</span> <span id="s2296">That's what I really like to do, mechanical engineering.</span> <span id="s2297">Like I said, at that time I thought I couldn't do it because I didn't have the money, it would take too long and I had to eat.</span> <span id="s2298">Where was I going to get food for me to eat, I had no money to eat.</span> <span id="s2299">Even if it would be a free college, I still would have to eat, pay the rent and clothes, whatever, basic necessities.</span> <span id="s2300">But if I would have had a chance, when I met my wife, I would have sent her out to work and I would have gone to college.</span> <span id="s2301">That's a mistake I made.</span> <span id="s2302">That was the last of the big mistakes.</span> <span id="s2303">It was.</span> <span id="s2304">I mean it.</span> <span id="s2305">I should have gone to college.</span> <span id="s2306">I had the ambition, I had the strength, I had the perserverience, I had the intelligence.</span> <span id="s2307">It may surprise you to know what you, to understand what you have to know being a good watchmaker.</span> <span id="s2308">It may surprise you to know.</span> <span id="s2309">You have to know algebra, mathematics, __________.</span> <span id="s2310">It may surprise you what you have to know as a watchmaker, a good watchmaker.</span> <span id="s2311">I'm not talking about the ____________, I'm talking about the watchmaker's watchmaker.</span> <span id="s2312">When you work on a $10,000 or $15,000 watch, you can't make any mistakes.</span> <span id="s2313">And when you are working on a timepiece that has 400 or 500 pieces in it.</span> <span id="s2314">You can't make a mistake.</span> <span id="s2315">You can't put one upside down because he has to take apart 380 pieces to get back to the bad piece.</span> <span id="s2316">You don't get paid for that.</span> <span id="s2317">Extra work.</span> <span id="s2318">So you have to have a photogenic mind, you have to know exactly where everything goes.</span> <span id="s2319">Take it apart, you have to know every piece, you have 300 or 400 pieces, you have to know it.</span> <span id="s2320">You can't fool around, play no games.</span> <span id="s2321">There are many nights I sat until 3 o'clock in the morning, but I did it.</span> <span id="s2322">Although it wasn't easy.</span> <span id="s2323">If I had put the effort into a college that I put into this trade, I would have made flying colors.</span> <span id="s2324">But I am not sorry.</span> <span id="s2325">You know, I have learned that you cannot be sorry about everything you did wrong in life.</span> <span id="s2326">It happened.</span> <span id="s2327">You can't go back, so what good does it, feeling sorry?</span> <span id="s2328">You just take it the way it is, make the best of what you have.</span> <span id="s2329">If you don't get what you like, you better like what you get.</span> <span id="s2330">It's the old story.</span> <span id="s2331">I made good in my trade.</span> <span id="s2332">I had my own business for 25 years.</span> <span id="s2333">I did well.</span> <span id="s2334">I can't complain.</span> <span id="s2335">I worked hard but I did well.</span> <span id="s2336">I have a nice house, I have a nice, my kids all went to college.</span> <span id="s2337">They all made something out of themselves, whatever they wanted.</span> <span id="s2338">I say to them, you can do whatever you want, but go to college.</span> <span id="s2339">Bring me that piece of paper on the wall.</span> <span id="s2340">You got that piece of paper, you're free.</span> <span id="s2341">I don't care if you're a garbage man, I don't care if you sweep the streets, but bring me that piece of paper on the wall.</span> <span id="s2342">And somehow, there was no argument, they understood.</span> <span id="s2343">What my children understood is that they have to have a Masters.</span> <span id="s2344">That is what I demanded of them.</span> <span id="s2345">No more.</span> <span id="s2346">I said, I'll pay all you're bills, I pay all the college, no problem.</span> <span id="s2347">But bring me that piece of paper.</span> <span id="s2348">Perhaps I'm not educated to this day.</span> <span id="s2349">You understand, I speak and write three, I speak and write three languages, four languages maybe, and I speak and write none.</span> <span id="s2350">You understand that?</span> <span id="s2351">Four and none.</span> <span id="s2352">None good, none right.</span> <span id="s2353">I'm not educated.</span> <span id="s2354">I missed out on that.</span> <span id="s2355">I'm very, I feel very bad about this.</span> <span id="s2356">And I always suspect someone that speaks well educated, that has a nice way about them.</span> <span id="s2357">Sure, my son comes, I don't understand what he's talking about, but I'm happy he's educated.</span> <span id="s2358">He's a college boy.</span> <span id="s2359">My heart is warm, because I may not understand what he's saying, but he's a college boy.</span> <span id="s2360">I said, Paul, what did you just say?</span> <span id="s2361">Write it down.</span> <span id="s2362">I can't say it twice.</span> <span id="s2363">He wouldn't say it twice.</span> <span id="s2364">I don't care if I understand it.</span> <span id="s2365">I have to go to my daughter, say, how do you write 'two'?</span> <span id="s2366">To write out the check. '</span> <span id="s2367">20' or '200' or '2000', how do you write 'two'?</span> <span id="s2368">Two hundred?</span> <span id="s2369">I did that to my daughter.</span> <span id="s2370">She's a school teacher.</span> <span id="s2371">She said, Da, you writing me out a check for 200?</span> <span id="s2372">Well, if that's what you want, I give it to you.</span> <span id="s2373">But she has to tell me how to write 'two' to this day.</span> <span id="s2374">I still don't know.</span> <span id="s2375">I make mistakes.</span> <span id="s2376">I still speak multi languages, some I picked up.</span> <span id="s2377">You see, that's the whole difference.</span> <span id="s2378">I speak them, I go to France, I can speak French.</span> <span id="s2379">But I don't speak French.</span> <span id="s2380">I can write French, but I don't know how to read a French newspaper.</span> <span id="s2381">But I skip words.</span> <span id="s2382">I believe that if I lived there for three months, I would pick it up again.</span> <span id="s2383">I've been out of there for fifty years.</span> <span id="s2384">I ________ German.</span> <span id="s2385">That's high class German, I can understand it.</span> <span id="s2386">And I went to a German school, I just grew up.</span> <span id="s2387">After a few years I was finished.</span> <span id="s2388">I forgot.</span> <span id="s2389">It's fifty years.</span> <span id="s2390">I forgot.</span> <span id="s2391">I don't remember anymore.</span> <span id="s2392">But I'm sorry that I didn't further my education, book-wise.</span> <span id="s2393">And I feel sorry for everyone that doesn't.</span> <span id="s2394">It's a big loss.</span> <span id="s2395">If you can possibly understand how important education is.</span> <span id="s2396">I know.</span> <span id="s2397">I never had it.</span> <span id="s2398">I have to ask my wife sometimes, how do you write this, how do you write that?</span> <span id="s2399">She tells me.</span> <span id="s2400">She spoils me, she tells me.</span> <span id="s2401">I'm not ashamed to ask.</span> <span id="s2402">I have asked my son, you know what he says to me?</span> <span id="s2403">Look it up in the dictionary.</span> <span id="s2404">I say, Paul.</span> <span id="s2405">He says, look it up in the dictionary.</span> <span id="s2406">He won't tell me.</span> <span id="s2407">He wants to make people use the dictionary.</span> <span id="s2408">And I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2409">Q: You said that since you've retired, you've been looking back a lot more than you use to?</span></p> <p><span id="s2410">A: Yeah, a great deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s2411">Q: And I wonder, if it's possible, you have a good family, a good home.</span> <span id="s2412">I wonder if it's possible, even with you're experiences during the war, to look back and say, well, all in all, maybe I've had a good life?</span></p> <p><span id="s2413">A: No, I didn't have a good life.</span> <span id="s2414">I'm happy to be alive, there's a big difference.</span> <span id="s2415">I didn't have a good life.</span> <span id="s2416">How could I have had a good life?</span> <span id="s2417">I struggled the moment I left home.</span> <span id="s2418">Let me tell you something.</span> <span id="s2419">The home I come from, we had three factories and nine stores.</span> <span id="s2420">Big ones.</span> <span id="s2421">We had a factory in South America, in Argentina.</span> <span id="s2422">We had a big factory, we had a big factory in Milan, Italy and a big factory in Ver-bes-pul-rita (ph) in Germany.</span> <span id="s2423">And nine Lodz outlet stores.</span> <span id="s2424">We sold fur coats.</span> <span id="s2425">Would you say we were well-to-do?</span> <span id="s2426">Would you say we had a good deal of money?</span> <span id="s2427">Since I left home, that was it.</span> <span id="s2428">I had, no longer had a good home.</span> <span id="s2429">I came from a well-to-do home, good upbringing.</span> <span id="s2430">Happy surroundings.</span> <span id="s2431">There were always fourteen, fifteen people in our house.</span> <span id="s2432">We always had five, six, seven guests for dinner.</span> <span id="s2433">We always had a big, open house.</span> <span id="s2434">Suddenly that all stopped.</span> <span id="s2435">No, I didn't have a good life.</span> <span id="s2436">I can't look back and say I've had a good life.</span> <span id="s2437">I struggled from the day I left home.</span> <span id="s2438">Until the day I came to America, I was, the struggled never ended.</span> <span id="s2439">I use to go to very good watchmakers, I use to ask them, how do you do this?</span> <span id="s2440">And how many ways can I do that?</span> <span id="s2441">They would do it for me, but they wouldn't tell me how.</span> <span id="s2442">I had to figure it out by myself.</span> <span id="s2443">They wouldn't give away the secret.</span> <span id="s2444">They would do it for me but they wouldn't tell me how to do it.</span> <span id="s2445">So I had to struggle, from the moment I left home, my struggle started and never ended.</span> <span id="s2446">And it never ended, even in America, after I was married.</span> <span id="s2447">Then are the kids in the struggle, how to divide my time between a great deal of work and the children.</span> <span id="s2448">Then finally, finally I stopped, but I stopped making good money.</span> <span id="s2449">I owned my own business 25 years old and the business clicked, took off.</span> <span id="s2450">And when that took off, I say, hey, it's taking off before I knew it.</span> <span id="s2451">I worked for twenty-five stores.</span> <span id="s2452">I did the work for twenty-five stores.</span> <span id="s2453">I had all of Manhattan and Bronx and Brooklyn and Staten Island and Jersey and, tied up and they thought, we'll work him all over the country.</span> <span id="s2454">All over.</span> <span id="s2455">I had so much work I couldn't deal with it.</span> <span id="s2456">I couldn't handle it.</span> <span id="s2457">Piled up, I was choking with work.</span> <span id="s2458">People would have to wait six, seven weeks to get their work back, I had so much work.</span> <span id="s2459">And I did whatever I said when, and it started taking off.</span> <span id="s2460">And I did that for 25 years.</span> <span id="s2461">I'm not complaining about that, but it was a struggle.</span> <span id="s2462">Then I had so much work, I had to work day and night to get it out.</span> <span id="s2463">That was struggle.</span> <span id="s2464">I had no time off.</span> <span id="s2465">I couldn't take off a day.</span> <span id="s2466">I sent my wife to Mexico on a vacation with the two kids and I had to stay home and work.</span> <span id="s2467">I just didn't have the time to go.</span> <span id="s2468">So, it was a struggle.</span> <span id="s2469">You know, there are different kinds of struggles.</span> <span id="s2470">There are struggles for you're life, there are mental struggles, there are psychological struggles.</span> <span id="s2471">There are all kinds of different struggles.</span> <span id="s2472">I use to sit on the bench and work and my mind use to be, then it got to be so good, so fluent.</span> <span id="s2473">I did it automatically.</span> <span id="s2474">The hands just went.</span> <span id="s2475">And then my mind started to wander back again.</span> <span id="s2476">Well, I'm making money, what will we do with it?</span> <span id="s2477">Is it going to help me?</span> <span id="s2478">Is it going to ease my pain?</span> <span id="s2479">Is it going to ease my memories?</span> <span id="s2480">Is it going to take away the bad, the nightmares?</span> <span id="s2481">It didn't.</span> <span id="s2482">And since I retired, my wife doesn't know because I don't talk about it.</span> <span id="s2483">I don't tell her.</span> <span id="s2484">I'm bad off, what does she have to know?</span> <span id="s2485">I do casual conversation, casual things.</span> <span id="s2486">But . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s2487">Q: You don't tell her what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2488">A: Don't tell her anything.</span> <span id="s2489">I don't tell her anything.</span> <span id="s2490">Once in while I come out with it.</span> <span id="s2491">I remember, oh, that's good, cold water.</span> <span id="s2492">I remember I would have given ten years of my life for a glass of water like that.</span> <span id="s2493">And she say, you're starting up again?</span> <span id="s2494">You're back in the desert?</span> <span id="s2495">Oh, you don't know, that's a good sandwich.</span> <span id="s2496">Ah, you remember how you picked up the crumbs?</span> <span id="s2497">I say, yeah.</span> <span id="s2498">You know, pick up the crumbs, years ago, there was a bread, on a tent, one bread for a tent, twenty men, one bread, little bread.</span> <span id="s2499">Twenty men.</span> <span id="s2500">So, one was in charge of dividing it.</span> <span id="s2501">One guy in a tent, every day a different guy, that was allowed to pick up the crumbs that came off the bread as you are cutting it.</span> <span id="s2502">I remember this, I use to pick up a crumb at a time, a crumb at a time.</span> <span id="s2503">So.</span> <span id="s2504">My wife says to me, are you picking up the crumbs again?</span> <span id="s2505">Once in a while I say, you know it slips out, you know, I say, this is a nice, delicious role here.</span> <span id="s2506">Ah, you're thinking about the crumbs you picked up?</span> <span id="s2507">Can you understand that?</span> <span id="s2508">It's the little things that, you know, so many of these little stays in you're head and once in a while it comes out.</span> <span id="s2509">You know, it's, I appreciate the whole roll, not the crumbs.</span> <span id="s2510">Can you understand that?</span> <span id="s2511">I don't know how to explain that, but nobody would understand that.</span> <span id="s2512">No, people will make a joke or forget about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2513">End of tape 3.</span></p> <p><span id="s2514">Tape 4</span></p> <p><span id="s2515">Q: We're continuing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2516">A: Yes, I've been sort of curling into myself, you know?</span> <span id="s2517">I become a recluse, or whatever you call it.</span> <span id="s2518">I'm not a very social guy because there's nothing anybody can tell me that I don't already know.</span> <span id="s2519">Or that I would care to listen to.</span> <span id="s2520">So I like to be by myself.</span> <span id="s2521">You see, my wife goes out at 9 o'clock in the morning, comes back at 3 or 4 o'clock in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s2522">I'm very happy, I'm by myself.</span> <span id="s2523">I go to my daughter's, out in Jersey, she has a big house, a big yard.</span> <span id="s2524">Two acres.</span> <span id="s2525">I take a chair, I go back in the corner under the tree and I sit all by myself.</span> <span id="s2526">[Inaudible].</span> <span id="s2527">She comes to me, she says, what are you doing there by yourself?</span> <span id="s2528">I tell her I'm happy this way.</span> <span id="s2529">I'm very happy being by myself.</span> <span id="s2530">I've reached a stage in my life where I want to be by myself.</span> <span id="s2531">I don't care to be with anybody.</span> <span id="s2532">I can't talk to anybody.</span> <span id="s2533">I want to live in my own little world.</span> <span id="s2534">I want nobody else in this world, my little world.</span> <span id="s2535">I don't care about anybody else's.</span> <span id="s2536">I don't care what's going on out there.</span> <span id="s2537">In here, it's me and me alone.</span> <span id="s2538">So if the world passes me by, that's fine with me.</span> <span id="s2539">It passed me by anyway.</span> <span id="s2540">I'm angry.</span> <span id="s2541">It passed me by anyway.</span> <span id="s2542">And not in a good sense of the word.</span> <span id="s2543">In a bad way.</span> <span id="s2544">My years passed me by, where?</span> <span id="s2545">In the camps, in the prisons, being hunted.</span> <span id="s2546">Eating garbage.</span> <span id="s2547">It passed me by anyway.</span> <span id="s2548">So I don't care.</span> <span id="s2549">I come to a point in my life where I don't care.</span> <span id="s2550">I don't give a damn about anything, anybody, anyway.</span> <span id="s2551">Whatever goes on out there, what ever wars go on, I fought my war to last me a lifetime.</span> <span id="s2552">I fight no more wars for anybody at any time, anywhere.</span> <span id="s2553">I'm not interested.</span> <span id="s2554">You have to understand my feelings.</span> <span id="s2555">I don't care about anybody out there.</span> <span id="s2556">They don't bother me.</span> <span id="s2557">I had my way at my time, that's enough for me.</span> <span id="s2558">I have a hard time enough dealing with what happened to me.</span> <span id="s2559">I don't want to have to deal with anything else that happens on the outside.</span> <span id="s2560">I don't know if you understand what I'm trying to bring across to you.</span> <span id="s2561">Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2562">Q: Is there, I guess again, is there any lesson that you sort of look back and you think, well, this is something, this is what I've concluded about this?</span> <span id="s2563">This is my answer to this.</span> <span id="s2564">This is how I've realized . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s2565">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2566">My answer is minding my own business, living my own life.</span> <span id="s2567">Be with my own little memories, with my good ones and bad ones.</span> <span id="s2568">With my nightmares and my good dreams.</span> <span id="s2569">And just trying to live my life out as best I can.</span> <span id="s2570">I'm seventy-five years old, not much more.</span> <span id="s2571">Allow me to live my life out my way.</span> <span id="s2572">Don't tell me how to live my life, what to do, how to do it, when to do it, where to do it.</span> <span id="s2573">Allow me to live my life out, my years out, my own way, the way I've tried to be happy in, or unhappy in.</span> <span id="s2574">That's all I want.</span></p> <p><span id="s2575">Q: You had said that in the camp in Algeria, you had a friend who would keep you going every day, saying tomorrow we'll get out of here?</span></p> <p><span id="s2576">A: Yes, Max, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2577">Q: I just wondered, then, it was always looking for tomorrow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2578">A: That's the only thing you had to look forward to, tomorrow.</span> <span id="s2579">What else did you have?</span> <span id="s2580">Max Stein was his name.</span> <span id="s2581">I wonder what happened to him.</span> <span id="s2582">He went back to Austria.</span> <span id="s2583">He was an army officer in Austria, a professional soldier.</span> <span id="s2584">And I use to say, Max, we use to look over the wall, right over the desert, and I would say, Max, you know it and I know it.</span> <span id="s2585">I spoke German with him.</span> <span id="s2586">You know we'll never get out, you know that.</span> <span id="s2587">We're here almost 2 years.</span> <span id="s2588">You know we'll never make it.</span> <span id="s2589">Every day we buried people.</span> <span id="s2590">And Max would look at me, he's say, boy, tomorrow is the day.</span> <span id="s2591">You better pack you're things together because tomorrow we'll be liberated.</span> <span id="s2592">The gates will open.</span> <span id="s2593">The allied armies will storm in and free us.</span> <span id="s2594">I would say, Max, you can't be, you're joshing me.</span> <span id="s2595">Remember, I was 19-years-old, 20-years old.</span> <span id="s2596">Max, he was quite a bit older than me, 35, 40.</span> <span id="s2597">He says, tomorrow is going to be the day so get ready.</span> <span id="s2598">Now, I really didn't believe him, but I was afraid not to believe him.</span> <span id="s2599">He put doubt into my mind.</span> <span id="s2600">You know?</span> <span id="s2601">Maybe he's right.</span> <span id="s2602">Maybe tomorrow I will get free.</span> <span id="s2603">And then what will I do with my freedom?</span> <span id="s2604">I said, Max, where will we go when we get out?</span> <span id="s2605">He says, things will take care of themselves.</span> <span id="s2606">You've had places to go.</span> <span id="s2607">I said, Max, we can't go home, we have no home.</span> <span id="s2608">We can't go to our families, we have no families.</span> <span id="s2609">We have no money.</span> <span id="s2610">We have no skills, no trade.</span> <span id="s2611">What are we going to do when we get out?</span> <span id="s2612">Another problem.</span> <span id="s2613">He would say, let's tackle one problem at a time, Max would tell me.</span> <span id="s2614">One at a time, he says, once we get out then we will attack the next one.</span> <span id="s2615">And I said, you know, Max, you better stick with me because you know where you're going, I don't know where I'm going.</span> <span id="s2616">I go where you go.</span> <span id="s2617">And he says, well, you will find your own way.</span> <span id="s2618">And this was it.</span> <span id="s2619">And the day before we got free, a few days before we got free, Max said, you know you're going to get free now, but be yourself mentally.</span> <span id="s2620">What are you going to do with freedom after two years in confinement?</span> <span id="s2621">I said, Max, I think I know where I will go.</span> <span id="s2622">He said, you see, I knew you would do it.</span> <span id="s2623">I knew you would know what to do.</span> <span id="s2624">So a few days later, we were free.</span> <span id="s2625">The gates opened up, the guards were gone.</span> <span id="s2626">And we were afraid to go out.</span> <span id="s2627">We thought, it's a trap.</span> <span id="s2628">We thought, they opened the gates, took away the guards, make us go out and shoot us trying to escape.</span> <span id="s2629">We thought it was a trap they laid there for us.</span> <span id="s2630">We were afraid to leave.</span> <span id="s2631">So the older guys said, nobody leaves the camp.</span> <span id="s2632">We want to know what's going on out there.</span> <span id="s2633">And, sure enough, a few hours later, the troop carriers came, British, and they came to us around the camp and _________________.</span> <span id="s2634">Now you have to picture, from almost 4,000 men, 300 left, for two years.</span> <span id="s2635">330 something.</span> <span id="s2636">And what we wore was a sack with three holes, one for the head, two for the arms.</span> <span id="s2637">That's all we had left at that time to wear.</span> <span id="s2638">Dates, from dates, sticky sacks from dates.</span> <span id="s2639">Full of lice.</span> <span id="s2640">This was sticky, the dates, it was sticky from the dates, you know?</span> <span id="s2641">We hadn't washed them.</span> <span id="s2642">We hadn't taken a bath in 2 years.</span> <span id="s2643">A haircut, a shave, in 2 years.</span> <span id="s2644">So you can picture what we were made of.</span> <span id="s2645">Desperate, skinny.</span> <span id="s2646">And when the Captain looked at us, he says, put down the guns, boys.</span> <span id="s2647">We had Professor, Dr. Pick.</span> <span id="s2648">I had a picture of him.</span> <span id="s2649">He died later.</span> <span id="s2650">He was a Professor, Doctor in the Vienna University.</span> <span id="s2651">He spoke about, I don't know how many languages.</span> <span id="s2652">He stepped forward, an old, tattered man, and he spoke to them in English, what we were.</span> <span id="s2653">He said, I heard him say, boys, put down the guns, get these people out of here.</span> <span id="s2654">And they took us to the hospital, in Ma-son-kava (ph), first came Algiers Hos-in-day (ph), Ma-son-kava (ph) and Fort N-low (ph) and Fort Blanche (ph).</span> <span id="s2655">Fifty years and I haven't forgotten their names yet.</span> <span id="s2656">And at __________ there was a big army hospital, all tents.</span> <span id="s2657">With nurses and people.</span> <span id="s2658">And they took us there.</span> <span id="s2659">The nurses, they were all offices I remember.</span> <span id="s2660">All these things on their shoulders.</span> <span id="s2661">They came, they shook their heads.</span> <span id="s2662">When they unloaded us from the trucks, this is what we looked like.</span> <span id="s2663">We smelled, we stank.</span> <span id="s2664">It was terrible, we were full of lice.</span> <span id="s2665">Oh, they said, get these things off them and put them in the showers.</span> <span id="s2666">We were so skinny, so sick.</span> <span id="s2667">Some couldn't even stand up anymore.</span> <span id="s2668">But they helped us.</span> <span id="s2669">They gave us injections with needles, they took out blood from _________ in the rain, I don't know what they carried on with us.</span> <span id="s2670">We weren't allowed to eat for fear that our stomachs would burst.</span> <span id="s2671">Only the fluids.</span> <span id="s2672">But then in a little, they gave us something to eat.</span> <span id="s2673">It took me no more than three weeks, I was back on my feet.</span> <span id="s2674">I was running around like crazy.</span> <span id="s2675">I was young, I was 21-years-old, you know?</span> <span id="s2676">But the others died, there were 30 or 40 died even after they got out of the camp.</span> <span id="s2677">It came, then Max came to me.</span> <span id="s2678">I was in uniform already.</span> <span id="s2679">He says, Harry, didn't I tell you.</span> <span id="s2680">The day will come.</span> <span id="s2681">The day is here.</span> <span id="s2682">We were ready for duty, he also joined the army, in a different outfit.</span> <span id="s2683">But we met.</span> <span id="s2684">I said, Max, you were right.</span> <span id="s2685">It took 2 years.</span> <span id="s2686">You told me that for a year.</span> <span id="s2687">A little late, but you were right.</span> <span id="s2688">We are free now.</span> <span id="s2689">Now where are we going to go and what are we going to do?</span> <span id="s2690">Fight the war.</span> <span id="s2691">Didn't we already fight the wars?</span> <span id="s2692">In a different way, but it was a war we fought.</span> <span id="s2693">Yeah, he says, we use to sit many times.</span> <span id="s2694">In the evening, after our duty.</span> <span id="s2695">We use to sit and we use to talk.</span> <span id="s2696">I would say, Max, what are you going to do after the war?</span> <span id="s2697">What are we going to do with our lives?</span> <span id="s2698">We have nothing, we have nobody, we have no place to go.</span> <span id="s2699">What's going to happen to us after the war?</span> <span id="s2700">Right now they are giving us three meals a day.</span> <span id="s2701">What's going to be after the war, Max?</span> <span id="s2702">He said, we'll tackle one thing at a time.</span> <span id="s2703">After the war, when we get out of the army.</span> <span id="s2704">Something will happen, you'll find something to do, you'll find someplace to go.</span> <span id="s2705">And he was right.</span> <span id="s2706">I wonder what happened to him.</span> <span id="s2707">He is someplace in Austria.</span> <span id="s2708">If you could get some of these guys together that we spent that time with, that would be nice.</span> <span id="s2709">No?</span> <span id="s2710">We only had it once, but they all went their separate ways.</span> <span id="s2711">And it was always sad, too, because together we talked about all the little things and the big things.</span> <span id="s2712">About the people that died and the little things, the little incidences, little tiny things.</span> <span id="s2713">You know?</span> <span id="s2714">Like eating the crumbs from the bread or you know, we were so many in the tent that we had to lay on our sides.</span> <span id="s2715">We couldn't lay on the back.</span> <span id="s2716">When a bug would bite you, you had scratch, you had to wait for you to scratch.</span> <span id="s2717">The whole tent had to turn around on their other side to make you're scratch, so you could scratch you're side where the bug was.</span> <span id="s2718">And now, it's so funny.</span> <span id="s2719">One guy would yell, everybody turn around on the other side.</span> <span id="s2720">Some guy has to scratch.</span> <span id="s2721">So the whole tent has to turn around on their other side, while we are turning, we scratched.</span> <span id="s2722">Little, stupid things.</span> <span id="s2723">But there were bugs in the ground.</span> <span id="s2724">We slept on the ground, you know?</span> <span id="s2725">There were ants and things, you know, that would bite you.</span> <span id="s2726">Little, stupid things that we use to, that we laugh at now.</span> <span id="s2727">Now it's funny.</span> <span id="s2728">It wasn't funny then.</span> <span id="s2729">It was serious.</span> <span id="s2730">You had to scratch, you can't scratch, it's terrible, you know?</span> <span id="s2731">You get all bitten up.</span> <span id="s2732">And how we walked around in the date sacks.</span> <span id="s2733">They were sticky inside, they were full of ants or full of lice.</span> <span id="s2734">And we had to walk around like this, it was torture.</span> <span id="s2735">Especially the heat.</span> <span id="s2736">When the sun went down on it, they were breeding inside you, that's all you had to wear.</span> <span id="s2737">Now you laugh about it, but it wasn't funny then.</span> <span id="s2738">It was serious.</span> <span id="s2739">And then, the whole, we made jokes.</span> <span id="s2740">We use to say to each other, you, you're never make it.</span> <span id="s2741">And the guy would say back to you, I make it before you.</span> <span id="s2742">And we use to kid around like this, although it was funny then, it was sad.</span> <span id="s2743">It wasn't funny.</span> <span id="s2744">Today, you say, ah, that was a funny thing he said.</span> <span id="s2745">It wasn't really that funny.</span> <span id="s2746">It was sad, it was hard.</span> <span id="s2747">People don't understand these things.</span> <span id="s2748">The little, minor little incidences there.</span> <span id="s2749">We use to get the rotten onion or rotten potato in the soup, the soup, which was warm water.</span> <span id="s2750">We had to scoop up the bugs from the top to get to the soup, we would get cold soup.</span> <span id="s2751">We had to scoop up the, today you laugh, you know?</span> <span id="s2752">We use to say, look at the age of the, you know we ate out of these cans that you buy, vegetables and these cans that you have to open up to get to the, that's what we ate out of.</span> <span id="s2753">You would say, how many bugs you got in there?</span> <span id="s2754">Eight.</span> <span id="s2755">I got twelve.</span> <span id="s2756">Use to make fun of it, who has the most bugs in the, the thing, some, this is disgusting to people, but that was our life.</span> <span id="s2757">Our way of life.</span> <span id="s2758">And we got use to it.</span> <span id="s2759">We thought.</span> <span id="s2760">We never really got use to it, but we said we had to put up with this.</span> <span id="s2761">You had to stay alive.</span> <span id="s2762">You're main objective is to stay alive, no matter what it took.</span> <span id="s2763">Stay alive.</span> <span id="s2764">Two things, stay alive and don't give up hope.</span> <span id="s2765">It was very difficult, not to give up hope under those conditions.</span> <span id="s2766">But staying alive was the important thing.</span> <span id="s2767">You could not allow the luxury of giving up.</span> <span id="s2768">So that's why today, who cares.</span> <span id="s2769">Could it ever be as bad as then?</span> <span id="s2770">Could it ever be as, could I ever sink as low as I did then?</span> <span id="s2771">Ever?</span> <span id="s2772">What could possibly happen in my life that would be as bad as I had it then?</span> <span id="s2773">They say, you go down only one way here, you come up again.</span> <span id="s2774">Nothing could ever happen in my life, nothing, that could ever be as bad as that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2775">Q: And again, maybe the last question, again about leaving your story for you're kids and for you're grandchildren and all that?</span> <span id="s2776">I know you've said that you don't want to tell them unless they ask?</span> <span id="s2777">But I wonder if you feel, like it is important for them to know about you're life?</span></p> <p><span id="s2778">A: Why is it important?</span></p> <p><span id="s2779">Q: I don't know, I wonder if it is important for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2780">A: No.</span> <span id="s2781">Not important.</span> <span id="s2782">Why should it be important?</span> <span id="s2783">Why should my kids be sad?</span> <span id="s2784">Why should my kids have bad feelings, what happened to their father?</span> <span id="s2785">I don't see the purpose.</span> <span id="s2786">That's something that will die with me.</span> <span id="s2787">That was born with me, live with me and die with me.</span> <span id="s2788">Why should they know?</span> <span id="s2789">I feel badly when these books, all the Holocaust books, the whole library I have.</span> <span id="s2790">Leaving that to Brian.</span> <span id="s2791">Why should he go through this?</span> <span id="s2792">I'd just as soon throw them out.</span> <span id="s2793">Why?</span> <span id="s2794">What's the purpose?</span> <span id="s2795">To make them feel bad?</span> <span id="s2796">To make them see what a rotten world it was?</span> <span id="s2797">To make them see what a guilt-ridden, rotten world that allowed something like this to happen?</span> <span id="s2798">To make them lose faith in their existence, in their world that they are living in?</span> <span id="s2799">No, what's the point.</span></p> <p><span id="s2800">Q: And yet it is important for you to keep thinking about this and to keep remembering?</span></p> <p><span id="s2801">A: To me, not for them.</span> <span id="s2802">Yeah, for me.</span> <span id="s2803">Because I lived it.</span> <span id="s2804">That was part of my life.</span> <span id="s2805">It's not part of theirs.</span> <span id="s2806">Yes.</span> <span id="s2807">It's part of my life.</span> <span id="s2808">My family was part of my life, it's not part of theirs.</span> <span id="s2809">They'll never know, my family.</span> <span id="s2810">They'll never know my brothers and sisters, my mother or father.</span> <span id="s2811">They never knew them.</span> <span id="s2812">So why should they mourn them?</span> <span id="s2813">They are passed, God knows where they are, alive or dead.</span> <span id="s2814">Where they are buried, I don't even know to put a flower on their grave.</span> <span id="s2815">Why should they be effected by this?</span> <span id="s2816">What's the purpose?</span> <span id="s2817">Do you see a purpose in that?</span> <span id="s2818">I don't.</span> <span id="s2819">With me, it will die.</span> <span id="s2820">Everything will die with me.</span> <span id="s2821">My experiences, my life, my suffering, my memories, my nightmares.</span> <span id="s2822">Everything will die with me.</span> <span id="s2823">That's going to be, they will bury me and they will bury that with it.</span> <span id="s2824">They will say, oh, he was really a nice guy.</span> <span id="s2825">Poor guy.</span> <span id="s2826">He suffered so much.</span> <span id="s2827">They'll never know how much.</span> <span id="s2828">He suffered so much.</span> <span id="s2829">Maybe he's better off.</span> <span id="s2830">Yes, my friends.</span> <span id="s2831">That's what it is.</span> <span id="s2832">That's what it's all about.</span> <span id="s2833">It's sad.</span> <span id="s2834">What is it they say, my friend?</span> <span id="s2835">We all live with our problems, we all live with our nightmares, our past.</span> <span id="s2836">Some more than others.</span> <span id="s2837">I live with it every day and every night.</span> <span id="s2838">Every free moment I have I sit down here.</span> <span id="s2839">I have made it pretty cozy down here, haven't I?</span> <span id="s2840">I sit down here and I don't put the lights on.</span> <span id="s2841">I put my head back and I re-live my life every now and then.</span> <span id="s2842">A bit at a time, a chapter at a time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2843">Q: Well, thank you very much for re-living part of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2844">A: My pleasure, my friend.</span> <span id="s2845">If somebody can learn from it, just a little bit, like never give up hope.</span> <span id="s2846">Have faith and believe in yourself.</span> <span id="s2847">You'd have it half won.</span></p> <p><span id="s2848">Conclusion of interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s2849">Harry Alexander page \* arabic87</span></p> <p><span id="s2850">October 11, 1995 Page page \*
