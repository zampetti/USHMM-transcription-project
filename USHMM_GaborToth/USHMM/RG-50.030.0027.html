name please?</span> <span id="s13">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s14">My name is Isaac Bitton.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Where and when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: I was born in Lisbon, Portugal, March 31st, 1926.</span> <span id="s17">I was born in the hospital at Hiletia in Lisbon.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: Tell me about your family and about what it was like growing up in your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: My...my mother was born and raised in Farouh in the south of Portugal.</span> <span id="s20">And...uh...most of the Jewish people that came to Portugal towards the end of the 1700s and beginning of the 1800s...uh...settled down in Farouh.</span> <span id="s21">And there was a very large community lodged and relatives over 126 families within approximately 100 years.</span> <span id="s22">By the 1900s they all disappeared so that Portugal...uh...Farouh today is...there is no Jewish life.</span> <span id="s23">But my mother was born there.</span> <span id="s24">She moved to Lisbon with my grandparents which originally came from...uh...uh...Morocco, Spanish Morocco and French Morocco.</span> <span id="s25">Therefore, my name Bitton which is a French, actually a French broken name.</span> <span id="s26">Uh...And of course my mother was married in Lisbon and...uh...we were five brothers and five sisters, 5 boys and 5 girls and...uh...I attended...the uh...the...uh...the schools in...in Lisbon...and...uh...the Jewish school...was a private Jewish school...uh...where we were taught Hebrew so we could...uh...we could read...uh...the prayer books.</span> <span id="s27">Because my family came from a reasonable religious...uh...family.</span> <span id="s28">Not orthodox, but...uh...religious.</span> <span id="s29">And we all had to learn Hebrew and...uh...we did so.</span> <span id="s30">At home my...my grandparents, primarily my grandmother spoke some Spanish and...uh...Lidino actually, and some of the Portuguese.</span> <span id="s31">And...uh...basically, I..</span> <span id="s32">.</span> <span id="s33">I grew up amongst the Jewish community which was very, very small at that time.</span> <span id="s34">There was not much activity amongst the Jew youth.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">There was actually not too many youth in...in Lisbon, Portugal.</span> <span id="s36">And...uh...my oldest brother had actually begun to have some girl friends, not Jewish.</span> <span id="s37">My father was very upset about it and...uh...as I used to go to school to learn Hebrew by...uh...a lady that also was a Moroccan...uh...Jewish teacher, she had in her...uh...living room several pictures of...uh...of...uh...of Israel, of Israel at the time from the wailing wall and others.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">And...uh...I was always impressed by those pictures.</span> <span id="s39">Always!</span> <span id="s40">And that created in me a great desire at the time to...to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s41">Already from a little, early childhood.</span> <span id="s42">And suddenly when the opportunity knocked in 1943, then I went to Israel.</span> <span id="s43">But in the meantime, my Aunt Esther Bitton, my father's sister, used to work at...uh...there was a Portuguese soup kitchen primarily at the time used for the poor...the poor Jews of Lisbon.</span> <span id="s44">And during the second world war, obviously this kitchen became very very influential in assisting the refugees to have one hot meal a day.</span> <span id="s45">And it was there that I really began to...uh...hang around a lot of time simply because I was...uh...I was very impressed by the various languages spoken.</span> <span id="s46">Uh...At the time I spoke Portuguese and a little bit of Spanish, but when you begin to hear Yiddish...lot of...lots of Yiddish...uh...lots of German...uh...Hungarian, Czech.</span> <span id="s47">I remember families from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s48">Uh...I was always very impressed by...by these languages and...and uh...and I used to help...used to help buy...uh...the sitting....the sitting arrangement.</span> <span id="s49">There were probably within the dozen tables...uh...each table would care approximately hundred...10... 10...uh...people so the dining room for the refugees was within...uh...150 persons sitting capacity.</span> <span id="s50">And there was another small dining room which was for the Portuguese...uh...the Portuguese community.</span> <span id="s51">And next to the kitchen, soup kitchen was a Jewish hospital.</span> <span id="s52">I was born in a Jewish hospital.</span> <span id="s53">So was my entire family.</span> <span id="s54">It was a very small hospital, but nevertheless they took care of...uh...of the Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">So...uh...and...uh...it was during this period in history that...uh...one day while I was at the soup kitchen I hear...one family walks in...several children, father and mother...very well dressed, not dressed like a refugee as such...uh...with crumbly clothing, but really very nice and neat...uh...and I..</span> <span id="s56">.</span> <span id="s57">I asked the gentleman.</span> <span id="s58">I said...I fact I told him, "Excuse me.</span> <span id="s59">This...this is for the refugees...this dining room.”</span> <span id="s60">And he said...uh...uh... ... in Portuguese...he said, "But we too are refugees.”</span> <span id="s61">And...uh...I couldn't quite understand it.</span> <span id="s62">I was a teenager at the time, but still...uh...I asked him, "Why is that you are refugee.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">You...you are Portuguese.</span> <span id="s64">How can you be a refugee.”</span> <span id="s65">And...uh...he asked me to sit down.</span> <span id="s66">And it was then that I..</span> <span id="s67">.</span> <span id="s68">I met the very famous...uh...humanitarian, Dr. - who told me that he was the ex-consul of Portugal in Bordeaux, France.</span> <span id="s69">And he went on to tell me that he had been expelled by the Portuguese government simply because he had refused...he...he was asked to refuse to give...uh...uh...visas to the...to the Jewish refugees.</span> <span id="s70">And...uh...as a result, of course, he was removed from his position.</span> <span id="s71">He was disbarred because he was a lawyer by trade also, and removed from the diplomatic corps.</span> <span id="s72">And...uh.</span> <span id="s73">.</span> <span id="s74">I met him in Lisbon at the soup kitchen within...I do not remember exactly if he was 4 or a half a dozen.</span> <span id="s75">We spoke briefly.</span> <span id="s76">He was there in line standing with...uh...family to get his hot meal and...and to date I couldn't...I..</span> <span id="s77">.</span> <span id="s78">I never got out of my mind simply that the.</span> <span id="s79">.</span> <span id="s80">the men of his stature...of his caliber...uh...that had ...had really helped saved lives, was punished in such manner by being removed from...from his...doing his job.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">And...uh...I was very impressed and these image always stayed with me.</span> <span id="s82">Uh...I..</span> <span id="s83">.</span> <span id="s84">I..</span> <span id="s85">.</span> <span id="s86">I don't believe I can really tell you a great deal more about Dr. because I met him such a short few times.</span> <span id="s87">But I remember portions of the family.</span> <span id="s88">And...uh...uh...I remember the...the refugees primarily more so that were there in most cases because they were the fortunate ones that had received visas by Dr. in Bordeaux, France.</span> <span id="s89">Uh...I remember a family by the name of Deutsch, father, mother and two children who...they set up a shop in the most busy street in Lisbon which is called the Sheadu.</span> <span id="s90">In fact, it was burned out recently.</span> <span id="s91">Was on the portions of the city that was burned...ancient part of the Lisbon.</span> <span id="s92">And...uh... Mr.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Deutsch used to put...uh...a table about maybe 3 by 3 and used to sell razor blades and other little things.</span> <span id="s94">And I help him bring them to the areas.</span> <span id="s95">I used to help also to bring the refugees to some...some new residences since they were not quite familiar with Lisbon and I was quite familiar with Lisbon.</span> <span id="s96">Uh...There was another family...uh...by the name of Goostave Zumich...Zumich.</span> <span id="s97">He was from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s98">Uh...Uh...He was a shoemaker, and he set up shop...uh...at the soup kitchen, one of the corners.</span> <span id="s99">And there he would repair the shoes from the refugees.</span> <span id="s100">And...uh...I remember Mr. Brown who was also a German Jew who...uh...was the liaison between the refugees and the Jewish...uh...Portuguese community.</span> <span id="s101">He was in charge of... uh...uh...helping them to...uh...go and...uh...he was the one that would ask me at times, why...why don't you show this person where such and such a street is and so forth and so on.</span> <span id="s102">And...uh...I remember a family by the name of, I believe Grallman, who...uh...uh...whose lady had...uh...uh... a very small little girl, a child, but she became quite ill.</span> <span id="s103">She was hospitalized in Lisbon....uh... for I believe was mental stress.</span> <span id="s104">And my Aunt Esther, God bless her soul, took care of her daughter for a given period of time and for as long as she was hospitalized prior to moving to Israel.</span> <span id="s105">Later on, since we traveled on the same ship to Israel...uh...the family asked me to join their own family in Nahariyya in a little farm, which I did.</span> <span id="s106">That's how come I arrived in Nahariyya.</span> <span id="s107">It was through the Grallman family.</span> <span id="s108">And...uh...basically...uh...sometimes when I remember of the...uh...the...uh...the incidences...you know, you are a young man and...uh...up to that point in time in history, life in Portugal as such and Lisbon was quite uneventful for a young man.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">And...uh...suddenly when all these refugees start to come in...uh...it was very exciting.</span> <span id="s110">I could not understand what they were saying in most cases, but they would...uh...they would come to this soup kitchen a little before noon.</span> <span id="s111">If it was an hour before, and they would...in groups...you could sit them right in the...uh... the and in Lisbon is still today a street that has no end, you know.</span> <span id="s112">It...is two little corners like.</span> <span id="s113">You must turn around to come out.</span> <span id="s114">And...uh...they would walk around there, talking about problems, families, the anxiety, what happened to other members of the family because they did not know.</span> <span id="s115">They hadn't heard from them.</span> <span id="s116">Uh...And...uh...this to me was all very exciting and...uh...as a matter of fact, it reinforced in me even more so my wants to...to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s117">And...uh...it was at some point in time that we met...uh... members of...uh...the...uh...Sofnut that came from Lisbon to ...uh...uh...help the refugees to immigrate to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Could we hold it for a second?</span> <span id="s119">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Can you give me a picture.</span> <span id="s121">We've moved fairly quickly.</span> <span id="s122">Give me a picture of what happened.</span> <span id="s123">What was Portugal like when the war broke out?</span> <span id="s124">How was it different from what had happened before?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: During the second world war?</span> <span id="s126">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s127">When...for you.</span> <span id="s128">For you!</span> <span id="s129">A: For me?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: What did you see.</span> <span id="s131">Besides the refugees, when the war broke out, what changes did you see.</span> <span id="s132">What was your...was your life any different?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: Well, since you asked...since you asked...uh...uh... (clearing throat), there was a time during the war that in the north of Portugal, they had found wolfrum.</span> <span id="s134">And that's some type of a metal.</span> <span id="s135">I do not know that much about it.</span> <span id="s136">But it's sometime of a metal that you must mix...uh... with other metals...uh...specifically for armory.</span> <span id="s137">And, of course...uh...that became very, very exciting all over Portugal.</span> <span id="s138">And many people just left the town and went to the north to try to work on the wolfrum mines.</span> <span id="s139">And, of course, being an adventurer myself...uh...me and a few friends, we decided that it was the time for us to go and dig wolfrum too.</span> <span id="s140">So...uh...we...we went there, but we were very...most unsuccessful.</span> <span id="s141">No sooner than we were there, we turned around and came back to Lisbon because, of course, we had no...no...no means...no...no money.</span> <span id="s142">And...uh...however little money we had...uh...didn't last that long, and I came back, of course...uh...very, very broken-hearted that I did not make a million escudos on the wolfrum mines.</span> <span id="s143">But...uh...that was an exciting thing.</span> <span id="s144">And as much as life generally speaking in Lisbon at the time for as far as I can remember...uh...other than going to school at the time, I..</span> <span id="s145">.</span> <span id="s146">uh...being a member of a large family and my father, at the time...uh....God bless his soul, was working for the Portuguese printing department of the Portuguese government.</span> <span id="s147">And he certainly did not earn that much money either.</span> <span id="s148">So...uh...it was up to us...the growing up children to help the family.</span> <span id="s149">So, other than school, we would pick up whatever job we could, me and my brothers.</span> <span id="s150">And...uh... I was involved in the dismantling, believe it or not, of World War I mines and...uh...we had a little wrench.</span> <span id="s151">There must have been a million bolts and nuts in these mines, and we spent all day unknotting these...these things.</span> <span id="s152">Uh...Another job that I took was...uh...working on ships by derusting the ballast of the ships.</span> <span id="s153">You know, if you're familiar with the ship ballasts, they're little oval holes at the bottom of the ship, and you go in with a little swimming suit and you go with your feet and your head and your...your arms and you stay there all day with a little hammer, and all you do is knock down the rust that accumulates in these little cubicles, You know, they're very small cubicles.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Uh...That was another part of a job.</span> <span id="s155">And I did other minuscule jobs and working on...uh...helping to manufacture of...uh...bicycle, painting, etc.</span> <span id="s156">And...uh...by and large, the...uh...there was an exciting period in Lisbon.</span> <span id="s157">I remember the...uh...uh...there would be a..</span> <span id="s158">.</span> <span id="s159">practically every day in the newspapers some story about someone being killed.</span> <span id="s160">A spy or...or some activity...foreign activities...uh...in Lisbon.</span> <span id="s161">And there is another thing that I used to do with my friends.</span> <span id="s162">We used to go to the German Consulate.</span> <span id="s163">And they had always literature.</span> <span id="s164">Tons of literature!</span> <span id="s165">They would give away propaganda about Germany.</span> <span id="s166">So we, of course, very diligently used to take as much as we could, and the moment we were out we used to toss it out in the garbage.</span> <span id="s167">So...uh...this was one of the things that we did...uh...for some obvious reasons...uh...actually.</span> <span id="s168">Another one function that I had...uh...was a neighbor of ours had a little shoe...uh...horse shoe shop.</span> <span id="s169">He was a big, big man and...uh...he couldn't read or write.</span> <span id="s170">And...uh...he always...whenever I came back from school, it was my function to come to him and read to him the newspaper and what was happening in the world.</span> <span id="s171">Because I used to like to read a lot.</span> <span id="s172">And...uh...and somehow or another we...we became very good friends, you know.</span> <span id="s173">And here was this big fellow.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">He couldn't read.</span> <span id="s175">I could never understand why he couldn't read either.</span> <span id="s176">But he was an older gentleman.</span> <span id="s177">And he was still doing the horse shoes...uh... in his shop.</span> <span id="s178">Blacksmith?</span> <span id="s179">I don't know how you call exactly, but...uh... So, by and large...uh...other than our going every...we had to go every night to the temple because my father...uh...my father insisted that we go to the temple every day...every night.</span> <span id="s180">You cannot come home unless you've been to the temple to the services.</span> <span id="s181">And...uh...every Friday night obviously...Saturdays, we used to go to temple.</span> <span id="s182">So we conducted a reasonably...uh... I would say a moderate Jewish life.</span> <span id="s183">And...uh...our house was...was, of course...uh...kosher.</span> <span id="s184">My father was quite kosher.</span> <span id="s185">And ...uh...we had a very large family, as I said...uh...uh... five boys and five girls.</span> <span id="s186">Although two of them were born...I..</span> <span id="s187">.</span> <span id="s188">one girl...my youngest sister, Rachel, was born after I left Portugal.</span> <span id="s189">And I did not meet her until 17... when she was 17.</span> <span id="s190">And my brother, Jacob, was...uh... few months old when I left for...for , Israel.</span> <span id="s191">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Did you feel...how did you feel being a Jew in Portugal once the war...once the war had broken out?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: My only memories in this case is...uh...I didn't feel any...uh...truthfully...from the part of the Portuguese, I had no...no feelings that there were anti-Semitic or anti-Jewish or anything like that.</span> <span id="s194">Never had that feeling while I was in Lisbon.</span> <span id="s195">That's the truth.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Uh...But...uh...by being in...uh...on a..</span> <span id="s197">.</span> <span id="s198">almost on a daily basis, mixed with the Jewish refugees for a given period of time, that in itself inspired in me more so the desire really to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s199">Number one, to go to Palestine and to join the British Army, and go and fight the Nazis, which I did as a matter of fact.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: Tell us about that.</span> <span id="s201">You started to say...you had started to tell us about the Sofnut.</span> <span id="s202">Tell us about the refugees and Sofnut.</span> <span id="s203">What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Certainly.</span> <span id="s205">Well, once we...uh.</span> <span id="s206">.</span> <span id="s207">we...uh...we left Portugal, our first stop was...</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s209">We have to back up.</span> <span id="s210">If you would please, tell us why...you were now in Lisbon.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: And the Sofnut came to Lisbon.</span> <span id="s213">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Tell us what they did and tell us what you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Well, basically, the...uh...uh...as far as I can remember, they came in to...uh...help number one, to bring all the children...refugees children primarily were the number one to go on.</span> <span id="s216">.</span> <span id="s217">uh...on the registration to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s218">And then came grown-ups.</span> <span id="s219">So families with children, of course, were the first ones.</span> <span id="s220">And they asked the Jewish community also if there were any members of the Jewish community in Lisbon that wished to immigrate to...uh...to .</span> <span id="s221">.</span> <span id="s222">to , Israel.</span> <span id="s223">And I..</span> <span id="s224">.</span> <span id="s225">I and my brother were the first ones to...uh...join.</span> <span id="s226">Uh...In fact...uh...I must say that my father at the time did not like the idea that we were going to leave Portugal.</span> <span id="s227">But I told him that I wanted to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s228">There was no Jewish life in Portugal, no Jewish youth.</span> <span id="s229">There was no girlfriends.</span> <span id="s230">At 16 a young man wants to have a girlfriend.</span> <span id="s231">And...uh...there was no such thing.</span> <span id="s232">And...uh...there were...there were, of course, many girls, but not...not Jewish.</span> <span id="s233">And...uh...I..</span> <span id="s234">.</span> <span id="s235">I..</span> <span id="s236">I had very, very strong...uh...will that I wanted to marry within the Jewish faith and have Jewish children as well, and continue my Jewish life.</span> <span id="s237">That was really something that I always had since childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">And I think as I mentioned before, I was very much impressed by the...uh...photographs from the...from , Israel, the wailing wall, etc.</span> <span id="s239">And Musrabano and other pictures that the teacher had on the wall.</span> <span id="s240">So we then registered with the government of Portugal.</span> <span id="s241">We had to pay some fees to...uh...so that we wouldn't have to go to the military, etc., and...uh...we left for Palestine.</span> <span id="s242">I do not remember the exact date, sometimes end of 43 aboard the ship Niasa...was a steamship, a Portuguese steamship.</span> <span id="s243">And...uh...there was several hundred children and adults, refugees.</span> <span id="s244">And...uh...our first stop was about a day...within a day, we stopped in Cadiz, Spain.</span> <span id="s245">In Cadiz, Spain, the ship picked up several hundred Jewish children again.</span> <span id="s246">And it was there that I met...uh...a fellow from the Jewish community in Lisbon.</span> <span id="s247">His name was who with his brother, Samuel, were in charge of the...uh...uh...uh... removal of Jewish children from the border of France into Spain into Portugal and into Israel.</span> <span id="s248">Uh...Again...uh... knew very well...uh.</span> <span id="s249">.</span> <span id="s250">Dr. because apparently there were visas some received from this gentleman through .</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Okay?</span> <span id="s252">So that was the last time that I saw alive.</span> <span id="s253">He and his brother worked for the Jewish community of Lisbon in conjunction with the American Joint Committee to save the Jewish children.</span> <span id="s254">So...uh...we (clearing throat) we went to...uh...we...uh...went to Israel or to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s256">Tell me about the ship.</span> <span id="s257">I would like to know what it was like for you on the ship with the refugee children and what you did.</span> <span id="s258">What effect it had and there was an incident that you had told me about.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Right.</span> <span id="s260">It was...I cannot remember the names of this young man, but...uh...uh...as a matter of fact in my life, I was directly and indirectly involved in saving five lives.</span> <span id="s261">But he was aboard the Niasa, that...uh...the first thing that happened was...the Niasa had to take a large deviation because of the second world war as it was in...at that point in time quite active, there was...the...the specifically, the German...uh...uh...U-Submarines were in the Mediterranean and as a result, we had to...I only remember that we were advised that the ship would have to make a deviation because of Germany submarine activity.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Uh...Although we...we...ourselves did not see any submarines.</span> <span id="s263">But we did pick up a time when there was very, very rough seas.</span> <span id="s264">And people, of course, were feeling not quite well, and everybody was running up to...to the top even though they were not...you were advised not to because it was reasonably dangerous.</span> <span id="s265">So I was going up to the deck and...uh...a young child I would say within 10 to 12 years old also was in a hurry apparently to relieve himself and...uh...he was caught by a wave.</span> <span id="s266">And...uh...don't ask me how.</span> <span id="s267">I only know that I dove to this child and I was able to grab him while I was grabbing myself also to the rails.</span> <span id="s268">And meantime his mother was very...uh...excited and she called the father which was a little further below the steps.</span> <span id="s269">And...uh...he came in a hurry too and to help me, and we brought, you know.</span> <span id="s270">This...This takes a few seconds because here comes the wave and...and...and just came through the deck and there he was.</span> <span id="s271">And I grabbed him and so we came down there and there was no water any more or anything.</span> <span id="s272">And the father....I will never forget it.</span> <span id="s273">Uh...He jumped at my feet, and he wanted to kiss my feet because I saved...I saved his child.</span> <span id="s274">Now, you know, it's one of these things.</span> <span id="s275">You know, he could...maybe he would never gone overboard, but he could have gone overboard as well.</span> <span id="s276">So...uh...I do not remember their names.</span> <span id="s277">I do not know...once we landed in Israel, I don't know whatever happened to them because they went in different directions and...uh...uh... But nevertheless, life on board ship for the approximately 1 week that we spent that normally would take within 3 to 4 days, but it took a little longer because of that...those deviations that...uh...the ship had to make in the Mediterranean...Mediterranean.</span> <span id="s278">But we...uh...landed in Haifa.</span> <span id="s279">Life was not that exciting on board.</span> <span id="s280">You know, it...uh...people would sit again in corners talking about what happened, wishing, willing, what happened to the families, etc. in...uh...in...uh...in...uh... Also, sort of type of permanent...permanent...uh...anxiety.</span> <span id="s281">That's the only way I can describe it, you know.</span> <span id="s282">There was I would say...uh...many sighs of relief when...when the word Israel, the land of Israel.</span> <span id="s283">I remember that when all of a sudden they say land, land, land.</span> <span id="s284">And there was Haifa Israel.</span> <span id="s285">That was a word that was very, very striking to everybody.</span> <span id="s286">Because everybody...all you hear at that time was Israel, Israel, and I could not understand what they were talking about.</span> <span id="s287">It was Polish or Yiddish or German.</span> <span id="s288">But you could hear all the time Israel, the word Israel.</span> <span id="s289">That I remember.</span> <span id="s290">We were unloaded into a..</span> <span id="s291">.</span> <span id="s292">uh...buses and immediately brought to...uh...it was some sort, if you wish, of a concentration camp in Atleit.</span> <span id="s293">I don't know within 10 to 15 miles from Haifa, south of Haifa.</span> <span id="s294">And...uh...I asked, "What are we doing in here?"</span> <span id="s295">It's like a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Barbed wire with security police everywhere...uh...Arabs, Jews, British.</span> <span id="s297">And...uh...the camp was divided into two sections for...one for men and one for women.</span> <span id="s298">And later on we found out that...uh...because or due to strong activity from the Fifth Column...the German Fifth Column they had to do a series of interviews and they asked everyone and they checked the papers, etc.</span> <span id="s299">So we stayed in that Atleit within...uh...a couple of weeks.</span> <span id="s300">The conditions were not the best, but they were fair.</span> <span id="s301">The Sofnut was there to help us.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">And...uh...from there on, most of us were moved to a little...uh...a little quarters outside Haifa by the name of .</span> <span id="s303">And there was worse because the conditions there were...everybody was mixed, men, women, children.</span> <span id="s304">There was no beds.</span> <span id="s305">We...uh...they didn't expect apparently that large number of people at the time and they were not prepared.</span> <span id="s306">And...uh...as a result we slept for a few days on...on the floor with blankets, etc.</span> <span id="s307">Then...uh...the...the youth were moved to a camp in Carmel in Haifa, the .</span> <span id="s308">And it was there that...uh...I had the great privilege and the honor of meeting the great lady of the Youth Alijah Movement, Henrietta Solt.</span> <span id="s309">And she was a lovely lady, God bless her soul, who...uh... I talked to her personally too.</span> <span id="s310">She talked to each one of us, welcoming us to Israel.</span> <span id="s311">And...uh...some of us we were already above desirable age to stay in the Youth...with the Youth Movement.</span> <span id="s312">And I was one of them.</span> <span id="s313">So I then was moved from the to Kibbutz BitAlfa.</span> <span id="s314">And here I must say that...uh...I could not get used to life in a kibbutz.</span> <span id="s315">I just couldn't.</span> <span id="s316">Uh...I was too...uh...you know, full of action, you know.</span> <span id="s317">And...uh...I wanted to join the British Army.</span> <span id="s318">I wanted to join the war, not...I didn't come over here to be in a kibbutz, you know.</span> <span id="s319">So my brother, Abraham, stayed in the kibbutz and my cousin, , God bless him.</span> <span id="s320">He also passed away in Israel.</span> <span id="s321">Uh...They...they stayed in there.</span> <span id="s322">And...uh...I went to...uh...to join the British Army in Haifa, the British Joint Office.</span> <span id="s323">Uh...Once I filled all the papers, I was advised that because when they asked me for my papers, I gave them my Portuguese passport that I arrived legally.</span> <span id="s324">So I was advised by the...by the lieutenant in charge...he said, "I'm sorry, Sir.</span> <span id="s325">You can't join the British army.</span> <span id="s326">Portugal is a neutral country.”</span> <span id="s327">So I said, "Okay.”</span> <span id="s328">I left and I joined the...at the time was in Haifa talking to some other friends in there, I joined the PPRD, the Palestine Police Railroad Division.</span> <span id="s329">And this time my cousin also joined.</span> <span id="s330">He came back from the kibbutz also.</span> <span id="s331">He couldn't manage there.</span> <span id="s332">And...uh...so we both joined the PPRD.</span> <span id="s333">But I did not like the PPRD, the Palestine Police Railroad DIvision.</span> <span id="s334">What we did was simply night guards.</span> <span id="s335">We had to be with the rifle or the carbine by the railroad or be escort to the British...uh...payroll, etc.</span> <span id="s336">And it was not what I wanted.</span> <span id="s337">I wanted to go to war.</span> <span id="s338">That was my main thing.</span> <span id="s339">So I decided to...uh...go to Sarafan, which was the largest British joint group...army...uh...camp.</span> <span id="s340">(clearing throat) And again I fill out the papers and...uh...when I was asked for my...uh...uh...papers...how did I came to Palestine, I said, "I haven't got any papers.”</span> <span id="s341">How did you come in?</span> <span id="s342">"I'm an illegal.”</span> <span id="s343">And I wrote in this time in my...in my...my papers that I was born in Sofia, Bulgaria.</span> <span id="s344">As a native of Bulgaria, of course...uh...Bulgaria was at war too, so was no longer neutral (clearing throat) and...uh...speaking to some other friends...uh...we realized, of course, that the British they speak English.</span> <span id="s345">And not once was I asked about if I speak Bulgarian.</span> <span id="s346">Which I don't!</span> <span id="s347">But...uh...so...it was in this manner that I was able to join the...the British army.</span> <span id="s348">So we spent some time in Sarafan...the camp, and then we were moved to the Jewish Brigade group...uh...training camp in...uh...Ismailia in Egypt.</span> <span id="s349">We were part of the ITD...the Infantry Training Depot.</span> <span id="s350">And, of course, we were trained by British...uh... officers and also by...uh...Jewish officers.</span> <span id="s351">So we spent several months in training in infantry accelerated training because at the time the British army...the Jewish Brigade group because they wanted us to have a very fast training.</span> <span id="s352">The Jewish Brigade group had seen some action in the front in Italy at the time.</span> <span id="s353">And...uh...of course, I never saw any action in the front.</span> <span id="s354">The end of the war came while I..</span> <span id="s355">.</span> <span id="s356">we were still in Egypt.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">So...uh...we were then moved to Europe.</span> <span id="s358">We left Alexandria aboard a British troop carrier, Escanya, if I remember right, and from there, of course, we were designated to the different...uh...Jewish Brigade...uh...unit.</span> <span id="s359">I was assigned to the second battalion of the Jewish Brigade group.</span> <span id="s360">And shortly thereafter, I was transferred to the corps of military police of the Jewish Brigade.</span> <span id="s361">(clearing throat) And we saw duties in Antwerp.</span> <span id="s362">We had our main station in Antwerp in Belgium.</span> <span id="s363">And it was there that...uh...I really had some first impact with dispersed persons that...people that came from the camps.</span> <span id="s364">Not the refugees that were able...that were fortunate to run away and arrive in Lisbon somehow in a reason...reasonably healthy manner.</span> <span id="s365">I'm talking about a dispersed person that survived the camps.</span> <span id="s366">They came out.</span> <span id="s367">They were skin and bones.</span> <span id="s368">Okay?</span> <span id="s369">And...uh...as a member of the Jewish Brigade, our uniforms were part of the British...uh...uniforms.</span> <span id="s370">The only difference was that we had our patches and we had the Star of David in gold with...uh...two whites and...uh...uh...blue...uh...stripes and...uh...it was in Antwerp and we used to do a lot of duty at...uh...train station that the group of dispersed persons came in.</span> <span id="s371">They came out of the train, and I don't know if they came from Germany or from where they came from, but...uh...it was several of us...MPs, military police....and when they saw the Star of David, there was one of the most things I ever experienced in my life.</span> <span id="s372">They came to you, and they kissed the Star of David.</span> <span id="s373">And they was saying in Yiddish, .</span> <span id="s374">They didn't believe that.</span> <span id="s375">And it was very, very touching.</span> <span id="s376">So I spent some time in...uh...in Antwerp, and...uh...then we went to Eindhoven in Holland to a..</span> <span id="s377">.</span> <span id="s378">uh...R and R camp.</span> <span id="s379">We spent some time there.</span> <span id="s380">And...uh...of course, this is after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Uh...And...uh...the Jewish Brigade at the time was not doing much of anything officially.</span> <span id="s382">Unofficially, the Jewish Brigade group or part of it or portion of it were very, very...uh...diligently working in moving...uh...dispersed persons from one place to another place.</span> <span id="s383">It reminds, perhaps, of the story of...uh...the Jewish Brigade group was like a duck that...uh...you only see the smooth sailing on...on above the water, but below water they peddle like Hell so to speak.</span> <span id="s384">And that's what was happening.</span> <span id="s385">The...uh...the Jewish Brigade group...uh...I'm assuming in conjunction with the Haganah and...uh...the Aliyah Bet and I'm sure you know the meaning of Alijah Bet.</span> <span id="s386">Uh...There was the convention immigration and the unconvention immigration.</span> <span id="s387">And the unconvention immigration was what we call today or we called then Alijah Bet.</span> <span id="s388">Uh...so that it would be distinguished from the convention immigration.</span> <span id="s389">Because the British mandate, at the time, in Palestine did not wish...did not want to allow any more Jews to come to Palestine on a variety of grounds that they believed in.</span> <span id="s390">But...uh...but, of course, the Jewish agency believed in...in otherwise.</span> <span id="s391">And the Jewish agency, of course, had other ideas.</span> <span id="s392">And as a result, the Alijah Bet was created.</span> <span id="s393">So...uh...there were many a times that...uh...in our camp, for instance, there was a time that over night there was several...uh...several...uh...tents that overnight had been erected in our...in...inside the camp.</span> <span id="s394">So for anyone on the outside looking at...at the army camp, another half a dozen tents wouldn't mean much of anything.</span> <span id="s395">Uh...Certainly, we were advised at the time that, you know, leave them along so to speak.</span> <span id="s396">They are dispersed persons in these tents.</span> <span id="s397">The reason is, of course, that the British mandate at the time...the British government...uh...with the assistance of the...uh...their various intelligence units...with the assistance of the British Royal Air Force, the British Navy, they had a blockade of Palestine not to allow any Jews to enter.</span> <span id="s398">And...uh...the Jewish Agency had no choice, but to try to evade their...their investigations.</span> <span id="s399">Where are the Jews coming from?</span> <span id="s400">Where are they being loaded?</span> <span id="s401">On what ships, etc., etc.?</span> <span id="s402">What ports, etc., etc.?</span> <span id="s403">So...uh...that's when the Jewish Brigade was of much help by using the military vehicles in transporting the refugees from one town to another town or if it's from another country, from...if it's from...from Holland to Belgium or to Italy or...or France, etc.</span> <span id="s404">So this involvement actually was...uh...ultimately was found out somehow, and the British government, of course, dismissed the entire Jewish Brigade.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: Were you involved in any of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: No.</span> <span id="s407">I..</span> <span id="s408">.</span> <span id="s409">I was not directly involved.</span> <span id="s410">No.</span> <span id="s411">Not at all.</span> <span id="s412">No.</span> <span id="s413">I was only by...by virtue of being...of serving with the Corps of Military Police of the Jewish Brigade.</span> <span id="s414">I do know that...uh...there was...uh...every...every vehicle...army vehicle had a log.</span> <span id="s415">And in this log, of course, you have to write the moment you leave your camp, where you going, who is for, dut dut dut da.</span> <span id="s416">So...uh...they used to.</span> <span id="s417">.</span> <span id="s418">to write in their logs when they were moving refugees three letters in English.</span> <span id="s419">T-T-G.</span> <span id="s420">And actually the meaning...uh...is...uh... Hebrew, Arabic, and Yiddish, which means .</span> <span id="s421">Which means if...if you pardon me, up your rear end business.</span> <span id="s422">That's what it meant.</span> <span id="s423">The reason that they wrote TTG on their...on their...on these log sheets was when and if they would be stopped by some of the Allied...uh... policemen on the frontiers, etc....uh...when the read, if it's British police and they read TTG on it, that sounds...even though it's a Jewish Brigade convoy...20 convoys or 30 vehicles, etc..</span> <span id="s424">.</span> <span id="s425">uh...they're not going in to see what's inside.</span> <span id="s426">Fortunately, for us, they wouldn't because if they would have lift the...the gate, so to speak, you'll see that there was women, children, refugees being moved around.</span> <span id="s427">From one port to another port, etc.</span> <span id="s428">So this part was very exciting.</span> <span id="s429">I knew it about it.</span> <span id="s430">I was not involved directly with this.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Uh...I was indirectly involved because, for instance, after spending some time in Europe in the British Army in the Jewish Brigade group, you are entitled to a vacation home.</span> <span id="s432">So an Isaac Bitton, in fact, went home on vacation.</span> <span id="s433">But the real Isaac Bitton never left, simply because the...uh...again...the...the Jewish agency had trained younger men, refugees to be able...how to hold...uh...the the way the British army does or way the Jewish Brigade does.</span> <span id="s434">How to eat, etc. etc.</span> <span id="s435">Uh...Some Hebrews words in the event they would be questioned, but otherwise they went home on vacation.</span> <span id="s436">They never came back.</span> <span id="s437">They stayed there.</span> <span id="s438">But Isaac never left, say Antwerp, either.</span> <span id="s439">And then suddenly Ike is back from vacation.</span> <span id="s440">You understand?</span> <span id="s441">And...and the other Isaac stayed in Israel.</span> <span id="s442">So in this manner, many refugees also arrived in Israel with...uh...with false...uh...army...uh...army papers, army documents.</span> <span id="s443">So that's the only time that I was, if you wish, indirectly involved with the Aliyah Bet.</span> <span id="s444">Uh...of course, the end of the Jewish Brigade came about 1946.</span> <span id="s445">We were dismissed.</span> <span id="s446">And we went back.</span> <span id="s447">And it was prior to living in Antwerp and that one evening I..</span> <span id="s448">.</span> <span id="s449">uh...I took a..</span> <span id="s450">.</span> <span id="s451">uh...an electrical train in the city and to my great surprise, there was Brigadeer Benjamin.</span> <span id="s452">Brigadeer Benjamin was a....was a British Jew who was commanding the Jewish Brigade group.</span> <span id="s453">And it appears that he had never been informed officially of the underground activities that the Jewish Brigade was doing at the time in Europe.</span> <span id="s454">And as a result he...uh...he was just totally demoralized if you wish, prior to the...to the...when we all left...the Jewish Brigade left Europe.</span> <span id="s455">And Benjamin would be just...I saw him more than one occasion walking around in town.</span> <span id="s456">But I met him personally in the electrical train.</span> <span id="s457">I had to salute, of course.</span> <span id="s458">He was a Brigadeer General and...uh...but we didn't speak.</span> <span id="s459">He was a very, very reserved man at that time.</span> <span id="s460">So I do not know from there on...uh...I never heard that he went to visit Israel or even if he ever went to Israel, but he was very upset about the whole thing.</span> <span id="s461">Uh...But the meantime...the main...the main...the main point was to save and bring as many Jews to Israel as possible.</span> <span id="s462">And that was something that the Haganah did...uh...the Alijat Bet did very well.</span> <span id="s463">And...uh...so we were disbanded, discharged pretty much.</span> <span id="s464">We went to Egypt again, and from Egypt we were...we stayed in some camps for a short period of time and we went to...we were discharged in Sarafan also officially and...uh...received our civil...civilian garments and little bit pay, etc., and we were free men again, so to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Out of the...out of the Army.</span> <span id="s466">Out in the streets.</span> <span id="s467">And...uh...immediately, when I went back in Nahariyya, of course, we joined the...all of us joined the Haganah underground because the word at the time was that...uh...things did not go that good for...in Palestine.</span> <span id="s468">The...uh... (clearing throat)...when it came to...was the beginning of the...uh...the problems...the...uh...the...the war, of course, if you did not travel in a convoy, then the chances of going from a place A to place B alive was...was very difficult.</span> <span id="s469">And...and it was here that I came quite involved in the...in the underground...in the Haganah between...uh... primarily between Haifa and Nahariyya and the Western Galilee.</span> <span id="s470">We used to meet convoys going south in Shavatsion, a few kilometers south of Nahariyya and....uh...and take as many cars as possible and...uh...in each one of the vehicles was at least one person, one member of the Haganah which was armed.</span> <span id="s471">Now if it was a girl...it was many of the girls that...that were also armed or if it was a boy...either if he were sitting on top of the truck or in the bus or in the car or in a motorcycle, etc....uh...that was a safe way for us to travel at the time.</span> <span id="s472">And coming back in the late afternoon...early evening during the daylight, we would...uh...we would all congregate in the .</span> <span id="s473">, you know, next to Haifa, and because between and Haifa was reasonably safe with the exception of the refineries in which...uh...there was a very, very...uh... very serious incident.</span> <span id="s474">Uh...One time...uh...the...at lunch time, a car went by and while all the Arabs and even some Jews that used to work in the refineries were sitting outside having lunch, somebody threw some bombs.</span> <span id="s475">Uh...As far as I can understand...uh...of course, the Arabs blamed the Jews.</span> <span id="s476">The Jews blamed the British.</span> <span id="s477">And...uh... the facts remains is that the Arabs were so angry...uh...at this attack that the massacred every Jew that worked with them.</span> <span id="s478">For years, they used to work together.</span> <span id="s479">For years and years!</span> <span id="s480">No matter how...all of a sudden, bingo.</span> <span id="s481">I don't think there was...if there was a half dozen Jews that came out of alive of the...Haifa refineries.</span> <span id="s482">They were all massacred.</span> <span id="s483">And on the same evening, the PALMA by orders of the high command of the Haganah took action, only with cold arms, no hot arms...they went into the Arabic village right outside Haifa...uh...where most of these Arabs came from, and they...they really fortunately enough...there was no men on that evening in the village.</span> <span id="s484">They all had escaped because they knew that...that...uh...the Haganah was after them.</span> <span id="s485">I do not know exactly what...what happened after that, but the...the fact remains that it was a very...at the beginning of the war...the war...this...of the problems.</span> <span id="s486">SO we...we used to congregate in Keathim, and from there on again we used to travel all together to...uh...to...uh...Nahariyya.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s488">Did you see the results of any of this PALMA or the fighting?</span> <span id="s489">You were not there?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: No.</span> <span id="s491">No.</span> <span id="s492">You mean at the...uh...at the...uh...the refineries.</span> <span id="s493">Q:</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: No.</span> <span id="s495">No.</span> <span id="s496">No.</span> <span id="s497">But I tell you one time...on two different occasions, I arrived late to the convoy, and I lost the convoy.</span> <span id="s498">Once was going south.</span> <span id="s499">And I was alone.</span> <span id="s500">No...I beg your pardon.</span> <span id="s501">I was...I was alone, and then I picked up a fellow who was a mechanic, Heim Yenkel, was his name...was a mechanic in Nahariyya.</span> <span id="s502">And he sat next to me, and we worked to the city of Akko, but he was uneventful.</span> <span id="s503">There was no problem.</span> <span id="s504">However, on another occasion coming back when...when just shortly before the war really started and things were getting a little tougher...uh...several people had been killed in Akko...that...one by a..</span> <span id="s505">.</span> <span id="s506">in a motorcycle.</span> <span id="s507">They tried to cross Akko alone, so to speak, by car, by bicycle, and they never made it.</span> <span id="s508">So one time I arrived...uh...a little late, and my wife, at the time, was pregnant and I..</span> <span id="s509">.</span> <span id="s510">I..</span> <span id="s511">.</span> <span id="s512">I had to go, get home.</span> <span id="s513">And...uh...certainly, I always had a gun with me, a 45 pistol liberata, Italian hand gun.</span> <span id="s514">But...uh...since I was driving at the time a Volvo...it was an old truck, and I had on...on my truck I had...uh...flour for the bakery, and a variety of other products.</span> <span id="s515">So I took my Arabic...uh... head dress which I used to carry with me because since I'm quite dark featured, I could pass very easily as an Arab.</span> <span id="s516">I put my head Cafia on and...uh...when I arrived at the gates, they had this...we called this Spanish donkeys...is barbed wire on...uh...cross...uh...horses you know.</span> <span id="s517">And we used to call it Spanish donkeys.</span> <span id="s518">And...uh...when I came to the city of Akko, the entrance to this...to this gate, I just put my head of the...my cab, and I shouted in Arabic, " .”</span> <span id="s519">"Open the gate.</span> <span id="s520">Open the gate.”</span> <span id="s521">And the...the guy looked at me and opened the gate and I just kept on going, and I was never stopped.</span> <span id="s522">But...uh...you can do these things when you are 20-some.</span> <span id="s523">(Laughing) Today, probably I wouldn't do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Uh...I was very fortunate too, but...uh...then, of course, the...uh...the war began pretty much very quickly, and...uh...I was...uh...with the....I was with the Fish in the Haganah, and then I became...uh...Sergeant Major in the Israeli army, and I was pretty much stationed in the western Gaililee, in Nahariyya and in north.</span> <span id="s525">But at the beginning of the war, something that sometimes people wonder, "How did you do it.</span> <span id="s526">How...How did Israel deceive them.”</span> <span id="s527">Now, you are attached by so many armies surrounding you, and how did you do it?</span> <span id="s528">One of the things that we did, we excavated roads between Nahariyya and...and...uh...frontier of Lebanon, which was about 7...5, 7 kilometers north of Nahariyya, and...uh...we excavated in a zigzag for miles up to the road where was the Kibbutz Hineta, so that one evening, by command of the Haganah, we took every car, every bus, every motorcycle we had.</span> <span id="s529">Now there was no arms at the time other...other than the Haganah itself.</span> <span id="s530">There was no army at the time.</span> <span id="s531">That was before the...the great shipment of Czechoslovakian arms came to Israel.</span> <span id="s532">This is all before that...that period.</span> <span id="s533">We took out all these buses...the things with full lights and we drove toward the frontier.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Okay?</span> <span id="s535">And so if you are sitting on the top of the mountain and you're looking down like the Arabs were at the time at the frontier of Lebanon in Israel, whoever...there was some army there.</span> <span id="s536">Of course, not...nothing of any great numbers but there were some.</span> <span id="s537">And they're looking down and you see all these lights coming in.</span> <span id="s538">They would say, .</span> <span id="s539">"The Israelis are bring the entire army over here.”</span> <span id="s540">Well, we did.</span> <span id="s541">We drove with lights on.</span> <span id="s542">We turned around underneath the mountain where they could not see.</span> <span id="s543">There was large growths of...of olives, and we turned around and came back without lights.</span> <span id="s544">And we turned around again and came back with lights.</span> <span id="s545">You know, in with lights on, back without lights.</span> <span id="s546">And we did this for a given period of time.</span> <span id="s547">But for your information, there was only one time that we found out that it was a few Arab tanks that came down from Horshineka, Russ, and Nicura, down into the section of the road to Hineta, and they turned around and back they went again.</span> <span id="s548">They never dare to go beyond that point.</span> <span id="s549">And, let me tell, if they had there was nothing to hold them like I said.</span> <span id="s550">So in this case, the Haganah...uh... used a lot of...of strategy of faked...uh...movements which was very successful in illuding the enemy at the time...uh...from advancing, because they did not know what was expected from...from them.</span> <span id="s551">And...uh...but...uh...at this point in time...uh...I'd like also to talk to you about an experience just very, very shortly before this...the war started, there was a convoy going to Yesshiam, Kibbutz Yesshiam.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Yesshiam was the name of a young man by the name of Yesshiam Vis, who was a meter of the PALMA, special forces of the Israeli...uh...Haganah.</span> <span id="s553">And...uh...Yesshiam Vis was amongst the detachment of...uh...PALMA that involved in operation bridges.</span> <span id="s554">In 1947, the Haganah decided to build, to blow up every bridge...every bridge that was connecting at the time the land of Israel so to speak and all the other Arab countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">And...uh...so...uh...it was very effective.</span> <span id="s556">The main purpose, I understand, was...uh...uh...just to show that...uh... we can take care of ourselves, and also some sort of a warning also toward the Arabs, you know, that..."Don't attack.”</span> <span id="s557">It didn't maybe work, but said don't attack us.</span> <span id="s558">Leave us alone.</span> <span id="s559">Let us be.</span> <span id="s560">Unfortunately, there is a legend about the...the...Yeeheim Vis.</span> <span id="s561">The bridge they were supposed to blow up was in...uh...was called Asiv, which goes back to the Finnishian times.</span> <span id="s562">It's a little bridge.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">And...uh...uh...the legend is that...uh... the...uh...from some Arabs later on we found out that there was a group of British army...uh...soldiers.</span> <span id="s564">There was a British army camp not too far away from Asiv, that...uh... was...apparently, they were doing some sort of manuevers in the middle of the night unbeknown to the group.</span> <span id="s565">And as a result, they were ambushed.</span> <span id="s566">Since every...and each of one these young men carried the...the dynamite, explosives with them.</span> <span id="s567">Uh...There was...not a thing was found from them.</span> <span id="s568">Absolutely nothing!</span> <span id="s569">They just disappeared.</span> <span id="s570">Was about 8 if I remember correctly.</span> <span id="s571">And today there is a memorial to...uh...Yeeheim Vis in Asiv by the bridge.</span> <span id="s572">And...uh.</span> <span id="s573">.</span> <span id="s574">before the war, there was an American...as a matter of fact, an American group of young men and women that built a kibbutz in Asiv, by the name of Asiv...American...I was there on the commemoration with General Adror at the time.</span> <span id="s575">But in the meantime the...</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: We need to stop at this point and change tapes.</span> <span id="s577">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: In...in the meantime, actually, the Jewish Agency decided...uh...to honor the name of Yeeheim Vis.</span> <span id="s580">His father was at the time, I believe, a high official in the Jewish Agency.</span> <span id="s581">So...uh...in the Western Galilee, there was too much openness actually, especially coming in from the mountains...uh.</span> <span id="s582">.</span> <span id="s583">So they decided...the Jewish Agency decided to build two kibbultzes.</span> <span id="s584">It was just shortly before the war started.</span> <span id="s585">And one of them is named, today, of course, Yeehim.</span> <span id="s586">I'm quite familiar with the area because Yeehim if you go back to...uh...to several years ago, used to be called in Arabic.</span> <span id="s587">And there was an Arab...a very, sort of a stronghold.</span> <span id="s588">But it was abandoned.</span> <span id="s589">There was no one there actually.</span> <span id="s590">And...uh...so the Sofnut decided to build a kibbutz at by honoring the name of Yeehim.</span> <span id="s591">And...uh...this was done.</span> <span id="s592">Next door was built another kibbutz and...uh...uh...uh...I believe was Gotton.</span> <span id="s593">I cannot quite remember the name, but I remember that I was there at the time.</span> <span id="s594">And this kibbutz was built already under fire...under Arabic fire because...uh...you could...it was a very...it was a very excitable day because here were the Haganah putting up little sheds and so forth, girls making food, and here these guys were shooting down from...from the...from a spot called the Mountain of the...the Tree Mountain.</span> <span id="s595">Because was in above the higher level.</span> <span id="s596">And...uh...I can't remember exactly all the names in Hebrew any more, but it's...was like a tree because there was a large tree there.</span> <span id="s597">And...uh...that's basically how come that this kibbutz Yeeheim came about, to honor Yeeheim Vis, basically.</span> <span id="s598">And we used to go...uh...prior to the war...uh...the Haganah used to train and we used to bring arms, ammunitions, and food to kibbutz Yeeheim .</span> <span id="s599">We used to walk for 4 and a half hours from Nahariyya to Yeeheim because you go up to the mountains and you have to walk to , and you had to bypass small Arab villages and you had to do it...uh...all night long pretty much and you had to do it to such an extent so that you would not create too much noise.</span> <span id="s600">If you had...uh...a squad, which is equivalent to a British army squad of 11 men and the officer, uh...we...uh...we used to have different squads going to different areas.</span> <span id="s601">And...uh....</span> <span id="s602">also to make a mock attacking, attacking Yeeheim because we expected there wwould be problems as...as... as the kibbutz would be...be put in there.</span> <span id="s603">And there were many problems.</span> <span id="s604">They were...they were attacked many times.</span> <span id="s605">But...uh...obviously, the attacks could not come from the because there was no shape, or form that as you were climbing this...this...this high mountain, big so to speak...uh...you always made noise, no matter how careful you are.</span> <span id="s606">You could hear it.</span> <span id="s607">You could hear it way a way before you were...uh...inside.</span> <span id="s608">They could hear the noise already.</span> <span id="s609">So basically that's what happened in...the .</span> <span id="s610">And from there, of course...uh...we...uh...(clearing throat) ...uh...there was a convoy where I lost my...my very best friends.</span> <span id="s611">I used to live at the time...shortly before that I used to live with a family by the name of Shinerman.</span> <span id="s612">And...uh...there was two boys and a girl.</span> <span id="s613">Moses, Alisa, and Salome Shinerman.</span> <span id="s614">And...uh...There was a convoy at one time.</span> <span id="s615">an armed convoy...that's when the conflicts already had started in 19...uh...beginning of 48...uh...that...uh... they took...it was a bus and several trucks, and a pickup truck.</span> <span id="s616">The pickup truck had a..</span> <span id="s617">.</span> <span id="s618">had a device like in V shape that had a wheel and this device would be lowered to the road and it would push any any stones that the Arabs used to block because they used to block the...the roads all the time.</span> <span id="s619">It was very easy to do.</span> <span id="s620">You throw in a few large rocks and no car can by.</span> <span id="s621">Uh...Interesting enough, the road between Nahariyya and Nefriam...uh...about...for about 5 miles was a zig zag, very zigzaggy.</span> <span id="s622">And...uh...the Arabs used to call it the road of backshis.</span> <span id="s623">The...uh...backshis is an Arabic word for tipping.</span> <span id="s624">And the reason being that...uh...way back before I even came to Palestine, the...uh...when the British mandate were building the road...that particular road... uh...which was quite parallel to the...the Lebanese border so to speak...uh...every Arab sheik that had orange or citrus groves or lemon groves...by paying the British backshis...the would make the road came to their gates, so they could come with the trucks and as a result the road went like this.</span> <span id="s625">That...that's a fact.</span> <span id="s626">And...uh...so as the came about, and I can tell you the precise date and the precise hour was March 23rd, 1948 at 20 til 3 in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s627">Uh...There were brutally attacked by...by the arm of , the known...uh...Arab liberator of Palestine so to speak.</span> <span id="s628">And he was very...very smart man, and he was able to illude the Israeli army...uh...at the time...uh...by running away through a..</span> <span id="s629">.</span> <span id="s630">his own road that he made to the Western Galilee.</span> <span id="s631">But nevertheless ....uh...the attack on the convoy to was quite successful simply because there was a serious of tragedies.</span> <span id="s632">Uh...Number one, the officer commanding the...uh...the convoy was...by name of...uh...uh...Ben Aame if you heard about him.</span> <span id="s633">And...uh...my best friend, Moses Shinerman was a lieutenant at the time in the unit.</span> <span id="s634">This was my unit.</span> <span id="s635">I was spared simply because my wife was giving birth to my daughter at that...a few hours before that.</span> <span id="s636">And because she was quite ill with a..</span> <span id="s637">.</span> <span id="s638">with a bone...some type of...uh... deficiency, that the doctor at the time...we did not have a hospital at that time there.</span> <span id="s639">.</span> <span id="s640">he said, "Isaac, you must stay here.”</span> <span id="s641">And in fact he even talked to our commanding officer, that I must stay there because they expected the worst from birth.</span> <span id="s642">Fortunately enough, nothing happened.</span> <span id="s643">But...uh...Alisa Shiner, which was like my sister, came to see the baby at...before she left even to the convoy.</span> <span id="s644">And...uh...I said, "Gee, I wish I could go, but the doctor did not allow me to go.”</span> <span id="s645">I had to stay there.</span> <span id="s646">So the convoy left...uh...uh...a few...it was a few minutes after the left Nahariyya, they were all ambushed.</span> <span id="s647">Because they...they ...they waited until the...the...uh...last truck had passed this zig zag and then they started to put some rocks and they put some rocks at the other end of the zig zag so that they first car unbeknown to them was able...was able to break the barricade.</span> <span id="s648">The second car in line was the bus.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">The bus had armor.</span> <span id="s650">The Israeli, at the time, they put armor and they welded these heavy metal plates in the cabin so that the driver would not be hurt.</span> <span id="s651">Unfortunately, as the driver of the bus was trying to turn around, they threw apparently some of a molotov cocktail.</span> <span id="s652">And both of the tires were shot so the truck then became paralyzed in...in closing the road.</span> <span id="s653">So all the other 6 or 7 other trucks...they were behind them...okay...we...we felt the same...the same thing.</span> <span id="s654">They couldn't move.</span> <span id="s655">And as a result the...uh...the people were given the word apparently to...uh...save yourself.</span> <span id="s656">And... uh...very, very few were to...to survive this incident.</span> <span id="s657">Uh...they were able to escape by hiding on the water that flows from the Western Galilee to Nahariyya to the ocean...to the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean.</span> <span id="s658">There was a little bit creek, and they were able to survive by hiding there because in the meantime it was beginning to be dark, you see.</span> <span id="s659">Had the convoy had left earlier although it was 20 in the afternoon, 20 to 3...uh...March...uh...uh...it wasn't quite full summer yet.</span> <span id="s660">And...uh...they survived by staying there in the dark, and maneuvering.</span> <span id="s661">Some of them arrived in Nahariyya and they...what...the next thing what happened was the British mandate was...the army was and the police were still at the time in Palestine, they did not allow the Haganah to...whoever the forces that we wanted to go out and try to help, but they would not allow it.</span> <span id="s662">Could not live Nahariyya.</span> <span id="s663">And it was one of the greatest disasters that we suffered...uh...in...uh...in the Haifaam...the convoy to Haifaam.</span> <span id="s664">Uh...We lost 40...49...I believe 49 members.</span> <span id="s665">But then there was an action that...uh.</span> <span id="s666">.</span> <span id="s667">some...some said in Israel later on there was a..</span> <span id="s668">.</span> <span id="s669">uh...an action from the Haganah to make up for the convoy to Haifaam.</span> <span id="s670">And what happened was one of the Israeli telephone operators caught up or intercepted a message coming from the Lebanese border that there was a convoy coming in with...at the time if you remember the British...the British had the Arab Legion in Palestine as well.</span> <span id="s671">And the Arab Legion had some stations in the Mount Cumberland Haifa, if you remember.</span> <span id="s672">They had some...so the...the Israeli intelligence was able to find out...the Haganah...that there was a convoy coming in from Lebanon full of arms and ammunitions for the Arabs.</span> <span id="s673">Let me tell you, that I saw personally.</span> <span id="s674">And I have never seen a thing like this in my life.</span> <span id="s675">For several days, the entire all the houses along the main road Haifa Beirut were emptied.</span> <span id="s676">Now, the Arabs, of course, didn't know that.</span> <span id="s677">And there were several members of the Haganah and the PALMA waiting in hiding because they...they knew that the convoy was coming but they did know when exactly...the precise time.</span> <span id="s678">And...uh...by sheer coincidence, I was not involved in...in any of those actions at the time, I just happened to come to with a truck which I is I..</span> <span id="s679">.</span> <span id="s680">I used to bring food and all kinds of things from Haifa to Nahariyya during this period.</span> <span id="s681">And I just had arrived barely in Kayathim... was a big, big circle.</span> <span id="s682">And all of a sudden, all Hell broke loose.</span> <span id="s683">This convoy had come in with the arms at the other end on the north side of Kayat...uh...Kayathim...Kayat valley.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">And...uh...of course, it appears that not just there was several...uh...private cars, automobiles, sedans, and there was some Araban Legion trucks.</span> <span id="s685">And apparently each one of them had some sort of dynamite in it.</span> <span id="s686">Not only did they have some dynamite in it, they also had some officers of the...uh...the Arab Legion in it.</span> <span id="s687">So the result was, it was just...uh...very tragic for the...for the convoy, because...uh...no one came out of it alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Not a single person!</span> <span id="s689">But what I saw and that I'll never forget in my life, for as long as I live.</span> <span id="s690">The British police and the British army...of course, they immediately surrounded...closed the roads.</span> <span id="s691">Okay?</span> <span id="s692">And...uh...you could smell the fire.</span> <span id="s693">You could smell bodies burning.</span> <span id="s694">You could see the fires because we were right there.</span> <span id="s695">Okay?</span> <span id="s696">But I'll never forget in my life is when the British...when all this action disappeared...several Israelis were also actually hurt because one young man from the Haganah, he just went the head of that truck and he then became...he received the highest medal from the Israeli army because he was the one who really went to the middle of the road and just stopped that truck.</span> <span id="s697">He just shot everybody...whatever the truck as the truck was coming to him, and he himself in turn was blown up, and his face...uh...I can't remember his name...they had all the plastic operations and a year, etc., etc., and he was for a longest time hospitalized.</span> <span id="s698">But the point is...I wanted to make, when I saw the British officers, British police with....uh...portable...uh...what do you call this...uh...when you put somebody...it's made of canvas, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: Body bag?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: No.</span> <span id="s701">Not a body bag.</span> <span id="s702">No.</span> <span id="s703">No.</span> <span id="s704">No.</span> <span id="s705">Uh...if someone is injured, for instance.</span> <span id="s706">.</span> <span id="s707">Q: Stretchers.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: Stretchers.</span> <span id="s709">I beg your pardon.</span> <span id="s710">They used to have stretchers.</span> <span id="s711">Okay?</span> <span id="s712">And...uh...they would put a stretcher next to a body.</span> <span id="s713">Now that body...uh...those that I have seen...I saw at the time without a head, without arms, etc.</span> <span id="s714">They didn't touch the bodies as such.</span> <span id="s715">They used sticks, and with sticks they used to push the bodies into the stretcher.</span> <span id="s716">Okay?</span> <span id="s717">And then they went like this...one...two...three, and dumped the body into the pickup trucks that they had.</span> <span id="s718">I'll never forget it in my life.</span> <span id="s719">Never!</span> <span id="s720">I thought it was so inhuman...no matter if it was Arab, if it was a Jew, he was dead...the person, whoever was left.</span> <span id="s721">And I thought he would be treated a little more...with some dignity, and not as if you tossing a pail of garbage into the truck.</span> <span id="s722">But they did it.</span> <span id="s723">It was very, very cold...cold.</span> <span id="s724">And...uh...so we afterwards, we had to wait several hours.</span> <span id="s725">We were allowed in when they cleaned up on the roads, etc., and the mess...we were allowed to go to Nahariyya in our convoy when we met.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: You obviously fought through the War of Independence.</span> <span id="s727">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: How long did you live in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: I stayed in Israel until 1959.</span> <span id="s730">That's when I left basically.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s732">Tell us why you left and tell us something about you coming to this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: Well I (clearing throat) after the war I..</span> <span id="s734">.</span> <span id="s735">I became a tourist driver guide, licensed by the government and...uh...I had one of the blue license.</span> <span id="s736">There was a red and a blue.</span> <span id="s737">I was not a biblical scholar, but I did have and I do have a basic knowledge of the western Galilee, and I was familiar so I drove many, many....uh...tourists... dignitaries.</span> <span id="s738">Uh...I drove...uh...Polish...uh...commission.</span> <span id="s739">They were making a film in the western Galilee.</span> <span id="s740">I drove...uh...I drove the Turkish Consul-General to Jerusalem...uh...the new one that came to...to Israel at the time.</span> <span id="s741">I drove...uh...a....uh...Jewish Parliamentary Commissions that came to visit also the western Galilee.</span> <span id="s742">Uh...I was assigned at one time, and I drove...uh...Isaac Bensfee, the President of Israel at the time, and his wife.</span> <span id="s743">They sat in the back of my car, and in the front...uh...we picked up in Auspina on the way to...uh...the excavations of Hotsora at the time...uh...we picked up the very famous archaeologist, uh...God bless their...their souls.</span> <span id="s744">Uh...He was the leading...uh...archaeologist in the country, and at the time he was also the Chief of Staff of the Israel Army.</span> <span id="s745">So we drove to the excavations of Hotsor in western Galilee.</span> <span id="s746">It was the most fascinating experience in life to listen to these biblical scholars speaking about how Joshua had taken over the mountains from the Canaanites.</span> <span id="s747">And it was a fascinating experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: What made you decide...when do you come...what made you decide to come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: I had the...the great honor of meeting a very charming...uh ...older lady in Israel which is...uh...was my wife's great mother.</span> <span id="s750">And she used to live in New Rochelle, New York.</span> <span id="s751">She came to visit Israel on a few occasions.</span> <span id="s752">I only met her once.</span> <span id="s753">She was quite a elderly lady, and somehow or another we then had a little reunion, and it was discussed that...uh ...perhaps we should come and stay with her family in the United States because myself I only had a brother in Israel at that time.</span> <span id="s754">And my wife had these cousins and...and so forth.</span> <span id="s755">And then a little bit later on, again by...by...by sheer coincidence, there was another member from the United States, a father-in-law of my wife's cousin.</span> <span id="s756">He had, at the time, arrived to visit Israel and I had a meeting with him with my mother-in-law and he was a very exciting man.</span> <span id="s757">He was a Polish Jewish fellow...uh...namely Abe Rockland was his name, God bless his soul.</span> <span id="s758">And he told me in his broken English, he said, "You should come to America yesterday.”</span> <span id="s759">And.</span> <span id="s760">.</span> <span id="s761">uh...kind of I..</span> <span id="s762">.</span> <span id="s763">I start to think a little bit more in that.</span> <span id="s764">Now I always liked United States.</span> <span id="s765">As a child in Portugal, I used to love to read.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Books...the little booklets about Buffalo Bill.</span> <span id="s767">That was my number one hero was Buffalo Bill.</span> <span id="s768">And the buffalo and the...and the things...fights with the Indians and all that sort of things.</span> <span id="s769">I used to read a lot.</span> <span id="s770">And that's how I..</span> <span id="s771">.</span> <span id="s772">I read a lot of it in...in...I couldn't quite understand English at that time, but I forced myself and taught myself some English.</span> <span id="s773">And so I always had the good vision that the United States, of course, is...is the greatest in the world.</span> <span id="s774">And it is.</span> <span id="s775">And...uh...and we decided then to immigrate, to come to the United States, and we left Israel...uh...in 1959, and we came to the United States in 1959.</span> <span id="s776">My wife, Miriam, and my daughter, Tamara, my son, Daniel, and my son, Michael.</span> <span id="s777">Uh...My daughter, Tamara, went to Switzerland to live with the rest of the family after she graduated from high school.</span> <span id="s778">My son, Daniel, of course...uh... stayed in...with us, and...uh...he joined the army without my knowledge...uh...joined the Vietnam war.</span> <span id="s779">He volunteered to...uh...to...to go to Vietnam.</span> <span id="s780">And...uh...although (clearing throat) I am very, very proud of him because...uh...he served with great honors...the...uh...with the Green Berets, and also with the Ninth Armed Calvary.</span> <span id="s781">And he was shot down four times...uh...from the helicopters.</span> <span id="s782">He used to be with the...uh...the...uh...the small...uh...OV helicopters, the observations helicopters.</span> <span id="s783">And fortunately enough, he was always fell in some rice paddies or within the area that he was not...never injured.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Uh....he jumped out of the choppers actually, when the choppers were...were attacked.</span> <span id="s785">And...uh...he's very heavily (clearing throat) honored ...uh...Presidential citations and bronze stars.</span> <span id="s786">He has three bronze stars and many other medals, and I'm very, very proud of him.</span> <span id="s787">And Michael, my younger son, works with me in the business.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s789">I'd like...I'd like to go back a little now.</span> <span id="s790">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s791">Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: If we could, I'd like to go back to Portugal...uh...during the war.</span> <span id="s793">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: You're a young man of 16?</span> <span id="s795">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s797">Can you tell us a little more about your impressions of the refugee community that filled the Jewish soup kitchen?</span> <span id="s798">More about the people, and about the numbers of people that came there.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: Alright.</span> <span id="s800">It's...uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: Could you repeat the question?</span> <span id="s802">Just repeat it a little.</span> <span id="s803">The microphone will pick it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s805">I..</span> <span id="s806">.</span> <span id="s807">uh...uh...I understand that you would like to know a little bit more about the situation in the soup kitchen...uh...perhaps some numbers of refugees that came by and what was the...the situation, the atmosphere.</span> <span id="s808">Uh...It's...uh...sometimes difficult...uh...to go back so many years and...and be able to precisely memorize on what happen then.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Uh...But something of very interest that I should have and I did not mention earlier, was...uh...by a sheer coincidence, as I told you before, I happened to be a cousin to Senator from Minnesota, Rudy Boshwitz, through my wife because of the marriage.</span> <span id="s810">And his wife, Ellen Boshwitz, was one of the refugees that passed through Lisbon at that point in time in history.</span> <span id="s811">But I don't remember meeting her then, because she was much younger.</span> <span id="s812">She was a younger person than me.</span> <span id="s813">And I do not remember...I don't she was necessarily at the soup kitchen because not all the refugees that came to Portugal were at the soup kitchen.</span> <span id="s814">Some of the refugees...they...they were persons of means that were able to somehow manage to bring some money with them, some...and they were able to stay in...in hotels and...uh...for a given period of time.</span> <span id="s815">And...uh...and I understand that Ellen and her family...they left Lisbon by boat to Brazil, and then from Brazil, they came to the United States.</span> <span id="s816">But...uh...most of the other refugees that really had no means and were waiting for visas to...uh...to... uh...immigrate to the Unites States, to Israel, to South America, etc., etc..</span> <span id="s817">.</span> <span id="s818">uh...there was a time in...uh...Portugal when...uh...many of these refugees' visas had expired, and they are allowed to stay a given period of time, if it was 3 months, 6 months, etc.</span> <span id="s819">And as a result the...uh...the Portuguese, if I may say so, are very...the Portuguese language is a very complete language.</span> <span id="s820">They say .</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Everything is to be just so.</span> <span id="s822">Uh...And they're very particular.</span> <span id="s823">And the reason they're law- abiding.</span> <span id="s824">So...so when the refugees visas expired, the next step was you are jailed.</span> <span id="s825">Simple as that!</span> <span id="s826">Now, you have here...uh...uh...a large group of people, reasonable large, several hundred people that suddenly, while they were able to escape the Nazi persecution and the Nazi armies, are being put in jail in Lisbon with common criminals.</span> <span id="s827">And the sad part is, of course, that most of these people in large numbers were academicians.</span> <span id="s828">They were doctors.</span> <span id="s829">They were engineers.</span> <span id="s830">They were scientists, etc., businessmen, etc.</span> <span id="s831">So the Portuguese-Jewish community and I believe again here, in conjunction with the American Joint Committee, asked the government of Portugal to allow these refugees...to...to assign to these refugees some small villages surrounding Lisbon so they...they could with some ...some dignity live in there, until they were able to receive visas to leave Portugal.</span> <span id="s832">And this was granted.</span> <span id="s833">There was several little villages.</span> <span id="s834">I can't remember...I think one of them that I remember is that was allowed for refugees to stay there.</span> <span id="s835">They were not allowed to move out of these villages without the permission of the Portuguese...uh...Naturalization Immigration Department, because they were very strict.</span> <span id="s836">Uh...The president of the time of the Jewish community in Lisbon was Professor Onsolack.</span> <span id="s837">Uh...He was the professor of...uh...science in the University of Lisbon.</span> <span id="s838">And ironically...uh...it is often said that he was good friend with the Prime Minister Salosar.</span> <span id="s839">even though that Solsar give orders to not to issue visas to Jews...uh...on the side, the Portuguese government was very strict.</span> <span id="s840">And I cannot, as I said earlier, personally say, that I was persecuted by the Portuguese government.</span> <span id="s841">I was not as such.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Uh...That Jews were persecuted by the Portuguese government, I can't say that either.</span> <span id="s843">Either than the fact that was removed from his position, that it is true of the Portuguese people, not the government, that they were very helpful to the Jewish refugees.</span> <span id="s844">In many instances!</span> <span id="s845">And many stores even, I understand, even giving them clothing.</span> <span id="s846">Although I have tendency to disagree with some of the statistics that are coming out from the Portuguese government side stating that over 40,000 Jewish refugees came to Lisbon.</span> <span id="s847">I..</span> <span id="s848">.</span> <span id="s849">I know...I'm quite certain that...that as many refugees as I saw in the soup kitchen, I did not see 40,000 refugees come to the soup kitchen.</span> <span id="s850">If indeed there were refugees that came to Portugal and somehow they...those that you never knew about...they...they came in; they stayed a few days in a hotel; they got a visa; they kept on going to South America or...or...or North America or...or...or Palestine or Israel or other countries for that matter, I do not know.</span> <span id="s851">I do not know.</span> <span id="s852">And...uh...in as much as the atmosphere itself in the soup kitchen, it was.</span> <span id="s853">.</span> <span id="s854">uh...I tried to bring back my...my mental memory...uh...and look at these families sitting on the table and...uh...and...uh...they were not happy faces to say the least.</span> <span id="s855">You could always see sad faces.</span> <span id="s856">Okay?</span> <span id="s857">Faces of when...when a person is concerned, when you are worried about...uh...whatever happened to...to your mother, your father, your uncle, your aunt, your niece, your brother, your sister?</span> <span id="s858">You don't know.</span> <span id="s859">You didn't know.</span> <span id="s860">You were the lucky one.</span> <span id="s861">You were able to make it.</span> <span id="s862">You run away fast.</span> <span id="s863">You.</span> <span id="s864">.</span> <span id="s865">you were lucky to do it.</span> <span id="s866">You saved your life.</span> <span id="s867">What happened to the other ones?</span> <span id="s868">And it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s869">And it was a concern because as you well know, Jewish are so very emotional, and...uh...there were many a tears in the kitchen soup, many a tears and you could see...you could observe that.</span> <span id="s870">Uh...And yet there was...uh...as I told you before about this fellow, Gustof Zumick, repairing the shoes of other refugees.</span> <span id="s871">That was the least he could have done to help his fellow...fellow...fellow in...in...in this instance you know.</span> <span id="s872">So there was a..</span> <span id="s873">.</span> <span id="s874">a..</span> <span id="s875">.</span> <span id="s876">a still a little bit of a sense ...of...uh...of, "I am your...my brother's keeper," you know.</span> <span id="s877">That's a atmosphere that I can best describe.</span> <span id="s878">Helping someone with the nothing that you have, you know.</span> <span id="s879">And I think it was very typical of the...of the Jews at the time, helping each other with the least that they had, with the nothing that they had.</span> <span id="s880">So I don't know if I answered your question.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: You did indeed.</span> <span id="s882">Is there anything you want to add.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: (Sigh) Yes.</span> <span id="s884">I..</span> <span id="s885">.</span> <span id="s886">I'm having a hard time keeping my tears inside me.</span> <span id="s887">Because every time when I think about these things, you know...uh...I happen to be Jewish too and very emotional too.</span> <span id="s888">It's hard to keep them down.</span> <span id="s889">Really.</span> <span id="s890">It's...uh...my friends that were killed during the war and....uh...even some of the what I saw in Europe with the dispersed persons and...uh... Later on in Israel, if I may add that too, as I became a tourist driver guide, there was a kibbutz by the name of .</span> <span id="s891">In English, it's called the ghetto of fighters.</span> <span id="s892">I was very, very fortunate again because I was called on more than one occasions...many, many times, to drive one of the leaders of the ghetto fighters.</span> <span id="s893">His name was Isaac Zuckerman.</span> <span id="s894">Yes.</span> <span id="s895">And I drove that man so many times, taking him from the kibbutz, bringing him to Nahariyya, bring him to Haifa, bring him here, bring him there.</span> <span id="s896">And there was a girl by the name of Miriam.</span> <span id="s897">I cannot remember her other number.</span> <span id="s898">But she was also one of the few...Isaac Zuckerman and Miriam were one of the few Jewish people that were able to...to get out of the Warsaw....Warsaw ghetto alive.</span> <span id="s899">I guess most of the leaders were all killed by the...by the ...by the Germans, by the Nazis armies.</span> <span id="s900">But they survived.</span> <span id="s901">And...uh...as the kibbutz was being from...from the very beginning...uh...which was built near a Roman aqueduct in...about 5 kilometers south of Nahariyya, , as it was built up, of course, I used to bring tourists over there also to visit the kibbutz .</span> <span id="s902">But this was... uh...one of the last things really I..</span> <span id="s903">.</span> <span id="s904">that it was very, very touching.</span> <span id="s905">Anytime you went to the...into the ghetto's fighters, as they were building the kibbutz and talking to these people and...and witnessing the things that they did to humanbeings, making soap out of hair and skins and children, that was...uh...uh... As far as I'm concerned...I'm...I'm one of those that believe in the philosophy that never again...I'm gonna die with some dignity, as opposed to just submit.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: With that note, I think we end.</span> <span id="s907">A: Good.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">d. Thank you.</span></p></body></html>
