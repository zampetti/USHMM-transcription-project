id="s11">July 25, 1989</span></p> <p><span id="s12">WH: You were born in what city?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">BN: …Zawnercie…</span></p> <p><span id="s14">WH: You have brothers and sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">BN: I have two brothers…they both made it.</span> <span id="s16">And one was in camp with me and one was during the war in Russia, the one who is still alive.</span> <span id="s17">Jonas, my brother, died— about 6 years ago…my brother had two by-passes, twice passes, and I had one</span></p> <p><span id="s18">by-pass…</span></p> <p><span id="s19">WH: (Your parents) did not make it?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">BN: No…they died in 1943 in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">WH: …and your other brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">BN: My other brother who is alive is here in Milwaukee, and we were in business together until about 5 years ago…</span></p> <p><span id="s23">WH: You’re not retired, you’re still working?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">BN: I am retired…I was in construction…we started in 1954, my brother and myself…</span></p> <p><span id="s25">WH: When did you come to this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">BN: October 24, 1949.</span> <span id="s27">Exactly…</span></p> <p><span id="s28">WH: When you came…were you married?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">BN: Yah, my daughter was born in Germany…1946 we got married…I was not in a DP camp, I was in a private…home.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">WH: Did you think about going to Israel after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">BN: Of course!</span> <span id="s32">…and why we didn’t go?</span> <span id="s33">Because we chose the easy way out…it wasn’t so good in Israel.</span> <span id="s34">We took the easy way out.</span> <span id="s35">Right or wrong, I feel pretty guilty about it.</span> <span id="s36">I really do.</span> <span id="s37">I speak out about being guilty and not going to Israel…I was speaking for a class, I do talk about Holocaust, and I was speaking in a class, I would say 95% are non-Jews, or more, in high school, and a kid asked me “After the war, you had a chance to go into Israel, why didn’t you go to Israel, and came to the United States?”</span> <span id="s38">And that’s a pretty tough question to answer to non-Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s39">I told them straight—I took the easy way out, I was wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">I think I was wrong.</span> <span id="s41">I thought I was going to come here five years and go to Israel.</span> <span id="s42">Once you get a taste of the good living, you don’t want to go back.</span> <span id="s43">I took the e-a-s-y way out.</span> <span id="s44">This is a fact…I would say that 90%, I really mean that 90% of our survivors planned to go to Israel…not everybody’s dream was to go to Israel…they had all the messages not to come because it’s tough, it’s hard, (inaudible) to fight, and, so they took the easy way out.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">WH: …Franka, where are you from?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">FN: Lodz, Poland</span></p> <p><span id="s47">WH: …who sponsored you to come here?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">BN The JOINT, HIAS</span></p> <p><span id="s49">WH: How is it that you wound up here, in Milwaukee?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">BN: I came with Wolherman on the same ship, accidentally, and I went with him.</span> <span id="s51">My brother came to St. Paul first, he came 6 weeks before I did… so I ask in New York to go to St. Paul, and I went to St. Paul…I stayed in St. Paul for 14 months…and I couldn’t find a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">WH: What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">BN: I will tell you, the truth how it happened.</span> <span id="s54">I came by train from N.Y. to Chicago, Chicago – St. Paul.</span> <span id="s55">The people from the Jewish Family Service picked us up and treat us like children, like private relatives, they did the best I have known, any people, anybody can do.</span> <span id="s56">They picked us up, took us to the apartment, it was a small apartment…but it was with new linens, not expensive, cheap, and dishes, and – but new, and nice.</span> <span id="s57">They didn’t have to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">WH: They put food in the refrigerator?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">BN: They put food in the refrigerator, and they treat me like my mother would…they came, they cared.</span> <span id="s60">And they were there to take me in and say “here,” and “this” and I couldn’t speak, and they came from the Jewish Family Service and took me out to their place, and they took a lady because Sandy was here and I didn’t have no clothes…so they took a lady, and I hear the lady say, “Take this young couple, and take—.”</span> <span id="s61">I said, “I don’t need anything!</span> <span id="s62">I will get—.”</span> <span id="s63">“Treat them, go down to the story and buy something for the kid.”</span> <span id="s64">She was 18 months old.</span> <span id="s65">So they did, that’s why I am working for Federation or any kind of a Jewish cause, because I think what the HIAS and the JOINT did, what the Jewish Family Service did, it’s really indescribable.</span> <span id="s66">I think that they’re doing a good job.</span> <span id="s67">Very nice.</span> <span id="s68">Really nice.</span> <span id="s69">They really cared.</span> <span id="s70">They had volunteers, they had people to teach you how to speak English, they cared….</span></p> <p><span id="s71">WH: Without that you would have been lost?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">BN: I don’t know if I would have been lost or not.</span> <span id="s73">I would have find my way somehow because that’s me.</span> <span id="s74">But at least they were there, pick me up, take me, they tried.</span> <span id="s75">They tried…</span></p> <p><span id="s76">WH: When you say, “that’s me,” are you also saying that that’s also in a way, how you were able to survive the war?</span> <span id="s77">I mean, your personality that you</span></p> <p><span id="s78">would give yourself--.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">BN: …right – we were survivors.</span> <span id="s80">We survived worst that that, we will survive, but it’s so much easy, when you come to a city, Milwaukee, and you don’t know anybody…and you have someone to take you around, to show you.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">WH: So what kind of jobs were you looking for in St. Paul…?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">BN: I did not have a trade.</span> <span id="s83">I was a kid.</span> <span id="s84">So I didn’t have a trade….</span></p> <p><span id="s85">WH: What year were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">BN: 1923…when I came over here I was 26, 27 years old…so when I came over here, and no real trade, we stayed 4 years in Germany doing nothing… so it was hard to get work…and people offered 75 cents an hour, not only a greener, - anybody for a dollar, dollar ten.</span> <span id="s87">This were the wages…so I know a landlord there who was a alte greener,[old newcomer] - and he had some apartment and he asked me along and help them a little bit, something, so I helped them…he painted, I painted…he give me 5 bucks a day and it’s fine…I didn’t know anything about painting or paper hanging, but I said, “If he can do it, I can do it.”</span> <span id="s88">So I started off a little bit, but – for about 4 months I couldn’t find no work.</span> <span id="s89">The JOINT supported me….”</span></p> <p><span id="s90">WH: …did you like have a group of people to hang around with when you first came</span></p> <p><span id="s91">here?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">BN: Yah, we had all the greeners [newcomers].</span></p> <p><span id="s93">WH: Did they all live in the same place, in the same area?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">BN: Yah…</span></p> <p><span id="s95">WH: Where did you meet?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">BN: The park, or we had some meetings from the Jewish- …the New American Club.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">FN: We were looking for each other…we didn’t have no family so we--.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">WH: No relatives anywhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">FN: No</span></p> <p><span id="s100">BN: Well, we – even right now, even as of today, we are feeling very comfortable… Sure, I have other friends, but we do feel very comfortable, with your own people.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">We speak Yiddish and you have fun with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">WH: Of your 4 best friends now, are they all survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">BN: …I would say two and two…</span></p> <p><span id="s104">WH: Of your ten, fifteen best friends, you’d say the majority of them are survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">BN: Sure, of course…we travel together on vacations.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">FN: There’s one family we go – for 30 years already together…we make parties,</span></p> <p><span id="s107">dinner dances….</span></p> <p><span id="s108">WH: …Why did you come to Milwaukee?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">BN: …I ran out of place to go to work and my brother lived over here, so I came over here…so I found a job as a painter…and Wallerman came after me…</span></p> <p><span id="s110">WH: …when you go through something really terrible, and you actually make it, I think those people who make it together are bound closer together because of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">BN: There’s another little thing, (inaudible) you must not forget that Europe was a different kind of a life there.</span> <span id="s112">When we came over here, 30, 40 years ago….</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Nobody knocked on somebody’s door.</span> <span id="s114">And nobody called “I’m coming over.”</span> <span id="s115">You opened the door, “Good morning!”</span> <span id="s116">(inaudible) and “How are you?”</span> <span id="s117">And if I was sleeping, he came into my bedroom…(inaudible) we didn’t have to call, there was nothing formal…this was way of European life, and now we became Americanized, we hate it because, you should call before, maybe somebody is there, and maybe he doesn’t want me.</span> <span id="s118">Before, we never thought of this.</span> <span id="s119">You just went.</span> <span id="s120">He watches television, I watching television…(inaudible)…</span></p> <p><span id="s121">FN: …Even if I would invite somebody, and somebody else came, they always were welcome.</span> <span id="s122">They know it.</span> <span id="s123">They knew.</span> <span id="s124">And we felt the same way by somebody</span></p> <p><span id="s125">else.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">BN: This is European…it’s European way of being the way we are raised.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Somebody’s there, I walk in, so what!</span> <span id="s128">Put another chair.</span> <span id="s129">Essen sex, essen acht.</span> <span id="s130">[Eat six, eat eight] See what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">WH: ...one of the things I’m writing about is the sense of community that the survivors, in a way, brought over with them when they came here…</span></p> <p><span id="s132">BN: Each and every one you gonna talk to, if they honest with themself, they will say, we wish it wouldn’t be like this.</span> <span id="s133">We wish we can go back so we can not be as formal because life was nice.</span> <span id="s134">We didn’t have to call.</span> <span id="s135">And not to go.</span> <span id="s136">You felt like going, you went, you come, you eat, you be, you do, you go.</span> <span id="s137">And now, it’s very Americanized.</span> <span id="s138">Call before you leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">WH: What else would you say means “Americanized?”</span></p> <p><span id="s140">BN: Americanized, well…we used to be younger and maybe as we struggled, we were more charitable maybe.</span> <span id="s141">Easier charitable now than not.</span> <span id="s142">Now we afraid for the tomorrow.</span> <span id="s143">As people growing old charity begins at home…and I don’t appreciate these things.</span> <span id="s144">Some people they can afford to help, and they don’t… it used to be in Europe that you were more charitable, you give of yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Tzedakah [charity] was the first thing in your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">WH: It’s very important.</span> <span id="s147">I saw you, you were on the phone before with something to do with JNF.</span> <span id="s148">Do you raise money for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">BN: Yeh.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">WH: …do you find that survivors tend to be more generous than the American Jews, or less, or the same?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">BN: There are two ways to look at that.</span> <span id="s152">The average American Jew, who makes as much as a greener will not be as charitable.</span> <span id="s153">The charitable, the average American Jew, the average American greener who is here, but the American Jew up there, gives a lot of money.</span> <span id="s154">There’s 5% who they give 50 and 120 and a half million dollars.</span> <span id="s155">But the person who makes only $30,000 dollars, he says, “I cannot afford it.”</span> <span id="s156">He will go golfing, but he will not give $50.</span> <span id="s157">for Israel, or JNF, or Federation or buy Israel bond.</span> <span id="s158">He wouldn’t buy that…you see, the refugees, the one thing about us, right after the liberations, they put most of them in a D.P. camp...and we are used to nem, nem, nem [take, take, take] but don’t give.</span> <span id="s159">The UNRA give you, the HIAS give you, nem, nem …give, give, give.</span> <span id="s160">And they became schnorrers [beggars].</span> <span id="s161">If you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s162">So they came over here, and they also, what is the HIAS giving?</span> <span id="s163">You know, it’s hard to get out of these things.</span> <span id="s164">I don’t say all, but some of them.</span> <span id="s165">Now they have a hard time of – let go…(inaudible)…about newcomers, come to give, they give money.</span> <span id="s166">Milwaukee is a good town.</span> <span id="s167">Milwaukee has not too many a wealthy greener…</span></p> <p><span id="s168">WH: …how did you get into the construction business?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">BN: Well, I was a painting contractor, and my brother was a carpenter, he was a cabinet maker at home…and I put myself together, I had people working for me as a painter…after two years, I want my own business…and I decided that painting is a bad business.</span> <span id="s170">It’s drunken painters…and I work for some builders and I seen how the builders do.</span> <span id="s171">And this what encouraged me.</span> <span id="s172">There’s one biggest builder in Milwaukee, he’s one of the largest even in the United States, Tom Realty, and I was painting, -and four guys came in with the car, I’ll never forget this, open four doors of the car, walked around, looked around, and five minutes, they are in the car, close four doors –pssht –I say… “This is the job I want.”</span> <span id="s173">I hate to be a painter.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">WH: …How did you get into that position…?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">BN: …we had $1,800 we saved some money and we bought him out…my brother was a carpenter, and I was a painter, and I support two families at that time.</span> <span id="s176">You see, our needs were not as big…we bought two lots…and we built one and we start the other one, and lucky us, we put in the first house, and sold it and made $1500…we built two family…then four family…then ten family…</span></p> <p><span id="s177">WH: …(Discussing other real estate people and Vineland)…</span></p> <p><span id="s178">BN: I’ll tell you about some of our people.</span> <span id="s179">Some of our people were very aggressive.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">FN: Hard workers.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">BN: They knew how to finagle.</span> <span id="s182">How to make a bu-how they out-didn’t outsmart, but they were a business thinking.</span> <span id="s183">If a person who went to a camp, he had to read somebody else’s mind.</span> <span id="s184">If I look at you, I knew what you were thinking.</span> <span id="s185">I mean, I used to push all that psychology.</span> <span id="s186">I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s187">And many of us, that’s what they did.</span> <span id="s188">They came, they foreseen, they bought, they went, they run and they bought.</span> <span id="s189">Some of them didn’t because they didn’t have that drive, so they worked for the watchmaker, and the carpenter at somebody’s place…(inaudible) but our people as a whole, I must say, are not as—I’ve been working with Federation,-- as a whole, the United States, our people are getting lost that comes to give away money.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">WH: What do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">BN: They don’t give the amount that they can afford to give, like Federation.</span> <span id="s192">Like buying Israel bonds.</span> <span id="s193">They do not…but then again, there’s a percentage who give.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">But not as a whole.</span> <span id="s195">As a whole, they try to shine away…</span></p> <p><span id="s196">WH: Have you been to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">BN: Many times…six times.</span> <span id="s198">My son got married in Israel…but unfortunately they divorced…she’s from Tel Aviv…she’s a very nice girl, and I’m proud of her.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">But it didn’t work out.</span> <span id="s200">And it’s better like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">WH: Where is he now?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">BN: He is here and she is somewhere in Texas…anyhow, she was too young, and he was too young.</span> <span id="s203">He was 20, and she was not even 18…no children….</span></p> <p><span id="s204">WH: Did he get married again?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">BN: He is not yet…between then he met a non-Jewish girl and I wasn’t so happy</span></p> <p><span id="s206">about it…</span></p> <p><span id="s207">WH: Do you think that happens pretty often among survivors…?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">BN: Too often, too many of our kids—too many of our kids intermarry!</span> <span id="s209">Too many!</span></p> <p><span id="s210">The trouble is with us, and I am, maybe I’m not religious enough, but I am Jewish, very Jewish, and if I see a greener or a no-greener (inaudible) Jewish kids, or any Jewish kids, who intermarries, I feel it’s like giving me a shtuck right in here, because I feel first, it’s not the same.</span> <span id="s211">It’s not only you marry the person, but you marry more than the person.</span> <span id="s212">You marry the father and mother and brother and sister and the kids go there and they gonna see a Christmas tree and they gonna go to church, and they have relatives and they have cousins on the other side, and the whole thing is not the same.</span> <span id="s213">And that what bothers me the most.</span> <span id="s214">If you bring a girl who’s not Jewish from Belgium, from Australia, where she’s not got anybody here.</span> <span id="s215">And she’s here, and she became Jewish, then she’s Jewish.</span> <span id="s216">But once they living here, and she has a grandmother and grandfather, a sister and a brother and an uncle like we have.</span> <span id="s217">Maybe more.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">“And why did we get married?”</span> <span id="s219">“I be a son of a gun, I don’t know.”</span> <span id="s220">I cannot understand that.</span> <span id="s221">The Jewish girl says, “There are no Jewish boys,” and the Jewish boys say, “There are no Jewish girls.”</span></p> <p><span id="s222">WH: And doesn’t the Holocaust survivor say to his children, “After everything that I</span></p> <p><span id="s223">went through?”</span></p> <p><span id="s224">BN: How long do you think my son, it took him to go and be open with a girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">WH: He told you later that he had known her for three years?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">BN: I knew he was dating a little.</span> <span id="s228">But he would never go in a public with her, because we didn’t accept her.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">FN: And some friends ours, they saw him once with her, and he was so ashamed.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">He was not just ashamed, he was afraid that my friends gonna tell us that he went with a shiksa [non-Jewish woman].</span></p> <p><span id="s231">BN: He feels very guilty himself…if she would be Jewish, he would want to marry.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">But he still is hesitating, even he likes her, she’s a nice girl.</span> <span id="s233">The only problem</span></p> <p><span id="s234">is…she’s not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">WH: What is her nationality…?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">BN: I don’t know…she’s not practicing…her mother wants to become Jewish!</span></p> <p><span id="s237">FN: She is going to Rabbi (name?)</span> <span id="s238">to become Jewish.</span> <span id="s239">I never want to meet her.</span> <span id="s240">I said to my son, “You got a choice, me or her” because I don’t want to have--.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">WH: But you will accept her eventually?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">BN: Now she’s accepting…</span></p> <p><span id="s243">FN: I will tell you – why…he knew her already for four years, then he came once and he said, “Mother I got to talk to you.</span> <span id="s244">She’s a poor girl.”</span> <span id="s245">I didn’t know her.</span> <span id="s246">I never wanted to talk to about her.</span> <span id="s247">I didn’t – never want to hear about any shiksa.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">So he said, “I got to talk to you.</span> <span id="s249">Mother, if you gonna call me, and you gonna hear a voice, from a girl, you should know that’s Kathy.</span> <span id="s250">She moved into my apartment because she can’t afford to pay rent because she goes to school… End of Tape #1, Side A Tape #1, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s251">WH: …you have to make up…</span></p> <p><span id="s252">FN: When my son talked to me, and he said, “Mother, please just meet her.</span> <span id="s253">Don’t worry, I will not hurt you, I’m not marrying her, but just meet her.</span> <span id="s254">What is her fault – she’s a very fine, intelligent girl.</span> <span id="s255">But what is her fault, that you are so afraid, that you were in concentration
