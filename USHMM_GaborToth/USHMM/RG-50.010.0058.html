May.</span> <span id="s5">I was born in Union Springs, Alabama in 1912.</span> <span id="s6">I entered the service in the winter of 1944 and went overseas in December of that same year.</span> <span id="s7">In April of 1945, I was with the 271st Infantry of the 69th Division.</span> <span id="s8">My duty was Battalion Chaplain with the Second Battalion.</span> <span id="s9">Our Division was assigned a mission of pursuit of the retreating Germans, and our final objective was the Mulde River.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">Q: When did you become a chaplain approximately?</span> <span id="s11">A: April 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: And you were ordained where?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: I was ordained a Methodist minister, and I had been serving a parish in south Georgia when I entered the service.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: And what was your military rank when you were in the service?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: I entered as a First Lieutenant and at the time of this action I was Captain.</span> <span id="s16">Q: And when were you released or discharged from the service?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: In August of 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: As a captain?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: As a major.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: Do you want to tell us how you found out about it when you say that your mission...</span></p> <p><span id="s21">just how did this come about?</span> <span id="s22">Were you notified orally or what’s your recall?</span> <span id="s23">I know it is a long time ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: A mission, of course, was given to the Division by a higher command.</span> <span id="s25">And my Battalion had a subordinate mission within that larger mission.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Did you have any specific role as a chaplain or were you just one of the officers?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: At this time I was traveling with the Medical Battalion, because they felt the Chaplains' ministry was most important for the casualties who were coming through, so as long as we were on the move or in combat, I moved with the medics and set up with them in their aid stations.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: When did you first hear about the camp that I will ask you to describe and identify in a moment?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: We moved in to the city of Tausha on April 20th.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: You say "We."</span> <span id="s31">Was that the whole Division or just your Battalion?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: The Medical Battalion with which I was moving which meant, of course, that the forward elements of the Division had already moved beyond us up almost to the Mulde.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: When you say "beyond," in what direction would that be?</span> <span id="s34">A: East.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: In other words, you were going from west to east.</span> <span id="s36">And Tausha would be some miles, almost directly east of Leipzig?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s38">Perhaps I should mention that the Third Battalion of our Regiment took the city of Leipzig, which was hardly a major military engagement, because of the situation.</span> <span id="s39">But after the Third Battalion took the city of Leipzig, the Battalion with which I was moving by-passed Leipzig, went around it toward the east, and moved into Tausha in preparation to support the attack on the city of Eilenburg, which was on the Mulde.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Had you known anything about a concentration camp at the time your military group entered Tausha?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: No.</span> <span id="s42">And I should say that I knew nothing about the nature of this facility, but we had hardly settled in Tausha before the word was passed around that there was this facility of some kind out there which we should see.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Why do you use the word facility?</span> <span id="s44">Is that the word that comes to mind?</span> <span id="s45">A: It’s the word that comes to mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: You don't know how it was described at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: No I don't.</span> <span id="s48">I have on the back of a photograph which I took this note which I sent to my wife.</span> <span id="s49">This was at an airplane factory near Leipzig.</span> <span id="s50">That's my note there, written at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: This is a photograph you are handing me.</span> <span id="s52">It is about one and a half by two and a half [inches], and it is a black and white photograph.</span> <span id="s53">On the back of it, you have written something.</span> <span id="s54">Is this in your own handwriting?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Will you just read it, please?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: “Two foreign workers burned to death in their barbed wire enclosure at an airplane factory near Leipzig.</span> <span id="s58">The work of SS men."</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: You took this photograph yourself.</span> <span id="s60">I notice on the back it has no date.</span> <span id="s61">Do you know the approximate date you took it?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: The date was approximately the 25th of April 1945.</span> <span id="s63">I was at Tausha from April 20th to May 2nd.</span> <span id="s64">It was some time within that period that this photograph was</span></p> <p><span id="s65">taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Do you want to tell us about what you called the facility -- the circumstances as to how you got into the camp or why you were at the camp.</span> <span id="s67">Were you directed to go?</span> <span id="s68">Was it curiosity?</span> <span id="s69">Was it official duties?</span> <span id="s70">I am using the word camp.</span> <span id="s71">You used the word facility.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: From your own recollection, Professor May, tell us, specifically, how you happened to view as an individual or how you happened to go to the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: It was common knowledge passed around amongst military personnel that there was a terrible scene, out here at this place, which was surely of interest and something which we ought to see.</span> <span id="s75">Moreover, the word was passed around amongst us that the military government was going to require the civilians to go see it and look at it, because many of them said they had no idea that this kind of thing existed.</span> <span id="s76">I don't recall the exact date that we went out...</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Except that it was between April 20 and May 2.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: Within this period, yes.</span> <span id="s79">The day that we went out, there were a considerable group of civilian persons lined up there.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: You say civilians.</span> <span id="s81">You mean Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Germans.</span> <span id="s83">Ready to be taken through to be required to view this.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: You mean German civilians who were not part of the camp personnel.</span> <span id="s85">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Was it right in the city of Tausha?</span> <span id="s87">A: As I recall it, it was in the environs.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: How big is Tausha?</span> <span id="s89">Is it a small town?</span> <span id="s90">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s91">I simply don't recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: Where were the American troops?</span> <span id="s93">Where were they housed, including yourself?</span> <span id="s94">A: As I recall, there was considerable real estate there, as we called it, which was not kaput, had not been bombed out, and this was always prized by the advancing troops because they wanted a more comfortable facility.</span> <span id="s95">And these were the most comfortable facilities that we had had for several weeks.</span> <span id="s96">At the same time, there was much devastation all around us , but there was surviving real estate which was fairly comfortable.</span> <span id="s97">Q: And the camp was outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Yes, as I recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: You said that when you approached the camp, there were a number of German civilians waiting to be observers or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: As I recall it, the military government required these civilians, I guess through subordinate German officials, to come out and view this camp, because so often in those days we were hearing people say, "We had no idea this kind of thing was going on."</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: What do you remember from the physical things?</span> <span id="s102">What do you remember seeing or smelling or observing?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: I ought to say in the first place that what I recall and the very little that I recorded was hearsay evidence.</span> <span id="s104">I did not try to find papers to validate or verify the information, but the “common knowledge” 1 was that this was a facility which had housed workers in that airplane factory.</span> <span id="s105">My assumption was that they were largely “foreign workers.”</span> <span id="s106">2</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: You say aircraft factory.</span> <span id="s108">Do you know of an aircraft factory being in the immediate vicinity?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: It was what you heard.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: All that my hazy recollection can recall now is this extensive facility with a great deal of barbed wire, watchtowers, and very plain minimum barracks facilities.</span> <span id="s112">One of the barracks, as I recall, had been burned down and there was a number of bodies piled up around the entrance way of this building.</span> <span id="s113">Burned.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">All their 1Professor May put quotes around this word/phrase himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">2Ibid.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">clothing burned off.</span> <span id="s117">They were naked.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Did you see if they were men and women, old, young?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: As I recall it, they were men.</span> <span id="s120">Grown men, mature men.</span> <span id="s121">I don't recall anything said about women or children.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: You didn’t see any?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A:.</span> <span id="s124">Didn't see any, as I recall, but their clothing had been burned off, and the corpses were all stiff.</span> <span id="s125">Apparently they had been there some time.</span> <span id="s126">Several days.</span> <span id="s127">The word which we had was that just before the Americans came in, the SS men fired this whole thing, and there were some bodies caught up on the barbed wire fence around where they apparently had tried to escape.</span> <span id="s128">These we understood had been machine-gunned by the SS men.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: When you say you saw the corpses of men and their clothes burned off, you mean they had no clothes at all or just part of it burned?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: As I recall it, practically no clothing in many cases.</span> <span id="s131">But that picture that I have there looks like that body has...that would look like all the clothing had burned off, wouldn't it?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s133">I know this would be a rough estimate, but how many corpses do you remember having seen?</span> <span id="s134">In the dozens?</span> <span id="s135">Scores?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: I would say in the dozens as I recall it now.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Do you know how long they were lying there?</span> <span id="s138">Was it days, weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: I assume they had been lying there for a number of days, because of the stiffness of the bodies.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: At the time you got there, were there any German guards?</span> <span id="s141">A: Don't recall any.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Do you recall any camp personnel at all?</span> <span id="s143">What was there beside the buildings and some of the corpses?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: That I don't recall.</span> <span id="s145">I assume that this was under some kind of American command at this time.</span> <span id="s146">I don't recall any difficulty in getting in to see it.</span> <span id="s147">There was no need for permission or permits or anything like that, so it was apparently open to the public.</span> <span id="s148">It may be that it was under military government.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: When you say military government, do you remember if that was run by the Americans in concert with the Russians or the French?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: There were no Russians there yet.</span> <span id="s151">We had a military government detail of some kind attached to our Division.</span> <span id="s152">I think it must have been rather small, and sometimes this military government unit with our Division would call in military government from Corps and [unintelligible] where there was special need for it.</span> <span id="s153">In other words, they could augment from higher headquarters when they needed to.</span> <span id="s154">But I simply don't recall the situation at that time there.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: You don't remember seeing any SS men or any German military?</span> <span id="s156">A: No, they were gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: But you do remember seeing German civilians, and what do you remember about them, other than being lined up to visit?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: It looked like just mostly older people, in civilian clothes, and my assumption was that they had been rounded up by the Burgermeister and the local German officials who said you got to go out there and look at this thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: What was your reaction then when you saw the Germans going through?</span> <span id="s160">Did you realize at that time why they were required to go through?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s162">Because so long as we moved through, we had heard Germans denying that this kind of thing could have gone on, or incredulous toward this kind of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: So you realized at that time the reason for it.</span> <span id="s164">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Had you had any contact at the time with German civilians?</span> <span id="s166">Do you speak</span></p> <p><span id="s167">German?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Not very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Do you recall ever having any conversation with any German civilians at that time about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Nothing specific.</span> <span id="s171">After this, I remember a conversation with an aristocratic woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">We went back later and we lived in the [unintelligible] which was this woman's home.</span> <span id="s173">It was a few miles to the east of this.</span> <span id="s174">And she was in her 70s.</span> <span id="s175">I remember a long conversation with her, and I said "You are here, reasonably close distance to this thing that I saw.”</span> <span id="s176">I called it this Tausha mess.</span> <span id="s177">“Why was nothing said about this?”</span> <span id="s178">She said, “Well, if we had opened our mouths, we would have been there too."</span> <span id="s179">Q: Did she speak English?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Some of the questions I will ask now are obviously subjective.</span> <span id="s182">You were, of course, a much younger man then.</span> <span id="s183">Do you recall what your feeling was at the time?</span> <span id="s184">You didn't see any women.</span> <span id="s185">You didn’t see any children.</span> <span id="s186">You saw maybe dozens -- I believe you said dozens -- of burned out bodies.</span> <span id="s187">Did you see anything else other than corpses?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Don't recall other than the incineration of the whole thing.</span> <span id="s189">Q: But there was no crematoria.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: No.</span> <span id="s191">Apparently they had ignited inflammables of some kind within these buildings and tried to lock the people in there and burn them inside the building.</span> <span id="s192">Q: Did you hear what these men were?</span> <span id="s193">Were they Hungarians, Romanians?</span> <span id="s194">Any knowledge as to who they were?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: The word we used in those days, because we had run into so many of them, was Poles and Russians .</span> <span id="s196">But not Russian military, but they were captured.</span> <span id="s197">Q: Not necessarily Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: So far as I know, these were not Jewish people.</span> <span id="s199">That's what I'd like to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">That's why I called Fred.3</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: My own knowledge is I think there were no Jews at that particular camp, but I’m giving you my own....</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: My assumption was that these were workers and they were in this camp for rigid controls.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Do you want to tell me your reaction at the time, not necessarily because you were a clergyman, but you can take that into consideration.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: It was ambiguous.</span> <span id="s205">On the one hand, it was utterly repulsive and sickening, and it 3Fred Crawford, the director of the Witness to the Holocaust Project at the time of the interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">tended to evoke hatred and resentment from me of all that Nazism stood for.</span> <span id="s207">On the other hand, I have to say fairly that I had encountered so much ugliness and cruelty and barbarism and so much suffering amongst the casualties of my own people that one becomes kind of hardened in defense against this kind of thing.</span> <span id="s208">I regret that, but I guess that's a human thing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Professor May, at the time all this happened, back in 1945, do you want to tell us what your reaction may have been and how you may have reflected your thoughts as a clergyman in the military?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: The point at which I confronted "religious”4 issues at this time was in connection with the response of the ordinary GI, who tended to have a great deal of difficulty with seeing so many evidences of the religiosity of the German people.</span> <span id="s211">They would go into a village and the first thing they would see would be the church and they would see the priest.</span> <span id="s212">And when they were ransacking homes as some of the GI's did, they were confronted with crucifixes, religious figures, religious pictures, all kinds of evidence of German religiosity.</span> <span id="s213">They had a great deal of difficulty in squaring this with the evidences of cruelty, and they thought of it as being un-Christian.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Did they come to you?</span> <span id="s215">Do you remember some instances of some of the individual GI’s coming to you about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: Yes, it would emerge in conversation.</span> <span id="s217">I tried to help them in my regular services.</span> <span id="s218">As we moved across and as we had opportunities for 4Professor May put quotes around this word/phrase himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">services, I frequently talked about this question -- the difference between "religiosity”5 and Christianity.</span> <span id="s220">These were Christian groups that I was with.</span> <span id="s221">Q: They weren’t limited to Methodists, though, were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: No.</span> <span id="s223">And at certain times during combat I had both Catholic and Protestants.</span> <span id="s224">Q: Do you remember in this part of Germany, that is the Leipzig area, what the dominant religion was there?</span> <span id="s225">It's not Roman Catholic, is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: This area in here was pretty heavily Protestant.</span> <span id="s227">I remember commenting in my letters the number of times in which I found priests saying Mass in Protestant churches, which was something I had never heard of before.</span> <span id="s228">I think that may have been under wartime conditions, but my hunch is that Catholics were in a minority, but not a minuscule minority.</span> <span id="s229">They had enough Catholics around to have priests.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Is it largely Lutheran then?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s232">That's Luther's birthplace at Eisleben.</span> <span id="s233">And by the way, you might be interested in this, in that city of Eilenburg...I don't know if you recall a Christian hymn that Lutherans, particularly, sing.</span> <span id="s234">"Now thank we all our God, with our hands and hearts and voices.”</span> <span id="s235">The author of that hymn was a pastor in Eilenberg in the 17th century, which was a time of great suffering and famine and pestilence.</span> <span id="s236">And after we took the city of Eilenburg -- I did not know until later about this association -- I conducted a</span></p> <p><span id="s237">5Ibid.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">service in this wrecked church, up on a hill, and we opened that service singing this hymn.</span> <span id="s239">Q: 300 years after it was originally written.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Only later did I find out that that hymn was written by the pastor of this church in this community.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Interesting footnote.</span> <span id="s242">You were talking about the conflicts some of the GI's thought between the symbols of religiosity and the actual combat that was going on.</span> <span id="s243">Do you recall what some of their comments were and what your reaction</span></p> <p><span id="s244">may have been?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: They were incredulous that the people who had committed some of the crimes that they had run into should be as religious as they were.</span> <span id="s246">And they saw around them, particularly the Catholic boys, all of these crucifixes, Catholic para phernalia, and everything.</span> <span id="s247">I don't know the technical name for it, but a home would have the little thing on the wall where you have holy water Over in the Rhineland, where it was almost 100% Catholic, they had a great deal of difficulty.</span> <span id="s248">My preaching was an effort to try to help them see the difference between religiosity and Christianity.</span> <span id="s249">I think I used the terminology real religion and phony religion.</span> <span id="s250">I don't remember specifically....in my letters I've got some of the texts listed that I preached on, but I don't</span></p> <p><span id="s251">recall specific developments.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Do you recall if your experience at Tausha had any specific relevance to any of your sermons?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Yes, it surely did.</span> <span id="s254">On Memorial Day we had moved back, occupying a number of towns and villages, awaiting some decision as to what they were going to do about the Russians.</span> <span id="s255">I was in the tiny little town of Baunersroda.</span> <span id="s256">There it is right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: I believe that is southwest of Leipzig.</span> <span id="s258">Were you there with your military outfit?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Yes, my headquarters was there, and we were there about six weeks, awaiting the Russians.</span> <span id="s260">Apparently they were negotiating with the Russians in higher headquarters.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: And this would have been after VE Day.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: After VE Day.</span> <span id="s263">And the Russians had come up to the Elbe, which was over this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Which was east of Eilenburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Yes, about 30 miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Our division met the Russians.</span> <span id="s267">We were the first persons to meet the Russians</span></p> <p><span id="s268">.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: At Torgau.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: That's by the Elbe.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Yes, that's on the Elbe.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">I remember standing in Eilenburg and seeing all of the big brass and the generals coming through in their jeeps going over to Torgau to talk to the Russians.</span> <span id="s274">Wasn't one of the big summits held about this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: Anyway, they were negotiating with the Russians, and ultimately the Russians came in and occupied all of this, but we were holding this territory in here waiting the arrival of the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: Tell us about when you were in Baunersroda.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: I was there for about six weeks, conducting services, in a wide circle around here .</span> <span id="s279">We had two battalions that I was meeting with.</span> <span id="s280">We would have a company here and a company there and around different places.</span> <span id="s281">And all in all, on Memorial Day we had a tremendous Battalion formation.</span> <span id="s282">We had trucked all the battalions in to Freiburg.</span> <span id="s283">Let me see where Freiburg is.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Freiburg is on the Saale River.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: That's just due south of Baunersroda.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: We trucked the whole battalion in there and had a Battalion formation in a very big outdoor amphitheater, up on a mountain.</span> <span id="s287">I don't know whether it had been a Nazi thing or not.</span> <span id="s288">I had no idea.</span> <span id="s289">But at any rate, it was a very attractive outdoor place.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">I have a picture upstairs if you want to see it that bad.</span> <span id="s291">I made the Memorial Day address, but one of the things I hammered on....would you be interested</span></p> <p><span id="s292">in seeing that?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">[Interruption in tape.</span> <span id="s295">Conversation resumes as follows.]</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Professor May, you have given me a copy of a paperback booklet, which was captio ned Shelby to the Elbe, Fighting 69th, Company A, 369th Medical Battalion.</span> <span id="s297">I understand this is a sort of an informal history of the Company A of the 369th Medical Battalion which you just got a copy of.</span> <span id="s298">It consists of approximately 80 pages, and there are small segments of various places that the Battalion had been in during World War II.</span> <span id="s299">There</span></p> <p><span id="s300">is a portion referred to as Tausha, Germany, and written by a Jim Crossley, and it is approximately a page long and there are brief references to Tausha.</span> <span id="s301">Would you be good enough to read just these two paragraphs, which briefly refer to th e camp or facility at Tausha, or outside Tausha?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: "There are many liberated slave laborers here in Tausha.</span> <span id="s303">At each meal they waited patiently for the food that might be left over and thrown away.</span> <span id="s304">It was in this town that we met and adopted our friend, Steve, the Greek sea captain.”</span> <span id="s305">And the last paragraph: “We visited a former German concentration camp on the</span></p> <p><span id="s306">outskirts of Tausha and saw horrors that seared our memories, leaving a scar that will remain forever."</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: You don't know who Jim Crossley is, do you?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: He was an enlisted man, that's all I know.</span> <span id="s309">Q: Professor May, you have given me a copy of a two-page letter addressed to "Dear Folks " and which ends "Love to you all, Jimmy."</span> <span id="s310">The caption is 271st Infantry, APO 417, c/o Postmaster , NY, NY, June 15, 1945.</span> <span id="s311">It is my understanding that this letter, copies and the original of this letter, was sent to a number of your family and friends.</span> <span id="s312">You are giving this to me as part of the Holocaust Project.</span> <span id="s313">You make reference to Father Kelley and to Ernie.</span> <span id="s314">I understand Father Kelley is...what's his first name?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Joseph.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Father Joseph Kelley, who is the Catholic priest assigned to the Regiment.</span> <span id="s317">And Ernie is his driver.</span> <span id="s318">You also make reference to a Roy, and Roy is your driver.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">You make reference in the letter to a camp, Dora Camp.</span> <span id="s320">Camp Dora.</span> <span id="s321">Do you remember how far Camp Dora, or Dora Camp is from Nordhausen itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: I can't remember that.</span> <span id="s323">I assume it was in the immediate vicinity.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: Within 10 or 15 miles?</span> <span id="s325">A: Less than that.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: The fifth paragraph in the first page of that letter makes reference to your personal observations of Camp Dora.</span> <span id="s327">The paragraph starts out "4,000 more had been shipped out the day before."</span> <span id="s328">Would you care to either expound on what you saw at Camp Dora, and what your feelings were then and are now?</span> <span id="s329">You made reference earlier to the fact that you were incredulous when you saw what you saw.</span> <span id="s330">Do you remember how long before you wrote the letter you actually saw this?</span> <span id="s331">The letter is dated June 15, but do you know, approximately, when you actually went to Camp Dora?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: Just a day or two before.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: Do you know when, approximately, the camp was liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: I would assume that it had been about the time that Buchenwald was liberated, because they are approximately the same...Buchenwald is down here near Weimar.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Isn't that where Buchenwald is?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s337">I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Right south of here, and so you will notice that Nordhausen may have been liberated before Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Was it liberated by American troops?</span> <span id="s340">A: I assume so.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: When you saw it some time during the first part of June, how long had it been liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: It must have been liberated over a month.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: Do you want to tell us how you felt then, if you remember, when you first saw the crematorium?</span> <span id="s344">Is it singular?</span> <span id="s345">Is there one crematorium or is there</span></p> <p><span id="s346">more?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: There were two furnaces.</span> <span id="s348">Q: Two furnaces?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: You actually saw two furnaces?</span> <span id="s351">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: And the bodies were...bodies or bones?</span> <span id="s353">A: Bones.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: The bones.</span> <span id="s355">They had already been incinerated then?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: You saw no bodies, actually?</span> <span id="s358">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: They had already been incinerated.</span> <span id="s360">You made references to Poles; that is, with a capital P.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Many people had been shipped out.</span> <span id="s362">I refer in the letter there to the fact that the preceding day they had shipped out 4,000 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: In other words, those that were internees?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: I assume so.</span> <span id="s365">And UNRAA was apparently in charge of the camp.</span> <span id="s366">They were feeding the people and I suppose were organizing it, though there was an American headquarters of some kind there.</span> <span id="s367">But the thing that I remember that distracts me as I look back on this experience is my own incredibility...rather, I found this simply incredible.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: What...by the fact that they were ashes?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s370">This was in the crematorium.</span> <span id="s371">Polish laborers in their striped uniforms had played on GI’s and their liberators to get what they could so this had left me somewhat hardened and skeptical about the stories that these people were telling.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Do you know if they were Polish Jews or wouldn’t you have any way of knowing?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: I doubt if they were Jews.</span> <span id="s374">I think they were foreign laborers, POW’s.</span> <span id="s375">My hunch is that all the Jews were gone by this time, if there were any left.</span> <span id="s376">And this camp apparently was in connection with this huge factory that went under this mountain.</span> <span id="s377">It’s unbelievable.</span> <span id="s378">Two tunnels of trains could run through and then tunnels feeding into it.</span> <span id="s379">This is where they were making V-1’s and V-2’s.</span> <span id="s380">6</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: Is it your understanding that the inmates at Camp Dora were supportive labor for this?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s383">I know nothing about the Jewish situation.</span> <span id="s384">That’s what I called Fred about.</span> <span id="s385">I’d like to know.</span> <span id="s386">If you find out...</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: We’ll let you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: But the ones that we saw were these...we called them Poles but they weren’t necessary Poles.</span> <span id="s389">They could be Hungarians or Gypsies or somebody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: They had the black and white striped....</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s392">Black and white stripes that you saw on all of these people.</span> <span id="s393">Many of them had Ost, from the East, up on their [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s394">But as these people who were standing about the furnace there, obviously interested in cigarettes....</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: They were sort of acting as guides?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Sort of acting informally as guides.</span> <span id="s397">Self appointed guides.</span> <span id="s398">So I was skeptical as they were telling the story there.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: In what language?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Broken English.</span> <span id="s401">We’d pick it out of them.</span> <span id="s402">But as I look back on it, I am struck by the fact that I found it hard to believe that these were human ashes and that people had really been burned in those instances.</span> <span id="s403">As Elie Wiesel once said, you’ve got to be ready to believe.</span> <span id="s404">And I wasn’t ready to believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: That’s interesting.</span> <span id="s406">I remember when I was in the service I got either Newsweek or Time magazine and that was the first knowledge that I had of the actual death camps.</span> <span id="s407">That was somewhere in 1945.</span> <span id="s408">At the time you saw this, was this your first physical observation?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: Closest I had been to it outside of my experience over in Tausha which was not 6V-1’s and V-2’s are German rockets.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">a death camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: Did you believe it then?</span> <span id="s412">It was 35 or 40 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: I didn’t believe it then.</span> <span id="s414">As a matter of fact, it’s only after I saw the Holocaust picture on TV that the burden of this thing began to bear down on me.</span> <span id="s415">It was kind of a confession experience.</span> <span id="s416">You just maintain a distance to it.</span> <span id="s417">I was maintaining my distance then.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Did you disbelieve it or figured this was some sort of exaggeration?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: I thought it was a sort of exaggeration.</span> <span id="s420">I didn’t disbelieve it.</span> <span id="s421">This also goes back to my own dehumanization.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: What do you mean dehumanization?</span> <span id="s423">It wasn’t unique to you?</span> <span id="s424">A: I had become hardened to it.</span> <span id="s425">I had seen so much suffering.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: In the military.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s428">You don’t go through...you don’t ride through city after city [unintelligible] and see people scratching around in the ruins without becoming hardened to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: Hardened or insensitive?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Insensitive.</span> <span id="s431">I didn't tell you this a little while ago, but I conducted services on a hill, overlooking that town of Eisleben while they were pouring artillery shells in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Who was pouring?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: We were.</span> <span id="s434">All day long on Sunday.</span> <span id="s435">We sent our troops in there on Saturday.</span> <span id="s436">Q: This would be what month?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: April 20 or 21st.</span> <span id="s438">I was [unintelligible] back at Tausha.</span> <span id="s439">I got in my jeep...</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: And you drove toward Einsleben.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s442">Our troops were all in here, going into Einsleben.</span> <span id="s443">Q: Einsleben or Eilenburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Eilenburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: Eilenburg, that's what you mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: And on Sunday I conducted two or three services.</span> <span id="s447">Q: In Eilenburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: In little towns on the outside here.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: You conducted services in the third week in April before the Americans had taken the</span></p> <p><span id="s450">city of Eilenburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Our First Battalion was going in, and I was with the Second Battalion.</span> <span id="s452">Our Second Battalion was not in the fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">[End of Side One.</span> <span id="s454">Side Two continues as follows.]</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: I want to amplify your letter on Nordhausen.</span> <span id="s456">A: I was just saying that...</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: Being incredulous is what you said.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: The experiences which we had been through overloaded us emotionally, and we got to the point where it was hard to believe, hard to be sensitive to the thorough dimensions of the tragedy which we were viewing.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: Do you think that your colleagues had the same reaction?</span> <span id="s460">A: I am afraid they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: They were all incredulous?</span> <span id="s462">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: There were just two or three others there with me, and we all had that same experience, but I really ought to speak only for myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: You didn't associate the observation of the bones, the crematorium, necessarily with the planned destruction of the Jews, did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: No.</span> <span id="s466">I knew all that in the back of my mind, but....</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: You didn't see this as primarily...that is, your observation of the crematorium and the stacks of bone ashes as primarily a Jewish persecution?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: No.</span> <span id="s469">It is going to take a long time for us to begin to gather some of the dimensions of all this Holocaust business.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: When, in light of your experience or what you have seen, did it really come down to you what this really was?</span> <span id="s471">You mentioned the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s472">Are you talking about the TV show?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Do you think that may have been the thing that really solidified it or...?</span> <span id="s475">A: It kind of gathered it up.</span> <span id="s476">Over the years...that's 35 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: And over the years as I began to read more and more, such as the Anne Frank story and other material, we began to understand this and to accept the fact that there were brutalities there that we could not even dream of.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Professor May, when you went to Nordhausen, as described in your letter, you didn't see...by that time all the SS guards had gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Do you recall at that time talking to German civilians either at Camp Dora or in the general area about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: I believe we had practically no conversation with German civilians.</span> <span id="s483">This was a very rapid trip we made and we had lots to see.</span> <span id="s484">If you go on through the rest of my letter, you’ll see that we went through that factory, and, again, it was almost incredible for me to believe that all of this was going on underground.</span> <span id="s485">Nobody told us that they would keep these workers underground there for five months at a time in order to ensure secrecy.</span> <span id="s486">I picked that up somewhere, I've got that in the letter.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: Looking back at it now, were you more impressed at the time with the underground facilities than with the crematorium?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: I suspect so.</span> <span id="s489">It just took time for that crematorium thing to [unintelligible].</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: At the time you saw it, it was not what you would characterize as a traumatic experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: No.</span> <span id="s492">I had defenses against it.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: And you say this was a very short trip and from your recollection it made no impression upon any of your colleagues either?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: I would say they reacted pretty much the same way that I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: You have already mentioned that you didn't talk to any German civilians at the time.</span> <span id="s496">I am going to keep this letter.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: In conclusion then, Professor May, your visit to Nordhausen, or specifically Camp Dora, is very brief, and you’ve already described that the impressions were, would you say, rather fleeting.</span> <span id="s499">They didn't stay with you.</span> <span id="s500">Your observation of the crematorium was less than an hour, or how long was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Twenty minutes, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: Twenty minutes and you were with a lot of other people?</span> <span id="s503">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: And then it took a little over a generation for this thing to really sink in.</span> <span id="s505">Is there anything you want to add before I leave and turn the machine off.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: No.</span> <span id="s507">I think not.</span> <span id="s508">As you said, the passing years have blunted the memories on many details, and I would remember very little about Nordhausen if I hadn't written that letter.</span> <span id="s509">Q: You saw the letter.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: The letter is what helps me keep that alive.</span> <span id="s511">Q: I want to thank you.</span></p></body></html>
