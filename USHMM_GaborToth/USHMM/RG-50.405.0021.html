<span id="s17">My mother was born in the Ukraine, in a small place near Kiev.</span> <span id="s18">My father was born in Minsk also.</span> <span id="s19">They met during World War II.</span> <span id="s20">They were evacuated to the south republic and my father was sent there after he was injured.</span> <span id="s21">He was in the hospital and in that place met my mother and they fell in love and came here.</span> <span id="s22">He died fourteen or fifteen years ago.</span> <span id="s23">He died of cancer in Minsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">(grandparents) My grandmother and grandfather lived in Minsk.</span> <span id="s25">And my grandmother, mother of my mother, she lived in the South Ukraine, where my mother was born.</span> <span id="s26">It happened that we lived in Siberia because my father was a military doctor and he served in the Soviet army and we lived very far from the place and maybe one time in three or four years we came to visit our grandparents in Minsk and the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s27">It was a very long trip, about three months.</span> <span id="s28">I stayed in Siberia fifteen years.</span> <span id="s29">It was very hard to live there.</span> <span id="s30">From two to sixteen years old.</span> <span id="s31">When (one is) very young, the world is wonderful.</span> <span id="s32">I thought that I was the happiest child in the world because every day I listen in child-care and school that I'm the happiest boy because I was born in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s33">But on the other hand my friends knew I was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">I had known I was Jewish from when I was maybe six or seven years old.</span> <span id="s35">It was very embarrassing.</span> <span id="s36">My friends told me I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s37">My parents didn't tell me.</span> <span id="s38">All my friends all around teased me.</span> <span id="s39">I don't know [how they knew I was Jewish] -- maybe their parents told them.</span> <span id="s40">I think so because they were also, like me, nine to eleven years old, and they teased me.</span> <span id="s41">My name is different, not Ivanov, Petrov.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">[ANNA: Everybody knows.</span> <span id="s43">It's not a secret.</span> <span id="s44">Because, you know, even if you go to the hospital, everywhere, even in your class journal where they list the pupils, on the last page you can see "Nationality" --Jews.</span> <span id="s45">I remember this very well because I lived not so far from Siberia.</span> <span id="s46">It was near the Ural mountains so I remember this very well.</span> <span id="s47">I was the only one who was Jewish.]</span> <span id="s48">I was the only one who was Jewish in our class and I got a lot of trouble from this, my nationality.</span> <span id="s49">I can expect that every time, at any moment, I can get this name like Jew, Jew.</span> <span id="s50">It's very terrible in Russian because it's very hard to defend yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">I don't think my father was sent to Siberia because he's Jewish.</span> <span id="s52">Maybe.</span> <span id="s53">He was born in Minsk and served in World War II and was injured in the battle with the Germans.</span> <span id="s54">And as soon as he became a little bit healthy he was dropped into the army again and was sent to Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">(Did you have Jewish rituals and holidays?)</span></p> <p><span id="s56">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">([Teasing] Did you tell your mother?)</span> <span id="s58">My father told me I should be proud that I'm a Jew because there were many famous people as Jews, but it was so little for me because I was surrounded in Russia by friends and they were different from me because I can be the best in the class, the best in any activity but then I hear behind my back, "Jew".</span> <span id="s59">It was very embarrassing.</span> <span id="s60">I had very good Russian friends who understood that it wasn't fair, but what could they do?</span> <span id="s61">Now I have very good friends in Russia, because all people are different.</span> <span id="s62">I can't say that all Russians are anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s63">There's a lot of good people in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">(Were there more Jewish families in Minsk?)</span> <span id="s65">Yes.</span> <span id="s66">There were more Jewish families.</span> <span id="s67">For me it was like a gift because I thought that I am one on the planet that is Jewish, and when I came to Minsk I found more Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s68">When we came to Minsk, my father got his illness.</span> <span id="s69">He worked for a couple of months.</span> <span id="s70">My mother worked, she is a dentist.</span> <span id="s71">When she came to Minsk she couldn't find work, but in Siberia she worked as a dentist because there was a big shortage of dentists.</span> <span id="s72">In Minsk she worked as a nurse.</span> <span id="s73">In Minsk I lived with my grandmother and mother, wife and children.</span> <span id="s74">I'm an only child.</span> <span id="s75">It was very difficult living for my parents.</span> <span id="s76">They couldn't let themselves have any more children.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">(Who took care of you?)</span> <span id="s78">I took care of myself.</span> <span id="s79">As a baby, my mother.</span> <span id="s80">She didn't work until I was six.</span> <span id="s81">My earliest memory is when I was at my grandmother's place in the Ukraine, and I remember a very tall tree and I'm sitting on this tree and I can't get down and I was crying and somebody didn't let me get down, maybe some bad guys.</span> <span id="s82">I don't remember how I got there.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">(grandparents - stories) My grandmother told me stories about her living.</span> <span id="s84">You know, it's a little different subject.</span> <span id="s85">It's difficult for me to find the special words for this conversation because I never used them.</span> <span id="s86">But I will try to explain to you.</span> <span id="s87">She lived in a special place for Jews.</span> <span id="s88">It's like round, not ghetto.</span> <span id="s89">They don't allow Jewish people to leave this place.</span> <span id="s90">It has borders.</span> <span id="s91">The czars decreed that there are certain places where Jews live.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">I'd like to tell you about my other grandmother.</span> <span id="s93">She was a very educated woman.</span> <span id="s94">Very highly educated woman.</span> <span id="s95">My father's mother.</span> <span id="s96">She had two educations.</span> <span id="s97">She was an accountant and a dentist.</span> <span id="s98">And also in Russia when there was the first meeting of the all-Jewish Bund she was first delegate... Maybe my grandfather was active too, but I don't know.</span> <span id="s99">He passed away when I was four or five, so I only know stories.</span> <span id="s100">Only my grandmother was politically active.</span> <span id="s101">She dreamed about going to live in Israel.</span> <span id="s102">She told me that I should go to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">[ANNA: I heard that her husband was arrested and put in a jail during Stalin's leadership and just because he was a boss in a factory and he was Jewish at the same time.</span> <span id="s104">That's why he was put in jail.</span> <span id="s105">She remembers that it was very scary.]</span></p> <p><span id="s106">(Stalinism) It affected almost all Jewish families.</span> <span id="s107">The brother of my grandfather was in camps.</span> <span id="s108">He did nothing.</span> <span id="s109">He was a simple worker.</span> <span id="s110">One morning he woke up and somebody was knocking at his door and told him, take your things and go with us.</span> <span id="s111">He asked for what.</span> <span id="s112">They said, "You'll get to know soon."</span> <span id="s113">And he came back only fifteen years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">(Basically happy childhood, but was life in Siberia hard?)</span> <span id="s115">No, I was never hungry.</span> <span id="s116">You know, it may be strange for you, but my father was a very good hunter.</span> <span id="s117">And he taught me how to hunt and fish.</span> <span id="s118">And I picked berries and mushrooms.</span> <span id="s119">I hunted and fished and had a happy childhood.</span> <span id="s120">And I was the only child.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">(about being teased) Sometimes I cried but my father told me "you should be strong, you should never cry, you should fight."</span> <span id="s122">And so I became a fighter and I got a broken jaw... but I fight them.</span> <span id="s123">After I fought I became more popular.</span> <span id="s124">They respected me.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">[ANNA: They considered all Jews chickens.</span> <span id="s126">I don't know why.]</span> <span id="s127">(Could you intermingle with everyone?)</span> <span id="s128">Yes.</span> <span id="s129">They accepted me.</span> <span id="s130">I had friendships with different friends, Jewish, Russian, Byelorussian.</span> <span id="s131">I didn't enjoy school life.</span> <span id="s132">I almost finished school in Siberia, and I finished only a half year in a new class.</span> <span id="s133">I couldn't have very warm relationships and friendships.</span> <span id="s134">It was hard.</span> <span id="s135">Then I became a student at a Polytechnical Institute.</span> <span id="s136">This is after high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">(early memories) I had a lot of obligations [responsibilities].</span> <span id="s138">I brought wood for the stove.</span> <span id="s139">And I brought water from a well.</span> <span id="s140">And I washed dishes.</span> <span id="s141">I grew up fast because we had a small garden.</span> <span id="s142">I took care of it.</span> <span id="s143">It was a big obligation, maybe from age seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">(Any holidays?</span> <span id="s145">vacations, trips?)</span> <span id="s146">No.</span> <span id="s147">There was no travelling around the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">(In school in Minsk) It was a policy in my family that I should get higher education.</span> <span id="s149">My father told me that I should be an educated person.</span> <span id="s150">I wanted to be a doctor because my father was a doctor and my mother, and I had a lot of my father's friends who were teachers in the medical institute.</span> <span id="s151">They told me, "Vladimir, don't even try to go to medical institute because now they are looking not for your knowledge, only for your nationality.</span> <span id="s152">Now we are the last to be picked for the institute.</span> <span id="s153">You should go to the polytechnical because not everybody will want to be an engineer because it's not so easy."</span> <span id="s154">There wasn't a lot of competition for engineering, because it's so small power and salary in Russia.</span> <span id="s155">[ANNA: Afterward it was about two percent.</span> <span id="s156">But I don't know any Jews who graduated from medical school.]</span> <span id="s157">I decided to go to polytechnical institute and spent one summer and I was well prepared and when I passed the exams in mathematics I had a 4.</span> <span id="s158">I understand that if I get a 4, I'll never pass the institute, and I ask why did I get a score of 4, because I answered all of the questions.</span> <span id="s159">And he was upset and asked, what mark do you need?</span> <span id="s160">I said, I want 5.</span> <span id="s161">And he gave me extra very difficult questions and I spent maybe 15 minutes on them and gave him correct answers and he told me, you should be more modest.</span> <span id="s162">I ask, what's wrong, I want to be a student, and he told me, "Okay, you got your 5.</span> <span id="s163">Get out."</span> <span id="s164">I was never in the Communist party.</span> <span id="s165">My father was because he couldn't become a doctor without being a member of the Communist party.</span> <span id="s166">My grandmother, she loved my father and she was proud about it because she has two sons.</span> <span id="s167">She saw that my father was more persistent in his goals.</span> <span id="s168">He was smart and handsome.</span> <span id="s169">[ANNA: I think that he was a real Communist.</span> <span id="s170">He certainly wanted to be a Communist, to live in the U.S.S.R.</span> <span id="s171">He believed in the USSR.]</span> <span id="s172">That's the tragedy of our parents.</span> <span id="s173">I can't understand how it happened.</span> <span id="s174">On the one hand he understands that everybody knows that he's a Jew so everybody can tell him, joke, that you're a Jew.</span> <span id="s175">Under the table joking.</span> <span id="s176">On the other hand, he really believes in Communism.</span> <span id="s177">He believes in Stalin.</span> <span id="s178">To me it's strange.</span> <span id="s179">He loves Stalin because he told me, "When I went to attack in the World War II, to fight, I cried, 'for Stalin, for the Communist party.'"</span> <span id="s180">[ANNA: They didn't even know that he was the greatest anti-Semite.]</span> <span id="s181">(How did you two meet?)</span> <span id="s182">By chance.</span> <span id="s183">I had a friend and sometimes I saw this picture and would ask, "Who is this girl?"</span> <span id="s184">He said, "this is my cousin".</span> <span id="s185">I asked when I could see her and he said never because I know she lives in a different town, not in Minsk, and as far as I know she has a boyfriend and is going to get married.</span> <span id="s186">Okay.</span> <span id="s187">I had known that she came to Minsk and I called her to talk to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">[ANNA: I would never have gotten married to him if he hadn't been so persistent.</span> <span id="s189">When we met you were twenty-three and I was twenty.</span> <span id="s190">Tomorrow it'll be fifteen years.</span> <span id="s191">He was twenty-four and I was twenty-one when we got married.</span> <span id="s192">I went for a holiday to my grandmother.</span> <span id="s193">And he called me, - He was calling me everywhere.</span> <span id="s194">He proposed.]</span> <span id="s195">She thought I was crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">[ANNA: I did not resist very long.]</span></p> <p><span id="s197">(Wedding-Jewish ceremony?)</span> <span id="s198">I have special feelings about this.</span> <span id="s199">I invited a lot of Jewish friends and relatives and I also invited Russian friends.</span> <span id="s200">And I was not comfortable because they heard the Jewish songs, very much Jewish dancing and I feel myself that my Russian friends don't understand.</span> <span id="s201">I have feelings that something goes wrong.</span> <span id="s202">I don't know why.</span> <span id="s203">I'm not afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">[ANNA: I remember - if anybody, my aunt, my grandmother, anybody spoke in Yiddish, I was so embarrassed.</span> <span id="s205">I didn't want anybody to hear this.]</span> <span id="s206">We had a regular wedding, at the government office.</span> <span id="s207">Our parents were with us.</span> <span id="s208">It was a regular Soviet wedding like everybody gets.</span> <span id="s209">It's nothing.</span> <span id="s210">We go there, listen to special words.</span> <span id="s211">After this we exchange rings.</span> <span id="s212">And we give gifts and a little champagne and that's it.</span> <span id="s213">And we had a party.</span> <span id="s214">We invited a special Jewish orchestra.</span> <span id="s215">Jewish and Russian friends.</span> <span id="s216">But I wanted it to be a Jewish wedding.</span> <span id="s217">I think it's very difficult because I've never been to a Jewish wedding in this country, I can't compare.</span> <span id="s218">I wanted to hear Jewish songs, dance Jewish dancing.</span> <span id="s219">(Nothing else before this was Jewish?)</span> <span id="s220">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">[ANNA: I remember one song [Ma....], the only song I remember.]</span> <span id="s222">First time in my life I felt Jewish.</span> <span id="s223">I felt so strange, - I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s224">My parents spoke Russian at home.</span> <span id="s225">My mother speaks Yiddish.</span> <span id="s226">She spoke it with her mother and her family a little bit.</span> <span id="s227">(So they spoke Yiddish at home?)</span> <span id="s228">They spoke Russian and Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">[ANNA: Sometimes my father's mother.</span> <span id="s230">But I didn't like it, because I didn't want to be Jewish.]</span> <span id="s231">In this country, my son speaks without an accent because he wants to be an American boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">[ANNA: No, nobody wants to be different, I think so, especially in this age, when a little bit younger.]</span> <span id="s233">(When in childhood did being Jewish seem a problem to your parents?)</span> <span id="s234">My father wanted me to grow up with other Jews.</span> <span id="s235">That's why he wanted to bring me to Minsk.</span> <span id="s236">He dreamed about this his whole life, then came to Minsk and died.</span> <span id="s237">I worked for 120 rubles a month.</span> <span id="s238">New engineers... only for food and I paid for the apartment.</span> <span id="s239">I lived with my mother.</span> <span id="s240">Our salaries were together.</span> <span id="s241">I didn't live better than others... We lived in two small rooms the size of maybe this room and this kitchen.</span> <span id="s242">My mother, my wife, me, my son, my grandmother.</span> <span id="s243">My grandmother was very sick.</span> <span id="s244">She couldn't move.</span> <span id="s245">It was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">We stand in line to get an apartment for nine years and I pay money, a huge amount of money and when I go to get the apartment they tell me you are not eligible to get this apartment because your grandmother died one year ago and now you have extra area and your mother should leave this apartment and find a smaller one for herself because you're going to go live as a family and your mother will live in two small rooms to exist.</span> <span id="s247">And they tell me, you can't do this.</span> <span id="s248">Why, what is wrong with my family?</span> <span id="s249">I stand in line nine years, I pay 3,000 rubles.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Now you can compare.</span> <span id="s251">I earned in one month 160 rubles and I could collect 3,000 rubles and I paid for my food and clothes, and I give this money to the housing agency and they tell me I'm not eligible!</span> <span id="s252">It's my nature to fight.</span> <span id="s253">I have lots of experience in Russia.</span> <span id="s254">We finally got the apartment.</span> <span id="s255">Because I gave bribes to one lawyer and he got to court and talked to...
