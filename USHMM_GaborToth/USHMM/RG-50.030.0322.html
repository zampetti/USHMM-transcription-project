telling me your name, date of birth, and where you were born please?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Answer: My name Sol Fox.</span> <span id="s13">Now it's Sol Fox.</span> <span id="s14">It was in Polish, where we lived before, Shlomick Fuchs.</span> <span id="s15">I was born September 2, 1922 in Lodz, Poland to a very, very well to do family.</span> <span id="s16">We were seven children.</span> <span id="s17">We were seven children, one sister and six brothers.</span> <span id="s18">I was amongst the two youngest.</span> <span id="s19">The distance between me and my next brother was four years.</span> <span id="s20">Therefore they already were involved in the family business, while I and my younger brother were going to this very famous high school.</span> <span id="s21">If I might explain at this moment, what it meant to get a high school education where we come from.</span> <span id="s22">In this country it's compulsory to have a high school education.</span> <span id="s23">Where we come from in Poland, only seven classes of basic school, you call it Public school, was 01:02:00 compulsory.</span> <span id="s24">High School was either private or they also had governmental subsidized, taxpayers subsidized high schools.</span> <span id="s25">Those accepted only two percent of a small percentage of Jewish students, and they had to be the best.</span> <span id="s26">Therefore, to afford to go to high school, you had to had support of a family that could afford it.</span> <span id="s27">It was expensive.</span> <span id="s28">Almost all in my family did have education at high school education and me and my younger brother who went together, that was a big expense for my parents.</span> <span id="s29">In this way, I'm paying homage to my parents.</span> <span id="s30">A very bright future was in sight that my father, should he rest in peace, planned particularly for me.</span> <span id="s31">Not that I'm trying to point myself out that I was an exceptional son, which was not true at all, because my younger brother was the darling of the house.</span> <span id="s32">He was much smarter and better student, but my father had planned at least one of his sons to become an angromomist and go to Israel.</span> <span id="s33">That was supposed to be me.</span> <span id="s34">So, by that I'm trying to stress the fact how this Holocaust business broke lives from the Shoresh, in Hebrew it means from the root.</span> <span id="s35">I am glad I injected a Hebrew word.</span> <span id="s36">So, we had a normal, beautiful, very beautiful life.</span> <span id="s37">My parents, as I say, were well to do people.</span> <span id="s38">I might add at this point that my mother and my grandfather, I come from a religious home.</span> <span id="s39">My father was dressed religiously, not any more the children.</span> <span id="s40">We started to get modernized.</span> <span id="s41">But my grandfather even owned his own synagogue.</span> <span id="s42">The synagogue that we were praying in, it was like a private synagogue.</span> <span id="s43">I'm not talking about a big building synagogue.</span> <span id="s44">It was like in his private home.</span> <span id="s45">He was a wealthy man, and he owned the building, so he allowed one room for prayers only on Saturdays.</span> <span id="s46">Himself, my parents, were going for like you go here to Sarasota, you know, to baths, will that be explainable?</span> <span id="s47">To Germany, Marienbad, Francisbad, Karlsbad, and when they came back they had the biggest praise.</span> <span id="s48">They were doing that for many years before Hitler, before Nazism.</span> <span id="s49">So, when this thing came on us, the shock was yet bigger, because my parents and my grandfather, and anybody who ever had contact with the German people, couldn't understand what happened.</span> <span id="s50">How could they turn into, and I must say it, and I promised myself on one of the notes, I would not be sarcastic and I will not be insulting to Germany as it is, not as I knew before.</span> <span id="s51">I don't know how they are now.</span> <span id="s52">I really don't.</span> <span id="s53">But, how could they have changed into --- oh, oh, see I lost my thought.</span> <span id="s54">Sometimes we say when somebody is bad you say he's vicious.</span> <span id="s55">He's worse than an animal.</span> <span id="s56">Whenever I get to this point, I say I cannot insult the kingdom of animals.</span> <span id="s57">I hate to see it, but it really comes out of me.</span> <span id="s58">Those Germans, if I would put it at the mildest, not wanted to insult today's Germans, though in doing me a lot of harm already for the last 50 years.</span> <span id="s59">I was in Germany only six months.</span> <span id="s60">I don't want to insult the kingdom of animals, because they were definitely absolutely worse.</span> <span id="s61">You cannot imagine how vicious they were.</span> <span id="s62">You cannot imagine the devotion that they had to that Fuehrer.</span> <span id="s63">Because I learned German in school, too.</span> <span id="s64">We learned Hebrew, German, Polish and Latin in our high school.</span> <span id="s65">It was multi-language.</span> <span id="s66">Polish was the main language.</span> <span id="s67">Hebrew was second, German was third.</span> <span id="s68">My German teacher was a lady who came from a very religious, Jewish home in our city of Lodz, Schneiersohn.</span> <span id="s69">Everybody knew the religious family of Schneiersohn.</span> <span id="s70">There was nothing wrong with the Schneiersohns to have a daughter speaking and teaching German to students with the deepest German dialect.</span> <span id="s71">So, when I have to say it, I know how to and it happened in Court.</span> <span id="s72">I had an incident when I said it in deep German and I'll maybe explain later what it was.</span> <span id="s73">The way the whole thing done in the most murderous, vicious, sadistic, as my teacher said, that he couldn't find words in the world's lexicons,_ dictionaries to express the viciousness and the pain of the Holocaust experience.</span> <span id="s74">I went through high school.</span> <span id="s75">Our system had four classes and two which was called Lyceum.</span> <span id="s76">I made 01:09:00 it through the first of Lyceum because the Germans invaded on Friday morning, 5:00, 1939, September 1.</span> <span id="s77">On September 2, as you remember I was born on September 2, was my birthday, my 17th birthday.</span> <span id="s78">We did not yet realize the scope of the tragedy even if Nazism in Germany started in '33 or even before.</span> <span id="s79">We heard things, even if the media was not as developed as today, but we knew, because it was only a border away.</span> <span id="s80">So, when it came, we knew that a tragedy was coming.</span> <span id="s81">We didn't even use the word tragedy.</span> <span id="s82">We knew tough times were coming.</span> <span id="s83">Bad people are coming.</span> <span id="s84">The Germans are hurting us, even killing some, but little did we realize the scope of it.</span> <span id="s85">To get as I am saying, to try and tell it is to do injustice to it.</span> <span id="s86">It's impossible.</span> <span id="s87">Let me try to give you some small instances.</span> <span id="s88">My sister was married a year before the war, therefore her baby was born the 26th of August one week before the war.</span> <span id="s89">Being that my parents were able to afford, and she married also a very well to do husband, they got an apartment for her in a very fine neighborhood, and it was equipped to the tee.</span> <span id="s90">Why not?</span> <span id="s91">She was the only daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q. Was this a Jewish neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A.</span> <span id="s94">This was not the very Jewish neighborhood where she moved to.</span> <span id="s95">She moved sort of like to the City.</span> <span id="s96">There were Ghetto neighborhood, what we called Ghetto neighborhood.</span> <span id="s97">I lived in a Ghetto neighborhood.</span> <span id="s98">I was born there.</span> <span id="s99">This was the center of Jewish life in the city.</span> <span id="s100">Then came the business section where we had our business, and my sister lived further down.</span> <span id="s101">It was a mixed neighborhood.</span> <span id="s102">As a matter of fact, it was diagonally across from my wife's high school.</span> <span id="s103">But then we didn't realize it.</span> <span id="s104">But, I'm aiming at something.</span> <span id="s105">The name, the landlords of that building, were German.</span> <span id="s106">The population of our city had a lot of Jews, Germans, and Poles.</span> <span id="s107">The population was about 900,000 of which 30 percent was Jewish and a lot of Germans.</span> <span id="s108">Now, these neighbors were Germans, the Richter family.</span> <span id="s109">Very wealthy in the steel industry.</span> <span id="s110">As soon as the Germans arrived and we noticed how bad it got and everybody started running in all directions, my father, my parents -- we were still intact, brought my sister and her baby to our house.</span> <span id="s111">That she shouldn't be alone there, because her husband had to go to attend to his problems.</span> <span id="s112">Everybody had problems.</span> <span id="s113">When she came back to the apartment, it was empty.</span> <span id="s114">Mrs. Richter, the millionaire German landlady, emptied my sister's apartment, because it was all new.</span> <span id="s115">She was just married.</span> <span id="s116">I was chosen by my father because I learned German in school, so he helped himself with me rather than with the other children and not with my younger brother.</span> <span id="s117">You see my younger brother's picture there in the back?</span> <span id="s118">Because he was still too young.</span> <span id="s119">I was already like a man, and I knew the language.</span> <span id="s120">He says go ask Mr. Richter what happened.</span> <span id="s121">So, I went.</span> <span id="s122">I knocked at the door.</span> <span id="s123">It was one flight up, left door, and she opened the door and I said Frau Richter, "Wer hat meiner Schwester Moebel 'rausgenommen? "</span> <span id="s124">Sie sind doch tod" she said to me. "</span> <span id="s125">I was yesterday at the party meeting."</span> <span id="s126">How did I know that she belongs to the party. "</span> <span id="s127">We were told that you were all dead.</span> <span id="s128">Why do you need furniture so I took it out".</span> <span id="s129">Can you imagine anything like that.</span> <span id="s130">I was shocked.</span> <span id="s131">This was the first real shock that went through me.</span> <span id="s132">Because the next shock didn't take very long when they confiscated completely our business.</span> <span id="s133">Where we lived, as I said before, was the Jewish neighborhood where the Ghetto was then formed eventually.</span> <span id="s134">All the others were pushed in here, and we had to share the apartment with everybody.</span> <span id="s135">But to come to the story of how fast they liquidated our businesses.</span> <span id="s136">We had three stores, retail stores, besides wholesale shoes.</span> <span id="s137">On the main street like here you would say Fifth Avenue or 14th Street, call it anything you want, but the main business section.</span> <span id="s138">They drove up with trucks.</span> <span id="s139">Asked no questions.</span> <span id="s140">Broke in the doors, emptied everything and took it away.</span> <span id="s141">But they left a receipt with an address where to come for payment, but the way the whole thing was done was already scary besides we knew what's going on in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q.</span> <span id="s143">When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A. '39, immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q.</span> <span id="s146">In September, right away?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A.</span> <span id="s148">A week, two weeks later.</span> <span id="s149">Immediately.</span> <span id="s150">So, again, my father turned to me.</span> <span id="s151">Who would go?</span> <span id="s152">As I told you before my father was 01:14:)) Jewishly dressed.</span> <span id="s153">Had the beard and pyes, like a religious man.</span> <span id="s154">Naturally, he wouldn't go.</span> <span id="s155">He wouldn't send boys because we figured boys is more dangerous.</span> <span id="s156">But we still underestimated -- rather overestimated the German character figuring that if a woman will go, they wouldn't beat them or do anything wrong to a woman.</span> <span id="s157">Men, it's more dangerous.</span> <span id="s158">So, it was decided that mother went.</span> <span id="s159">It was already curfew.</span> <span id="s160">5:00 was curfew.</span> <span id="s161">Mother went with this receipt to the place where they were told to come, and curfew time came closer and mother didn't come back.</span> <span id="s162">She's not here.</span> <span id="s163">You know we're in trouble.</span> <span id="s164">We realized we're in trouble and started being very, very nervous about it, and again come close to curfew, Father chose me and says go there.</span> <span id="s165">We knew the address where she went.</span> <span id="s166">See where Mother is.</span> <span id="s167">There's not question that you went.</span> <span id="s168">I went there.</span> <span id="s169">We still didn't know the score that it was dangerous even to make a step on the street.</span> <span id="s170">I went there, into the animal's mouth, you know, into an office where my mother was already in jaihl.</span> <span id="s171">I came there it was already dark.</span> <span id="s172">It was getting dark.</span> <span id="s173">So, the lights were on in these offices, and I just started walking around.</span> <span id="s174">I could have been squeezed to death or shot to death or killed or taken right away.</span> <span id="s175">They didn't probably realize who I am immediately.</span> <span id="s176">I didn't see mother.</span> <span id="s177">Now, imagine that I came back without mother, because curfew was over, I was still able to take a tram.</span> <span id="s178">Still able to grab on and get home a little past curfew.</span> <span id="s179">We didn't know that you could have gotten killed for being out on curfew, but I come without Mother.</span> <span id="s180">We never seen her.</span> <span id="s181">That's when we escaped to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s182">After a few days or weeks, I don't remember exactly, Father decided because Litzmannstadt, Lodz was turned into the name Litzmannstadt and it was getting terrorized.</span> <span id="s183">The city was getting terrorized more and more every minute and we realized that being that they already have mother in, they'll lead to us.</span> <span id="s184">Meaning, mainly we talk of Father.</span> <span id="s185">The decision was that my father and his sons, all of my brothers, and my sister and her baby are escaping to Warsaw, which was only supposed to be only occupied territory.</span> <span id="s186">Not incorporated in the Reich, not the Holy Land.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q. Let me ask you a question.</span> <span id="s188">When you say the City was becoming more terrorized, what was happening on the streets?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A. That's a good question.</span> <span id="s190">The Germans came in shortly before - that's a good question -- shortly before Rosh Hoshana.</span> <span id="s191">The Jewish New Year.</span> <span id="s192">Before the war started, already feeling that it was coming, we were digging on order of the government, we had to dig shelters in the street against bomb attacks.</span> <span id="s193">Let me say something, yet better.</span> <span id="s194">Before they came in, big announcements were hung out, what do you call these announcements on walls?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q. Posters?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A. Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s197">That it is not true the rumors that you're hearing about the atrocities about the German Army and the Germans is not true.</span> <span id="s198">Come out when you see the German Army when they come marching in, and greet them.</span> <span id="s199">You hear that?</span> <span id="s200">And everything was going fine and smooth.</span> <span id="s201">We have seen an Army that we didn't even imagine exists because the Polish Army was a thousand years behind with little horse and buggies.</span> <span id="s202">Here at once you see a motorized, not one horse, everything in tanks and on trucks.</span> <span id="s203">We went out in the main street and nothing happened.</span> <span id="s204">That lasted only a day or two.</span> <span id="s205">Then they started grabbing Jews and burying them in the shelters.</span> <span id="s206">That's what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q.</span> <span id="s208">They shot the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A. No, they didn't need to shoot you.</span> <span id="s210">If he wanted, he could shoot you.</span> <span id="s211">They didn't make a big tsimmes, a big deal about how you died.</span> <span id="s212">They wanted you to die the most miserable way.</span> <span id="s213">So, throwing you into a mass shelter like that and covering you up, to them that was a very befitting way to doing it to Jews.</span> <span id="s214">Anyway, we decided to escape to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s215">Escaping to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s216">How do you escape to Warsaw?</span> <span id="s217">Do you buy a ticket on the plane or on the train.</span> <span id="s218">Do you take your car from the garage?</span> <span id="s219">There was no such thing.</span> <span id="s220">Number one, we were immediately forbidden to use public transportation.</span> <span id="s221">Anyway, it was still the beginning and there was still some horse and buggies and imagine when I think of it now, that by horse and buggy and the winter got tough, like in spite, very cold and a baby also with us, and we made it finally to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s222">It's easier said than done.</span> <span id="s223">So, now to describe the terror that happened in these few weeks is as 01:21:00 impossible as to describe the whole thing, because when you're talking about terror, is not only that something happened.</span> <span id="s224">Say, somebody gets killed by a car.</span> <span id="s225">Somebody gets killed by a brick falling down.</span> <span id="s226">That's a tragedy, but that's not terror.</span> <span id="s227">That's why I don't call myself a survivor and I already was talking with our organization.</span> <span id="s228">I'm not big mixer, I don't push.</span> <span id="s229">We're not survivors, we are victims.</span> <span id="s230">Because a survivor is one who gets hurt by any means and then he gets revived and if the other person or realtor has any type of insurance which they do, they will be made good for.</span> <span id="s231">They'll take him to a hospital, and if he's lucky he'll come back as a survived person.</span> <span id="s232">We are not survivers.</span> <span id="s233">We suffered day and night.</span> <span id="s234">Because why did my wife have to have a dream fifty years later that they take the children and it's cold outside and they don't have socks on.</span> <span id="s235">This is not one occasion.</span> <span id="s236">If it's a funeral, a bar mitzvah, a wedding, a card game a restaurant and we were this week twice, that this thing does not come up amongst us.</span> <span id="s237">I don't know if you did realize it.</span> <span id="s238">This is why my neighbor Mary once said to me, "Sol, why don't you start living a normal life?</span> <span id="s239">Get it out of your mind."</span> <span id="s240">Easy said.</span> <span id="s241">Get it out of your mind.</span> <span id="s242">I wish it could.</span> <span id="s243">There is not a day, if more than once a day, if we go to sleep, if we go to eat, if we meet for a game, if we go for a walk, always comes up.</span> <span id="s244">This was -- it cannot be told.</span> <span id="s245">It cannot be told.</span> <span id="s246">As my teacher said, he cannot find expression in the dictionaries of the languages.</span> <span id="s247">You can see that we can go on and on forever.</span> <span id="s248">If you need to go home to sleep, you will not.</span> <span id="s249">So, ask me questions which will lead me in, otherwise I get lost in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q.</span> <span id="s251">You made your way to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s252">Did you go directly there?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A. Oh, you got me back on track.</span> <span id="s254">So, we made our way to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s255">Father, six of his sons, no, five of his sons.</span> <span id="s256">One of our brothers died before the war.</span> <span id="s257">Five sons, his only grandchild which was the light in his eye.</span> <span id="s258">She was only a few weeks old, our first grandchild.</span> <span id="s259">My brother-in-law did not come along because he had a big business to take care of.</span> <span id="s260">He was a big businessman.</span> <span id="s261">I'll tell you how he died.</span> <span id="s262">He was thrown out of a hospital window by the Germans.</span> <span id="s263">We will get to that.</span> <span id="s264">Now, we are in Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q.</span> <span id="s266">You went directly there?</span> <span id="s267">You didn't stay --?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A.</span> <span id="s269">You don't go so directly by horse and buggy to Warsaw, you know.</span> <span id="s270">We stopped over in different places to sleep over and we slept on the street and we slept in Konushki(?)</span> <span id="s271">on city not so far.</span> <span id="s272">The rabbi of Konushki(?)</span> <span id="s273">, his son rather, opened his house for the escapees, and we slept on the floor, masses of us.</span> <span id="s274">When I say we made it to Warsaw, it wasn't the same day.</span> <span id="s275">The locomotives didn't say, hey we're in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s276">No, so, we got to Warsaw, now we are homeless.</span> <span id="s277">A whole homeless family.</span> <span id="s278">There were no brokers or realtors to contact before or anybody provide me a roof over my head.</span> <span id="s279">But somehow, Father had plenty of money, he got an apartment.</span> <span id="s280">It happened to be by coincidence the apartment was placed right across the street from the so called Pawiak.</span> <span id="s281">Pawiak was the most famous prison in Poland or in Warsaw where the first Marshal Pilsudski was imprisoned by the Russians.</span> <span id="s282">By coincidence the building was right across the street from there.</span> <span id="s283">So, we located ourselves.</span> <span id="s284">I'll tell you a little story about this as a side piece that happened in Hollywood between me and a Jew from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s285">Anyway, so my sister became the housekeeper.</span> <span id="s286">She never did that before.</span> <span id="s287">She was just married.</span> <span id="s288">She had housekeepers.</span> <span id="s289">She had everything.</span> <span id="s290">She didn't even know how to make a glass of tea, like any young woman.</span> <span id="s291">After a while my father says what did we achieve.</span> <span id="s292">Where is Mother?</span> <span id="s293">We escaped to save our skin and we don't even know where Mother is.</span> <span id="s294">And here again he appointed that my oldest brother, who passed away last year, and me to go back to Lodz to look for Mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q. I just want to ask you a question.</span> <span id="s296">First of all, how long were you in Warsaw about?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A.</span> <span id="s298">A few weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q. Were the conditions any better there?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A. Just ask everything.</span> <span id="s301">Yes.</span> <span id="s302">You did not feel the Germans on top of you.</span> <span id="s303">It was still reigned by a Polish puppet government, because as I said before Lodz was the Reich.</span> <span id="s304">Hitler reigned already that while the other was protected, Protectorate they called it, occupied territory.</span> <span id="s305">The administration was so to say, not German.</span> <span id="s306">That would be wrong, not Polish, but not German.</span> <span id="s307">Not like in Lodz.</span> <span id="s308">We were able to go in the street and there was a curfew, that already didn't scare us, but we were not -- it was bad.</span> <span id="s309">We knew we were in trouble, but when you're homeless, you're already a displaced person in the worst way, and you are an illegal being.</span> <span id="s310">You don't belong to this world.</span> <span id="s311">God didn't mean you to be existing here.</span> <span id="s312">The sentence, we felt the sentence already.</span> <span id="s313">So, now me and my brother were delegated by Father.</span> <span id="s314">Now, in the meantime it gets cold.</span> <span id="s315">We are getting into the deep winter and Poland is very cold in the winter.</span> <span id="s316">The climate is different.</span> <span id="s317">It's a gorgeous climate, but it's very cold and lots of snow.</span> <span id="s318">How do you get back?</span> <span id="s319">You cannot go by train.</span> <span id="s320">You cannot go by public transportation.</span> <span id="s321">You're Jewish.</span> <span id="s322">Nothing is for you.</span> <span id="s323">We couldn't find the horse that brought us here.</span> <span id="s324">The guy who did it, but there was a pole already available, you know these things develop like black marketing, who bought tickets.</span> <span id="s325">In other words he would go to the station and buy a train ticket, two train tickets for us.</span> <span id="s326">It seems that now we're fine.</span> <span id="s327">We have tickets, all right, but we are still Jewish.</span> <span id="s328">The tickets don't say that we're not Jewish, so we are taking a tremendous chance.</span> <span id="s329">At least we can get into the train now, but the train is only with Germans and Poles.</span> <span id="s330">Not only Germans, and a Jew to be in this, it's illegal.</span> <span id="s331">They don't have to sentence you, they can just shoot you or kick you out while the train runs.</span> <span id="s332">It was a long voyage, and we made it home, and to describe how it was, at one station they recognized us and they chased us, me and my brother, but I was then 17 and my brother was 23, no 27.</span> <span id="s333">He was ten years older than me, my oldest brother.</span> <span id="s334">So, we were younger, and I will never understand in Hebrew they say Yad Elokim in 01:30:00 Hebrew, that means God's hand must have been watching over us.</span> <span id="s335">The Germans were chasing us across the railroad tracks in deep snow with German Shepherds and they didn't catch us.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">End of Tape 1</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A.</span> <span id="s339">We were trying to make our way back to the city of Lodz in search of our mother.</span> <span id="s340">We still do not (know what) happen(ed) to her, where she is.</span> <span id="s341">One of our brothers which I probably did not inject before, remained behind.</span> <span id="s342">My father would not take everybody.</span> <span id="s343">He remained behind just in case to be with Mother or for Mother.</span> <span id="s344">So, we finally made it there, me and my older brother.</span> <span id="s345">It took days and nights.</span> <span id="s346">We came there so to say, finally, safely.</span> <span id="s347">Our other brother was there.</span> <span id="s348">By during that time he was able to find out for money through people like in that particular prison who would bring out information.</span> <span id="s349">You know, everything is money.</span> <span id="s350">Also, he was able then that he knew already to send in a little food to mother.</span> <span id="s351">He found out that mother was in prison without a sentence and was already three months and there she was, but at least we know that she is in prison.</span> <span id="s352">Remember I said before it's still cold winter.</span> <span id="s353">She had no set sentence.</span> <span id="s354">We didn't know that she's coming home at a certain date where we can go there and receive her.</span> <span id="s355">So, again, me, being that I was the best German speaker in the house or learned German in school -- and also because of my age.</span> <span id="s356">We also had still that we lured ourselves with the impression that they wouldn't hurt a woman or they wouldn't hurt the young boy.</span> <span id="s357">They're just out for the real Jews.</span> <span id="s358">So, I was the one who every morning went in front of the prison across the street from the prison.</span> <span id="s359">The city was almost already clean of Jews.</span> <span id="s360">I stood there.</span> <span id="s361">I asked myself very often, I wore a coat, I wore a hat, maybe it was earmuffs or the earmuffs came from the hat, how I lasted a whole freezing day, day in and day out with my eyes glued on the main door, the gate of the prison hoping that Mother will come out.</span> <span id="s362">If we knew the sentence, we would only have to go there or wait until she comes.</span> <span id="s363">We didn't know that.</span> <span id="s364">This took maybe a month or six weeks.</span> <span id="s365">I really don't know, but day after day.</span> <span id="s366">Nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s367">God forbid, not a little warm coffee or water because the surroundings was already German.</span> <span id="s368">I didn't have a chance to go to a door and knock and say give me a drink of water or maybe hot coffee.</span> <span id="s369">How I survived it, just like most of the things are unexplainable and one day me standing there like an idiot watching if Mommy comes out, I come home Mommy is home.</span> <span id="s370">They let her out the back door.</span> <span id="s371">Half of her was left, maybe less.</span> <span id="s372">Three months.</span> <span id="s373">Now you remember why she was there.</span> <span id="s374">She went with the receipt to be paid for what they confiscated all our businesses.</span> <span id="s375">So instead of that, they stuck her in prison without a sentence.</span> <span id="s376">Finally, we had Mother.</span> <span id="s377">So now, the family is divided.</span> <span id="s378">Three of us, me, my brother and the one that was left behind to wait for mother and Mother are here.</span> <span id="s379">Father and the rest of the family are there.</span> <span id="s380">How do you bring this thing together now.</span> <span id="s381">Where is it better to be?</span> <span id="s382">Should we go there?</span> <span id="s383">Should they come here.</span> <span id="s384">The first decision was that we should try to get Father back to Mother.</span> <span id="s385">To go into detail how you accomplish a thing like that will be just -- I lack sometimes the expressions, getting into formalities.</span> <span id="s386">We got Father back, by horse and buggy somehow through payments, through monies, through smuggling.</span> <span id="s387">You had to smuggle from Warsaw to Lodz, because it was a border already.</span> <span id="s388">The border was in Kolushki.</span> <span id="s389">So, finally, the family is getting to be together.</span> <span id="s390">Father is back, but the other two brothers, the sister and the baby, remained in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s391">We're talking not still about 1940.</span> <span id="s392">This is 1940 because Mother went with this receipt in 1939.</span> <span id="s393">She came out it was already 1940, the very beginning of it, the winter of 1940.</span> <span id="s394">So, part of the family remains stuck there and we are stuck here.</span> <span id="s395">We never heard of them again.</span> <span id="s396">The only thing that came through was this picture once in the mail, in 1941.</span> <span id="s397">So, we were lucky.</span> <span id="s398">That was the last sign of their life.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q.</span> <span id="s400">This is a picture of your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A. Of my brother, yes.</span> <span id="s402">This is my brother.</span> <span id="s403">We were like twins, because we were the two youngest in the family.</span> <span id="s404">Show it please.</span> <span id="s405">Show my brother.</span> <span id="s406">But let me tell you the story of the picture.</span> <span id="s407">See, if he can get the piece -- you see that.</span> <span id="s408">Should I tell the story of the picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q. Well, I think you should continue on with the story?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A. So, now we are in Lodz.</span> <span id="s411">It was not yet a Ghetto.</span> <span id="s412">It was not yet a Ghetto, and the other part of the family is in Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q. Could you communicate?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A.</span> <span id="s415">In the beginning there was mail.</span> <span id="s416">No telephone, no thing like that.</span> <span id="s417">There was mail for a while, yes, that's how this arrived.</span> <span id="s418">For a very short time there was a normal mail connection.</span> <span id="s419">No other connection.</span> <span id="s420">Good question.</span> <span id="s421">As I said, I promised to tell the truth so instead of saying there was no mail, there was mail, quite a long time.</span> <span id="s422">Where are we now?</span> <span id="s423">What do you want to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q. Your father and part of your family returned to Lodz?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A. So, now Lodz started developing and developing and setting in motion the Ghetto, in '41.</span> <span id="s426">In '40 it was closed.</span> <span id="s427">They started in '40, but when the fences were created and the Ghetto was locked that was '41.</span> <span id="s428">And if I'm a little off on the dates, you'll have to forgive me because I didn't have a calendar.</span> <span id="s429">I didn't like today do everything on a calendar and I didn't write a diary.</span> <span id="s430">So, dates might be -- not might be, will be, not correct.</span> <span id="s431">At the time we still had three of them there, and then one returned.</span> <span id="s432">His son, who is the lawyer now, through him I got to write this to the museum to begin with.</span> <span id="s433">Two lives start, there are there and we are here and somehow it was considered a plus rather than a minus because the family is divided.</span> <span id="s434">If one wouldn't survive, if Lodz will not survive, Warsaw will survive.</span> <span id="s435">Because we could have reunited ourselves by the very primitive ways of communication as Father came as my other brother came.</span> <span id="s436">All of the rest could have come, too, but it was more logical to 02:09:00 have it divided.</span> <span id="s437">You remember in the Bible when Jacob divided his riches so if he's caught by his brother Esau they all shouldn't get lost.</span> <span id="s438">That's how we did it.</span> <span id="s439">Father decided to already have an apartment there.</span> <span id="s440">Sister was the houselady, the baby was growing.</span> <span id="s441">God knows how old the baby was when it disappeared.</span> <span id="s442">We don't know.</span> <span id="s443">That's how the situation is now, or established itself to that.</span> <span id="s444">We were here and they were there.</span> <span id="s445">Until the Ghetto started closing, and all the new chapter of living in a Ghetto, seeing the creation of it and all true to life in the Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q. Can you tell me how your daily life was.</span> <span id="s447">How things --?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A. Daily life in Ghetto depending on what the Germans had in store for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q. I'm sorry, first of all tell me how you got to the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s450">Were you in the same neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A.</span> <span id="s452">We happened to live -- and I answered it to you before, in the Jewish neighborhood.</span> <span id="s453">The very Jewish neighborhood.</span> <span id="s454">As a matter of fact, I have there a picture of the synagogue which was destroyed which was on our street.</span> <span id="s455">The Germans dynamited the synagogue.</span> <span id="s456">The night that I was sleeping in my sister's house when she still had her apartment, that's how early they did it.</span> <span id="s457">They laid around dynamite for days or weeks because a little before that, they dynamited the Polish heroes monument, you call it Kosciusko, and then they drove over with a tank and they put a chain on his neck and they pulled him down.</span> <span id="s458">Then they destroyed the synagogue, and why to hell they needed an excuse, they needed excuses for nothing, they said because the Jews destroyed the monument of Kosciusko, so the Poles dynamited in revenge the synagogue.</span> <span id="s459">Ridiculous.</span> <span id="s460">So, then they started forming the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s461">They just chased section by section into the territory, and you had to find yourself a place where to get into.</span> <span id="s462">In other words, we took in two families.</span> <span id="s463">Apartments at home weren't as big as here.</span> <span id="s464">Ours was a two bedroom apartment.</span> <span id="s465">By today's standard, it would be one bedroom and one big salon, what you called with beautiful furniture, in case like ours, because we were on the well to do side.</span> <span id="s466">Now, every room was a room for another family to live.</span> <span id="s467">So, we got all squeezed in.</span> <span id="s468">The Ghetto became an Arbeitslager so to say.</span> <span id="s469">It's the best I can describe it.</span> <span id="s470">Not a complete concentration camp, which actually it is recognized as because it has fence.</span> <span id="s471">It was high fence all around with guards.</span> <span id="s472">The signs, where they had the few gates of entries, I don't know if anybody ever told you that what the sign said "Wohngebiet der Juden", (it) means that's where the Jews live, "Betreten verboten",_ it's forbidden to get in.</span> <span id="s473">"Seuchengefahr", it's danger of the plague.</span> <span id="s474">Those were the signs.</span> <span id="s475">So, we start forming factories of all kinds.</span> <span id="s476">My brother in law which I mentioned before, was one of the top millinery producers before the war.</span> <span id="s477">The whole family.</span> <span id="s478">So, he founded we called a resort, a factory, a place to work.</span> <span id="s479">We had 500 people working.</span> <span id="s480">We made 02:12:)) flour -- all for the Germans.</span> <span id="s481">In other words, everyday German trucks would come into the Ghetto and pick up productions of all kinds.</span> <span id="s482">Shoes, clothing, even uniforms, military uniforms -- and here I'll tell you right away with connection my brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s483">So, that's why I worked in a millinery shop which had 500 women and men working.</span> <span id="s484">We made the most beautiful things for the Germans.</span> <span id="s485">Trimmings and flowers and earrings and hats for the German population.</span> <span id="s486">Other people made shoes.</span> <span id="s487">My brother worked in a shoe factory because we were from shoes.</span> <span id="s488">Whatever anybody was able to contribute to a factory, did, because otherwise we didn't get soup.</span> <span id="s489">If you did not work you didn't get your ration to begin with, but if you worked, you also get a soup.</span> <span id="s490">The soup consisted of some water with some dirt in it, but it was very important to have it.</span> <span id="s491">Everybody worked because what else?</span> <span id="s492">You couldn't go on the street, they would shoot you.</span> <span id="s493">You had to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q.</span> <span id="s495">What age people worked?</span> <span id="s496">What age range were the workers?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A. Good question.</span> <span id="s498">You led me into this horrible scene.</span> <span id="s499">What did I leave out before, what I always leave out.</span> <span id="s500">Starting from 12 years, in May of '42, I don't know if you ever heard this one, I'm jumping over a lot now because you led me into it.</span> <span id="s501">Announcements came out -- it was a beautiful sunny day and I was on my way home from work, because we had a home and a place to work.</span> <span id="s502">If the home had ten people instead of two people, or if the home was cold or without water or without facilities, but that was the place where you went to sleep over.</span> <span id="s503">On the way home there was announcement.</span> <span id="s504">What do you call what you call when you put announcements on the walls.</span> <span id="s505">There's an English word for it.</span> <span id="s506">Mother's should prepare children up to ten years old in front of the building to be picked up by trucks because they are unproductive.</span> <span id="s507">This answers your question, and they don't earn their ration.</span> <span id="s508">I always tell the way I was tortured, but I never leave out in conjunction with this, this scene.</span> <span id="s509">I think of all the atrocities, and everybody knows that there is piles of shoes in Auschwitz and everywhere else, but to be present when this announcement came up, when I walked into the garden of my building where we live and I seen mother's tearing the skin off their flesh.</span> <span id="s510">They had to prepare their children for next day to be given away.</span> <span id="s511">Now, what could be a bigger crime than that?</span> <span id="s512">All the crimes I will tell you about, or I will not tell you about, all of them together in my judgment and I always feel it that way, if I would be able to come in front of the United Nations and I would tell this story only.</span> <span id="s513">The following day, trucks were coming down the street.</span> <span id="s514">Me and my brother, the father of Mark, the lawyer, were on the roof top.</span> <span id="s515">We made it to the roof top for two reasons.</span> <span id="s516">One, we wanted to see what was going on better, but mainly because we were afraid to be in the building because the mother's just didn't deliver the children on a silver platter.</span> <span id="s517">The Germans had to break in doors, and they did.</span> <span id="s518">These "Herrenvolkz", these proud bastards, sorry if I have to call them that, were going door to door breaking in the doors with the carabins, grabbed the children and throw them on trucks.</span> <span id="s519">We seen it from the roof top with my brother.</span> <span id="s520">Isn't that heartbreaking.</span> <span id="s521">02:18:00 Can this ever come out of your mind?</span> <span id="s522">Can this be forgiven?</span> <span id="s523">Moses was taken out from the water, right?</span> <span id="s524">But she put him on at least something to swim.</span> <span id="s525">Here, they threw them on the trucks and many times they tear them in half.</span> <span id="s526">Never heard it?</span> <span id="s527">Everybody knows where these children went?</span> <span id="s528">They went to death.</span> <span id="s529">So, usually I tell my own torture that I went through once.</span> <span id="s530">I know that we're leaving out a lot.</span> <span id="s531">We're skipping a lot or we'd have to be here forever.</span> <span id="s532">1942 again.</span> <span id="s533">I'm 19 years old.</span> <span id="s534">My father was summoned to the Kripo.</span> <span id="s535">Kripo is the acronym for Criminal Police because we were big criminals.</span> <span id="s536">As a matter of fact, when I was in Germany 16 months ago, about my case, and I at once opened the paper and it says Kripo, I thought I'm going to faint there sitting there because I didn't see this word since then.</span> <span id="s537">The Kripo was the place in the chancellory of the nicest church in the neighborhood and this church fell into the neighborhood of the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s538">So, there was no use for the church as a religious place, so the Germans made their warehouse out of the gorgeous church.</span> <span id="s539">A block big magnificent church.</span> <span id="s540">I'll never forget that because it was only a block, two blocks from me where I live, where I went everyday passed.</span> <span id="s541">They made this into a warehouse for the Schmattes, for the belongings of the poor, already worn down Jews.</span> <span id="s542">So, the church became a warehouse with that stinking stuff.</span> <span id="s543">The chancellory which was across the street turned into a torture house, and that's where we were tortured ten days, and I will describe you only the tortures.</span> <span id="s544">Father was called the 16th of April.</span> <span id="s545">See how I remember.</span> <span id="s546">You asked before if we had money.</span> <span id="s547">They went by that.</span> <span id="s548">They went by the status of the person, figuring that Father was a businessman, he must have hidden money and what they wanted was very simply, money, diamonds, brilliants and dollars.</span> <span id="s549">The list was like this.</span> <span id="s550">So, Father was in the day before, summoned.</span> <span id="s551">Now, you know when you prepared yourself to go there that you're going to be tortured and you don't know how long.</span> <span id="s552">So, what we did we dressed ourselves in a lot of underwear, a lot of upperwear that when they beat you, it should help.</span> <span id="s553">It doesn't help, but you do your best.</span> <span id="s554">Mother sent her husband and now she sends her sons.</span> <span id="s555">The next day, the 17th, we were summoned, the three of us.</span> <span id="s556">We had to stand like walked up three flights, stand in the little foyer, the balcony when they called down the first one, there was more people than us.</span> <span id="s557">First they searched us and took everything out from us, you know, because now we are legal prisoners.</span> <span id="s558">By coincidence a small little pencil, and I don't know why I had it there.</span> <span id="s559">It was there, and they didn't find it.</span> <span id="s560">I used it then to mark on the bunk in the cell when I came down, the dates and the day, otherwise I wouldn't even know what it is.</span> <span id="s561">We had to listen to the screams of the other ones so my older brother was done 02:21:00 first.</span> <span id="s562">The screams were terrible.</span> <span id="s563">Then they threw him down the stairs like a ball, and they put him into a cell.</span> <span id="s564">We didn't know where he was going.</span> <span id="s565">Next came the other one.</span> <span id="s566">They took it by age, and then came me.</span> <span id="s567">When I came into the other room, there was a German sitting on kitty-cornered desk, and he had laying strings(straps?)</span> <span id="s568">_on the counter.</span> <span id="s569">The other German was sitting behind -- I am there now.</span> <span id="s570">He was having a breakfast.</span> <span id="s571">It turned my Kishkes, because we didn't smell an egg for two years now.</span> <span id="s572">And there he sits behind the typewriter consuming an egg breakfast and smells up the whole house with it.</span> <span id="s573">The first one behind the desk, he was the first one talking to me, he says you are the youngest so you better be the smartest.</span> <span id="s574">You heard what happened to the others, so if you want to be smart, talk.</span> <span id="s575">We didn't talk, because by then there wasn't anything to talk about.</span> <span id="s576">Because the answer to that is if you already went to Warsaw, the money already became worthless.</span> <span id="s577">That's just God forbid something happens here the dollar loses its value, everything became black marketing, and if there was anything little left, how could you give it to him.</span> <span id="s578">Anyway, this is only besides the point, and as I didn't talk, now this I considered the only heroic thing that I did through the war because my father and the three of us made up not to talk.</span> <span id="s579">So, the fact that we lasted and I didn't talk, I considered this was the only heroic thing, if anything.</span> <span id="s580">Anyway, with a wink of his head, he was a hunch back, you must have heard of him in your interviews.</span> <span id="s581">Suter was his name, a Volksdeutsch, called the other guy whose name was Schmitt.</span> <span id="s582">This guy was a real German, full Aryan, tall and blonde.</span> <span id="s583">Told me to lay down on the floor belly down, ass high.</span> <span id="s584">He showed me exactly how to do it, but he had canes hanging on the wall or on the closet side.</span> <span id="s585">I had to pick my cane and he started measuring out.</span> <span id="s586">He tells me you're going to get 50.</span> <span id="s587">You remember the Singapore story with Michaels.</span> <span id="s588">He was getting six but the President intervened for four and a hospital room was prepared for him.</span> <span id="s589">He said you're going to get 50 and he starts measuring out and I scream.</span> <span id="s590">He politely stands and talks down to me, he says, would you please not scream.</span> <span id="s591">I can't hear you screaming.</span> <span id="s592">I can't take it.</span> <span id="s593">Go down again.</span> <span id="s594">He gives it to me again, and I scream.</span> <span id="s595">He says, see I forgot to tell you.</span> <span id="s596">Bite your fingers so you wouldn't scream.</span> <span id="s597">I go down again, he measures out and I scream.</span> <span id="s598">Again, he gives me advice.</span> <span id="s599">He says, you know you're hurting yourself, because every time you go down again, you have to start counting from the beginning so don't scream.</span> <span id="s600">Go down, bite your fingers, count.</span> <span id="s601">02:25:30 How do you count while you bite your fingers?</span> <span id="s602">The sadism of it is what I'm trying to point out.</span> <span id="s603">I don't know how many I counted.</span> <span id="s604">I don't know how many I received.</span> <span id="s605">Enough to find myself in a dark alley in the chancellory on the top floor in a flood of blood.</span> <span id="s606">If you want to touch here you'll feel where the blood is coming out.</span> <span id="s607">I had them touch it in court last year.</span> <span id="s608">Last week it was bleeding a little bit.</span> <span id="s609">I said to my wife, it's bleeding.</span> <span id="s610">How could a nation become so murderous?</span> <span id="s611">My father died only a few months later, November 27, which was -- he never recovered.</span> <span id="s612">When we got out of there after ten days, -- I'll tell you one more thing.</span> <span id="s613">We couldn't sit, we couldn't walk, we couldn't lay down.</span> <span id="s614">Remember I said I had a little pencil.</span> <span id="s615">When I got down to the cell then they put me to a cell.</span> <span id="s616">One of my cousins was already there too, and an uncle of mine was there too.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q.</span> <span id="s618">In the same cell?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A. My cousin was in the same cell, my uncle was not.</span> <span id="s620">I heard one of my brothers cry in the next cell.</span> <span id="s621">They broke his arm, and there was a doctor, I remember his name, Doctor Gilbert, who was also in prison there and he tried to help him.</span> <span id="s622">The guard opened the door an shoot him for trying to help my brother.</span> <span id="s623">This scene is also of sadism.</span> <span id="s624">I was laying on the top bunk.</span> <span id="s625">I just crawled up there.</span> <span id="s626">There was no facilities in the thing, just a pail, but no water no nothing.</span> <span id="s627">They gave us one little bowl of something like soup, once a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q. Was it crowded?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A. Depending on how many Jews they got in that day.</span> <span id="s630">They didn't go by reservation.</span> <span id="s631">One time I was listening through the bars.</span> <span id="s632">There was small window with bars.</span> <span id="s633">They made a prison out of it.</span> <span id="s634">Out of the church they made a prison.</span> <span id="s635">We could have recognized the hearse, because the hearse those days didn't have at home, have air balloons, air wheels but steel wheels, and at home, the streets were not yet paved, not all of them.</span> <span id="s636">The main street was, but most of the city still had cobblestones.</span> <span id="s637">At once I hear the hearse coming in.</span> <span id="s638">So, I figured it possibly could be one of my brothers or my father so I looked out, laying looking down and they schlepped down a body, a corpse, and they put him into the casket and then a few Germans came out from the 02:29:00 chancellory.</span> <span id="s639">Before they closed the casket they want to take pictures with the body for souvenirs.</span> <span id="s640">Now, being on the team of hearse.</span> <span id="s641">Hearses did not pick up one body.</span> <span id="s642">When my father passed away, and we put him in the casket, they put another body on top of him and then more on top, and on top of the roof too, and you couldn't go to the cemetery, because it was during the day you're supposed to be at work.</span> <span id="s643">We, the three of us smuggled ourselves, we made our way to the cemetery.</span> <span id="s644">Luckily there was a neighbor in the next building from before the Ghetto, who was a grave digger.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">End of Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Tape 3 By coincidence a neighbor from the next building from where we lived all those years, because we lived in the Ghetto territory all our life.</span> <span id="s647">So, we knew more people than those that came in.</span> <span id="s648">So, this person next door, he was out of profession, a grave digger.</span> <span id="s649">So, when we came out of the cemetery and he already knew that Father died in the house, so he kept an eye on it.</span> <span id="s650">When they started piling up the corpses, he watched for us our father.</span> <span id="s651">So, when we came there he showed us he was laying already on a pile of bodies.</span> <span id="s652">But somehow he was able to manage that he should be the outside corpse and he helped us pull him out, pulled(?)</span> <span id="s653">the body(?)</span> <span id="s654">and brought it to the grave.</span> <span id="s655">He had a grave dug and we helped him finish it.</span> <span id="s656">When my wife was once in Poland, I couldn't go, '46 from Sweden she went there --- oh I have here the monuments -- she was able to put up monuments for her father and for my father.</span> <span id="s657">Her father was killed in the Krypo too because his name was Grinspan.</span> <span id="s658">You've heard of the Grinspan story.</span> <span id="s659">They called all the Grinspans one day.</span> <span id="s660">Her father -- the same year.</span> <span id="s661">Her father and her oldest brother died within a week.</span> <span id="s662">Families, whole families were dying within a day because everybody was so worn physically and mentally that if one died, out of grief, the others just fell in line the same day and died, too.</span> <span id="s663">It happened.</span> <span id="s664">It's not as a rule, but it happened.</span> <span id="s665">You're screaming somebody died and then you heard the husband died, the daughter died, everybody the same day.</span> <span id="s666">So, life in the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s667">It was a work camp.</span> <span id="s668">You went to work.</span> <span id="s669">You got a ration of food which was very, very, very little because people were dying from hunger.</span> <span id="s670">If you worked you got soup, and if you worked better they would reward you with another little soup.</span> <span id="s671">They were out more to get the last breath out of you.</span> <span id="s672">They fed you enough that they should get the production out of you, but for sure you should die.</span> <span id="s673">You should not survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q. Was there any way to get extra food or different kinds of food?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A. Absolutely not.</span> <span id="s676">There was a black market developed which is a human thing, everywhere, if it's Russia or even the United States.</span> <span id="s677">A black market.</span> <span id="s678">I earned -- they paid us with Ghetto money.</span> <span id="s679">See, I have some of it here.</span> <span id="s680">They printed Ghetto money.</span> <span id="s681">It was like a little government, police, everything was a self ruled thing.</span> <span id="s682">So, I earned for my work 15 marks a week.</span> <span id="s683">Bread on the black market was 500 marks.</span> <span id="s684">It was ridiculous.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q. Was anybody able to steal outside of the Ghetto and bring stuff in?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A.</span> <span id="s687">There was maybe small incidents like that but it shouldn't even be mentioned as a fact because no, no, absolutely not.</span> <span id="s688">There was stealing going on from one another.</span> <span id="s689">Let's say if somebody worked in a bakery.</span> <span id="s690">He would definitely be able to help himself to a bread.</span> <span id="s691">If somebody worked at the vegetable place.</span> <span id="s692">Home vegetables were kept outside.</span> <span id="s693">Now, that's very interesting,too.</span> <span id="s694">At once we would see on the main road, like here, let's say 95.</span> <span id="s695">The main road to Warsaw through Lodz was cut through the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s696">You see it on last week's movie.</span> <span id="s697">It was fenced off.</span> <span id="s698">So, what was I saying?</span> <span id="s699">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s700">So, at once you'd be able to see something wonderful is happening to the main road, loads of wagons, loads of vegetables are coming into Ghetto so we'll get a ration.</span> <span id="s701">You know where they kept them?</span> <span id="s702">On the outside in the winter and when we got them they were all smelled already.</span> <span id="s703">They were frozen when we brought them home most of the time.</span> <span id="s704">Some times we were lucky to get potatoes that were useable.</span> <span id="s705">Now, potato shells was a very big thing, because in the kitchens where they cooked soup for the workers, mass soup, they shelled, and they had the shells, the potato shells.</span> <span id="s706">You needed a doctor's prescription for a pound or half of pound of that stuff to have potato.</span> <span id="s707">Now, when you say a doctor, you might ask yourself were there doctors?</span> <span id="s708">Yes, there were doctors.</span> <span id="s709">There was no medicine.</span> <span id="s710">The doctors were there prisoners like ourselves.</span> <span id="s711">Coming back to my brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s712">He suffered on hemorrhoids and at that time this place was still a hospital not far from where we lived.</span> <span id="s713">Once the Germans decided that it was a very new big building that this hospital they want to change into a factory for uniforms for the army.</span> <span id="s714">So, they had a very simple way of getting rid of the sick.</span> <span id="s715">They drove up with open trucks on the sidewalks.</span> <span id="s716">They threw the sick out through the windows, and they knew how many they needed to have.</span> <span id="s717">The Germans are very orderly.</span> <span id="s718">They had a famous saying "In Ordnung muss die Welt zugunde gehen", that if they'll bring down the world to ashes, but it will be done orderly.</span> <span id="s719">If anybody escaped through a side door or a side stairway, they counted everybody who they got on the trucks half dead already or broken bones.</span> <span id="s720">If the number didn't match to what they expected, how many sick will be in the hospital, the "Aelteste der Juden", which means the oldest of the Jews who was in charge, had to produce other Jews to fill in the numbers.</span> <span id="s721">It is == how can anybody invent a thing like that.</span> <span id="s722">If I would invent it, you should go and throw me out the balcony.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q.</span> <span id="s724">Who was in charge of everything?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A.</span> <span id="s726">In Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A.</span> <span id="s729">There was a committee with an Aeltesterr.</span> <span id="s730">His name was Rumkowsky.</span> <span id="s731">You must have heard of this name already.</span> <span id="s732">He was killed, too, at the end in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s733">They created a committee.</span> <span id="s734">We had police.</span> <span id="s735">We had firemen.</span> <span id="s736">We had this hospital, maybe one more.</span> <span id="s737">We had doctors because there were doctors, but they were not officially doctors.</span> <span id="s738">They tried to help you, but they had no medications for you.</span> <span id="s739">There was no such thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q.</span> <span id="s741">But all these, the committee and the police were all Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A. Only Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q. Were those good jobs?</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A.</span> <span id="s745">If this was a better job, yes, it definitely was a better job because they were out the whole night.</span> <span id="s746">They were able to steal.</span> <span id="s747">I call it by the name steal.</span> <span id="s748">Actually we didn't call it steal but organize something for themselves.</span> <span id="s749">Yes, it was a better job.</span> <span id="s750">You could help yourself a little better.</span> <span id="s751">It also had its bad sides to it, because you had to do things that the Germans wanted you to do like to round up people.</span> <span id="s752">You had to do that.</span> <span id="s753">I wouldn't call this a better job, because when it came to being, they only took into the police boys that had high school education.</span> <span id="s754">So, I was one of them that would be eligible.</span> <span id="s755">My father should rest in peace, not my son.</span> <span id="s756">You will not.</span> <span id="s757">I wanted to go there.</span> <span id="s758">You get an extra piece of bread.</span> <span id="s759">You can even bring home and extra piece of bread to the house.</span> <span id="s760">But my father was too honorable.</span> <span id="s761">He said not my son.</span> <span id="s762">That's afact.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q.</span> <span id="s764">What was the general attitude towards the police and the Jewish council.</span> <span id="s765">Were they corrupt.</span> <span id="s766">Did the take advantage of their situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A. Well, it would be not natural if in a crisis like that some people wouldn't take advantage of their position.</span> <span id="s768">They were not saints.</span> <span id="s769">There was a crisis that had never been in history and they had a chance to maybe grab an extra piece of bread or help somebody in his family not being deported because he had the chance to do it.</span> <span id="s770">So, it was a bad taste, and here again my 03:10:00 father didn't want me to have the extra piece of bread or the extra better chance, and there were more like me who didn't go, but not all that went, were bad.</span> <span id="s771">They didn't go there because they wanted to be policemen or they wanted to be in this situation.</span> <span id="s772">They went there for the piece of extra bread or little different treatment.</span> <span id="s773">The end was the same anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q. So, the other people really didn't resent them?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A. No.</span> <span id="s776">No, a little bit yes, mostly not.</span> <span id="s777">I mean this was it.</span> <span id="s778">This was part of this life.</span> <span id="s779">There is resentments.</span> <span id="s780">Let's say 03:11:00 somebody did do something bad, transgress.</span> <span id="s781">It couldn't happen not.</span> <span id="s782">The situation was so tight and so bad.</span> <span id="s783">Now, I am not one of them and I am not sitting here to excuse them, because there were transgressions.</span> <span id="s784">There definitely were, but I blame it on the enemy.</span> <span id="s785">I said just enemy.</span> <span id="s786">We were not enemies of Germany.</span> <span id="s787">Jews were the best citizens of Germany for hundreds of God knows how many years.</span> <span id="s788">We didn't carry weapons against Germany.</span> <span id="s789">We didn't revolt.</span> <span id="s790">They just came on us, I still don't know why.</span> <span id="s791">It was just anti-semitic Nazistic hate.</span> <span id="s792">Now, how could 80 million people, and my teacher makes sure if you can read his writing to put the number of 80 million because he was afraid then that they'll try to have a white wash, good Germans and bad Germans.</span> <span id="s793">I would be too strict saying that there were none good ones.</span> <span id="s794">There must have been some.</span> <span id="s795">80 million is a lot, but we have seen the German people in action.</span> <span id="s796">The devotion to sadism.</span> <span id="s797">The devotion to their Fuehrer was above everything.</span> <span id="s798">They committed the worst crimes in human history with devotion.</span> <span id="s799">It's 03:12:40 endless.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q. Do the Germans come into the Ghetto or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A. No, remember I mentioned before headquarters.</span> <span id="s802">At one intersection they turned this in -- and also the entrances, there they had offices, barracks, I would think it was barracks.</span> <span id="s803">Officers with the Germans and there was the contact with the Germans and the Jewish body, you know.</span> <span id="s804">Also, all the transports and deliveries out and in same through there.</span> <span id="s805">When I said, I think I mentioned before, this incident that my mother sent me -- no I described it there.</span> <span id="s806">We had to pass this headquarters and we could have gotten killed, but this was a separate incident.</span> <span id="s807">That's what it was.</span> <span id="s808">You see, it was one place.</span> <span id="s809">My wife had worked in an office which you call the registry, so to say, and I don't even know what purpose this had, but in a back room they were saving historic diaries of the days for later.</span> <span id="s810">It happened to be an ex-lawyer from the city of Lodz who was in charge of this.</span> <span id="s811">If anybody could have done something, he would, but it was very little chance to do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q. Was there any semblance of normal life going on in the Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A. Normal life you probably mean family life, normal life, yes, if you can call this normal.</span> <span id="s814">You had an address and you had a room and you had a mattress or a bed.</span> <span id="s815">Most of the time, a few people were sleeping on one mattress because there was no mattress for everybody.</span> <span id="s816">Definitely not.</span> <span id="s817">There were wife's and men's -- you're probably leading to sex.</span> <span id="s818">There were a few births happen, very, very few.</span> <span id="s819">That means they did have intercourse, but the funniest thing, if it is funny, when we came to Sachsenhausen or rather Koenigs Wusterhausen (deny?)</span> <span id="s820">the German proud uniformed officers would go through the night our bunks with lamps, with lanterns to see if we're not engaging in some kind of sex activities, so fresh they were.</span> <span id="s821">Let me tell you, it took months after liberation that I even knew that I'm still a living person.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q. Back in the Ghetto was there any schools, was there cultural activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A. Yes, that's a good question.</span> <span id="s824">Let me see.</span> <span id="s825">Schools?</span> <span id="s826">For who?</span> <span id="s827">One thing was, I played the violin since I was 14 years old.</span> <span id="s828">As a matter of fact, my wife remembers it because we were school friends and she remembers.</span> <span id="s829">I played the violin.</span> <span id="s830">I had a girlfriend whose whole family, herself, her sister her brother and her other brother.</span> <span id="s831">The oldest brother led, conducted the orchestra.</span> <span id="s832">We had a concert each week on the weekends.</span> <span id="s833">On Sundays, the Germans left the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s834">They went from the Kripo, the criminal police like in hell.</span> <span id="s835">On Sabbath hell is not hell.</span> <span id="s836">The main body -- the Jews were only in their own charge one day a week.</span> <span id="s837">Saturday afternoon through Sunday.</span> <span id="s838">So, we did organize concerts and my girlfriend's older brother.</span> <span id="s839">You say you've been in Yad vaShem.</span> <span id="s840">In Yad va Shem there's an inscription on one wall Milly Konsky_ will conduct a concert on this Saturday and ______________.</span> <span id="s841">I attended every concert.</span> <span id="s842">Now, when the Germans came in, the order immediately went for Jews to turn in any playing instrument naturally radios included, and I had to deliver my violin to the city hall.</span> <span id="s843">I remember a cousin of mine I took along with me.</span> <span id="s844">I was afraid to go myself with my violin.</span> <span id="s845">While we walked up the steps to deliver it, I said to him, you know what I'm going to do?</span> <span id="s846">I'm going to break it on the stairs.</span> <span id="s847">He says, you're crazy they're going to kill you.</span> <span id="s848">He's right.</span> <span id="s849">I was off my mind.</span> <span id="s850">Finally I brought it up to the top floor, the room was loaded with all kinds of instruments up to the ceiling.</span> <span id="s851">That was the end of music.</span> <span id="s852">So, how did we have the few -- now we had two conductors before the war in Ghetto, Professor Ridder and Bergesmann(?)</span> <span id="s853">_ who conducted one week and another week.</span> <span id="s854">This young fellow who was only 19 years old, Jastrowski, it is recorded in Yas vaShem.</span> <span id="s855">I'm telling you truth, my girlfriend's older brother.</span> <span id="s856">He was a beautiful conductor, and the Germans never found out.</span> <span id="s857">Or maybe they did because how is it possible that they didn't?</span> <span id="s858">Maybe I don't remember how long this thing was going on, but we did have it.</span> <span id="s859">I attended every rehearsal and every concert, but I did not have my own instrument.</span> <span id="s860">As a matter of fact we have a doctor in Haifa_ who also played in the orchestra.</span> <span id="s861">I'll tell you a little bit of a happy incident.</span> <span id="s862">I had a business in New York, a retail store, listen boys, and a lady once walked in there with another lady with two children.</span> <span id="s863">When I had children come into the store, you know, we had these metal racks in the stores, would you please watch the children shouldn't get hurt.</span> <span id="s864">Hold on to them.</span> <span id="s865">The lady, who was the grandmother turned around to the kids and spoke to them in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s866">Now, I still know a little Hebrew from what I learned, so I asked them where are you from?</span> <span id="s867">She said we live in Haifa.</span> <span id="s868">We have a friend in Haifa his name is Doctor Fuchs, she says, yes he delivered the mother and the children, but he was one of the violinists during the Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q.</span> <span id="s870">Did going to those concerts feel good?</span> <span id="s871">Was it a release?</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A. For somebody who has a feel for music, for art, otherwise you wouldn't go.</span> <span id="s873">You wouldn't go even to a concert if you are as safe as you are in New York, if you had no interest for it.</span> <span id="s874">For me, even today, listening to music.</span> <span id="s875">You want to know how many tapes I have in the house?</span> <span id="s876">Hundreds.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q.</span> <span id="s878">What I'm saying was it a special release in the Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A.</span> <span id="s880">It was known to be, nobody squealed about it.</span> <span id="s881">I don't know how I myself should describe this incident that I am freely divulging even if it was something so good, because how could the Ghetto have had something so good.</span> <span id="s882">It's a miracle.</span> <span id="s883">It's such a miracle that it was recorded in Yad vaShem.</span> <span id="s884">It was Professor Ridder, what a wonderful leader and the other one and this young fellow.</span> <span id="s885">I cannot explain, no, how it went on.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q. Were there other activities?</span> <span id="s887">Was there theater?</span> <span id="s888">You don't remember if there was school?</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A.</span> <span id="s890">There was not supposed to be children so what for school.</span> <span id="s891">No, no.</span> <span id="s892">The answer is no, absolutely no.</span> <span id="s893">There were not supposed to be children.</span> <span id="s894">Now, when they took away children up to ten, you remember that, we tried in many cases to make false papers for children of 12, let's say make them 14, or even 10 and make them 12, but then you couldn't open a school.</span> <span id="s895">Wait, wait, wait.</span> <span id="s896">In the very beginning I attended school.</span> <span id="s897">When they chased us into the Ghettos already out, we ourselves just created a school because our professors came with us.</span> <span id="s898">They were mostly Jewish and we started attended the school.</span> <span id="s899">That was the building, the same building, but then became a hospital and from there when they threw the people out from the windows.</span> <span id="s900">So, it was a school for a while where all school like at once I was at the school with my wife because like at home, there was no coeducational schools.</span> <span id="s901">But it lasted only a few weeks or a few months.</span> <span id="s902">We tried to live, but we didn't know that we were forbidden to live.</span> <span id="s903">That is the answer.</span> <span id="s904">I think I phrased it well.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q.</span> <span id="s906">What about religion?</span> <span id="s907">Were you able to observe?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A. Well, it wouldn't be a legal thing to do, but let's say if somebody died in a house where we have that sitting shiva thing, there would a few other people to help out, but was there a place where we prayed, Rosh Hoshana, Yom Kippur?</span> <span id="s909">I don't think so.</span> <span id="s910">I really cannot tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q.</span> <span id="s912">You worked on the Sabbath?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A. Yes, we worked six days.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q.</span> <span id="s915">So you weren't aware of holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A. Holidays, you mean observe holidays?</span> <span id="s917">You could observe holidays in your house.</span> <span id="s918">Nobody could tell you that you should know that today is Shavuoth or Passover or you didn't have matzos for Passover, you can be sure of that.</span> <span id="s919">If you had a little piece of bread it was a holiday.</span> <span id="s920">Now, you seen it on the Anne Frank movies that people were stealing bread from members of the family.</span> <span id="s921">I described a scene there, I want you boys to listen in, I described the scene how I wanted to bring a piece of bread to my Rabbi.</span> <span id="s922">First let me let me tell you what a rabbi meant at home.</span> <span id="s923">Here when you use the word rabbi you mean an official rabbi.</span> <span id="s924">A rabbi by us was a teacher because a teacher was a melamed, which is in Hebrew teacher, so a rabbi was only bestowed on a real rabbi.</span> <span id="s925">He had the top.</span> <span id="s926">He had to be sort of say in our language now, a licensed, an ordained rabbi.</span> <span id="s927">But we called our Hebrew teachers, those that taught us religion also a rabbi.</span> <span id="s928">And he did not have to be with a school, an official.</span> <span id="s929">He had a few kids that he taught.</span> <span id="s930">In our building was a rabbi like that, a very prized Jew to who almost every one of our sons, my Father's sons had to attend because that was higher learning, not only reading and writing and arithmetic, but higher learning.</span> <span id="s931">That was done like only one at a time or two at a time at the rabbi's quarters which was one room.</span> <span id="s932">That was his bedroom, that was his living room, that was his kitchen.</span> <span id="s933">A poor man, and he derived his livelihood out of some people could afford sent their sons like myself to him.</span> <span id="s934">When the war started, not yet the Ghetto, when the Germans came in, hunger_ came with them.</span> <span id="s935">Just 03:35:00 as whenever Americans, God bless America, came after the war, hunger disappeared.</span> <span id="s936">Plenty of food by the red cross and by the soldiers.</span> <span id="s937">You could drown yourself with food.</span> <span id="s938">When Germans came, everything dried up.</span> <span id="s939">And there were lines for bread.</span> <span id="s940">You could stay in line for a night.</span> <span id="s941">A person like my rabbi, nobody could visualize, and he himself he was just dying from hunger.</span> <span id="s942">And at once I realized that my rabbi on the top floor he was living in the same building, is dying from hunger.</span> <span id="s943">For all these years I was looking for a chance and this is why I probably appreciate this interview so much, because that was the first time in the 50 years that I had a chance to describe this scene that I was looking for an artist for a Chagall or for somebody like this organization now.</span> <span id="s944">I at once put my hands like 03:26:00 this(cupping) and I started walking the stairs up to my rabbi's apartment as if I had something in my hand, a piece of bread for my rabbi.</span> <span id="s945">I had nothing there.</span> <span id="s946">I walked all the way to the rabbi's door which was in a dark hallway, because at home it wasn't like here.</span> <span id="s947">When I came to the door, I started asking myself a question.</span> <span id="s948">If I had here a piece of bread would I break it down to my father, to my family or would I eat it myself.</span> <span id="s949">Because as you see in the Anne Frank story, people were eating their family members food.</span> <span id="s950">.</span> <span id="s951">At once I had nothing, and I turned around I walked back and the rabbi died from hunger.</span> <span id="s952">All this that you are hearing today make up for the most cannibalistic 03:27:00 happening and we know history and we don't deny history and there's book recorded.</span> <span id="s953">There was plenty bad things happening and do happen at the time too.</span> <span id="s954">Like Elie Wiesel was the first one to run to the Balkans_ to say what are you doing here.</span> <span id="s955">Let me give you a little break down.</span> <span id="s956">Remember in the Balkans in Bosnia Herzegovina once a bomb recently a few months ago and it blew up and killed 60 people, and the world was outraged.</span> <span id="s957">You'll be surprised when I say rightfully so.</span> <span id="s958">60 people to kill from a bomb.</span> <span id="s959">I'm not talking about all the other atrocities that are going on now today, but he was there Elie Wiesel to tell the world that he's getting sick from it.</span> <span id="s960">Why isn't something done about it.</span> <span id="s961">Now, let me give you a statistic now.</span> <span id="s962">Six million divided by 2,185 days comes to 3,000 a day, not 60.</span> <span id="s963">Three thousand each day, if you have a pencil or an adding machine you can add it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q. I just want to get back to the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s965">Were there regular round ups in the Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A. Oh absolutely.</span> <span id="s967">These were called "Aussiedlungen", liquidations until the final liquidation.</span> <span id="s968">Naturally that was 03:29:00 going on normal.</span> <span id="s969">They would grab you, they would announce that you should come to a certain place where you will be -- but they lied.</span> <span id="s970">They said we need people that say in another part of the country or the biggest lie and the most sarcastic lie was when they came in '44 to liquidate the Ghetto they told us being that the Russian front if coming nearer we want to save you and take you with us.</span> <span id="s971">So, they liquidated whole shops with the things and they really were -- because they were robbing.</span> <span id="s972">They were robbing, but under the pretext that something wrong is coming.</span> <span id="s973">The Russian front is coming near because our side only the Russians could have come because that was east.</span> <span id="s974">The Americans came to Normandy which was in the west.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">End of Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Tape 4</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A.</span> <span id="s978">How could they have undertook to fight helpless innocent people.</span> <span id="s979">All right, I will leave out the word innocent because according to them we are the most guilty in the world.</span> <span id="s980">But how can they have taken upon themselves to make the judgment and to carry on such atrocities.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q.</span> <span id="s982">You were telling me that there were actions and deportations 04:01:00 all the time.</span> <span id="s983">Were there any rules?</span> <span id="s984">Who got sent away first?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A. Sick, anybody who was breaking down.</span> <span id="s986">Age, like at one time I almost went though somebody told me if you go you will not live.</span> <span id="s987">They told us that they need an amount of people at a certain age that they're a little stronger and healthier for work somewhere in Germany because at one time I worked on the Berlin autostrada,_ building the Berlin highway which was supposed to connect Berlin to Moscow.</span> <span id="s988">I worked there too.</span> <span id="s989">So, when they needed slave labor mainly the fact when let's say somebody in Germany was short of labor because after all they were conducting a war and their people were in.</span> <span id="s990">So, they would reach into these businesses of theirs, Ghettos and said at once we need a thousand young men.</span> <span id="s991">That's how it was.</span> <span id="s992">Now, who made the list had a terrible conscientious thing to do.</span> <span id="s993">He had to deliver a 1,000 people, so he had to sit down and pick, and whoever he picked he 04:02:00 had to.</span> <span id="s994">See, here again there is the big discussion amongst ourselves did they have to do it didn't they have to do it.</span> <span id="s995">Are they guilty are they not guilty.</span> <span id="s996">Well, they were made to do it.</span> <span id="s997">They had no choice, because if they had an arsenal of weapons to say well tomorrow morning we're going to give weapons to a thousand boys and we'll go out and have a little war with the Germans instead of sending them, there was no such thing.</span> <span id="s998">We were locked in absolutely helpless.</span> <span id="s999">That's how they did these liquidations.</span> <span id="s1000">The liquidations were actually work things.</span> <span id="s1001">So, if they didn't take him right away to death, not all the time, no.</span> <span id="s1002">You heard of the selections, once they took a group out, they started selecting who will fall to the wayside, systematically.</span> <span id="s1003">Then they needed more, so they had plenty Ghettos so they reached into the Ghetto and got more.</span> <span id="s1004">There is no other explanation of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q. So, when they sent people away, they still needed workers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A.</span> <span id="s1007">In Ghetto.</span> <span id="s1008">They needed somebody somewhere maybe better or like Schindler himself or my guy, where we were.</span> <span id="s1009">We also were owned by a slave owner like that.</span> <span id="s1010">Maybe he needed to enlarge his business.</span> <span id="s1011">Schindler had a factory and he needed more.</span> <span id="s1012">So, let's say this guy of mine or another one.</span> <span id="s1013">He didn't give a damn for anything else probably than his own business, but he was able to get instead of going to the labor organization for workers, they were at the front lines.</span> <span id="s1014">So that's how they used us, they used us up until death.</span> <span id="s1015">In other words, they didn't waste a bit of us.</span> <span id="s1016">They used us until we died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q.</span> <span id="s1018">Did they bring more people in when they were sending people out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A.</span> <span id="s1020">They only brought in people when they had the full pull of it in the beginning.</span> <span id="s1021">Then they didn't bring in no more.</span> <span id="s1022">Where would they take them from.</span> <span id="s1023">There was no more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q. Maybe from other Ghettos or other towns?</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A.</span> <span id="s1026">We had people to begin with from all the surrounding towns.</span> <span id="s1027">In other words, not every little town did they make a Ghetto.</span> <span id="s1028">It would be bothersome for them.</span> <span id="s1029">They incorporated all the small towns around Warsaw, all the small towns around Lodz, so the Ghettos were mainly in the big towns.</span> <span id="s1030">There was some small Ghettos, too.</span> <span id="s1031">It all depended on this strategic productive need that they had.</span> <span id="s1032">They did what they wanted.</span> <span id="s1033">They didn't have to ask anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q. Right.</span> <span id="s1035">So, there were people in the Lodz Ghetto from around other places?</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A. Yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s1037">We still have some that we know now that survived just like ourselves who were brought in from the outside.</span> <span id="s1038">We know a few of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q.</span> <span id="s1040">Then they just got distributed amongst the rest of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A. Yes, they were just thrown in there and the leadership had to place them.</span> <span id="s1042">And placing people was an easy thing.</span> <span id="s1043">You're going to live in this apartment.</span> <span id="s1044">You're going to say no, and he's going to say -- there was no choices.</span> <span id="s1045">You did what you were made to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q.</span> <span id="s1047">Did people get along?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A. I wouldn't say not all the time probably.</span> <span id="s1049">There wasn't too much antagonism, and then on the other hand, it was yes, because under circumstances like that where some helped themselves better to a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1050">Bread was the key word.</span> <span id="s1051">You could have -- 04:05:00 I didn't come across myself any frictions or even that I should be able to tell of.</span> <span id="s1052">I did know people that worked in the same place as me that were getting an extra soup.</span> <span id="s1053">The biggest envy was an extra soup.</span> <span id="s1054">What else did you know?</span> <span id="s1055">You didn't care about your pants.</span> <span id="s1056">You didn't care about your jacket.</span> <span id="s1057">You didn't care about your tie.</span> <span id="s1058">You didn't care about your car.</span> <span id="s1059">The main thing was survival, a piece of bread or another soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q. Were women treated any differently than men?</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A. Were women treated different than men?</span> <span id="s1062">I don't think so.</span> <span id="s1063">I don't think so.</span> <span id="s1064">Absolutely, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q.</span> <span id="s1066">How did you manage to avoid deportations all this time, for these three or four years in the Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A. That's a good question because I answered a minute ago that at one time I wanted to report for the deportation.</span> <span id="s1068">Now, let me explain what that means.</span> <span id="s1069">Let's say that an announcement comes out that the Germans need a hundred strong men or young men.</span> <span id="s1070">So, the first thing that came to your mind is that it will be good there where you're going.</span> <span id="s1071">You'll get an extra piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1072">You'll get an extra soup so some reported "freiwillig",_ voluntarily.</span> <span id="s1073">That's what you can call it.</span> <span id="s1074">So, how one avoided all the deportations.</span> <span id="s1075">Some questions are very proper that you put forward and not easy to give an answer to.</span> <span id="s1076">Because they say if they needed 100 out of a thousand, only a hundred went.</span> <span id="s1077">Who it was -- sometimes you needed to know somebody up there not to be sent out.</span> <span id="s1078">Another time you needed somebody in the higher echelons because we had a committee that should help you go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q.</span> <span id="s1080">Did you know people on the committee who helped you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A. No, we knew who they were every one of them because they were visible every day.</span> <span id="s1082">I personally didn't have any personal contact with anybody in higher places.</span> <span id="s1083">If I might call it higher places.</span> <span id="s1084">It was like a prison.</span> <span id="s1085">A big, big prison with some people being a little bit more in charge of things than others.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q. So, you and most of your family were there until the final liquidation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A. No, we lost two brothers, a sister and her baby in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1088">We don't know what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q.</span> <span id="s1090">But the people in Lodz, your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A. No, my father died after the beating in Kripo in '42, but 04:09:00 the three of us, me and my other two brothers, my oldest brother passed away two years ago, and my other brother, the father of this lawyer passed away 14 years ago.</span> <span id="s1092">We, by unexplainable miracle, and you have a few cases where there are sisters or brothers, we were together all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q. So, you and your two brothers and your mother were still in the Ghetto at the final liquidation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">A.</span> <span id="s1095">At the final liquidation, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q. Tell me what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">A.</span> <span id="s1098">What happened.</span> <span id="s1099">Then they announced the final liquidation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q.</span> <span id="s1101">This was when?</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A.</span> <span id="s1103">The Ghetto got liquidated between August, September, October of 1944, but they needed a group of workers that will clean up so to say.</span> <span id="s1104">They called it clean the Ghetto after the people are gone.</span> <span id="s1105">What was it to clean of?</span> <span id="s1106">Nobody had a new suit or a new diamond or a new living room wall piece.</span> <span id="s1107">For them everything was good.</span> <span id="s1108">Anyway, that's what they called this.</span> <span id="s1109">We loaded that on trains.</span> <span id="s1110">So, there were 500 of us, women and men.</span> <span id="s1111">We became kind of chosen because we were there longer than the others.</span> <span id="s1112">The Ghetto was empty.</span> <span id="s1113">We went out every day to work.</span> <span id="s1114">On trucks they took us to work from building to building to pick up the stuff.</span> <span id="s1115">It's ridiculous, what was there?</span> <span id="s1116">Broken up things, the Ghetto was already five years old.</span> <span id="s1117">Then finally came our turn where this Beboff(?)</span> <span id="s1118">who owned us, he already owned us there, so what he was doing was already as a businessman or rather as a function to guard himself or hide himself from going to the Russian front because he makes himself useful for the fatherland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q. For the record, why don't you tell me who Beboff is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A. Beboff was a German, a German who was the Gauleiter, it was called.</span> <span id="s1121">Gauleiter means like Schindler was in his business.</span> <span id="s1122">Schindler was actually like a gauleiter.</span> <span id="s1123">So was Boboff.</span> <span id="s1124">Beboff was the head of our Ghetto, the German head of our Ghetto because we had a Jewish head.</span> <span id="s1125">You've heard of him, Chaim Rumkowsky, but Beboff was the German representative, the German delegate, the German appointee for this business of this Ghetto.</span> <span id="s1126">Then he took us with him and he opened this business, established this business of building cement four by eights it would be today flats in Koenigs Wusterhausen.</span> <span id="s1127">So we belonged, our headquarters were Sachsenhausen, the concentration camp was Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s1128">They took us to Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s1129">From there he got his group further after delousing and after being there a few weeks --.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q. Wait you're skipping too many steps here.</span> <span id="s1131">I want to hear about the trip when you left the Ghetto, how all of that came about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A.</span> <span id="s1133">They loaded us into cattle trains.</span> <span id="s1134">I have to mention only a little thing, a few weeks or a few days before they loaded us, the engineer of the cattle of the train was a Pollack.</span> <span id="s1135">Because you remember there was movie Shoah on television for nine hours and it showed how the Poles this was their job.</span> <span id="s1136">He was the engineer of the train.</span> <span id="s1137">When we were loading these products that we were making on those trains he told us in Polish Jidski, Jews don't go, they're frying you in frying pans.</span> <span id="s1138">Now this is the end of '44, and we said to ourselves is he off his mind?</span> <span id="s1139">Frying us on frying pans?</span> <span id="s1140">What's he talking about.</span> <span id="s1141">He's stupid.</span> <span id="s1142">He knew what he was saying because he came from here to there and from there back.</span> <span id="s1143">So, he had to be careful telling us because the Germans were around but he did anyway.</span> <span id="s1144">So, finally the liquidation came.</span> <span id="s1145">We were loaded into cattle trains, and they took off.</span> <span id="s1146">No openings of any kind like you see on Schindler's List.</span> <span id="s1147">I really cannot tell you how many nights and how many days because we didn't know the difference between day and night.</span> <span id="s1148">They pushed us back and back until we arrived at the very big railroad crossing and I assume that it was Ravensbruck because they took out the women.</span> <span id="s1149">The doors opened and outside Germans running around with dogs, with German shepherds, yelling aloud "Frauen 'raus",_ women get out.</span> <span id="s1150">And that's how we were separated from our mother.</span> <span id="s1151">Then the doors locked again and the train went forward.</span> <span id="s1152">I don't know how long it took and we wound up in another place.</span> <span id="s1153">Now we knew we were in Sachsenhausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q.</span> <span id="s1155">What was the train ride like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A.</span> <span id="s1157">A cattle train filled with people like sardines.</span> <span id="s1158">Not a place to turn.</span> <span id="s1159">No facilities of any kind, not even a pail.</span> <span id="s1160">Now, you can imagine after a while how this things smelled, and people were just dying, falling down, sick or dead.</span> <span id="s1161">That's how it was.</span> <span id="s1162">It was hell, hell couldn't be that way.</span> <span id="s1163">This was worse than hell.</span> <span id="s1164">How long was it?</span> <span id="s1165">It could have been a week.</span> <span id="s1166">I don't know because we didn't know when it was day and when it was night.</span> <span id="s1167">We just heard trains going by and passing by and they pushed us from one line to the other and at once the door opened, we didn't know where we were.</span> <span id="s1168">We didn't know where we were.</span> <span id="s1169">That was the only stop to get all the women out.</span> <span id="s1170">And when they meant out, they meant out.</span> <span id="s1171">Then they continued on after a while and not long after we wound up at another station and that was our place, Sachsenburg-Oranienburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q. Describe to me what was happening when you arrived there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A.</span> <span id="s1174">When we arrived at Oranienburg, the doors opened and a few guys were dead and a few others got heart attacks and died in front of us.</span> <span id="s1175">One of them two sons survived and came to America afterwards, Jakobowski_ was their name, and he was one of the leaders of the Ghetto, too, and his father just fell dead while the door was opened and we carried him with us and he was cremated because they had crematoriums there too.</span> <span id="s1176">Then we came into the camp and there was big sign "Arbeit macht Frei", Work Makes You Free.</span> <span id="s1177">So, we realized that we were in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1178">There were barracks, full of barracks, and we all got -- 04:16:00 this was an established concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1179">As a matter of fact, the guy in charge of our barrack was a German.</span> <span id="s1180">George was his name.</span> <span id="s1181">He was incarcerated yet from the beginning of Hitler's times.</span> <span id="s1182">He was not bad with us.</span> <span id="s1183">The next barrack from us they had Russian prisoners.</span> <span id="s1184">Every morning they would march them.</span> <span id="s1185">These prisoners were used for breaking in new military shoes for the German Army.</span> <span id="s1186">You never heard of that.</span> <span id="s1187">That was their job.</span> <span id="s1188">In the morning, every morning they got a new pair of shoes because they were heavy and hard.</span> <span id="s1189">They wanted to have them for the soldiers to have them broken in.</span> <span id="s1190">SO, they would march a whole day and in the evening they came back and they gave back these shoes and they got other shoes the next morning.</span> <span id="s1191">They were our neighbors.</span> <span id="s1192">Us they were taking out to 04:17:00 work, and I remember at one time we worked at the Autobahn, means the highway from Moscow.</span> <span id="s1193">We built that.</span> <span id="s1194">At one time they took us to like work in the fields.</span> <span id="s1195">At one time they took us out to pick potatoes.</span> <span id="s1196">I remember the SS man who was in charge of the group just for fun pushed one of our boys.</span> <span id="s1197">I knew the boy well, when the truck moved, behind the wheel and squashed him.</span> <span id="s1198">In the evening he had to report to Mr. Beboff.</span> <span id="s1199">Beboff was waiting at the gate when we came back, marching us back, and he reported " Herr Gauleiter, Ich habe herausgenommen 125", I took out 125 and I brought back 120, and the reaction would be "gut gemacht", well done.</span> <span id="s1200">So, when we went out to work, we didn't know if we were going to come back.</span> <span id="s1201">All this was already so part of our being that we didn't think of the liberation.</span> <span id="s1202">We didn't know it would come until finally as this our commander told us that the spring song wind is blowing in front of you, you will not live but probably orders came in that we had to brought back to Sachsenhausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q.</span> <span id="s1204">When you were in Sachsenhausen initially, how long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A. Initially, we stayed in Sachsenhausen a very short time, just like a passing through to the real camp, maybe two or three or four weeks, no longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q. Was there a registration there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A. That's how I got my number.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q. Yes, but the tape doesn't know that's your number so tell me what really happened in those two weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A.</span> <span id="s1210">We got incorporated into the camp as prisoners of the camp.</span> <span id="s1211">We were taught all the rules of what goes on and while we were there we had to witness hangings.</span> <span id="s1212">If there was a hanging, we all had to go to witness it.</span> <span id="s1213">You know, that was the duty of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q.</span> <span id="s1215">What were you thinking?</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A.</span> <span id="s1217">What we were thinking?</span> <span id="s1218">I don't think we were thinking.</span> <span id="s1219">What could you think?</span> <span id="s1220">We had hangings in Ghetto too.</span> <span id="s1221">In other words, why was somebody hung in Ghetto?</span> <span id="s1222">I was stealing too, and I'll explain you why.</span> <span id="s1223">Let's say my brother, should he rest in peace, he worked in a shoe factory, so he would bring home a sole for a shoe.</span> <span id="s1224">For that he could have been hung.</span> <span id="s1225">So, if they caught anybody touching somebody, taking it, stealing it, he was sentenced.</span> <span id="s1226">There was no sentence, there was no court, they didn't have him in court like we have the thing now.</span> <span id="s1227">He was just hung.</span> <span id="s1228">They had places where to hang him.</span> <span id="s1229">So, and when they hung somebody to show the others how to behave, we had to go and be present at hangings.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q.</span> <span id="s1231">What were the rules they taught you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">A. I really don't...The rules were to keep yourself clean, or 04:28:30 to make the bunk every day.</span> <span id="s1233">There was no rules of any particular kind that I can remember.</span> <span id="s1234">I wouldn't even want to remember if there were, but I'm sure that there were rules to obey.</span> <span id="s1235">They were all more like for I don't want to say animals because I think I mentioned once today I don't want to insult the kingdom of animals.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q.</span> <span id="s1237">But you said they taught you -- they told you how it was going to work when you got in, I'm just wondering what they told you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">A.</span> <span id="s1239">They didn't give us any future.</span> <span id="s1240">They didn't tell us if you'll be good, you'll go home or you will go to the theater tomorrow or you'll have a piece of cake tomorrow.</span> <span id="s1241">We were worms as you walk and you step over worms.</span> <span id="s1242">Do you ask then the worm if he had rules.</span> <span id="s1243">There was rules that they made up, that they obeyed.</span> <span id="s1244">Okay, it (be)came very interesting in Koenigs Wusterhausen.</span> <span id="s1245">You remember I mentioned we had no facilities.</span> <span id="s1246">If we needed to go out in the field, the only way to go out was into the field.</span> <span id="s1247">So, in the night, let's say if I remember it vividly, if I needed to go out in the night, to make a physical need, to piss or whatever else, I had first to report to the Wacht (guard), the Heftlig (prisoner) #...., that I need to go out.</span> <span id="s1248">04:22:00 You know what he did to me.</span> <span id="s1249">He made me run around the barracks three time, not run around three times but "auf, auf, hinlegen", I'll never forget that.</span> <span id="s1250">He played with me.</span> <span id="s1251">He didn't get orders to do that.</span> <span id="s1252">He just wanted to have fun.</span> <span id="s1253">He made me fall down and get up.</span> <span id="s1254">I needed to go out, so he made me run around three times the barracks and he had fun in the night to make me fall down and get up.</span> <span id="s1255">Exercise.</span> <span id="s1256">Another case, it was a big privilege in camp, because they had their quarters there, the commanders, those who watched us.</span> <span id="s1257">I don't know now many of them, eight or ten, so they had a separate nicer house where they lived and where they ate, but they had to go for their food to headquarters, to the nearby headquarters.</span> <span id="s1258">It was a tremendous break or privilege rather a break if you were picked.</span> <span id="s1259">He would just go, come on here.</span> <span id="s1260">He picked one of the guys to go with him so they put you into a wagon like a horse with two wheels and there was a part on it to go to their kitchen to bring food for them.</span> <span id="s1261">On the way there, to the headquarters every German officer who passed by like that had the pleasure of spitting at you, kicking you, pushing you and the one who was in charge of us didn't mind.</span> <span id="s1262">But this was a break.</span> <span id="s1263">Why was this a break?</span> <span id="s1264">When they finished eating they gave you to wash the pots so you were able to lick a little bit.</span> <span id="s1265">So you would agree to be kicked around going one way and the other for this big break.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q.</span> <span id="s1267">You did this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A. I had once the privilege, only once, otherwise I wouldn't be able to tell you how these proud clean, tall uniformed like this he kicked, he spit, he threw his cigarette on you.</span> <span id="s1269">He pushed you over the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s1270">I was doing a duty and the guy stood there with the commander and just had fun both of them.</span> <span id="s1271">Where did you ever hear a thing like that in history?</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">Q.</span> <span id="s1273">What about people's health at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A. Health, health what is that?</span> <span id="s1275">Who thought of health.</span> <span id="s1276">You mean if you sneezed?</span> <span id="s1277">If you died, you died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q. Was there disease?</span> <span id="s1279">Were people taken care of?</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">A. Well, disease they would be afraid themselves.</span> <span id="s1281">Well, they always had "entlausung" deloused us because we didn't take showers or wash so they threw powder on us, "entlausung", and if somebody would be a little bit sick, they would shoot them.</span> <span id="s1282">There was no problem healing him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Q.</span> <span id="s1284">You had lice?</span> <span id="s1285">Did you have lice on you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A. I just told you, yes, lice.</span> <span id="s1287">Sure I had lice on me.</span> <span id="s1288">I did have lice on me, so what they did, they would powder you only.</span> <span id="s1289">You didn't take a shower.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q.</span> <span id="s1291">Did you ever get typhus or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A. I got typhus in the Ghetto, right after crypo.</span> <span id="s1293">I had very mild case of typhus, yes.</span> <span id="s1294">That was also in another horrible, horrible horrible thing.</span> <span id="s1295">I feel so horrible about it, that I am even ashamed, I feel bad to tell it with all three of you particularly those two.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q. Forget us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A. My uncle, this is why I don't want this to come to the public because maybe I have a chance now, maybe they'll give me something.</span> <span id="s1298">My uncle was also taken in at the same time as us, a little later, maybe a week later because we were there ten days.</span> <span id="s1299">When we came out, I was laying in bed sick, my wife, my father was laying in bed sick, and at once my oldest brother handed me a little note.</span> <span id="s1300">Uncle Solomon, my name, is dead.</span> <span id="s1301">How did he die?</span> <span id="s1302">He was taken into the Kripo too, and they tortured him.</span> <span id="s1303">I'm even ashamed to tell you what they did to him because it isn't _____________.</span> <span id="s1304">They tied his testicles with a rope.</span> <span id="s1305">Remember I told you it was only cobblestones at home.</span> <span id="s1306">They put him on a wagon.</span> <span id="s1307">They had a wagon with horses.</span> <span id="s1308">They didn't have a car.</span> <span id="s1309">If we heard that little horse running on the street, we didn't know who was next.</span> <span id="s1310">This little horse was like the devil for us.</span> <span id="s1311">The crypo was if you remember before, I said, only a block, two blocks, or one and a half blocks from where we lived, my uncle, too.</span> <span id="s1312">They put him on the wagon, and until he came threw the half of block, he was dead.</span> <span id="s1313">Blue and dead.</span> <span id="s1314">This you never heard yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q.</span> <span id="s1316">Who saw this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A.</span> <span id="s1318">Who saw this?</span> <span id="s1319">When they took him off when he came in the front of the building, they threw him out, and whoever was there, my aunt, my other people, he was dead.</span> <span id="s1320">He was blue and dead and his testicles were tied with a rope.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Q. Let's go back to where we were which was Sachsenhausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">A.</span> <span id="s1323">We were talking about Koenigs Wusterhausen now all the time.</span> <span id="s1324">From Sachsenhausen we were sent to work camp because Sachsenhausen was not a work camp.</span> <span id="s1325">It was a concentration camp and this was supposed to be a work camp.</span> <span id="s1326">So, there we were not long, from October to April 21, when the war started getting bad for them and then I said before Potsdam was burning and we were able to see Potsdam burning, so they returned us to SAchsenhausen.</span> <span id="s1327">When we arrived at Sachsenhausen we were going to Berlin.</span> <span id="s1328">Koenigs Wusterhausen was on one side of Berlin and Sachsenhausen on the other side.</span> <span id="s1329">So, we were seeing Berlin also in flames and pretty ruined.</span> <span id="s1330">We have seen the bombers day and night going that way because we were in the middle, rather Berlin was in the middle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">Q.</span> <span id="s1332">How far were these --?</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">A.</span> <span id="s1334">We were about ten or fifteen miles from one side of Berlin and the camp Sachsenhausen was also ten or fifteen miles the other side of Berlin.</span> <span id="s1335">When we came back to Sachsenhausen, it was a mad house.</span> <span id="s1336">Papers were flying.</span> <span id="s1337">They were burning papers, you know, they were disposing of it.</span> <span id="s1338">There was anarchy because when the camps were there was an order.</span> <span id="s1339">You know the famous German saying "In Ordnung muss die Welt zugrunde gehen", we will bring the world down in order.</span> <span id="s1340">So when we came there to Sachsenhausen_ we didn't know where we belonged.</span> <span id="s1341">There was no barracks for us.</span> <span id="s1342">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1343">They just led us into the gutter, but at the gate, we had to line up constantly and march out into the death march.</span> <span id="s1344">We didn't know what it was.</span> <span id="s1345">So, that's how the death march started or became.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">End of Tape 4</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Tape 5</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q. Tell me about this work camp, what was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">A.</span> <span id="s1350">The work camp was exactly if somebody would open a business of his own.</span> <span id="s1351">We were building one item.</span> <span id="s1352">In other words, this Biboff, in order to get themselves involved with something that is almost military and need for war, because Berlin was bombarded by then and there was a lot of homeless.</span> <span id="s1353">There was no more monkey business.</span> <span id="s1354">He came up with this -- not the idea-- but he opened the business of building four by eight cement plates which then he sent or sold to Berliners to make themselves shacks to live in.</span> <span id="s1355">They were already "auf Tsures" themselves.</span> <span id="s1356">That's what he did.</span> <span id="s1357">In other words, he took advantage of the situation or if you want to say it was a business of his.</span> <span id="s1358">It had nothing to do with the German government anymore.</span> <span id="s1359">But we did belong to the German government.</span> <span id="s1360">We did belong to Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s1361">The Shupos, or the soldiers that were watching us were belonging their command came from Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s1362">So, that's how it worked.</span> <span id="s1363">It was a whole set up.</span> <span id="s1364">As a camp how it was, we did not have hangings in this camp.</span> <span id="s1365">We did not have much beating in this camp.</span> <span id="s1366">Once in a while the commander here would kick you.</span> <span id="s1367">He could have split you in half.</span> <span id="s1368">We worked from sunrise to sundown.</span> <span id="s1369">There was no hours.</span> <span id="s1370">I remember like now, at that time, it was placed on a railroad intersection.</span> <span id="s1371">So, we loaded the railroad with the stuff and then by then already as we were there a little few weeks because that already was towards the end of the war, we started receiving German soldiers from the Russian front without noses without ears, frozen hands.</span> <span id="s1372">They couldn't even eat a piece of bread that was laying to them.</span> <span id="s1373">So, we already have seen how they were getting in their behind.</span> <span id="s1374">Yes, yes, they were getting it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q.</span> <span id="s1376">What were you thinking when you saw that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">A.</span> <span id="s1378">We were thinking -- I think you said before if we ever thought -- this time we were thinking, oh, it was so good.</span> <span id="s1379">It was good.</span> <span id="s1380">It didn't last long because then they took us to the march, and it became hell again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">Q.</span> <span id="s1382">Did it give you hope?</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s1384">That was the first time when the hope was me or not me but that's their end.</span> <span id="s1385">Where did we get news from?</span> <span id="s1386">That should be a question to answer.</span> <span id="s1387">How did we know what date it is or what day it is?</span> <span id="s1388">We didn't have calendars.</span> <span id="s1389">We didn't have watches.</span> <span id="s1390">We had nothing.</span> <span id="s1391">When the SS was having a paper and the wind blew it away, that's how we caught up with the times.</span> <span id="s1392">It's interesting, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">Q. Please tell me more about what the camp looked like, who was in charge?</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A.</span> <span id="s1395">It was a field, a big field on the outskirts or on the side of this big railroad station because what we produced was supposed to be shipped and received again raw material.</span> <span id="s1396">That was going on for these few weeks or these few months, but we were there.</span> <span id="s1397">That's all it was, a big field.</span> <span id="s1398">Now, you wanted to know if the Germans knew about us.</span> <span id="s1399">Let me describe you.</span> <span id="s1400">We were hungry, no question about it.</span> <span id="s1401">We have seen German women -- because this was in the midst of them-- German women driving bicycles, not cars.</span> <span id="s1402">In the back they had loaves of bread.</span> <span id="s1403">It turned our insides.</span> <span id="s1404">They were having big full breads to eat besides other items probably that she took home to her family.</span> <span id="s1405">We seen them.</span> <span id="s1406">They did see us, and they did see the way we looked.</span> <span id="s1407">They knew that we were prisoners, that we were prisoners--prisoners is too fancy a name because we were not prisoners, slaves.</span> <span id="s1408">Not even that.</span> <span id="s1409">There is no word to describe what we were.</span> <span id="s1410">So, that describes to you what it was.</span> <span id="s1411">It was a few barracks that we built ourselves.</span> <span id="s1412">When we came there there was only one barrack and it wasn't finished.</span> <span id="s1413">So, first we built our own barrack and this Biboff couldn't give a damn how much production went out from there or what we built.</span> <span id="s1414">All for him was important that he was covered because he was in charge.</span> <span id="s1415">It was his business and he is helping the government, the war effort.</span> <span id="s1416">He was helping the war effort and he enslaved us.</span> <span id="s1417">So, probably he must have been a big guy that even could get a thing like that.</span> <span id="s1418">Do you understand his position?</span> <span id="s1419">His position was to cover himself.</span> <span id="s1420">If he made profit or not on it that I don't care and I don't know, but I'm trying to describe you what it was a big empty field which was fenced in then, and when we came there was one barrack unfinished.</span> <span id="s1421">We had to finish it ourselves.</span> <span id="s1422">It was already winter coming.</span> <span id="s1423">There was one water well outside, a pump.</span> <span id="s1424">That's where we in the morning we able to wash our faces.</span> <span id="s1425">We stood in line half naked in the cold and splashed our faces.</span> <span id="s1426">You couldn't do more than that with a little pump when you had 500 people to go through and here you had to go out to commandos, it's called, work commandos.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q.</span> <span id="s1428">The entire working camp was you 500 people from the Lodz Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A. Yes, that group, that group.</span> <span id="s1430">And we had women amongst us too, but not together with us.</span> <span id="s1431">Also, now, if somebody died, it was another privilege to get a piece of bread if you carried them out.</span> <span id="s1432">They had the wagon on two wheels only and you put yourself in the front like a horse and I know a person who lives now in Europe who was good at it because I couldn't do it.</span> <span id="s1433">Not everybody could.</span> <span id="s1434">He got an extra piece of bread to do that job, to carry out the dead.</span> <span id="s1435">The way he disposed of them nobody knows.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">Q. So, they sent you back to Sachsenhausen and you saw Berlin burning, that must have been hopeful?</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">A. Because we had to go to Berlin to the underground bahn-- to the subway.</span> <span id="s1438">As a matter of fact there were rumors that Hitler had ordered the underground to be flooded.</span> <span id="s1439">It was flooded, but right after we passed it.</span> <span id="s1440">So, through the autobahn we came to Sachsenhausen, but we did have the privilege of seeing Berlin burning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">Q.</span> <span id="s1442">Did you see a lot of German people on your way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">A.</span> <span id="s1444">We did some, yes, we did see some, but they could not have any contact with us.</span> <span id="s1445">That mood was already hell for everybody.</span> <span id="s1446">That was hell came to be.</span> <span id="s1447">Then at once when we came into Sachsenhausen, the whole thing was like anarchy.</span> <span id="s1448">As orderly as the camps were, not it's an anarchy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">Q.</span> <span id="s1450">What does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">05:09:00 A. Everybody on his own.</span> <span id="s1452">Papers flying, burning papers.</span> <span id="s1453">They're burning everything.</span> <span id="s1454">But they directed everybody into the main gate out and we got lined up into what became the death march.</span> <span id="s1455">That was the death march which lasted from the 25th of April when we left Koenigs Wusterhausen.</span> <span id="s1456">In include this into the 2nd of May, the day of Liberation.</span> <span id="s1457">So, we marched for about two weeks without any provisions, without any facilities.</span> <span id="s1458">Just marching, marching, marching, and after a while people were tipping over to the sideways with the SS on the sides of us.</span> <span id="s1459">They did inform us, like some of them that they are marching us towards Hamburg because -- and it was on television this week-- if the Russians reach us, they will call us all.</span> <span id="s1460">They, the Germans will kill us.</span> <span id="s1461">If the Americans reach us, we will be their -- they will turn us over to Americans as a good gesture to save their lives.</span> <span id="s1462">So, we walked like that and we walked and people were tipping over and that's how this picture got soiled because we were sleeping in the mud.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">Q.</span> <span id="s1464">The picture of your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">A.</span> <span id="s1466">This picture of my brother, yes.</span> <span id="s1467">I didn't know.</span> <span id="s1468">If I knew I would stow it away because if any German would notice he would kill me.</span> <span id="s1469">Then after a while I couldn't take it no more and I realized that when people lay down they give him a shot in the head to make sure he's dead, finished, over.</span> <span id="s1470">So, we kept on marching, we kept on marching, and people were laying down.</span> <span id="s1471">At once I started negotiating with my brothers.</span> <span id="s1472">Now, this is really something that I'll never ever be able to explain how the three of us were together all the time.</span> <span id="s1473">That is unexplainable.</span> <span id="s1474">But there is a few other cases like that too, in amongst such a big mass of people.</span> <span id="s1475">I started negotiating with my two brothers that I've had enough, I'm going to lay down.</span> <span id="s1476">I'll tell you why else.</span> <span id="s1477">It was May, April May.</span> <span id="s1478">When we came to Sachsenhausen originally in October they bathed us, just like they did for gas chambers and then they threw us clothing.</span> <span id="s1479">We had undressed, and a big guy would get a small piece of clothing and I got a coat it must have been from a dead woman of 400 pounds.</span> <span id="s1480">So, it became very useful in the camp during the winter, but to carry it on yourself in May.</span> <span id="s1481">Europe has a mild climate.</span> <span id="s1482">It was killing me.</span> <span id="s1483">It was hot, and it was so big.</span> <span id="s1484">So, at once I said I'll throw it away, but if you throw it away they'll shoot you.</span> <span id="s1485">You're not supposed -- this is not your road, you cannot throw -- and the coat doesn't belong to you, a coat, a shmatte.</span> <span id="s1486">It had not buttons.</span> <span id="s1487">I remember when the commander once in the morning said to me "Sie haben keine Knoepfe", that I have no buttons.</span> <span id="s1488">He was worried that I have no Knoepfe.</span> <span id="s1489">Tomorrow you will have Knoepfe.</span> <span id="s1490">I'll go to Macy's and buy Knoepfe.</span> <span id="s1491">So when I was outside working I thought what will I do now.</span> <span id="s1492">Tomorrow I will be on count down and I have no Knoepfe.</span> <span id="s1493">So, I found a piece of wire on the floor and I made holes and I tied it up.</span> <span id="s1494">This was my coat, which because of this coat I wanted to give up in May because I couldn't carry it, it was too hot.</span> <span id="s1495">So, anyway, my brother, who was the father of this lawyer, said to me, my name at home was Schlomik, in Polish, "I have a feeling that we're going to freedom.</span> <span id="s1496">Don't do it.</span> <span id="s1497">Please don't lay down."</span> <span id="s1498">But by then if you lay down they didn't shoot you, but they kicked you.</span> <span id="s1499">They didn't want to waste ammunition on you, so they made you, they forced you to walk.</span> <span id="s1500">In the nights, they dispersed us into the woods.</span> <span id="s1501">If you want me to tell you the last day of this march which is liberation so my brother again, he was terrific.</span> <span id="s1502">Once we were sleeping near a farm, in the night and they had some bags with little corn.</span> <span id="s1503">My brother with his fingers managed to pull out a few pieces of corn because we didn't eat.</span> <span id="s1504">When we marched it was five of us.</span> <span id="s1505">Me and my two brothers, one friend that went with me to school together and his father.</span> <span id="s1506">He then became a doctor in America and he died of cancer.</span> <span id="s1507">Anyway, my brother was feeding us.</span> <span id="s1508">Everytime he gave each one of us one piece to chew to exist.</span> <span id="s1509">So, one day it was the 2nd of May--better yet the first of May we notice the SS reading a newspapers. "</span> <span id="s1510">The Fuehrer ist tot.</span> <span id="s1511">It was worth living.</span> <span id="s1512">Do you know what it means?</span> <span id="s1513">Hitler is dead.</span> <span id="s1514">Better news we couldn't ask for.</span> <span id="s1515">He was reading, but they were starting losing themselves.</span> <span id="s1516">Without the Fuhrer how can they exist.</span> <span id="s1517">The Fuhrer is tot.</span> <span id="s1518">Now, another story, airplanes started flying on top over us one day before liberation.</span> <span id="s1519">Leaflets came down signed by Truman, Stalin and Churchill.</span> <span id="s1520">Stop the killing, we will keep you responsible.</span> <span id="s1521">Why did they wait so long.</span> <span id="s1522">Why did they wait why couldn't they do that months or years before the last day?</span> <span id="s1523">You know how the Germans reacted to that?</span> <span id="s1524">They have an intuition of sadism like nobody else.</span> <span id="s1525">They threw a can of bloodwurst-- meat into the masses thousands of people got killed because amongst them was mainly the Russian prisoners who were a little stronger than us.</span> <span id="s1526">All these people had to grab that can.</span> <span id="s1527">Imagine their idea that they'll throw in one can of meat there many people will get killed.</span> <span id="s1528">That was the first of May.</span> <span id="s1529">So, now liberation day.</span> <span id="s1530">That's a beautiful day.</span> <span id="s1531">At once we reached a little overpass as we were marching and the sun shined so good.</span> <span id="s1532">On the overpass we couldn't believe ourselves there were red cross busses and red cross representatives and German officers and they were negotiating and talking and we feel that this must be a put on because this is the end of us.</span> <span id="s1533">They didn't let us cross.</span> <span id="s1534">It must have been 11:00 or 12:00, we didn't know.</span> <span id="s1535">We didn't have watches, and I remember I was laying on the ground and I put my feet against a tree just to relax a little bit and I was picking grass and I ate and we were sitting there and they were negotiating back and forth and we didn't believe that this is it.</span> <span id="s1536">At once, march again, the busses get away and we marched across this overpass.</span> <span id="s1537">So, the hours in the meantime we went forward until we reached an intersection and there was a German again like this showing us that we can't go any further than into the woods again.</span> <span id="s1538">Same thing as every day.</span> <span id="s1539">Dispersed into the woods for the night.</span> <span id="s1540">My brother, this one, he was a hero, really.</span> <span id="s1541">He had a little can on him all the time, and as we were marching at the risk of being shot he would run over if there was mud, and he would grab a can of this and that would be our supper in the evening, with the worms and everything in it.</span> <span id="s1542">He did it every day.</span> <span id="s1543">So, they moved us in there.</span> <span id="s1544">Yes, I must give credits to the Czechoslovakians.</span> <span id="s1545">We were marching geographically as Poles, and the Poles even then were anti-semitic, but at once geographically we were able to blend ourselves into Czechoslovakia which is next on the map geographically, and these Czech's took care of us.</span> <span id="s1546">They watched over us.</span> <span id="s1547">They knew we were Jewish that we are in bigger trouble than them.</span> <span id="s1548">In the evening, in the night, they helped us get leaves together to make a place to lay down.</span> <span id="s1549">I'm talking now about liberation day.</span> <span id="s1550">So, we did all that, and my brother had managed to grab a piece of supper for us, in the can of worms with everything in it, with the grubs, and I lay down on the ground like that and I pushed it over, my can, with my foot.</span> <span id="s1551">There went our dinner.</span> <span id="s1552">My brother got himself again -- now it's a dispersement.</span> <span id="s1553">Everybody lays there, all kinds of nationalities.</span> <span id="s1554">God knows how far and he went to find another pan, and he didn't see it.</span> <span id="s1555">He went.</span> <span id="s1556">After a 05:18:00 long time, me and my brother standing there we lost him.</span> <span id="s1557">At once we see a bundle is moving forward like a pile of something is moving towards us.</span> <span id="s1558">We notice that our brother is coming and he brought a can of food.</span> <span id="s1559">He said we don't need it no more, we are free.</span> <span id="s1560">Free, will you stop saying that, we're going to get killed.</span> <span id="s1561">Where do you get ______________ what do you mean we are free.</span> <span id="s1562">Don't you see everybody is here.</span> <span id="s1563">And a little while later a green Opel car, those days with the step on the side, drove in, and a Russian officer said zdrastvjete, he was Russian because there were many Russians, so we started believing that we were free.</span> <span id="s1564">The rain started drizzling a little bit.</span> <span id="s1565">The day came to an end and we say to ourselves, if it's true and everybody starts going out to the main road and we say to ourselves, we're Jews.</span> <span id="s1566">Let's wait a little longer.</span> <span id="s1567">If it's true, we waited that long, let's wait a little longer, but the woods were getting empty and also we noticed that Germans were kind of coming and mixing amongst us and tearing off their epaulets and throwing their uniforms away, the big heroes.</span> <span id="s1568">At once they're not anymore heroes.</span> <span id="s1569">Something -- we couldn't add it up.</span> <span id="s1570">Also we decided also to go out.</span> <span id="s1571">So as we went out towards the main road because we knew where we came in, the corn was already that high on the side of the road.</span> <span id="s1572">At once we notice a German on a horse with a column of horses like this.</span> <span id="s1573">He didn't know that it's over, so we could have gotten killed.</span> <span id="s1574">We laid down on the side of the corn and they passed and we went forward.</span> <span id="s1575">We came to the main road.</span> <span id="s1576">Americans with the pistols like that, like about every 20 or 30 feet.</span> <span id="s1577">We couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s1578">The Germans like this, their tanks taken and we're free.</span> <span id="s1579">I was hospitalized right after this.</span> <span id="s1580">Let me get to it.</span> <span id="s1581">We didn't know English.</span> <span id="s1582">In other words, the Russians and the Americans(?)</span> <span id="s1583">came together.</span> <span id="s1584">So, we went --we came out to the road where the American side was which was good.</span> <span id="s1585">The American boys showed like this.</span> <span id="s1586">We didn't know what they meant.</span> <span id="s1587">The Red Cross is waiting for us there.</span> <span id="s1588">Until we understood what, so we were going there and in the middle of the road the Germans were already like this, prisoners, with the tanks with all the machinery and we couldn't walk no more.</span> <span id="s1589">We didn't know how far it was so we got in in a tank.</span> <span id="s1590">The soldiers helped us on the tanks and the Germans were leading the tanks.</span> <span id="s1591">I came up on this tank, in front where the driver was, was lying a bacon, a big piece of bacon.</span> <span id="s1592">It was green and I ate it.</span> <span id="s1593">I wound up in the hospital, because I got poisoned from it.</span> <span id="s1594">Anyway after a short while of -- I didn't know right away that I was sick.</span> <span id="s1595">I didn't eat -- I mean I knew I ate raw bacon and after I went off that tank the whole thing -- the whole world is how will I use an expression, in Hebrew it's Tohu va Bohu, like in the beginning God (when) created the world.</span> <span id="s1596">We walked, me and my two brothers, and at once we noticed that on the left hand side was a white beautiful house and three American soldiers standing there.</span> <span id="s1597">So, we went over to them.</span> <span id="s1598">The Germans were just walking passed like this with their hands on their heads, prisoners.</span> <span id="s1599">We went over to them and we started talking but we don't speak English.</span> <span id="s1600">But they were Jewish boys, so we were able to communicate.</span> <span id="s1601">They were wild.</span> <span id="s1602">The first Jew since Normandy, which was a year later.</span> <span id="s1603">The invasion of Normandy was a year before.</span> <span id="s1604">They took us into that house.</span> <span id="s1605">This was a German house.</span> <span id="s1606">They took us into that house.</span> <span id="s1607">They fed us, which they shouldn't have.</span> <span id="s1608">Then they put us to sleep and we couldn't sleep in a bed.</span> <span id="s1609">It was awful, it was so clean and it was so soft.</span> <span id="s1610">The following day I got sick, and they had to take me to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1611">The soldiers took care of us all the time.</span> <span id="s1612">They were stationed there.</span> <span id="s1613">So, they brought a woman German doctor for me, and she prescribed red wine for me.</span> <span id="s1614">Where would they get red wine.</span> <span id="s1615">It's a war zone.</span> <span id="s1616">The boys went out and told us don't you open the door to nobody.</span> <span id="s1617">When we come back we will knock with the carabines on the door a certain amount of times then you'll know it's us.</span> <span id="s1618">We're going to look for red wine.</span> <span id="s1619">They came back in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s1620">You're not going to drink red wine.</span> <span id="s1621">We're going to bath you in it.</span> <span id="s1622">We found a tug boat full of it.</span> <span id="s1623">That's the end.</span> <span id="s1624">That is the end of the hell, but then you are a displaced person and you have to go through a lot.</span> <span id="s1625">It took until July '45 when we went to Sweden.</span> <span id="s1626">We went to Sweden because you remember when I told you my brother, they broke his arm, and they shot the doctor.</span> <span id="s1627">Because of my brother's state of health, the Red Cross picked sick ones to go to Sweden.</span> <span id="s1628">Very few, as we wondered all his time how is that three of us survived?</span> <span id="s1629">Very few were more than us alone, so anybody who had family like two brothers, the Swedes took us alone.</span> <span id="s1630">That's how we got to Sweden July 7, 1945, after liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">Q.</span> <span id="s1632">So the Red Cross took you to Sweden?</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">A.</span> <span id="s1634">The Red Cross took us to Sweden, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">Q.</span> <span id="s1636">What happened in Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">A.</span> <span id="s1638">In Sweden my brother was put in a hospital and we were camped.</span> <span id="s1639">It wasn't only us.</span> <span id="s1640">They took over a lot of people, and they had camps provided, like military barracks outside of Stockholm, all over Sweden.</span> <span id="s1641">This is a separate chapter.</span> <span id="s1642">The Swedes did us absolutely magnificent.</span> <span id="s1643">That's a separate in our lives is Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">Q.</span> <span id="s1645">It must have been quite an adjustment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">A.</span> <span id="s1647">If you want to know about Sweden, it was quite an adjustment but it was so wonderful.</span> <span id="s1648">They were so nice.</span> <span id="s1649">All right.</span> <span id="s1650">We arrived in Sweden the 7th of July in the city of Helsingborg.</span> <span id="s1651">People were on the roof tops on the ________ hanging.</span> <span id="s1652">People were every where to receive us.</span> <span id="s1653">Then, naturally we were sent around -- oh, it was July so the schools it was vacation so the schools were turned over for our use.</span> <span id="s1654">They brought us to the town which is called Landskroner, and they put us in a school.</span> <span id="s1655">Naturally, they had to put fences around.</span> <span id="s1656">Now, before we left Germany, the port of Luebeck, the Swedes took us over already.</span> <span id="s1657">We got undressed and all we got -- we got sanitized because we were in bad shape, and they gave us underwear only.</span> <span id="s1658">We lived in that underwear for two or three weeks in that school, because they were quarantining us.</span> <span id="s1659">They fenced around that school.</span> <span id="s1660">Swedes were only allowed to go to see us or to talk to us through the fence because they were afraid of sickness.</span> <span id="s1661">After we were through the quarantine, busses came.</span> <span id="s1662">They took us to warehouses.</span> <span id="s1663">By warehouses I mean stores, like Macy's, like Gimbel's, you know.</span> <span id="s1664">The stores were not available for civilians for that particular day.</span> <span id="s1665">We had a list of what we need to wear.</span> <span id="s1666">That was after the quarantine.</span> <span id="s1667">The quarantine took two weeks, three weeks.</span> <span id="s1668">The sick ones were taken to other sanatariums and first they gave us three changes of clothing including work clothing.</span> <span id="s1669">Everything that a person needs that's what the Swedes did.</span> <span id="s1670">I'm very fond of all of Scandinavians.</span> <span id="s1671">You know the stories of Denmark or Norway.</span> <span id="s1672">So, that's what they did.</span> <span id="s1673">Even Finland.</span> <span id="s1674">That's how we wound up in Sweden and there we were camped for a certain while.</span> <span id="s1675">They taught us trades.</span> <span id="s1676">We were free people.</span> <span id="s1677">We were able to travel free.</span> <span id="s1678">Everything free.</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">Q.</span> <span id="s1680">Did you eventually get your own places to live there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">A. Yes, when we started working we had an apartment.</span> <span id="s1682">We lived as subtenants, because while we were in Germany liberated the military, the American Military were registering those that want to go to America.</span> <span id="s1683">So, we were on the list.</span> <span id="s1684">So, we were not eager to have our own apartment, but we rented an apartment from a wonderful lady in a private house.</span> <span id="s1685">Her son was a classmate of Ingrid Bergman's first husband Aaron Lindstrom.</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">End of Tape 5</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">Tape 6</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">Q. Before you made it to Sweden, did you --?</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">A. I see what you mean.</span> <span id="s1690">I was hospitalized in a city called Hagenau.</span> <span id="s1691">A small city in Germany, in the vicinity.</span> <span id="s1692">But Hagenau was also a prisoner's camp.</span> <span id="s1693">I mean, we were camped there just like others.</span> <span id="s1694">As I mentioned before at one point, we were considered geographically Poles so they put us to this district, the Polish district of the camp.</span> <span id="s1695">The Poles started showing anti-semitism immediately.</span> <span id="s1696">We couldn't take it.</span> <span id="s1697">We didn't have to take it no more.</span> <span id="s1698">We knew this is the end.</span> <span id="s1699">We would not accept that.</span> <span id="s1700">We wouldn't stay here or we'll do something about it.</span> <span id="s1701">One of our boys, who happens to be now a lawyer in Tel Aviv, spoke, knew English a little bit, like I learn languages in his school, instead of German, they learned English.</span> <span id="s1702">So, he knew enough English to communicate.</span> <span id="s1703">He went to the American headquarters and by coincidence the captain there in charge happened to be a Jewish boy from New York.</span> <span id="s1704">We told him what happened.</span> <span id="s1705">He immediately ordered a truck.</span> <span id="s1706">It was an open truck or a bus I don't remember and he arranged to bring us to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1707">The Poles looked what happened.</span> <span id="s1708">Where are you going Jews Jidji, where are you going?</span> <span id="s1709">We didn't give a damn for them.</span> <span id="s1710">We were out.</span> <span id="s1711">That's how we wound up with all the others in the big camp of Bergen-Belsem.</span> <span id="s1712">That's where we stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">Q.</span> <span id="s1714">How long were you in the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">A.</span> <span id="s1716">In Bergen-Belsem I was since liberation which was May.</span> <span id="s1717">It was still May until July 7.</span> <span id="s1718">From there we went to Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">Q. Can you tell me about Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">A. Well, the camps in Bergen-Belsem where we were kept used to be a German air force academy.</span> <span id="s1721">That's where they camped us.</span> <span id="s1722">We slept on beds and on floors.</span> <span id="s1723">The hallways were full of poeple, and Americans were stationed across from us.</span> <span id="s1724">We never knew pancakes, but we wanted to eat something better because what they gave us us was still not the best, but the Americans were getting delicious food, so we would stay there with our cans.</span> <span id="s1725">When the Americans threw food away, the English couldn't afford to do that.</span> <span id="s1726">We grabbed it, and that's how we were introduced to pancakes.</span> <span id="s1727">Every one of us would sleep on a dozen pancakes.</span> <span id="s1728">That's true.</span> <span id="s1729">You know we were sleeping in the hallways, lined up.</span> <span id="s1730">We got some kind of mattresses, but everybody was grabbing pancakes.</span> <span id="s1731">It was so good.</span> <span id="s1732">It became like an item to us.</span> <span id="s1733">Whoever had more of them.</span> <span id="s1734">So we put them -- where could we have kept them all day?</span> <span id="s1735">We kept them in our beds, and that's where we slept.</span> <span id="s1736">And little by little, we started to develop and we were able to see a doctor and the fact that my brother was injured, the Red Cross, the Swedes were already very active there helping out, so that's how they took us to Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">Q. Was it crowded?</span> <span id="s1738">Were the conditions okay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">A.</span> <span id="s1740">That question should be answered it was crowded but wonderful.</span> <span id="s1741">We were free.</span> <span id="s1742">We were free and little by little people were coming out of there.</span> <span id="s1743">Those that remained in Germany many remained started working.</span> <span id="s1744">Started doing business, started going to school.</span> <span id="s1745">I wish I went to school.</span> <span id="s1746">I should have gone to school because I had the background, but if we would have remained there, I would have gone to school and I would have been today an educated person.</span> <span id="s1747">But my brother had to go to Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">Q. Were the schools organized by the camp itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">A. No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1750">They went to regular German schools, not schools for us.</span> <span id="s1751">You were able to attend -- you became a normal person and anybody could have done whatever he was able to do.</span> <span id="s1752">People were out to help themselves.</span> <span id="s1753">For a long time we lived on the mercy of the donations, on the mercy of the UNRRA.</span> <span id="s1754">You heard of the UNRRA, on the mercy of the American Red Cross or the European Red Cross.</span> <span id="s1755">There was no more problem of not being fed.</span> <span id="s1756">Even dressed, even housed.</span> <span id="s1757">So if at once we were housed and slept in a corridor, to us it didn't mean anything.</span> <span id="s1758">It was wonderful.</span> <span id="s1759">We were free.</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">Q.</span> <span id="s1761">How long did this euphoria over your freedom last?</span> <span id="s1762">Did people all of a sudden have to come to terms with their families?</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">A. Well, it was a very horrible time because at once we had to see who do we have.</span> <span id="s1764">Where are they?</span> <span id="s1765">Where are the others?</span> <span id="s1766">That became the main concern.</span> <span id="s1767">Where are they?</span> <span id="s1768">What happened?</span> <span id="s1769">How can we find them?</span> <span id="s1770">Some picked themselves up and went home, if that's what you call it.</span> <span id="s1771">They found nothing.</span> <span id="s1772">We knew that it's no good.</span> <span id="s1773">A few did discover themselves and that's how the whole new era of life started with zionism, with Israel, with American, with Canada.</span> <span id="s1774">For once we were free to do things with ourselves and again, step into normal living.</span> <span id="s1775">Those things don't happen overnight.</span> <span id="s1776">It's not easy particularly we are displaced persons.</span> <span id="s1777">D.P.</span> <span id="s1778">We were stamped D.P..</span> <span id="s1779">We were D.P.'s, displaced persons.</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">Q.</span> <span id="s1781">Did you have any thoughts about going back to Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">A. No, no.</span> <span id="s1783">I wouldn't be able to face it.</span> <span id="s1784">My wife went once from Sweden in 1946 because we knew -- she wanted to go to put up monuments on her father and her brother and my father.</span> <span id="s1785">She went for that purpose and we had already people there that did return so she had where to stay.</span> <span id="s1786">So, for that purpose she went.</span> <span id="s1787">But I could never have gone back.</span> <span id="s1788">I would never, no.</span> <span id="s1789">I was once in Belgium, in the outskirts of one of the city of Liege_or where(ever?)</span> <span id="s1790">that also had concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1791">That's the only concentration camp I tried to go into after liberation because we were in Belgium one year 1947 from Sweden.</span> <span id="s1792">It was a horrible thing to see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">Q.</span> <span id="s1794">When you were at Belsem were there efforts made to help people get information about their families?</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">A. Oh, definitely, the UJA.</span> <span id="s1796">That's how I found my wife.</span> <span id="s1797">That's how my brother found his wife.</span> <span id="s1798">They were only girlfriend and boyfriend then.</span> <span id="s1799">That was in Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">Q.</span> <span id="s1801">How about Belsenm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">A.</span> <span id="s1803">There too, in Bergen-Belsen too.</span> <span id="s1804">But we first discovered our things in Stockholm where the UGA had every day new lists.</span> <span id="s1805">And my brother found his girlfriend, and she was at the other end of Sweden.</span> <span id="s1806">Sweden is long and narrow.</span> <span id="s1807">It takes a night to come from Stockholm to Southern Sweden.</span> <span id="s1808">So, I went with my brother o find his girlfriend.</span> <span id="s1809">She was only then a girlfriend and there was a girls camp.</span> <span id="s1810">Camps for girls and boys.</span> <span id="s1811">This is a very famous story.</span> <span id="s1812">One of the girls was showing pictures that were taken after the war of the girls and at one picture I see this is Grinspan.</span> <span id="s1813">She says how do you know.</span> <span id="s1814">I said this is my fiancee.</span> <span id="s1815">This is my girlfriend.</span> <span id="s1816">I love her.</span> <span id="s1817">She was -- but I had to go back up to Uppsala, the old city.</span> <span id="s1818">She was adopted by a non-Jewish family, a Christian family who is a very aristocratic family whose son was the president of the bar of Sweden, and the daughter was the president of the Library of Stockholm.</span> <span id="s1819">She was adopted there and they sent her to become a nurse.</span> <span id="s1820">She was working as a nurse in a hospital.</span> <span id="s1821">Anyway, it was before Rosh Hoshana.</span> <span id="s1822">I sent a New Years card.</span> <span id="s1823">But what kind of New Years card?</span> <span id="s1824">Sweden didn't have Rosh Hoshana cards.</span> <span id="s1825">So, it was a Swedish small good new year.</span> <span id="s1826">I have the card until today in my house.</span> <span id="s1827">So, she was adopted there.</span> <span id="s1828">She was 60 miles above Stockholm.</span> <span id="s1829">She thought that nobody remained.</span> <span id="s1830">So, when I found her on the list, I sent her this card and at once she knew I was there.</span> <span id="s1831">By then she was going out with this Swedish captain of the Air Force.</span> <span id="s1832">She was in a beautiful family, the Culvert family.</span> <span id="s1833">They were a very aristicratic family.</span> <span id="s1834">But when Mrs. Culvert recieved this card and then I started writing letters she said to her what is this correspondence you're having.</span> <span id="s1835">We want to know who you're corresponding with.</span> <span id="s1836">So, she said this is a friend from home.</span> <span id="s1837">They said we want to meet him.</span> <span id="s1838">They invited me to their house and Mr. Culvert went out to the woods and killed a deer that's the only time in my life that I ate deer meat.</span> <span id="s1839">They made a dinner for us and by desert time Mr. Culvert took me into his library.</span> <span id="s1840">All the Swedes have libraries and particularly an aristocratic family like that, very wealthy, but he was kind enough to test me on the Bible, otherwise I would be lost, and I passed.</span> <span id="s1841">Then they started intervening with this girl that you see today.</span> <span id="s1842">Mrs. Culvert told her no it's not good.</span> <span id="s1843">It's an attraction with this Swedish captain, you never met somebody else.</span> <span id="s1844">You thought everybody is dead.</span> <span id="s1845">Somebody showed up, cool it a little bit.</span> <span id="s1846">Let us get to know this boy, and they came to my wedding.</span> <span id="s1847">We were married in Malmoe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">Q.</span> <span id="s1849">You started dating in the Lodz Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">A.</span> <span id="s1851">We knew from school, not the Lodz Ghetto, school days.</span> <span id="s1852">We lived in the country together a few season, one villa next to the other.</span> <span id="s1853">I knew her brother.</span> <span id="s1854">Here is a picture of her family.</span> <span id="s1855">She received it from an aunt in Newark after the war.</span> <span id="s1856">You will recognize the cute little thing.</span> <span id="s1857">I knew her since probably she was ten years old.</span> <span id="s1858">Last week was our 49th anniversary.</span> <span id="s1859">The 24th of March.</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">Q.</span> <span id="s1861">How come you decided to come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">A.</span> <span id="s1863">If you remember we were registered.</span> <span id="s1864">In those days, I don't know if you'll remember do you remember the Berlin blockade in history,when Truman was President and then again it looked like movements from the Russians.</span> <span id="s1865">It looked like a new war is shaping up and we decided enough is enough and somehow we were registered and at once we were called by the American consulate that if we want to it's our turn.</span> <span id="s1866">So, we decided to go.</span> <span id="s1867">So, just like this, we came with $500 in my pocket and a pregnant wife.</span> <span id="s1868">So, you want to know how easy it was here?</span> <span id="s1869">When I came here that was in 1949, Truman was President and I learned a trade in Sweden as a furrier, but there was a big crises and it was already past season and I coudn't find a job.</span> <span id="s1870">I came in on 29th street to one person and he told me look you cannot find a job now.</span> <span id="s1871">Listen to me and I'll help you.</span> <span id="s1872">I know the chief of personnel at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx.</span> <span id="s1873">She's a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s1874">Seven million unemployment in the country.</span> <span id="s1875">There are lines for this job as a dishwasher.</span> <span id="s1876">Go there.</span> <span id="s1877">I washed dishes for three months.</span> <span id="s1878">Nice story.</span> <span id="s1879">Later years, I was always in business.</span> <span id="s1880">We lived in the country where my second son was already born and young mothers always go to more experienced mothers if they have a problem with their child like coughing or sneezing.</span> <span id="s1881">Talking about little babies you know.</span> <span id="s1882">So, it was on a Friday, by Friday evening I would come to the country already.</span> <span id="s1883">My week was over.</span> <span id="s1884">By that time I was still washing dishes at Montefiore Hospital.</span> <span id="s1885">So, a lady another lady came over to my wife to ask her some advice about the child.</span> <span id="s1886">My David, my youngest son, says Ma, tell her to wait later Daddy is coming he works in a hospital."</span> <span id="s1887">He didn't say that I worked as a dishwasher.</span> <span id="s1888">He thought I'm a doctor.</span> <span id="s1889">He was a kid only.</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">Q. Let me just ask you a couple general questions.</span> <span id="s1891">What do you think got you through all this?</span> <span id="s1892">How were you able to survive all this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">A. Absolutely impossible to explain.</span> <span id="s1894">This question is nagging us constantly.</span> <span id="s1895">What did I have better, or what abilities did I have better than my other brothers, and I remember each and one of them extremely well.</span> <span id="s1896">They were better than me.</span> <span id="s1897">My younger brother was a much better student that me.</span> <span id="s1898">My older brother was the most wonderful mechanically and business like.</span> <span id="s1899">The whole family, they were all working the business.</span> <span id="s1900">It haunts us.</span> <span id="s1901">This was the strongest question that you asked today.</span> <span id="s1902">I was only talking about it a few days ago.</span> <span id="s1903">It haunts us.</span> <span id="s1904">We don't know.</span> <span id="s1905">If you're going to tell me God did it, I don't buy it.</span> <span id="s1906">Because if I would buy it, I would agree with the fate of them, no.</span> <span id="s1907">I don't understand.</span> <span id="s1908">We don't understand how the three of us were together all the time.</span> <span id="s1909">Because you know why we went through like that, because we were shaved.</span> <span id="s1910">They didn't know we were brothers.</span> <span id="s1911">We were standing one next to the other, but the minute they would know those were three brothers, they would shoot either three or two of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">Q. Were there times other than on the death march where you wanted to give up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">A. I don't remember such things.</span> <span id="s1914">No.</span> <span id="s1915">No, because a person doesn't live only for himself.</span> <span id="s1916">I lived because I had a mother and she didn't have a husband now.</span> <span id="s1917">I lived because we had brothers.</span> <span id="s1918">I lived because I was stealing a little bit to support the family.</span> <span id="s1919">You might want to know what I was stealing.</span> <span id="s1920">I told you I could have been hung.</span> <span id="s1921">I was in charge of the supply room in this particular factory and at once trucks came in.</span> <span id="s1922">You know heads(?)</span> <span id="s1923">are sized by sizing, by Starch and once a delivery came in from the Germans with the big bag of some kind of a flour, white flour, and I was in charge of it.</span> <span id="s1924">I didn't care if this is chemical or edible or not.</span> <span id="s1925">What's the difference.</span> <span id="s1926">If it will be poison, we'll die.</span> <span id="s1927">And every day I brought home in my pocket in paper a little bit of it and my mother mixed it with pototoe skin and made it something tangible to eat.</span> <span id="s1928">How could I have thought of dying.</span> <span id="s1929">There was a lot of suicides.</span> <span id="s1930">There were suidices, but somehow we were managing a little bit, this brother, like I said before, he would bring home something stolen from the factory so we were able to sell it on the black market.</span> <span id="s1931">Talking about the governement, the Germans can arrest me now for stealing from them.</span> <span id="s1932">At that time that's what it was.</span> <span id="s1933">I didn't consider myself a thief, not a bit.</span> <span id="s1934">I did something to save the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">Q. Throughout this period was religion important at all to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">A. I knew it was going to get to that.</span> <span id="s1937">I am raised in a religious home, strictly religious.</span> <span id="s1938">As a matter of fact I'm sure you know what it means and I'll tell you something.</span> <span id="s1939">I was reading the Torah myself one week, my younger brother one week, and a cousin of mine the third week in my grandfather's synagogue.</span> <span id="s1940">I taught here in America, a guy, he was just here in Florida recently, to read the Torah because he was nine years old when the war broke out.</span> <span id="s1941">Then he became my neighbor businesswise if Suffolk, New York, so he was not bar mitzvahed.</span> <span id="s1942">By coincidence he was quarantined in Sweden with me together, but we didn't know one another.</span> <span id="s1943">But he told me you know I was quarantined in Urkis(?)</span> <span id="s1944">skola, in Swedish (it) means a tradeschool in Nauskrona(??)</span> <span id="s1945">.</span> <span id="s1946">I said I was there, but there were so many of us.</span> <span id="s1947">So we started revealing one another and telling what we know what we don't know.</span> <span id="s1948">Once his daughter came into my store and says Sol, would you help my father become bar mitzvahed.</span> <span id="s1949">I said yes.</span> <span id="s1950">I have another story in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1951">Anyhow, I did it and then he told me after that that he wants to become a real reader.</span> <span id="s1952">So, I said if you want to do it it's very tough, but if you want to, and he take me and anyways we accomplished it and he is -- my pupil is reading the Torah every shabat in Suffolk Synagogue.</span> <span id="s1953">But something else, when we were in Sweden, remember when I told you about it was Rosh Hoshana and I sent a card to my wife, but the chief rabbi of Sweden Rabbi Jacobson was coming to the camps to organize religious services for new years, Rosh Hoshana.</span> <span id="s1954">One of the boys who is from Montreal and now he lives in Florida.</span> <span id="s1955">One of the boys told he you know we have a guy here from my city, Rabbi who reads the Torah.</span> <span id="s1956">So, Rabbi Jacobson says we have a ______________ here.</span> <span id="s1957">He came to me he says you know we're organizing services for the holiday you're going to read.</span> <span id="s1958">I said Rabbi I will not.</span> <span id="s1959">I cannot emotionally do it.</span> <span id="s1960">He was desperate.</span> <span id="s1961">He said I found a __________, and I can't use it.</span> <span id="s1962">Anyway, Rabbi, it's impossible because when I do it, I see my home, I see my father, how proud he was.</span> <span id="s1963">I can't do it.</span> <span id="s1964">One day me and my wife ran into Rabbi Jacobson at the Central Station in Stockholm.</span> <span id="s1965">He had returned from Oslo, Norway.</span> <span id="s1966">He buried 70 Jewish bodies.</span> <span id="s1967">He comes over again to me.</span> <span id="s1968">My wife was with me.</span> <span id="s1969">He says, Sol, whatever he called me then.</span> <span id="s1970">Will you maybe do me a favor and come to read in Oslo.</span> <span id="s1971">I said Rabbi, it doesn't matter where I cannot do it.</span> <span id="s1972">He was desparate.</span> <span id="s1973">So, he walked past in the station waiting for the train and at once he came back, I have an idea.</span> <span id="s1974">Will you teach somebody if I find somebody who wants to.</span> <span id="s1975">I said yes.</span> <span id="s1976">But we were camped outside of Stockholm.</span> <span id="s1977">Every morning -- but our transporation, everything was free.</span> <span id="s1978">Every morning we came to Rabbi Jacobson's house.</span> <span id="s1979">We had breakfast there and I taught the guy how to read for the holidays.</span> <span id="s1980">I never yet read on my own.</span> <span id="s1981">Only recently this pupil of mine had his 40th anniversary and we were invited and we were up north and he called me over to show his rabbi he said see this is my teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">Q. Today is religion important to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">A. I am not observant.</span> <span id="s1984">When it comes yishkor, you know what yishkor is?</span> <span id="s1985">On certain holidays we have remembrence of the dead.</span> <span id="s1986">The list is so long that I stay in bed and do my own remembering of whoever I remember including my wife's family.</span> <span id="s1987">I am afraid to say it while other religion is present.</span> <span id="s1988">To me it's a little bit hypocritical.</span> <span id="s1989">How could God have done -- as a matter of fact my teacher, you gentlemen didn't know, I have books of my teacher the poet.</span> <span id="s1990">He was a son of a rabbi from the very famous city of Wilno (near), Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1991">At one point he says: " we served you all our lives, where are you?"</span> <span id="s1992">How could I be a believer.</span> <span id="s1993">If you ask me if I'm a disbeliever I wouldn't say so.</span> <span id="s1994">It's so tough to be a believer.</span> <span id="s1995">My father and my grandfather and we were from a religious home.</span> <span id="s1996">Six million Jews of which 90 percent were religiously obedient and something like that could be lashed out on them.</span> <span id="s1997">When I say something like that you haven't heard nothing yet.</span> <span id="s1998">You will never hear the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1999">The whole thing is a tragedy.</span> <span id="s2000">You questioned this to me is a tragic question.</span> <span id="s2001">If I have to stay here and not being able to say yes or no, that's a tragedy.</span> <span id="s2002">That's a personal tragedy.</span> <span id="s2003">I cannot say no because there lays my father.</span> <span id="s2004">That is why I cannot read, because I see him.</span> <span id="s2005">I see him how proud he was.</span> <span id="s2006">He ran back and forth to that synagogue being proud his son I was only 13 when I started bar mitzva and then up to 17 and then his younger son, every three weeks.</span> <span id="s2007">This is why sometimes I say our life is a very painful life.</span> <span id="s2008">We hurt, so to call us survivors, is wrong.</span> <span id="s2009">We are victims, because a survivor doesn't suffer anymore, but we do, we do.</span> <span id="s2010">But go through for these many hours, go through every day in our mind, every day.</span> <span id="s2011">There is no such move.</span> <span id="s2012">If we go to bed, if we go to wash, if we go to eat, if what we eat if it's Sunday, if it's Saturday.</span> <span id="s2013">There is no such thing, and when I told my dear friend, neighbor Mary, let all the names of all your dear children your family your preachers, your clergy, your teachers and you Italian people, very family minded people, how can you just ask me to start living a normal life.</span> <span id="s2014">When you lose one person, we lost one brother before the war, he was 21 years old.</span> <span id="s2015">Life in our house, in our home was never the same.</span> <span id="s2016">My father was a finished person and my mother got sick forever.</span> <span id="s2017">So, now you asking somebody who lost the world of every thing.</span> <span id="s2018">Forget about material.</span> <span id="s2019">Would you believe that the Germans have a nerve now to accuse me that I have material reasons for wanting to be paid.</span> <span id="s2020">Number one I don't want to be paid, because if they want to call this "Wiedergutmachung", many of us didn't want to accept it from the beginning, because that's too high priced.</span> <span id="s2021">"Wiedergutmachung" means made good.</span> <span id="s2022">How do you make good for that.</span> <span id="s2023">I don't know who allowed them to use this name.</span> <span id="s2024">They could have found in the dictionary of the German language many easier words to describe what it is than "Wiedergutmachung".</span> <span id="s2025">There are many cataclysms through history.</span> <span id="s2026">There is only one thing that I'm kind of grateful for, that they used the strongest word in the dictionary which is Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2027">You know how many people try to call their own things lately when something is going on downtown where the Spanish people wanted to call their faith Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2028">That means that they don't grasp the scope of what this Holocaust was.</span> <span id="s2029">Because if this has to be the strongest expresseion is only because they didn't find a stronger one.</span> <span id="s2030">That's exactly what my teacher said and I told you before I cannot find when he got melancholy and he stopped writing and his friends said Yitzkhak you must write for history.</span> <span id="s2031">He says I can't find words in the dictionary words to write.</span></p> <p><span id="s2032">Q. You're teacher's name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">A. Yitzkhak Katznelson.</span> <span id="s2034">There are streets named after him in Israel.</span> <span id="s2035">Then you have the museum.</span> <span id="s2036">One more thing.</span> <span id="s2037">I'm glad that I reminded myself.</span> <span id="s2038">When I talk about Katznelson, I am paying homage to my parents.</span> <span id="s2039">Because to send two boys to his school was a big expense, a big effort.</span> <span id="s2040">So when I talk very much of him, all my friends know that and they'll know about it.</span> <span id="s2041">If you boys ever go to Israel, there is a museum built and the name it's called Lokhamei ha Ghetto-oth (tape ends.)</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">Conclusion of Interview USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0322 PAGE 4</span></p></body></html>
