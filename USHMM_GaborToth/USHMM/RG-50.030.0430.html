it was the reason...</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: So you were all in Spon-she (ph) during Christal-naght(ph)?</span> <span id="s204">Do you recall how you were notified that you have to leave,

alone.</span> <span id="s213">Yes, we were all before the Christal-naght (ph) because that was the critical point which made him go and shoot Von Graff.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: I just want to understand a little.</span> <span id="s215">Your passport, or your identity card said ‘stateless’?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: I didn’t have an identity card.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q:

certificate and I had my drivers license, which was a little photograph.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: And with these two documents they identified you and deported you and your sister was in a similar situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: In Germany, everybody had to be registered.</span> <span id="s226">So police had all, where ever you lived, that district had a police department, and in there you had to register so they knew all the people who lived in their district because they were all registered.</span> <span id="s227">In other words, if I would try to go to another town and want to settle there I had to register within three days so they knew where we were and we didn’t have to show anything or they didn’t take my ID, my birth certificate, or they took my drivers license.</span> <span id="s228">But the action was to take all foreigners, all people who did not have, or Jews who did not have the German nationality.</span> <span id="s229">That was the action which took place in October, 1938.</span> <span id="s230">Because the German Jews were not touched at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Your father and your mother...</span></p> <p><span

<p><span id="s243">Q: So without any papers, you were put on a train and deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: No, we were just all collected.</span> <span id="s245">Put into a concert hall and we lived there for a whole day until we were transported to the station and into cattle cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: And the Poles, when you arrived at Spon-she (ph), did Poles make lists of who has arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: No.</span> <span id="s248">The Poles wouldn’t let us in.</span> <span id="s249">We were in Normansland for forty-eight hours before they let us

id="s253">The Poles didn’t want to let us in so we had the SS standing on one side with the bayonets in our eyes, on the other side were the Poles with bayonets on their rifles.</span> <span id="s254">But then, for some intervention, they opened up and let us into that small little village in As-bon-shee (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Do you recall a visit of A-lin-grin-glum (ph) in As-bon-shee(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: No, I wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s257">Doesn’t ring a bell.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: When was he there?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: He

‘42.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: Tell me about the Gay-sphel (ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: The Gay-sphel (ph)?</span> <span id="s604">Well, it was a poster that we had posted all over the ghettos that from this and this date, from this and this time nobody’s allowed to be on the street.</span> <span id="s605">And the reason for it was that they wanted to have an easy job going to the houses and collect whom they wanted to collect.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: This was a fairly unusual activity in that the Germans themselves came in, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: No, they always came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: They never asked our permission.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: You see, Na-ba-loskie (ph) is where you had the central office, okay?</span> <span id="s610">You had the ghetto far-va-doonk (ph) which was Bebof (ph) and cohorts and you had our people, Rum-cof-ski (ph) and Aaron Yakovobitch had his office there and from there everything was, that was the central point of all the activities within the ghetto.</span> <span id="s611">And what the transports are concerned they went on until actually even in ‘43, we still got transports into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s612">They called people and brought them in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s613">They brought some people, put them in the cemetery and shot them.</span> <span id="s614">And they hung people and they shot them, but it was outside, not within.</span> <span id="s615">Within we had also shootings, like for instance, in the Krim-a-nall Po-da-sigh (ph), Gooby Oben-stein-er (ph) who was the big shot there was sitting, when he was drunk he was sitting at the window and there was like a sniper, shooting.</span> <span id="s616">Whether he killed someone or not, he just started to shoot, that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: I understood, and if you know, in all the pictures of the, whether they are arrivals or deportations, this is so difficult for me and I will ask you to show me the...</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Well, whatever I can help you with we are here.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: The only ones that we recognize as Gay-sphel (ph) the Germans, we can see the German soldiers as opposed to others that you don’t, that you see Jewish police, ghetto police?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: The ghetto police had to go with them in all actions.</span> <span id="s621">They were forced to.</span> <span id="s622">In other words, the SS would come in with trucks and the Jewish police had to work with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: And I understand that.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: Because they had to interpret.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: And I see these columns walking.</span> <span id="s626">Like 5,000 people walking to Mechelen and I don’t see any Germans in the picture.</span> <span id="s627">Except for the Gay-schel (ph), would they actually come and grab people from the hospital and from the old peoples home and...?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: The Germans, when the transport went out, you wouldn’t see them but you would see them at the tracks.</span> <span id="s629">There they would be.</span> <span id="s630">They would do the loading into the cattle cars.</span> <span id="s631">So you would not see any escorts at Rather-gorch (ph).</span> <span id="s632">You would not see them on the way to Rather-gorch (ph).</span> <span id="s633">There you would see only our own police.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: In the Chronicle it says at a point in ‘42 one of the people who, for instance he writes, a very curious thing is happening, he writes.</span> <span id="s635">The trains leave with people for labor and their luggage is coming back.</span> <span id="s636">And he doesn’t go into, he doesn’t draw any conclusions that it means these people went to death, but he kind of writes, it is very strange that their clothes should come back and we should have to clean them and sort them.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: Well, this leaves yourself to various interpretations.</span> <span id="s638">Because normally when you come into a camp you had to get rid of everything, or your clothing and you get fresh clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: You know what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: So that was the rationalization?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: I will tell you what happened.</span> <span id="s643">My sister-in-law, my brother’s widow, she built Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s644">She lived in Ka-to-beet-sa (ph), it’s very close to Auschwitz, and they grabbed her, she was 14 years old.</span> <span id="s645">Her family was shot, everybody of her family was shot.</span> <span id="s646">She was left 14 years, a girl before the war in Europe was very sheltered.</span> <span id="s647">And she was taken to Auschwitz, they were building the barracks at that time, she told us.</span> <span id="s648">And then, they put her to the Prin-ya (ph), laundry.</span> <span id="s649">Every piece of Jewish clothing was checked out and you wouldn’t believe the stuff that they found in this, in buttons, diamonds, there was a lot of dollars and paper money was found and some people, when they were in Auschwitz they collected it, they had connections and when they came out after the war they had...</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: Do you mean Auschwitz or do you mean Bruckenau?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: I am talking about Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s652">I don’t know the distinction between Bruckenau and Auschwitz, I know this was the center of point when people heard this.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: We know that Bruckenau was where the crematoriums and where the gassing took place.</span> <span id="s654">Not in Auschwitz but in Bruckenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: [Inaudible] We were in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s656">We were a few years ago, three years ago.</span> <span id="s657">We went, we took a pilgrimage to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: The working camp was Auschwitz and the final solution took place in Bruckenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: When I look at you and I try to think in the standards of war time.</span> <span id="s660">You look good, I mean you are a beautiful woman today, but you looked good, you looked airy and you looked, you know, blue eyes, and, did it occur to you to run away and hide?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s662">I got married in order to survive.</span> <span id="s663">Not to him, I was married for three months and later on I got a ________.</span> <span id="s664">He was my father’s age, or maybe a little bit older, but my parents told me I was...</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Polish man, or?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: He was a Jew.</span> <span id="s667">[inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: The police.</span> <span id="s669">We call them the OD man.</span> <span id="s670">_____________.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: And this is why I wanted to run away, but my parents, the factory was still going full swing and my mother was telling me in the First World War they were having a paradise in Poland.</span> <span id="s672">They were working for the Kaiser you know and they were making money and they didn’t want to, my mother didn’t want to leave.</span> <span id="s673">My father wanted to leave.</span> <span id="s674">And then, my mother said to me, your going away and we are left behind.</span> <span id="s675">This is when I changed my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: So you married this man in order to, how would it help you to run away if you were married?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: Because I would have somebody to take care of me.</span> <span id="s678">I was a spoiled young girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: When the ghetto was already closed was there a possibility, were there some individuals that could get away?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: A lot of them fled and went to Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: After the closing of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: They could get out, some of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: Before and after.</span> <span id="s684">If you realize, people smuggled them out but most of them, most of the, they fled in ‘39 when the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: They survived in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: Then they fled, okay?</span> <span id="s687">And went East.</span> <span id="s688">And they wound up and they survived in Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: I bet you know that in Poland the family ties were very close so you couldn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s690">You would live all your life with a guilt complex.</span> <span id="s691">It’s true!</span> <span id="s692">You couldn’t just do whatever was good for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: It’s a long story?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: Yes, everybody has long stories to tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: When it became scary in the ghetto and you understood that people are taken away.</span> <span id="s696">Did you think of leaving and, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A:

send us from Argentina, the pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: The cigarette case that Teresa is copying?</span> <span id="s868">Did you also want to donate the cigarette case?</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: Yes, I want to donate my most precious possessions, they are.</span> <span id="s870">You see, I was hesitating to give it to my daughter, my older daughter is very active, second

was with me at the table to be interviewed.</span> <span id="s1538">And they were talking about what she said to ____________ for instance.</span> <span id="s1539">Why couldn’t they do in Lodz the same as in Warsaw, the uprising.</span> <span id="s1540">So I said I’m sorry you are complaining.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">A: Yeah, she was obnoxious anyhow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A: I said first of all the people in Warsaw ghettos they had _______ with the outside.</span> <span id="s1543">So they were able to exchange something for weapons and ammunition.</span> <span id="s1544">We had absolutely no contact with the outside world.</span> <span id="s1545">We were absolutely isolated and what could we do?</span> <span id="s1546">To fight the Germans with bare fingers?</span> <span id="s1547">It would have been suicide!</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">Q: You shouldn’t feel defensive, it’s ummm...</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">A: Yeah, but I mean, she said it in front of the camera.</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">A: She was so arrogant.</span> <span id="s1551">She said something that I was very, very up in arms, what was it?</span> <span id="s1552">And this young editor from the For-vert (ph)...</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">A: There was a Jonathon Rosen.</span> <span id="s1554">So, he asked me, tell us what or how did you feel at that time when you had to collaborate with the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">A: I could have killed him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">A: So I told him, we had to work to eat and if Rum-cof-ski (ph) would have been not able to negotiate with the Germans, to give us materials, raw materials, and we would manufacture and would deliver the completed goods to them in exchange for money and food.</span> <span id="s1557">Whatever we needed in the ghetto and if he would have been successful in that negotiation the Lodz cater (ph) would have been liquidated in 1943 completely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">A: 1942 already...</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">A: In 1942, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s1560">I meant ‘42.</span> <span id="s1561">Completely.</span> <span id="s1562">No body would have left at that time alive.</span> <span id="s1563">They would have had to find a solution at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">A: There was a young man, an editor of the For-vitz (ph), Jonathon Rosen.</span> <span id="s1565">Very lovely young man.</span> <span id="s1566">So he said, who are we to judge if we didn’t live there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">A: And everybody had their individual experiences so who are we to tell them or to judge of what was good and what was bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">Q: To what extent at that time, not today, but at that time were you aware that the Lodz ghetto is so different from others?</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">A: No.</span> <span id="s1570">We didn’t have any knowledge of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">A: We found out after the war.</span> <span id="s1572">We didn’t know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">A: We didn’t even know that there exists other ghettos in Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">Q: You didn’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">A: No.</span> <span id="s1576">Because all from this, from the little villages and surrounding towns, they sent it into the Lodz ghetto.</span> <span id="s1577">What was the two brothers that came from the Warsaw ghetto to us?</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">A: Cone (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">A: The brothers Cone (ph).</span> <span id="s1580">They came from Warsaw to the Lodz ghetto and they told us about the Warsaw ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">A: And this is when we found out.</span> <span id="s1582">This was towards the end.</span> <span id="s1583">And she could tell them, one of the daughters is alive in Fairlong, New Jersey.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">Q: I hear that people in Lodz before the ghetto was sealed...</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">A: Closed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">Q: Closed.</span> <span id="s1587">They figured that it’s better to go to Warsaw because this is not going to be annexed to the Reich as opposed to Lodz which became part of the Reich and so they were afraid...</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">A: Who knew that they would annex the Lodz city...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">Q: Wasn’t it right away announced?</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">A: I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s1591">I have to butt in because I lived through it.</span> <span id="s1592">My father, when the Germans started to invade, to come into Lodz, my father and my brother went to Warsaw because every patriotic Pole went to defend the City of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1593">And my father came back must be a week later, his feet were bleeding and he looked, he was a shadow of a person, they tried to walk towards Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">End of Tape 2.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: Jumping to 1944, did you feel or know or consider yourself in some way privileged that you were in the last transport?</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">A: We were privileged.</span> <span id="s1598">We were definitely privileged in the last transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">A: You were only around 300 people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">A: Because they were already...</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">A: There were a few young doctors, a few doctors and people that use to work close in the administration.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">A: At that time we did not know that already are other people like Alan Yakovobitch (ph) knew that we would not be staying in Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s1603">That we will be going somewhere else to work, in other words, it’s like slaves, like going into slave labor, okay?</span> <span id="s1604">But we didn’t know that, only when we came to Sachsenhausen we were told we are not staying here.</span> <span id="s1605">After two weeks we went to Kern-es-woo-sen-hausen (ph) because the barracks were not ready.</span> <span id="s1606">But in the meantime when we came in they were just about ready to be occupied.</span> <span id="s1607">And then we got the straw mattresses and stuff like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">A: Wasn’t Stefan Vee-ter (ph) with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">A: Sure he was with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">A: Was he working in his profession there or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: He was a doctor, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">A: This is the Dr. Vee-ter (ph) I told you lives in Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s1613">He was with him on the transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">A: He was with us and there was another doctor with us and he was also on the circus saw and he lost...</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">A: Oh, I know who it was.</span> <span id="s1616">Dr. Tennenbaum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">A: Tennenbaum.</span> <span id="s1618">He lost three fingers.</span> <span id="s1619">He also was the same as what I did with these big plywood plates on a circus saw.</span> <span id="s1620">And he did the same thing and he got his hand too close, the right hand, got to close to the circus saw and cut off three fingers.</span> <span id="s1621">And he was a surgeon!</span> <span id="s1622">So afterwards he could not operate anymore because he had lost those three fingers on his right hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">Q: Could you describe the contrast between what you expected while on the train, on the transport...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">A: Which transport?</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">Q: To Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s1626">And after your arrival and realizing what is going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">A: Well, until we came to Sachsenhausen we were together with our women in the cattle cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">A: Cattle cars, strangers, I don’t know how many people in one, couldn’t sit down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">A: Everybody knows already how the transport took us in the cattle cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">A: No, not everybody, no.</span> <span id="s1631">I don’t know how many people but I know we couldn’t sit down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">A: Wall to wall.</span> <span id="s1633">Shoulder on shoulder.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">A: I know they put with us a pail.</span> <span id="s1635">You had to do something in front of everybody, you did it, strangers.</span> <span id="s1636">Men and women.</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">A: It was a long trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">Q: How long?</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">A: I think it was a day and a night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">A: I think it was more like two days and we didn’t have windows to look out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">A: I think two days and one night, something like this.</span> <span id="s1642">And then the train stopped.</span> <span id="s1643">All men out!</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">A: I will never forget this moment, this was the worst moment in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">A: I didn’t even say good-bye to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">A: Here was my father...</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">A: My father, her father, her brother...</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">A: My brother!</span> <span id="s1649">He left the train when they took them out of the train, he never looked back.</span> <span id="s1650">He never said good-bye to me, he never looked.</span> <span id="s1651">This picture...</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">A: I remember!</span> <span id="s1653">I didn’t want to say good-bye because I didn’t want to break down.</span> <span id="s1654">I had to be strong.</span> <span id="s1655">I knew I had to be strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">Q: What did you know, what did you think, why...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">A: I had to be strong because...</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">A: We separated, that was all we knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">A: This was the only possibility because we were separated.</span> <span id="s1660">We were only married...</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">A: Few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">A: No, we were married...</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">A: We married in ‘43 Bert and this was ‘44.</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">A: Yes, we married in June and this was ‘44...</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">A: About a year later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">A: Yes, a little over a year.</span> <span id="s1667">So we basically were still on our honeymoon.</span> <span id="s1668">If you can call that, you know.</span> <span id="s1669">First of all, I was frustrated.</span> <span id="s1670">Not knowing what happened next, okay?</span> <span id="s1671">And second of all, I didn’t want to see that I had tears in my eyes, I didn’t want her to see that, so I just left out with the transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">A: And this is when I saw the last time my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">A: And we lost her father because...</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">A: He was about 40 years, not even 40 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">A: And I was met at Alan Yakovobitch (ph) because he was the numbero uno on this transport.</span> <span id="s1676">And one day, I was told to go outside, the outside commando, because they were always building tank traps because the Hitler youth comes always with the tanks over there were shooting against the Russian over our camp.</span> <span id="s1677">One day, later on, I realized why he had sent me out.</span> <span id="s1678">Because when I came back late that afternoon seventy people had left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">A: My brother and my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">A: From our camp and amongst them her father and her brother.</span> <span id="s1681">They were amongst the seventy that were sent out and Alan Yakovobitch (ph) knew that if I would be in the camp I would never let them go because I would have told them that if they go, I go too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">A: But he liked you and he wouldn’t...</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">A: Well, he was like family because my sister was married, well, no, they were not married, but they went together, they were a pair.</span> <span id="s1684">So, they were very close to each other.</span> <span id="s1685">Aaron was ever close to Dora anyhow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">Q: So Bolic and Dora were not actually married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">A: No, they were married after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">A: They married in ‘45.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">A: But he knew, Aaron knew, that I would never, ever have allowed my father-in-law and brother-in-law to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">Q: Where did they go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">A: They went on a march to the North Sea to be put on a boat and bound out.</span> <span id="s1692">It’s Final Solution.</span> <span id="s1693">And he couldn’t walk anymore.</span> <span id="s1694">So they shot him, all right?</span> <span id="s1695">Was on May the 3rd, while my brother was able to escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">A: They told my brother, too, run for his life, not to hang around.</span> <span id="s1697">And my brother survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">A: Since then, I was very, very mad.</span> <span id="s1699">And as you say in Turkish, broy-gus-with-in (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">A: But we are in touch with his son, would you believe it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">A: His son called me.</span> <span id="s1702">They lived in Brooklyn and he called me at that time to tell me that his father had passed away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">A: And he wanted us to go to the funeral.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">A: And were we in Scranton or were we already in...</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">A: We were in Connecticut and the next thing we left for Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">A: I had to leave for Europe so I told him, I’m sorry I cannot come to the funeral.</span> <span id="s1707">And every Christmas I get a post card...</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">A: Not a post card a regular letter!</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">A: Yeah, with their family printed on it with a long letter of what had transpired during the year of what they had done and what they had accomplished and where they go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">Q: So you felt that he is asking your forgiveness for sending your father-in-law and brother-in-law...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">A: He didn’t ask forgiveness, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">A: No, this young man, it wasn’t his fault.</span> <span id="s1713">He’s not responsible for his father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">Q: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1715">I am saying that you felt that Alan Yakovobitch...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">A: I absolutely, absolutely.</span> <span id="s1717">He sent me out that day because he knew that I would never allow my father-in-law and brother-in-law to leave!</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">Q: How did Yakovobitch know that they are going to be sent on this march?</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">A: He must have known because he was in touch with the German camp, with the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">Q: Had he worked with Bebof before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">A: Sure!</span> <span id="s1722">On the _____________.</span> <span id="s1723">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1724">Even very close, I must say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1726">So he would possibly know, people would tell him things?</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">A: Oh, sure, sure!</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">A: He would know because, as I mentioned to you, Zi-fed (ph) from the ghetto Fuf-eitel (ph), he was also with us in Kernet-woo-sure-hausen (ph), in that factory.</span> <span id="s1729">As a German _____________.</span> <span id="s1730">And they were very close and I was very close with Zi-fed (ph).</span> <span id="s1731">He was a nice guy.</span> <span id="s1732">But, he did not know that that was my father or my brother-in-law.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">Q: He didn’t know who it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">Q: So he was simply trying to protect you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">A: But he didn’t have to protect me.</span> <span id="s1737">Because I was working and I was, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">A: So was David and Dad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">A: Yes, but I mean, I was working inside the factory on a circus saw.</span> <span id="s1740">And this day I was told to go away, okay?</span> <span id="s1741">And then later on it happened that I got the rifle in my back, that I told you, on one of these outside commandos.</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">Q: Can you describe that during this day and a night or maybe two days and a night on the train, what, and you were all from Lodz, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">Q: Was there any talk, any...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">A: It was frustration.</span> <span id="s1746">You were so embarrassed, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">A: You tried to comfort each other for once.</span> <span id="s1748">Saying to all, what will happen to us?</span> <span id="s1749">Where will we go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">A: We had to accommodate ourselves because you have to get along in this place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">A: And you were actually occupied with yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">Q: Did you think you were going to die&gt;</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">A: We didn’t know what to think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">A: We didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1755">The possibility existed everyday.</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">A: We were sure that...</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">A: The train was stopped by the, bombs were falling.</span> <span id="s1758">So we could have died right there.</span> <span id="s1759">Not from the German end but from the Allied bombs.</span> <span id="s1760">So, we didn’t know whether we would survive or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">Q: Yes, I mean in terms of this specific policy of the Germans at this point.</span> <span id="s1762">Here, everybody’s left the ghetto except these 800 people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">A: They told us were are going to be working.</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">A: But they told us we were going into...</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">Q: But did you still believe this was a real possibility?</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">A: No, no, we doubted it.</span> <span id="s1767">We didn’t know what to believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">Q: No body talked about the specifics?</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">A: No, because nobody knew!</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">Q: When Teresa asked you whether you felt privileged about being on the last transport, did you feel privileged in terms of your whole ghetto experience, given the position that you had in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">A: That was one part.</span> <span id="s1773">In another part, that I was Dora’s brother.</span> <span id="s1774">This definitely was a privileged.</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">Q: Did you get more food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">A: We got a little bit extra, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">A: When we were getting, I told you, the _______ of food, it was a small portion of meat, but Bert sent it to my parents.</span> <span id="s1778">We never saw a thing of it!</span> <span id="s1779">My father looked like a skeleton.</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">A: And he was a tall man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">A: Over six feet tall, six-four.</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">A: Tall and, he needed it, definitely more than I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">Q: Did they other heads of the departments have a barber?</span> <span id="s1784">They were all men, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">A: I had my barber.</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">Q: Yes, I know that.</span> <span id="s1787">Did they all have a barber?</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">A: Everybody had this, this fellow, this barber, he made the rounds.</span></p>

id="s1792">Q: To all the heads of the departments?</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">A: To all, I wouldn’t say, but he had quite the amount of privileged people to go around and shave and cut their hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">Q: Was this in your life, prior to going to Lodz, was this a traditional male thing to do if you had a certain status to have somebody shave you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">A: You couldn’t shave yourself.</span> <span id="s1796">You went to the barber to be shaved.</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">A: I went everyday to the barber.</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">Q: When you were a kid?</span> <span id="s1799">I mean, once you got a beard or when you grew up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1801">Before, I am talking about the general life without, I am not talking about the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">A: Everyone went to a barber.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">Q: I’m curious because it’s not something one necessarily sees today.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1805">They couldn’t do it, cut their hair.</span> <span id="s1806">They went to the barber everyday to shave.</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">A: When father had this ___________ after we came back, we had a barber come here.</span> <span id="s1808">Father and I to shave us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">Q: So this really had nothing to do with your positions in life, this was what one would expect for the male population.</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1811">But he had this circle of people around him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">Q: Did your sister have a hairdresser?</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span

because I really don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">A: I didn’t have a hairdresser, I can assure you!</span> <span id="s1818">We didn’t take advantage...</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">Q: Did you ever get your hair cut?</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">A: No.</span> <span id="s1821">In ghetto, I had long hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">A: You started off with short hair, like now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">Q: But then you said before you left together you shaved your head?</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">A: I shaved.</span> <span id="s1826">This is what happened.</span> <span id="s1827">After we left the ghetto, I had the shorter hair than you, very crew cut.</span> <span id="s1828">This is why they didn’t actually...</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">A: I forgot to mention to you.</span> <span id="s1830">I was honored by the SS in the camp.</span> <span id="s1831">The little caps we wore, the cappies, right?</span> <span id="s1832">And every time we passed a German...</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">A: You had to salute him!</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">A: We had to take our cappies off.</span> <span id="s1835">And this guy, he was one who was in charge of us, so called, okay?</span> <span id="s1836">And he liked the way I saluted him when I took off the cap.</span> <span id="s1837">So he took me out, turned me around so I faced our people and he said, show them how to salute!</span> <span id="s1838">So I took my cap off, and he said, that’s the way you have to do it!</span> <span id="s1839">And he allowed me to let my hair grow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">A: No, he was bald like now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">A: My twenty-two and a half hair, I had, you couldn’t know if I had a haircut or not because there was nothing left.</span> <span id="s1842">So he allowed me to have my hair cut, that was my reward.</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">Q: To have your hair cut?</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">A: Not cut!</span> <span id="s1845">Everybody had shaved their hair off.</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">A: In the camp.</span> <span id="s1847">They didn’t want to have the lice growing all over the place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">A: And I was allowed to let my hair grow because I knew how to salute him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">A: Yeah, there were funny moments too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">Q: Did you have a lot of meeting with your staff, these forty or fifty people who were...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">A: Almost every morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">Q: All of them together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">A: No, not all of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">Q: Parts of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">A: The ones who are very important to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">Q: And who would that have been?</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">A: Bel-laf-sky (ph) was one.</span> <span id="s1858">Then that girl from Hamburg.</span> <span id="s1859">The German girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">A: Would you believe my governess was working for him?</span> <span id="s1861">She was with us for the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">A: Sorry, Darling, I don’t remember their names.</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">Q: And what would the meetings be like in the morning, what would you be discussing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">A: Whatever was, had to be done.</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">Q: Like what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">A: Like a program.</span> <span id="s1867">There were different occasions which I couldn’t tell you the details, no.</span> <span id="s1868">But, there was always something which we had to do.</span> <span id="s1869">They had to report to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">A: There were so many factories, resorts they called them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">A: They had to give a report of what they did and how it was done and so on.</span> <span id="s1872">There was always something going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">Q: Did you have quotas for what people had to produce in each of these...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">Q: You didn’t.</span> <span id="s1876">So when you would go to a factory and look around and talk to people and, if you would criticize something, what would you criticize if something was going wrong?</span> <span id="s1877">What would be the kind of thing that would be going wrong?</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">A: The cleanliness.</span> <span id="s1879">The way, their conditions at the working places.</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">A: He would go to the kitchen and try the food.</span> <span id="s1881">If they don’t cheat, the workers of the food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">A: I would go to the kitchen and look at the soup, which the workers would receive, okay?</span> <span id="s1883">Then I would make my comments, whether it was good or not good or whether there is somebody and if I found somebody, he was finished with the kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">Q: You mean if they were stealing food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">A: They were stealing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">A: And we went to the factory, all right?</span> <span id="s1887">And somebody from the factory needing a little bit repair, would send in his place to the kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">Q: Did I understand correctly that you were in the first period, one of the two people that were in charge of employment or labor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">Q: And then you became the head of the labor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">Q: No, it was the other way around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">A: I was called and I was told to organize the department of labor because all people had to be registered to receive an ID card and without the ID card, nobody would get the food coupons.</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">Q: That was in the beginning or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1894">A: That was when I came into the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">A: I have the papers still.</span> <span id="s1896">Little pieces of paper when he was nominated to start the department.</span> <span id="s1897">You want it?</span> <span id="s1898">I have the original.</span> <span id="s1899">It was lying in the little calendar.</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">Q: I will copy it, I will only copy it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">Q: That was November, right, of ‘42, of ‘40?</span></p> <p><span id="s1902">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1903">That was 1940.</span> <span id="s1904">And I interviewed a lot of people for the job, for the office.</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">A: I went with David to you, too, and I was staying in line with Dr. Kin-ee-roos (ph), he took me to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">A: Well, in any case, to answer your question, I wasn’t nominated to organize and run the department of labor, which I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">Q: But there was another person, right, that was like a co-director?</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">A: Later on.</span> <span id="s1909">Not originally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">Q: And then, in the beginning of ‘44 it changed again, that you were the only one in charge of...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1911">A: No, no, Shin-nit-skie (ph) was with me the whole time until the end and we got in 1943 from Czechoslovakia a transport was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">A: Andres was his name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">A: A 100% gentleman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">A: Professor Cas-par-ee (ph) was, this is a proverb.</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">Q: I want to know about that, that’s later, tell me about the _____________.</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">A: He was a micro-biologist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">A: And he wanted the favor of Rum-cof-sky (ph) and he was given to my office to be the third man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">Q: His name was Anders?</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">A: No, it was Andres, A-N-D-R E-S.</span> <span id="s1920">And he was with me also until the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">Q: And how did you divide the duties?</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">A: With Andres I shared the office.</span> <span id="s1923">Shin-nit-skie (ph) had his own office.</span> <span id="s1924">But I put Andres in my office.</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">Q: Did you get along with Shin-nit-skie (ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">A: Yes, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">Q: Did you have to write reports directly to Rum-cof-ski (ph) or who did you report to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1929">To Rum-cof-ski (ph).</span> <span id="s1930">Directly to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">Q: And did he have comments?</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">A: Well, naturally, but in general he was satisfied with the way I handled it because in the beginning since it had to be organized we were three days and three nights, I got maybe two or three hours sleep, because I want to be with the people.</span> <span id="s1933">I have to work sixteen and eighteen hours and then I let them go and I meet them, somebody else would work, so we registered day and night.</span> <span id="s1934">Three days and three nights.</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">Q: So people stood in line?</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">A: Yes, stood in line.</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">A: There were crowds of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">Q: To get their ken-car-ta (ph) or ous-vise (ph) or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s1940">It was like a ken-car-ta (ph) and this ken-car-ta (ph) they were getting their rations every week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">A: The ID they get later on from the archives, from Shun-dul-dom (ph), no, from Nef-tall-en (ph) who was in charge of it too, for ID cards.</span> <span id="s1942">So he made out the ID cards afterwards but the people had to be delegated to the various factories.</span></p> <p><span id="s1943">Q: And how did you make the decision about the, were the factories already set up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">A: No, they were in the process of setting up.</span> <span id="s1945">And we had to select the people to go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">Q: And did you know how many people could go into each factory or you made an approximate?</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">A: Well, they gave me a demand.</span> <span id="s1948">I can take now twenty, I can take now fifty, I can take now a hundred, I can take now five.</span> <span id="s1949">So, whatever the demand was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">A: He’s head of the workers or the factory...</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">A: They had to come to me and tell me of what they wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">A: A paper assault, we can have a hundred people working there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">Q: But, three days and three nights that you were registering people, are you at the same time as you registering them designating them for a particular factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">Q: So how long from the time that Rum-cof-ski (ph) hired you for this until you began to actually register people?</span> <span id="s1956">A week?</span> <span id="s1957">Two weeks?</span> <span id="s1958">I mean, it had to take you some time to figure it out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">A: It took me about 10 days, if I remember right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">Q: To organize, to figure out how to organize?</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">A: Yeah, to organize my office.</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">Q: And your talking about 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s1963">A: 1940, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">Q: And then, when people started there were demands for deportations and some of the people were your workers from factories, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">Q: And then people came and said, I hear there is a free space in the comb factory, or paper assault or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">A: There was no choice, they were assigned to where ever there was an opening and if they fit in, you had to know something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">A: You see, don’t forget that a lot of people volunteered to go out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1970">Forty-one, forty-two, their still volunteers.</span> <span id="s1971">And then came the demands.</span> <span id="s1972">We want 1500 people, we want 1000 people, whatever.</span> <span id="s1973">And then, where were the people?</span> <span id="s1974">Everybody had to work so naturally we had given, like old people, I had made out maybe 500 or 600 papers to go to the straw resort, for instance.</span> <span id="s1975">They were sitting there, there was nothing to do because there was that much work and that much places but people had, that they were delegated to the straw aut-tie-lum (ph) where we had old people, sick people.</span> <span id="s1976">I must have made a few thousand people like this, you know.</span> <span id="s1977">So, to answer your question, it took me about ten days to organize the staff and I added as we went along and naturally after we were not through with the registries because, but three days and three nights it took to get the bulk into paperwork so they could get to the kitchen to get some food or get some, or where ever the food was distributed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">Q: So you registered over 100,000 people in three days and three night?</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1980">You cannot image what it was like.</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">Q: I think I’m right.</span> <span id="s1982">120,000 at that time?</span> <span id="s1983">In the beginning, in 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s1984">A: Oh no, it was more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">A: When the ghetto was closed we had over 200,000.</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">A: Over 200,000, almost a quarter of a million people we had in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">A: But then, very shortly the first transport was organized.</span> <span id="s1988">Where the rough element was sent out first.</span> <span id="s1989">And then a lot of volunteers came to be out of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">Q: Did they send a lot of very, very poor people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">A: By what do you mean, very poor people?</span> <span id="s1992">Everybody was poor!</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">Q: What I am wondering is, was their a hierarchy in the ghetto in terms of the population?</span> <span id="s1994">Some people came in wealthy, right?</span> <span id="s1995">Some people came in with things, other people came...</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">A: But they had to give everything away.</span> <span id="s1997">There was a special place.</span> <span id="s1998">Jewelry first...</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">Q: But did everybody give everything away?</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">A: No, no, you are absolutely right.</span> <span id="s2001">Some people came in with some valuables.</span> <span id="s2002">Then they started later on if they needed, and everybody was trading some valuables for food.</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">A: Bertie, we didn’t turn in our jewelry until the last day.</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">Q: But that’s what I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">A: That’s what I just said.</span> <span id="s2006">That everybody who had something could bring it in because nobody, they didn’t have to undress, like when they went to the camp in Auschwitz, they had to completely strip and everything was taken away from them.</span> <span id="s2007">So, naturally, people came into the ghetto with whatever valuables they had.</span> <span id="s2008">But they did not hide.</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">Q: Right, but there would be some people who might not have had anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s2011">Most of them.</span> <span id="s2012">Because let’s not forget that there were a lot of poor Jews in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">Q: Were they more vulnerable?</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">A: Vulnerable in what sense?</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">Q: Well, vulnerable in terms of the amount of food they would get, their inability to barter or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">A: No.</span> <span id="s2017">They were better equipped to withstand these environments than the higher class of people because they were poor people.</span> <span id="s2018">They were always in need for something so they could adjust to these bad circumstances and conditions much easier than like, people like my father-in-law who was a very affluent man.</span> <span id="s2019">He had everything he wanted because he was a big owner of a big factory, okay?</span> <span id="s2020">So naturally, he suffered much, much more and had much more trouble adjusting to these conditions than the guy who was poor.</span></p> <p><span id="s2021">A: When you see the picture from my wedding, he looked like a skeleton.</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">A: So also, on the survivor list, when you look at the survivors today, I would say that about 80% of the surviving class were poor people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">A: Bert, be careful.</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">A: Today, if you talk to them, everybody was a big man with their factories and had a big working staff for themselves and everybody was rich and we know that they were eaten up by the lice.</span> <span id="s2025">So you find that the element, or the class of people who were in that conditions before the war adjusted easier to the bad conditions in the ghetto than the better class of people, if we want to classify them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">Q: Was that true for you?</span> <span id="s2027">You didn’t come from a poor background.</span></p> <p><span id="s2028">Q: For me I would say that since I became right away in an upper position where I would get a little bit more than others I could easier adjust to the condition than most of them because as I said I was in terrific physical condition.</span> <span id="s2029">Because I was a sportsman all the way through.</span> <span id="s2030">I think that because of my physical condition I was able to survive and adjust to the conditions.</span></p> <p><span id="s2031">Q: In terms of your work, what was the hardest thing you had to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s2032">A: The hardest thing I had to do?</span> <span id="s2033">That is a tough question.</span></p> <p><span id="s2034">Q: We talked about that yesterday.</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">Q: What was it at that time that made you say, I don’t want to be doing this anymore?</span> <span id="s2037">Was there a specific incident or was it a set of incidents that happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">A: No, the demands which were set forth to the ________, to the department of labor, which I could not combine with any of my philosophy and my characters.</span> <span id="s2039">And when we actually were forced to support the committee who had to make lists of deportations, I just couldn’t digest that.</span> <span id="s2040">And that’s why, also with the influence of Irene, that I finagled myself out of that and let my other partner do this job.</span> <span id="s2041">That was the time I would not, I would have loved to get out of it, out of the position I was in.</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">Q: And why do you thing, I know that Rum-cof-ski (ph) threatened you, but that was different.</span> <span id="s2043">Why didn’t he say to you, you’ve got to do it?</span> <span id="s2044">This is part of the job, you can’t do part of the job and not the other part of the job?</span> <span id="s2045">Do you have any idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">Q: Was there ever any talk between Rum-cof-ski (ph) or just other heads of departments questioning or thinking about philosophy and moral aspects of the work and the choosing and...?</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">A: I am sure such conditions, such conferences and discussion took place.</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">Q: Do you recall any sense of, more theoretical conversations?</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">A: Certain occasions, yes.</span> <span id="s2051">We could discuss personal things and personal ideas.</span></p> <p><span id="s2052">A: When the Rabbi came, he was playing chess with the Rabbi.</span> <span id="s2053">It was then that they had some discussions.</span> <span id="s2054">Because Bert had a dilemma you know.</span> <span id="s2055">There was a lot of nepotism going on, there was a lot of, like, my own cousin.</span> <span id="s2056">They came in, they wanted to bribe you and Bert would take them by the neck and throw them out.</span> <span id="s2057">He was the heavy one.</span> <span id="s2058">But he just couldn’t believe that you could put a price on a human life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">Q: So what did you talk about with the Rabbi when you played chess?</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">A: Various things of what his experiences because he had much more contact with the people than I had.</span> <span id="s2061">To him they came with all their complaints and all their headaches and conditions while they did not have, my door was not open to the general population because they had to go through various instances before they could come to my office.</span> <span id="s2062">You could not just walk into my office because otherwise I would have never been able to do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">Q: What extent did you feel as tools?</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">Q: As tools, used by the Germans by how impossible your situation and position, yours and Rum-cof-ski (ph) and others?</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">A: Well, I must say thank heaven that I never had anything to deal with the Germans.</span> <span id="s2067">My dealing was directly with Rum-cof-ski (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">Q: But in general, they built a certain structure in which the Jews in the ghetto had to do things that otherwise maybe they had to do, the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">A: I couldn’t think of anything they asked us to do what they should do because they just...</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">Q: Well, like they assign people to factories and produce thing for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">A: For themselves, for them personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s2072">Q: No, not personally.</span> <span id="s2073">For the good of the Reich?</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">A: Well, that was the purpose of our existence in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s2075">A: Of our survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s2076">A: We survived because of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">Q: So you didn’t see yourselves as being manipulated by them in some sense, you thought, Rum-cof-ski (ph) in some way felt he was manipulating them in order to save people?</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">A: No, we were just doing what was in that condition, we were put in that condition by the elders of the Jew in prolonging our lives by working for them.</span> <span id="s2079">This doesn’t make any near collaboration.</span></p> <p><span id="s2080">Q: No, no that’s not what I meant.</span> <span id="s2081">What I meant is to what extent you felt that the Germans forced you to be in a position which felt so uncomfortable as to the point to say to Rum-cof-ski (ph), Ok, I don’t want to do that anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">A: The Germans did not put any demands on myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">Q: Not personally, but in general?</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">A: The put demands on their own...</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">A: They put demands on the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2086">And the spokesman was Rum-cof-ski (ph).</span> <span id="s2087">Rum-cof-ski (ph) and Yakovobitch (ph), these two people.</span> <span id="s2088">These two people were the liaison people between the ghetto and the German ghetto fo-vert (ph).</span> <span id="s2089">They got the demands and they had to give the orders on down to the other people of what has to be done.</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">Q: I mean, one instance of it is the Germans could have said, we are going into the ghetto and we are going to take 1500 healthy people...</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">A: They did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2092">Q: No, I know.</span> <span id="s2093">But they also said, you choose them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2094">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2095">Q: You bring the, you make the deportation decision.</span></p> <p><span id="s2096">A: First they did.</span> <span id="s2097">First they said.</span> <span id="s2098">And if the demand was not met, then they came in and did it themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s2099">Q: So, one could have made the choice, we’re not going to do it?</span> <span id="s2100">That is a choice, that it could have been made, I don’t know what that would have meant?</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2102">The result was that they did it themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s2103">Q: There is a description in the chronicle again, maybe in the Polish book, in which there was a demand for 1500 healthy men in February of 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s2104">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">Q: In which Rum-cof-ski (ph) asked for the heads of the departments to come and...</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">A: Yes, and they had to be healthy people and they had to be examined by the doctors, you know, that they are healthy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">Q: And people tried to get out of this meeting and he said, if we don’t do it then they will do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2109">And they did, they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">Q: Now you, in the chronicle’s description of that meeting, it starts saying he asked you to do something but for better or worse Clinger or some other man did it, but it doesn’t say you refused.</span> <span id="s2111">But from your description of yourselves...</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">A: Bert did not refuse.</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">Q: You refused and then it says, for better or worse this other man did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">A: Your talking about Bert, he didn’t refuse, he just manipulated Rum-cof-ski (ph) because he was sick.</span> <span id="s2115">He couldn’t go sick...</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">Q: No, because there’s an empty space in this report where it goes from you being asked to do something and it’s saying, for better or worse, so-in-so did it, it doesn’t say anything about how it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2117">A: okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2118">A: No, because, are you talking about Lut-sek (ph) in Lut-sek’s (ph) book, Dr. W. Lut-sek-ies (ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s2119">Q: Yes, the chronicles of that meeting.</span> <span id="s2120">But he didn’t write the chronicles, he translated what had been written before.</span></p> <p><span id="s2121">A: No, he collected all the data from the Archives.</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">A: Now, but, I was able to get out of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2124">A: okay.</span> <span id="s2125">It wasn’t easy.</span> <span id="s2126">It was not easy to get out of it.</span> <span id="s2127">And people still thought that I was involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">Q: To what extent were you aware that there was hatred towards Rum-cof-ski (ph) and the whole Jewish Counsel and to what extent was their admiration that, yes, you saved our lives by giving us work?</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">A: There were I think a much smaller percentage of the ghetto people who felt favorable towards Rum-cof-ski (ph).</span> <span id="s2130">Why, the mass, the bulk of the people hated Rum-cof-ski (ph) and put him in, thought of him in such a way that he was a demagogue, that he was a tyrant and that he did mean well for the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2131">We know better.</span> <span id="s2132">We who saw everything and were involved in almost everything know better.</span> <span id="s2133">That he was the man who really manipulated the Germans at that time and was able to convince them to let us do what we had to do so that we can survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">Q: So what did he have to offer that it was so valuable to the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">A: The work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">Q: That was so valuable to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2137">A: We had tremendous talents.</span> <span id="s2138">Yes, we had talents in every phase of the human being, whatever there is to do.</span> <span id="s2139">We had the intelligence, we had the workmen for it, we had the architects.</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">A: We had the brains.</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">A: We had everything.</span> <span id="s2142">We had everything in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">Q: But you also have Bebof who wanted this, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">A: Bebof?</span> <span id="s2145">Well, he felt that he has something, a force which he can use.</span></p> <p><span id="s2146">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2147">So, it was...</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">A: And he was able to convince all the leading people to have the ghetto provide _____, so what they intended to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">Q: Because certainly you had talented people in the Warsaw ghetto and they had work shops, that they ran quite differently.</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">A: Absolutely, but the only thing is that they were able to communicate with our sites, able to buy weapons and arm themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s2151">Q: Their work was not that valuable, it was the same work they were doing now in Warsaw or in Kov-now (ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2153">But what finished it?</span> <span id="s2154">The riot.</span> <span id="s2155">The uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s2156">A: No, Bertie, before that they weren’t as organized as the Lodz ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s2157">Q: No, the deportations are before the uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s2158">Q: In 1942, there were 330,000 people deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s2159">A: So they could not satisfy the Germans as we could.</span></p> <p><span id="s2160">Q: So you think that it was the quality of their work or?</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">A: Probably.</span> <span id="s2162">Because if they would have satisfied the Germans as we had, they probably would have also been left alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">Q: That’s very interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2164">Q: But, of course, Warsaw is not in the Reich, it’s in the general government and was in a different situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2165">A: It was the symbol of Poland and the Germans hated the Poles.</span> <span id="s2166">Do you realize that we had factories, you name it and we had it.</span> <span id="s2167">Metal, everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">Q: Would you like to look at some of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">A: This is the comb factory.</span> <span id="s2170">I don’t know this one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2171">A: The comb factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">Q: Was there a comb factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">A: Not that I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2174">A: Not that I know of.</span> <span id="s2175">And this ________ is indubitably the comb because he has a Bunsen burner, what we call the Bunsen burner and he has some metal here too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2176">Q: Do what do you think it is?</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">A: This definitely will be the metal resort.</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">A: They had a fake metal resort.</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">Q: How did they get combs from this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">A: You made combs in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s2181">The Lodz ghetto paper resort is what it was, so it wasn’t a comb factory, it was a paper resort.</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">A: These are grinding tools, grinding and sharpening the tools.</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">Q: So you think it was all metal resort, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">A: The same thing here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2186">A: Here they have, you know, combs is very easy to make.</span></p> <p><span id="s2187">A: Iron horns at the comb factory again, comb factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s2188">A: Here you see combs.</span></p> <p><span id="s2189">Q: Did these factories have names other than the name of the kind of work?</span></p> <p><span id="s2190">A: Only the kind of work, like metal resorts, clothes resorts, shoe resorts...</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">A: I don’t even know that we had a comb factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s2192">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2193">Q: And you were head of the labor department?</span></p> <p><span id="s2194">A: That’s news to me!</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">A: Yeah, to me too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2196">A: We didn’t have a comb factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s2197">A: Yeah, mother did my combs.</span> <span id="s2198">Combs are very easily made, you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2199">A: Here they are grinding them, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s2200">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2201">Jack-o-vich (ph) made for me in the concentration camp a comb from metal.</span> <span id="s2202">He made it, it was easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2203">Q: Well maybe there were metal combs to be made?</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">A: okay.</span> <span id="s2205">It has to be metal comb because there was no plastic at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">Q: Of course.</span> <span id="s2207">So, maybe part of a metal factory was making combs?</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">A: It had to be that, it had to be that because they had to be metal combs.</span></p> <p><span id="s2209">A: ______________, he was in charge of the metal department, he lives in Cleveland.</span></p> <p><span id="s2210">Q: How big were these factories?</span></p> <p><span id="s2211">A: Big.</span></p> <p><span id="s2212">A: The metal factory was big.</span></p> <p><span id="s2213">Q: But some of them would be smaller than others?</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2215">The hat factory was small.</span></p> <p><span id="s2216">Q: The hat factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s2217">A: Hat factory.</span> <span id="s2218">They had a hat factory and lingerie and...</span></p> <p><span id="s2219">Q: Did people come asking for protection?</span></p> <p><span id="s2220">A: Oh yeah, oh yeah a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2221">Q: What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s2222">A: What Bert did?</span> <span id="s2223">He ______ ____ _____ ____ _______, and he made enemies.</span></p> <p><span id="s2224">Q: They come to you to ask for protection to come back to your boyfriend or husband at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2225">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2226">Q: How did it make you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s2227">A: Awful, awful.</span> <span id="s2228">But I had an influence on him and he always made the right judgment because he is a very honorable man, I have to say it in front of him.</span> <span id="s2229">He had integrity, this is what drew me to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2230">Q: And me, God forbid you shouldn’t say it in front of him.</span> <span id="s2231">[Laughter]</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2233">Q: The rubber factory where you were working?</span></p> <p><span id="s2234">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">Q: Was that large?</span> <span id="s2236">There were two hundred women working with you.</span> <span id="s2237">That was large?</span></p> <p><span id="s2238">A: Yes, it was large.</span></p> <p><span id="s2239">Q: Was there more going on in that factory than just the coats you were making?</span></p> <p><span id="s2240">A: No, coats.</span> <span id="s2241">Rain coats, rubber coats.</span></p> <p><span id="s2242">A: This here, it was metal, pots and pans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2243">A: The same here.</span> <span id="s2244">No, here they could dress, or tailoring.</span></p> <p><span id="s2245">Q: Pots and pan was part of the metal

where we were collecting the feathers?</span> <span id="s2258">In the church were I was working.</span></p> <p><span id="s2259">A: That’s a scale and the feather resort.</span></p> <p><span id="s2260">A: We had the whole church, it was piled with feathers and we had to put it in containers.</span> <span id="s2261">And it went to Germany, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2262">Q: Did everything the factories make go to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s2263">A: Everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2264">Q: So nothing was made...?</span></p> <p><span id="s2265">A: Some was left over for the people.</span> <span id="s2266">Like, for instance, my leather case for the ID card.</span> <span id="s2267">Raw material from the Germans and, you know, the cigarette case.</span></p> <p><span id="s2268">A: There was a lot of pilfering, a lot of people, whoever was sitting by the Shisel (ph), Off-gee-gessen (ph), you know what I am talking about?</span> <span id="s2269">Everybody helped himself like an asha (ph), you had to organize.</span></p> <p><span id="s2270">Q: Their stuffing, I think, there...</span></p> <p><span id="s2271">A: Their stuffing cushions.</span></p>

other people.</span> <span id="s3667">Apparently he’s supportive of Rum-cof-ski (ph) but I haven’t read it so.</span> <span id="s3668">It sounds a little strange.</span></p> <p><span id="s3669">A: I

know so much about him I don’t want to convince you...</span></p> <p><span id="s3679">Q: Well you don’t have to, I believe you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3680">A: [Speaking in foreign

<p><span id="s3683">Q: Which is not true.</span></p> <p><span id="s3684">A: First of all I was born in, and I was not deported in 1939 only in 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s3685">A: He writes and he takes a lot of freedom here with the writing because he doesn’t know!</span> <span id="s3686">How does he know?</span> <span id="s3687">Nobody knew his background.</span> <span id="s3688">I was his wife and I didn’t know his background.</span></p> <p><span id="s3689">A: It was for ___________.</span> <span id="s3690">I was a gigolo.</span></p> <p><span id="s3691">Q: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3692">A: That’s something.</span> <span id="s3693">Nobody called me that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3694">A: So.</span> <span id="s3695">I called you a Casanova but...</span></p> <p><span id="s3696">Q: That’s different.</span> <span id="s3697">That’s better than a gigolo.</span></p> <p><span id="s3698">A: Well, it’s sad.</span> <span id="s3699">Very, very sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s3700">Q: Now tell me, when your children have asked you, I mean, you’ve said at least your older daughter has wanted more information.</span> <span id="s3701">When she asked you questions you didn’t want to speak with her or?</span></p> <p><span id="s3702">A: No, we did, if she asked we answered.</span></p> <p><span id="s3703">Q: Was she hesitant to ask you?</span> <span id="s3704">So that’s why she doesn’t know so much do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s3705">A: We didn’t talk much about it.</span> <span id="s3706">Such things that happened, two weeks before my daughter’s wedding.</span> <span id="s3707">Naturally they both knew it.</span> <span id="s3708">And they know their father.</span></p> <p><span id="s3709">Q: No, I understand that, but you said that they didn’t know the story in detail.</span> <span id="s3710">Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s3711">A: Details?</span> <span id="s3712">Nobody knows.</span> <span id="s3713">You are the only one that knows.</span> <span id="s3714">We never told anybody anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s3715">Q: But what I’m wondering about is, is it because sometimes people don’t want to talk.</span> <span id="s3716">Other times they want to talk and their waiting for someone to ask them a question.</span> <span id="s3717">And I’m just wondering if your children, because often children with their parents, no matter what the past is, you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s3718">A: She never came with direct questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s3719">Q: That’s what I mean.</span> <span id="s3720">I think children...</span></p> <p><span id="s3721">A: Oh, but Bert.</span> <span id="s3722">You know mother told her plenty.</span> <span id="s3723">My mother was very vocal.</span></p> <p><span id="s3724">A: She might have talked, she might have discussed it with her grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s3725">A: And they were very, very close with their granddaughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s3726">A: But she never asked me direct questions about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3727">Q: Was your mother more vocal about it without somebody asking questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s3728">A: My mother...</span></p> <p><span id="s3729">A: My mother lived in the past.</span> <span id="s3730">Mother-in-law, she lived in the past.</span></p> <p><span id="s3731">Q: And so she would...</span></p> <p><span id="s3732">A: And she was telling her feelings and her thoughts she was telling my daughters.</span> <span id="s3733">They were very, very close, very close.</span> <span id="s3734">And they knew a lot from my mother and my mother knew a lot and she told them as it is and they looked up to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s3735">Q: That’s interesting that children don’t often, there is a shyness about asking their parents about their past.</span> <span id="s3736">No matter what...</span></p> <p><span id="s3737">A: Well, you see when they were young growing up we had our life to live, she had a hard time.</span> <span id="s3738">Because we always went somewhere else or she never had really to be able to socialize and have a circle of friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s3739">A: Not because we were hiding out, it’s because his job took him.</span></p> <p><span id="s3740">A: In my profession, traveled.</span> <span id="s3741">And at that time we did not have a chance, or it never came to an occasion that she came to ask about this.</span> <span id="s3742">Later on when she grew up and knows and she has her own child, she came around to be interested, more interested in what happened.</span> <span id="s3743">And some she knows, some we told her, but she would like to know more.</span> <span id="s3744">And when we get this tape now with your interview...</span></p> <p><span id="s3745">A: When she didn’t know everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s3746">A: She will know a little bit more.</span></p> <p><span id="s3747">Q: Has she read about the Lodz ghetto?</span> <span id="s3748">Did she read the chronicle?</span></p> <p><span id="s3749">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3750">She has and she also has the film.</span></p> <p><span id="s3751">A: And you wrote your observation on the margin, remember, in the chronicle?</span></p> <p><span id="s3752">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3753">A: Because there were a lot of discrepancies also and Bert wrote...</span></p> <p><span id="s3754">A: Why does the chronicle of the Lodz ghetto in which I appear, why didn’t they write about this like this?</span></p> <p><span id="s3755">Q: Bert, they don’t at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s3756">A: They would, if it was true, they would!</span></p> <p><span id="s3757">A: And they researched everything, I think very carefully because this is all documented what they have in the chronicle of the Lodz ghetto, is it not?</span></p> <p><span id="s3758">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3759">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3760">A: So is this really, if this would be the case, it definitely would have been written.</span></p> <p><span id="s3761">Q: No, it’s clear that it’s not...right, no question.</span></p> <p><span id="s3762">A: Somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s3763">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3764">Can I ask you something?</span> <span id="s3765">Today, in some ways, and I don’t know if it’s because we were going through the pictures, that you were more, and maybe Teresa’s questions were better than mine, that you were able to talk more about some things?</span> <span id="s3766">Or is it because we’ve now been doing it for two days?</span></p> <p><span id="s3767">A: No.</span> <span id="s3768">Because it was laying still for such a long time and today we were faced with the facts, we saw the pictures so...</span></p> <p><span id="s3769">A: If you have orange juice from the concentrate and you let it stay.</span> <span id="s3770">If you have everything down there and the water is up with things, and you have to shake it.</span> <span id="s3771">And we now stirred everything up, okay?</span> <span id="s3772">So now everything is again...</span></p> <p><span id="s3773">Q: Going?</span></p> <p><span id="s3774">A: Going, and it’s full.</span> <span id="s3775">It’s all, it’s not any more separated.</span> <span id="s3776">It’s solid from the shaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s3777">Q: So it’s possible that it would have been better if we had known this, to come to the museum first and look at the pictures and then do the interview and on video?</span> <span id="s3778">I don’t know, I am trying to figure out...</span></p> <p><span id="s3779">A: Maybe yes, maybe no.</span></p> <p><span id="s3780">Q: We don’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s3781">A: We don’t know, we don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3782">Q: I mean, I’m very glad that I decided that we would tape the conversation today because...</span></p> <p><span id="s3783">A: Yeah, I wanted to have it out of the way.</span> <span id="s3784">This is the purpose we came.</span></p> <p><span id="s3785">Q: Because you were able, I mean, it seems that the more we talk the more comes out.</span> <span id="s3786">But I think the pictures are very helpful because they trigger...</span></p> <p><span id="s3787">A: Yes, well, we were able to identify for them quite a few people.</span></p> <p><span id="s3788">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3789">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s3790">Are you glad you did this?</span></p> <p><span id="s3791">A: In a way yes, in a way no.</span></p> <p><span id="s3792">A: Yes and no.</span> <span id="s3793">I’m glad because we can live with ourselves.</span> <span id="s3794">We are not the kind of people we, we would never benefit from somebody’s misery.</span> <span id="s3795">This is not the type, listen!</span> <span id="s3796">If we went to the flast-en-tralen (ph), the ghetto, and you had a witness, and Nat-kit (ph) who was working there and he was giving us portion of meat that the dog should be having and we shared it with the dog.</span> <span id="s3797">And I had a witness.</span> <span id="s3798">But you see, we didn’t tell the Rabbi Stein to call him, we didn’t tell him to call anybody.</span> <span id="s3799">He went to the Lodzer people and they gave him names and he spoke to some people.</span> <span id="s3800">But, boy do we have already people that I know will really cheer us.</span> <span id="s3801">But we never gave names.</span> <span id="s3802">But the two survivor girls we told you about it, I want you to talk to them.</span> <span id="s3803">They are very sharp women.</span> <span id="s3804">Very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s3805">Q: But when I was asking you about whether you are glad you came here and talked about your, is it difficult to live with it because now we’ve shaken up the glass?</span></p> <p><span id="s3806">A: This is difficult to live with because it’s a big lie.</span></p> <p><span id="s3807">A: Well, first of all, as I said I had a very restless night and...</span></p> <p><span id="s3808">A: Eight o’clock, quarter after eight we were in bed already.</span> <span id="s3809">We were so shook up.</span></p> <p><span id="s3810">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3811">A: I was exhausted.</span> <span id="s3812">Mentally.</span> <span id="s3813">And for some reason I was very restless and I couldn’t sleep well.</span> <span id="s3814">I napped then I was awake and I napped.</span></p> <p><span id="s3815">A: Cat napping.</span> <span id="s3816">I don’t know, I feel so much shame that such a thing can surface now.</span> <span id="s3817">I can’t believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3818">A: Somebody says something, is something different but written down in a book and, I don’t know what kind of, how many books are printed or in how many books were sold and how many books were read, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s3819">A: Anybody that reads it, it’s just awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s3820">A: Somebody who really doesn’t know reads this.</span> <span id="s3821">My God, what kind of monster was this guy?</span> <span id="s3822">_________ says you become such a powerful guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s3823">Q: But does it become important to you even in light of that, that you were able to tell part of your story?</span> <span id="s3824">And that it is documented?</span></p> <p><span id="s3825">A: Certainly, certainly it’s important.</span></p> <p><span id="s3826">A: But listen, when we talk about ourselves, we want to smell like roses, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s3827">A: Yeah but we still state only facts.</span></p> <p><span id="s3828">A: It wasn’t a thing that we wanted to defend ourselves because there is nothing to defend.</span></p> <p><span id="s3829">Q: No, I didn’t bring you here to defend yourselves.</span> <span id="s3830">I brought you here to tell your story.</span></p> <p><span id="s3831">A: But we said it as it is and there are still living people that can witness.</span></p> <p><span id="s3832">A: Mmmm, interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s3833">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3834">So many _______ should have taken testimonies from all these people but this should be going back 40 years ago when everybody was alive because Bert had a lot of people that called him and thanked him.</span> <span id="s3835">That they are alive.</span> <span id="s3836">He’s responsible for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3837">A: Well.</span> <span id="s3838">You know that I mentioned it to you that I made an enemy and a friend at the same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3839">A: Maybe he’s one of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s3840">Q: No, but you were in a situation where you couldn’t do for everybody.</span> <span id="s3841">It was impossible.</span> <span id="s3842">Nobody could.</span> <span id="s3843">So, there’s...</span></p> <p><span id="s3844">A: Nobody could.</span> <span id="s3845">I am only human.</span></p> <p><span id="s3846">A: Do you think if he could do something, he wouldn’t do it for my father?</span> <span id="s3847">That my father would be alive if he would have the power?</span></p> <p><span id="s3848">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3849">But what I’m saying is that in situations of, even not situations of distress.</span> <span id="s3850">All kinds of situations where people have some power, some authority.</span> <span id="s3851">They can’t do everything for everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s3852">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3853">Q: So, you cannot ever satisfy people.</span></p> <p><span id="s3854">A: I’m guilty.</span></p> <p><span id="s3855">Q: And in this situation it’s particularly difficult.</span> <span id="s3856">It was difficult for you.</span> <span id="s3857">You didn’t even want to do it in some ways but it...</span></p> <p><span id="s3858">A: okay.</span> <span id="s3859">Then you can say I wanted something from him and he denied it.</span> <span id="s3860">He didn’t do it.</span> <span id="s3861">okay?</span> <span id="s3862">All right, so he disappointed me.</span> <span id="s3863">But bring up lies?</span> <span id="s3864">Make such statements?</span></p> <p><span id="s3865">A: Bertie, do you remember a fellow that use to be your family some distant relation and you were so helpful to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s3866">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3867">A: He was always in your office whenever I came.</span></p> <p><span id="s3868">A: A cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s3869">A: Some distant cousin and he had a wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s3870">A: No, you remind me, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3871">A: I don’t know his name anymore.</span> <span id="s3872">And whenever I came to, happen to come over to his office this was, he was always asking Bert for something and I said to Bert, my God, he’s always asking you for things.</span> <span id="s3873">He survived and his wife survived.</span> <span id="s3874">And you know where we met him?</span> <span id="s3875">After the war in Hamburg it was a Schmelling match, boxing match.</span> <span id="s3876">And he said to him, yes you are a good guy.</span> <span id="s3877">And turned away.</span> <span id="s3878">A fellow that had always, always asked for things and always, whenever Bert could he always did it.</span> <span id="s3879">Probably once he had to deny him, he couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s3880">Q: You know it can also be people sometimes get very angry at people who have control.</span></p> <p><span id="s3881">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s3882">Q: Even if they do good things for them.</span> <span id="s3883">Because it means...</span></p> <p><span id="s3884">A: Jealousy.</span></p> <p><span id="s3885">Q: Well it’s not, I don’t, it’s sometimes more complicated than jealousy.</span> <span id="s3886">Sometimes it’s because you don’t have power yourself.</span> <span id="s3887">And you have to rely on someone else.</span> <span id="s3888">And that’s not an easy, human situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s3889">A: But still to make such statements.</span></p> <p><span id="s3890">Q: Well this is different.</span> <span id="s3891">We don’t know what, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3892">A: And you know, now it dawns on me.</span> <span id="s3893">When I started to read it I remember that Nat-tik (ph) told us somebody’s bad mouthing him.</span> <span id="s3894">But we didn’t pay any attention.</span> <span id="s3895">We did not ask who it is and where it is.</span> <span id="s3896">Now...</span></p> <p><span id="s3897">A: I couldn’t care less.</span></p> <p><span id="s3898">A: Now it came to...</span></p> <p><span id="s3899">Q: You mean you think this is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s3900">A: Could be.</span> <span id="s3901">Because he lives in Queens and in Sweden too.</span> <span id="s3902">And Stockholm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3903">A: Probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s3904">Q: Well, we’ll see what Teresa comes up with.</span></p> <p><span id="s3905">A: It’s unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s3906">Q: Well, it’s a very complicated set of circumstances.</span> <span id="s3907">And it brings out the best and it brings out the worst, right?</span> <span id="s3908">I mean, I’m sure you saw it there?</span></p> <p><span id="s3909">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3910">But I just, I just, can’t digest it.</span> <span id="s3911">Can I have this?</span></p> <p><span id="s3912">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3913">A: Thank you.</span> <span id="s3914">Put it together with the envelope.</span> <span id="s3915">Is the Federal Express, does it have room in the envelope.</span> <span id="s3916">No?</span> <span id="s3917">In there.</span> <span id="s3918">Try it now.</span></p> <p><span id="s3919">Q: Now, do you want to go and see the permanent exhibition for a little bit or are you too tired?</span></p> <p><span id="s3920">A: I am tired.</span> <span id="s3921">I’m tired and I’m exhausted mentally.</span> <span id="s3922">Very upset.</span></p> <p><span id="s3923">Q: That’s what I thought, that if you didn’t go earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s3924">A: I’m very upset because this is unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s3925">Q: Well, now I feel terrible, I..</span> <span id="s3926">.</span></p> <p><span id="s3927">A: No, don’t feel terrible.</span> <span id="s3928">I’m glad that I learned something.</span></p> <p><span id="s3929">A: We didn’t have an inkling about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3930">Q: Well I had no idea yesterday.</span> <span id="s3931">Amy said that somebody had found this just this morning so, I thought, you know, that we would show it to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3932">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s3933">No, it’s very interesting because otherwise how would I know that something like this exists.</span> <span id="s3934">All right.</span> <span id="s3935">You will excuse me?</span></p> <p><span id="s3936">Q: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s3937">You want more water?</span></p> <p><span id="s3938">A: No, that’s why I take the candy now so, I get a little bit more saliva action.</span></p> <p><span id="s3939">A: I’m just, right now it bugs me what fry-ana (ph), you know, the third thing that she said to the Rabbi.</span></p> <p><span id="s3940">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3941">One was that I sent Men-tak (ph), that I sent him on to the ghetto so that I can marry you?</span></p> <p><span id="s3942">A: No, that you got rid of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s3943">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s3944">That I got rid of him.</span> <span id="s3945">So that I could marry you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3946">A: Then we changed our names because we were hiding out.</span></p> <p><span id="s3947">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3948">A: And the third one, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3949">It was three things, I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s3950">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3951">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3952">Q: Did...</span></p> <p><span id="s3953">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s3954">Q: I was just thinking about your temper and I was wondering if you thought that, in a way it’s a stupid question.</span> <span id="s3955">If you had every had to have dealings with the Germans that you actually could have survived?</span> <span id="s3956">Would you have been furious with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s3957">A: I didn’t understand the question.</span></p> <p><span id="s3958">A: I don’t either.</span></p> <p><span id="s3959">Q: Because it’s a conditional question, it has no reality.</span> <span id="s3960">I was wondering that if you could have, remember we talked about your being a hot head?</span></p> <p><span id="s3961">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3962">Q: And that with Rum-cof-ski (ph), you held your temper because he was also a hot head so it would have been impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s3963">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3964">Q: And I was wondering if you had dealing with the Germans whether you could have, not that nice guy, but Bebof.</span></p> <p><span id="s3965">A: No, the nice guy had nothing to do with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3966">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3967">Whether you could have kept your temper?</span></p> <p><span id="s3968">A: He would have to control his temper I guess.</span> <span id="s3969">Because he never blew his top with Rum-cof-ski (ph) just out of respect for an old man.</span> <span id="s3970">Bert knew when to loose his temper...</span></p> <p><span id="s3971">Q: Did you every loose your temper?</span> <span id="s3972">Either alone or with someone, I mean, out of frustration?</span></p> <p><span id="s3973">A: I’m sure I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s3974">A: I know with Sche-bit-ski (ph) when they came and wanted...</span></p> <p><span id="s3975">A: I almost killed the guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s3976">Q: What?</span> <span id="s3977">When they wanted to bribe you?</span></p> <p><span id="s3978">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3979">A: Nobody buys me.</span></p> <p><span id="s3980">A: Then I wish Abrom-ic Kud-meric (ph) would be available, Bert?</span></p> <p><span id="s3981">A: Well, Eddie Kline?</span></p> <p><span id="s3982">A: No, Eddie was living with Dora so he doesn’t know how it conditions.</span></p> <p><span id="s3983">A: He came, every time he came to me he played something on his harp.</span></p> <p><span id="s3984">A: You want to call him?</span> <span id="s3985">He’s the adopted son of his sister.</span> <span id="s3986">Whenever he had problems, he was a little boy, he would come to me...</span></p> <p><span id="s3987">Q: It would be very interesting to talk with him, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s3988">A: He always came to me, he said, you are the only one I could talk to.</span></p> <p><span id="s3989">Q: How old was he then?</span></p> <p><span id="s3990">A: He was a boy of 14.</span></p> <p><span id="s3991">A: No, 12 or 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s3992">A: Or something like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s3993">A: I know about, a young boy.</span> <span id="s3994">Very lovely young boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s3995">A: Today he’s in his fifties, close to sixty, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s3996">A: Yeah, I think that he must be in his sixties, Bert.</span></p> <p><span id="s3997">A: In his sixties, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3998">Q: Do you see him?</span></p> <p><span id="s3999">A: Oh yeah, whenever we have a chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s4000">A: Yes, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s4001">Q: And where does he live?</span></p> <p><span id="s4002">A: In Montreal.</span></p> <p><span id="s4003">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s4004">I told you that his daughter is an international lawyer and his son is a professor.</span></p> <p><span id="s4005">A: And he himself made himself a fortune by inventing and customizing sanding machines, like for pig pens?</span> <span id="s4006">The automatic assembly machines where certain parts are coming together and out comes the end, the fixed product, the finished product.</span> <span id="s4007">So, he made a lot of money with that.</span> <span id="s4008">And he is an ardent surfer rider.</span> <span id="s4009">And he lived now for four month...</span></p> <p><span id="s4010">A: A surfer.</span></p> <p><span id="s4011">A: A surfer for four month or five months in a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s4012">A: So he can surf.</span> <span id="s4013">A few years ago he was surfing in Australia, on a surfing trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s4014">Q: Do you think he remembers a good deal about the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s4015">A: I’m sure he did, I’m sure he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s4016">Q: Well, when I call you, include that in one of the names.</span></p> <p><span id="s4017">A: He lives next to Pierre Trudeau.</span> <span id="s4018">Your looking from his window your looking to...</span></p> <p><span id="s4019">A: On the balcony of Trudeau.</span> <span id="s4020">Not that I need witnesses, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s4021">Q: No, I wouldn’t, I’m not doing it because of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s4022">A: I’m just saying.</span></p> <p><span id="s4023">Q: But it’s always very interesting when you can have a group of people...</span></p> <p><span id="s4024">A: To hear two sides?</span></p> <p><span id="s4025">Q: It’s not two sides.</span> <span id="s4026">But to hear different people talking about the same situation.</span> <span id="s4027">And people who had relationships with each other because it makes it a much richer view because what...</span></p> <p><span id="s4028">A: You can average it out.</span></p> <p><span id="s4029">Q: Yeah, but you learn a great deal from having, when a friend of mine did interviews with four or five women who were in the hospital in Auschwitz...</span></p> <p><span id="s4030">A: Talking about this Rabbi Stein, he even called Kin-roos (ph) in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s4031">A: Dr. Kin-roos (ph) was the president of the Lodz survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s4032">A: And he wrote us a letter telling us.</span></p> <p><span id="s4033">A: Yeah, I too write the letter.</span></p> <p><span id="s4034">A: Yeah but I mean, he wrote us a letter telling us that Robert Stein contacted him.</span> <span id="s4035">So, he met, not just throughout Europe but he went to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s4036">A: He called Israel, he didn’t go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s4037">Q: Now, you see, you were in such a unique position and you probably are, I don’t know if there’s anyone else who was in, I don’t mean in the job you had, but in a similarly high administrative position anymore that can talk with the survivors...</span></p> <p><span id="s4038">A: Well, no one else is alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s4039">Q: No one has survived, no one is alive.</span> <span id="s4040">So, it’s a very special set of understanding that we can get from you.</span> <span id="s4041">And to then have people who knew you, and also talk about their own lives and their relationship with you, it simply makes the story, it’s like talking with all members of the family not just with one member of the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s4042">A: Bertie, let Joan call Mala Ordner (ph).</span> <span id="s4043">She knew a lot.</span> <span id="s4044">She was a doctor in one of the resorts, in one of the factories.</span> <span id="s4045">She lives in Spring Valley.</span></p> <p><span id="s4046">A: No, what for.</span></p> <p><span id="s4047">Q: Are any of the doctors from the hospital alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s4048">A: Dr. Ved-ger (ph) in Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s4049">Dr. Kin-e-roos (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s4050">A: Oh, no, he wasn’t in ghetto.</span> <span id="s4051">Dr. Jin-ski (ph), he wasn’t in ghetto, no?</span></p> <p><span id="s4052">A: He wasn’t in ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s4053">Q: What happened to Rum-cof-ski’s (ph) wife, second wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s4054">A: They killed her too.</span></p> <p><span id="s4055">A: They finished in Auschwitz too.</span></p> <p><span id="s4056">A: The whole family.</span></p> <p><span id="s4057">Q: But, the Germans, they went to the gas chamber or that they were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s4058">A: They went to the gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s4059">A: No, Bertie, they were killed when they arrived in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s4060">A: Heim and Josef, but I don’t think the women.</span></p> <p><span id="s4061">Q: They separated the men from the women?</span></p> <p><span id="s4062">A: I don’t know, I can’t tell you because...</span></p> <p><span id="s4063">A: I don’t think the women.</span></p> <p><span id="s4064">A: This is what we heard, we don’t know details.</span></p> <p><span id="s4065">Q: That they separated them so if he had gone to a barrack and was killed she would have not been there?</span></p> <p><span id="s4066">A: We don’t know details.</span></p> <p><span id="s4067">A: Many people told me that they know that there was a girl...</span></p> <p><span id="s4068">A: Oh, your talking about Lucia Szymanowicz.</span></p> <p><span id="s4069">A: She went to so many men from hand to hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s4070">A: She was working in Bert’s office.</span></p> <p><span id="s4071">A: And she couldn’t, you couldn’t stand it, that I did not, that I ignored her.</span> <span id="s4072">That I didn’t make a pass at her or something like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s4073">A: Bertie, but she was stealing cards.</span> <span id="s4074">She was stealing people’s food cards.</span></p> <p><span id="s4075">Q: In the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s4076">A: She was in his office.</span> <span id="s4077">And Rum-cof-ski (ph) sent her out, they caught her and he sent her out on a transport.</span> <span id="s4078">She went to Auschwitz and became a madam there.</span> <span id="s4079">She was walking, while others were working, she was walking around in negligées and robes and stuff like that.</span></p> <p><span

id="s4084">She had a lot of pull, she had a lot of men that she had, she survived.</span> <span id="s4085">But nobody knows where she is, where she lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s4086">A: She had something to give.</span></p> <p><span id="s4087">A: And she said it.</span></p> <p><span id="s4088">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s4089">She didn’t make anything of it, on the contrary.</span></p> <p><span id="s4090">Q: I don’t know how she did that in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s4091">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s4092">In Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s4093">There was a lot of it going on.</span> <span id="s4094">What are you talking about.</span></p> <p><span id="s4095">Q: Well, there was some but you had to be in special places.</span> <span id="s4096">It was not so easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s4097">A: She was there.</span> <span id="s4098">People did what she wanted to do.</span> <span id="s4099">What she wanted them to do.</span> <span id="s4100">And I was told she was waiting for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s4101">Q: To do what?</span></p> <p><span id="s4102">A: To kill me.</span> <span id="s4103">Or to have me killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s4104">A:

<p><span id="s4115">A: They said she was a kappo, you know what a kappo is?</span></p> <p><span id="s4116">Q: Yeah, but what I don’t understand is those early transports, I thought they went to Helm-no (ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s4117">A: Not all.</span> <span id="s4118">Maybe this was afterwards, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s4119">A: I don’t know where they went.</span> <span id="s4120">I really don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s4121">A: I don’t know when they started to send the troops to, the transport to Hel-no and I remember...</span></p> <p><span id="s4122">Q: As far as I know all the 1942 transports went to Hel-no (ph), not to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s4123">A: I doubt that.</span></p> <p><span id="s4124">A: I don’t know, so how could he survive...</span></p> <p><span id="s4125">A: There were people that went to working camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s4126">A: And they live.</span> <span id="s4127">They are alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s4128">A: And they live.</span> <span id="s4129">From that period.</span></p> <p><span id="s4130">Q: From those 1942 transports?</span></p> <p><span id="s4131">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s4132">A: So not all of them went to Hel-no (ph).</span> <span id="s4133">And I don’t know when they started transporting them to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s4134">Q: As far as I know it was later.</span> <span id="s4135">It was very late from Lodz to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s4136">A: We don’t know because we had no contact.</span></p> <p><span id="s4137">A: I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s4138">Q: And Giertler is alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s4139">A: Was.</span> <span id="s4140">He died in Munich a few years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s4141">A: He died in Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s4142">Q: Did he ever write notes about what he was doing or was he ever interviewed, do you think, by anybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s4143">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s4144">A: I don’t think he would divulge anything because he was a little bit shady.</span> <span id="s4145">He was working with the Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s4146">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s4147">But for that reason...</span></p> <p><span id="s4148">A: And what he did with them I don’t know but that was not kosher that he would admit to it in an interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s4149">A: But he had a big following of people that really would do anything for him.</span> <span id="s4150">He was a good guy by nature.</span></p> <p><span id="s4151">A: He helped a lot of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s4152">Q: Then why do you think he went back to Germany?</span> <span id="s4153">He lived in Germany after the war the whole time?</span></p> <p><span id="s4154">A: Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s4155">A: He never was in Germany before he was...</span></p> <p><span id="s4156">A: After the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s4157">A: After the war he went to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s4158">A: He married.</span> <span id="s4159">A very nice woman and has a child, a son with her.</span> <span id="s4160">He’s a lawyer.</span> <span id="s4161">We saw him a few times when we came to Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s4162">Q: And he never divulged things to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s4163">A: Nobody ever talked anymore about it.</span> <span id="s4164">It was a chapter in your life that you didn’t want to talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s4165">A: It was like a pack or an agreement amongst the people not to discuss it for one or another reason.</span> <span id="s4166">It was a period you really liked to forget.</span> <span id="s4167">The only reason you talked about it is to give the message to the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s4168">A: But lately when we get together, lately, we always wind up talking about it.</span> <span id="s4169">Before we never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s4170">A: Because we are so much involved in teaching the young people not to forget because, after all, slowly we are leaving.</span> <span id="s4171">Nobody left to be a witness for it.</span> <span id="s4172">So now we have to take the last few years we have to live to make sure that it is being spread out.</span></p> <p><span id="s4173">A: I want to tell about it to Rabbi Stein.</span> <span id="s4174">To show him that, to read it to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s4175">Q: Does he read Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s4176">A: No, I will translate it for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s4177">Q: Well, what would you like to do?</span> <span id="s4178">Would you like to go back to your hotel, do you want to walk around at least the first floor of the museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s4179">A: Don’t we want to wait on what Teresa comes up with?</span></p> <p><span id="s4180">Q: Oh, yes, sure.</span> <span id="s4181">Why don’t I call her.</span></p> <p><span
