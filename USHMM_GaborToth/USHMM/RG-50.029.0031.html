<html><body><p><span id="s1">Q: Would you please tell us your name, your place and date of birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s2">A: My name is Arlette DeLong--my middle name is Weigman (phonetic)--and I was born in Brocourt, in France, on June 15th, 1937.</span></p> <p><span id="s3">Q: Where were you living at the time that the Holocaust began?</span></p> <p><span id="s4">A: I was living in the village, in Brocourt, where I was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">Q: What was life like before the Holocaust began?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A: It was a very small village of 300 people.</span> <span id="s7">And my parents were doctors there, so we lived a little better, perhaps, than the rest of the people.</span> <span id="s8">We had a house with indoor plumbing; sometimes some did not in those days.</span> <span id="s9">We had a telephone.</span> <span id="s10">Life was the life of a small village.</span> <span id="s11">It was very safe, and very uneventful in many ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: How many Jewish people lived in your village?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: There weren't any.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: Besides your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: Right; no others.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Did you have any sisters or brothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: No; I was an only child.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: And who else lived in your household besides you and your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: My grandfather--maternal grandfather and grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: How did life change in your village when the Holocaust began?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: Life changed dramatically in the village, not at the time of the Holocaust but at the time when the Germans invaded France and our village was occupied by Germans.</span> <span id="s22">We had German soldiers living with us in the</span></p> <p><span id="s23">village.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: I think that was in the beginning of 1940,but I'm not absolutely sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: If you didn't have any Jews living in your village, what did the Germans want to accomplish by taking over your village and living there?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: I think they just wanted a place to live,-- well, we're not very far from England, from the channel; we were only 30 kilometers--and towards the end of the war they built what we called a "blockhouse," to send V-2's to England.</span> <span id="s28">So, it was, strategically, an important position, I think, and that's why they occupied; and that's why, I believe, they were there.</span> <span id="s29">They had no interests, especially, in the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: And what was day-to-day life like with the German soldiers there?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Well, for me--of course, I was only two-and-a-half, three, four, so I don't--I think there was--I think there was--I know there was fear.</span> <span id="s32">Everybody felt fear.</span> <span id="s33">My parents certainly felt a lot of fear, but the villagers did, too, because we were occupied and there were a lot of restrictions.</span> <span id="s34">I think right before the Germans came--and it must have been in the middle of 1940--my father went away to fight; and my mother took the rest of the family, and we ran.</span> <span id="s35">We ran away.</span> <span id="s36">You know, there was the evacuation.</span> <span id="s37">And that--I have one memory, which I think is my first memory, of being under a table, with my grandmother holding me, because there were bombs falling.</span> <span id="s38">And I've had a very vague memory, and dreams, of the earth being on fire, because we had to drive through areas that were being bombed.</span> <span id="s39">But then we all came back to the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: How long were you gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: I don't know; some months, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: And when did your parents first fear that Jews were in danger?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: I think my parents had a strong sense long before, even before Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s44">They had the sense that being a Jew was unsafe, and they hid--they hid that fact from the peoples in the village.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: What did they do to hide that?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: They erased, on their passports,--because my mother had a Russian passport; my father, a Rumanian passport--the religion, "Jewish," from it and never told anybody.</span> <span id="s47">And it's unclear how much I knew.</span> <span id="s48">I think I knew, because things are never hidden in a family.</span> <span id="s49">At some level, even as a small child, I knew that we were Jews; but I'm not sure that I knew in a conscious way, because I would think they were worried that if I knew I would speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Did the Germans ever knock on doors, looking for Jewish people, or do any activities like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: It was assumed that nobody in your village was Jewish,--</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: --according to their records?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Do you feel that the other people in the village knew that you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: I think it would have been hard not to suspect something because of our name, Weigman (phonetic), and because we all came from a different place.</span> <span id="s58">My parents came from different places.</span> <span id="s59">I think it's a thought that would occur, come across people's minds.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: And tell me about what you told me, when somebody was asked if they knew you were Jewish and why they didn't turn you in.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: As a matter of fact, I think I remember my mother saying that somebody did try to--went to the Germans and said, "Those are Jews," and that my father was able to diffuse the situation by saying, "It's an outrageous accusation."</span> <span id="s62">And he also was--because, he was a doctor and he traveled all over; my mother stayed at home and saw patients at home--and, he may--I think he was treating Germans, as well as French, that nobody was eager to get us away, because they served a purpose in the community.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: And they were the only doctors in the village?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s65">The next doctor was seven kilometers away, and he helped my father.</span> <span id="s66">He signed papers for him; when he was no longer allowed to work, because he was a foreigner, that doctor signed the papers so he could continue working.</span> <span id="s67">And there may have been a financial arrangement between them.</span> <span id="s68">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: How old were you when you found out you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: My conscious memory was when we moved.</span> <span id="s71">When I was ten we moved to Paris.</span> <span id="s72">And then my father wanted to go to the synagogue, and that's when--and I was not allowed to go back to church any more, and, I went--I was told I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s73">And that's--as far as I can tell, that was about it.</span> <span id="s74">Do you want me to elaborate a little bit on it?</span> <span id="s75">Okay.</span> <span id="s76">Again, my parents are very private people.</span> <span id="s77">They do not talk about feelings; they don't share feelings; they try to say there are no such thing as feelings--you know, you "just live"--so that it's hard for me to really know what they were about, about hiding; but, you have to assume that it was a very, very frightening time, because your life just depends upon somebody's whim, and you can be taken away at any time.</span> <span id="s78">For me, it wasn't the same, because I had no real awareness that Jews were being killed all over.</span> <span id="s79">I knew it was dangerous to be a Jew, but I didn't know the extent of it and I didn't know that it could be so--so fatal.</span> <span id="s80">At least, I don't think I ever faced it.</span> <span id="s81">They pretended that they were just Christians, because I was going to--because I was baptized.</span> <span id="s82">They were not practicing Christians, for the village, but, very many people weren't, either; you know, the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Did they have you baptized for the purpose of concealing your identity?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Yes; yes.</span> <span id="s85">The priest knew.</span> <span id="s86">My parents told me that the priest knew we were Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: And what types of things did you do; you went to church regularly?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: Um-hmm (positive response).</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Were you educated in that--was it Catholic, or which--</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Yeah; yeah.</span> <span id="s91">It was a Catholic church; yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: And did you go to Catholic school?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s94">When I was small, there was a little parochial school, if you like.</span> <span id="s95">And the teacher liked Peter so she had us sing songs about Peter; and, can you imagine, I would come home and sing the song, and my parents weren't that warm about that at all!</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Did your parents, inside your home, have any symbols of Judaism--</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: --or observe any Jewish traditions?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: None at all; no.</span> <span id="s100">The only thing that they did that I knew was forbidden was listening to the radio, from England.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: That was forbidden?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: And after the war was over, did your life change at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: (nods head in the affirmative)</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: Again, it changed not exactly because I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s107">It simply changed because the Germans were gone, and there was a great sense of relief.</span> <span id="s108">There was danger from the Germans for all of us, because there was a small resistance group in the village and a couple of German soldiers were ambushed and killed right before the end of the war.</span> <span id="s109">And at that point they came one morning, about 6:00 in the morning.</span> <span id="s110">There was a knock at the door.</span> <span id="s111">And my grandmother took me and we ran away.</span> <span id="s112">We tried to hide, but the Germans found us and shot--but not to kill us, because we were right there.</span> <span id="s113">And then everybody went in front of the mayor (phonetic) and all the village was there; and the women, the men, and the children were separated.</span> <span id="s114">Now, I assume for my parents it must have been a terrible moment of anguish, because they didn't know.</span> <span id="s115">You know, I didn't know, but I was too young to know the danger.</span> <span id="s116">They must have felt that someone came to get them.</span> <span id="s117">And, we spent the day there; and the Germans wanted to take us to Germany--you know, in trucks--or burn the whole village; and the priest talked to them; and apparently they changed their mind; and, a few days later, the Americans came and liberated us.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: And at what point did your parents actually tell you you were Jewish, and, did you ever start pursuing a Jewish lifestyle?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: No; not me.</span> <span id="s120">I don't remember the day.</span> <span id="s121">You know, I don't remember the event at all.</span> <span id="s122">I think--it was traumatic for me because I was more identified with the church.</span> <span id="s123">I had liked--I liked the priest.</span> <span id="s124">I liked the little church, and I liked the kind of religion that we were taught, which, for the children, was very simple: "If you are good, God loves you"; and the Jewish religion, as I was told, didn't offer the same kind of comfort.</span> <span id="s125">There was a God that was removed.</span> <span id="s126">It was a God that every year looked at you and decided whether you could live or die.</span> <span id="s127">I wasn't prepared for that.</span> <span id="s128">There was no transition.</span> <span id="s129">And I didn't like the synagogue.</span> <span id="s130">It looked like just a room; an empty, cold room.</span> <span id="s131">The women were above the men.</span> <span id="s132">The Rabbi was small and dark and bearded and looked fierce, and I was afraid of him.</span> <span id="s133">I never talked to him.</span> <span id="s134">He had daughters that he, later on, married away against their will--one of them.</span> <span id="s135">And it looked--it didn't look comforting, the way, as a small child, I knew the church; and it was a tall, a little, a dark church with stained-glass windows.</span> <span id="s136">There was a mystery.</span> <span id="s137">So, I was not--I did not like, unfortunately, being a Jew; and I, later on, tried to escape it altogether.</span> <span id="s138">I even married a man who is not Jewish.</span> <span id="s139">And eventually, of course, I came back, because I feel I am a Jew and I will not--I could never convert or never be what--what I am, I am a Jew; but it has been a difficult journey for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Have you done any education to educate yourself in Judaism?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: I have tried to go back to synagogues here and there, but I never--I am never comfortable.</span> <span id="s142">I can't find a place.</span> <span id="s143">I have gone to church a few times, and I cry when I go; but, I can't go there, either, because I don't belong.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Can you tell me the progression of events that happened after the liberation of your family and how Judaism became a part of your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Right.</span> <span id="s146">There was, of course, an enormous sense of relief when the Germans left.</span> <span id="s147">I mean, we were all safe--but it wasn't, entirely, a safe atmosphere.</span> <span id="s148">Right after the war they started--then there was a sort of witch-hunt for collaborators, people who either helped Germans or had contact with Germans; and, I remember that.</span> <span id="s149">An old lady who lived across the street from us, she was a spinster, and she had slept with a German, and I remember her head being shaved.</span> <span id="s150">I remember, also, that the food--you know, the things we missed didn't come back right away.</span> <span id="s151">It's not like suddenly we are free and life goes back to normal.</span> <span id="s152">There was no--for a long time there was no sugar, still.</span> <span id="s153">There was no leather.</span> <span id="s154">We were not that terribly deprived, because in the village you get all the basics.</span> <span id="s155">We didn't have chocolate, and things like that.</span> <span id="s156">I saw oranges, I think, for the first time in my life when I was eight years old--and sardines.</span> <span id="s157">And when we were liberated the Americans threw us chewing gum, to the kids, and that was, of course, the first time we saw chewing gum.</span> <span id="s158">We chewed on it for a month, it seems!</span> <span id="s159">I don't think life changed very much in terms of the practical aspects of it; it was more the feeling that the danger was away.</span> <span id="s160">However, for my parents, I heard them say they never felt or feared that there was no danger, that they had the sense that it might occur again, and they really never relaxed.</span> <span id="s161">My mother, especially, had a bad--which is interesting to me, and I don't know why--she had a bad feeling about the village, when I felt--and I think my father, too--that we were really saved by the people around us and we owed them a lot.</span> <span id="s162">And so--you know, I remember the celebration when the Americans were there and we were liberated, and the joy.</span> <span id="s163">And afterwards I think we just went back to living a life that's lowly.</span> <span id="s164">It became a little better, but it wasn't a tremendous change right away.</span> <span id="s165">And I don't believe my parents ever told anyone that we were Jews.</span> <span id="s166">They wanted to keep it a secret.</span> <span id="s167">But when--then, when I was--in '47 my grandmother and I moved to the suburbs of Paris for a year--and my grandfather died in '48.</span> <span id="s168">So, she and I spent a year there and--because I was going to school.</span> <span id="s169">My parents sold their practice and came later.</span> <span id="s170">And then my father joined the synagogue, which was in--where we lived, in Valdoise (phonetic), and then we started going regularly to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s171">We did not have kosher food in the house.</span> <span id="s172">And we celebrated the main holidays, and the one that stayed with me was Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s173">And, I felt simply reluctant.</span> <span id="s174">I just went along.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: When did you learn that the Holocaust happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s177">It's a strange--it's a strange notion.</span> <span id="s178">I don't know if I knew and I repressed it, or, I didn't know.</span> <span id="s179">I know, certainly, I did not want to know; I stayed away from the whole--from the whole subject, as best as I could, and, in fact, it's only when my daughter, who was--when she was 17, or 16, she asked.</span> <span id="s180">She started asking me questions; and I said I didn't know and I didn't want to know and she did not need to know, because it was over; and--but she insisted then.</span> <span id="s181">She started to read books, and she started to have nightmares.</span> <span id="s182">And at that point I didn't want--I felt I owed it to her, maybe, or maybe to--to also know something so I can talk to her about it; and, very slowly I have informed myself, but even now, I haven't read Franco (phonetic), for instance.</span> <span id="s183">I mean, there are books on--</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: (Interposing) Did you--when you left your village and you went to Paris and you were ten years old, you weren't aware of what had just happened in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: You know, I cannot remember; I can't remember anything.</span> <span id="s186">I'm sure I was aware, because it's impossible not to; but, I have absolutely no memory.</span> <span id="s187">All I remember is the people in the synagogue, and they looked so somber and so sad but I don't recall consciously knowing why.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Where did you go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Then I went to Le Seine (phonetic), when I lived in Valdoise (phonetic).</span> <span id="s190">It's a public school.</span> <span id="s191">And, in my class, again I was the only Jew--wait; no.</span> <span id="s192">I think in the class ahead of me was Michelle LaVeigh (phonetic).</span> <span id="s193">That's right.</span> <span id="s194">In my own class of 30 kids I was the only Jew.</span> <span id="s195">And I never really experienced any anti-semitism directly.</span> <span id="s196">I wasn't taunted for being a Jew.</span> <span id="s197">The kids--the boys made fun of me because I was eleven years old and I had breasts; and so, that was a big event!</span> <span id="s198">So, the breasts were what plagued me as a child, not being a Jew!</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: But were they aware that you were Jewish, your schoolmates?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: Again, you see, I really don't have much information.</span> <span id="s201">I think--I was also taught to hide, and it was very confusing, because--I became a Girl Scout, and I remember going to see a priest who was holding this Girl Scout group, and my mother telling me to tell him that we were Russian Orthodox.</span> <span id="s202">So, I trot in his office and he asked me what my religion is--and I think it was a Catholic group--and so, I tell him; and he asked me questions about it, and I couldn't answer; I had no idea; and he got angry at me and told me it was bad to lie.</span> <span id="s203">So, I went away in tears and joined a Protestant group--but, I went to church with them, too.</span> <span id="s204">You know, I went to all the services, because that's what we did.</span> <span id="s205">And so, it seems like that I was both going to the synagogue and, also, I had to hide being Jewish, at the same time; and, unfortunately, I do not--I can't remember what I was feeling about it.</span> <span id="s206">I think it was confusing.</span> <span id="s207">It was never something that I felt a part of, which I regret because I now have friends who find a strong sense of identification and strength in being a Jew, and a sense of being a survivor.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: And what were the events that occurred in your life after; how long were you in Paris and what brought you then--did you come from there to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s210">I came.</span> <span id="s211">I stayed in the suburbs with my parents until I was 18 and finished, you know, the Le Seine (phonetic).</span> <span id="s212">Then I spent a year in London, studying.</span> <span id="s213">Then I moved out from my parents' house and lived in Paris near the Sorbonne.</span> <span id="s214">And in 1962--and once I was on my own I stopped going to any kind of religious services, and in 1962 I came over to America, on vacation, basically, and stayed a year to learn the language, and met an American and got married; and so, we settled here.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: And throughout your adult--your early adult years if you were asked what religion you were, what did you tell them?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: Oh, yes; I always said that I was Jewish, but I never volunteered very much, either; but, I never hid.</span> <span id="s217">My ex-husband was Methodist, I believe.</span> <span id="s218">He was not religious, either, so the children were brought up without any religious education at all.</span> <span id="s219">They asked me if I believed in God, and I said I wasn't sure but chances are there was a God, because I really wanted to give them the opportunity.</span> <span id="s220">When we divorced I tried to take the children to--oh; we went to the Ethical Society (phonetic).</span> <span id="s221">That's right.</span> <span id="s222">I thought maybe that's a way.</span> <span id="s223">They hated it!</span> <span id="s224">Then I tried to take them to a synagogue; and there was a very good Rabbi here, and the kids liked him; and then he retired to become a therapist, a family therapist; and, after that, there was nothing doing.</span> <span id="s225">The kids wouldn't hear of going to another synagogue.</span> <span id="s226">So, we left it at that.</span> <span id="s227">I left it at that.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: And when did you begin to identify with--or are you involved in--you said you are a member of a group of children of (inaudible) survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Yes--no; I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s230">The Hidden Children (phonetic).</span> <span id="s231">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: When did you decide to become involved and identify with that group of people?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: Well, you know, as ironic as life is, it is really my daughter who showed me the way, because she strongly identifies, very strongly, with the--she--she is a Jew.</span> <span id="s234">She calls herself a Jew.</span> <span id="s235">I have two children; an older son, and a daughter.</span> <span id="s236">My son is not, at all; doesn't consider himself Jewish.</span> <span id="s237">He is not part of it at all.</span> <span id="s238">It's very striking.</span> <span id="s239">My daughter is, and she is now working in Tucson with Russian refugees, Jewish refugees.</span> <span id="s240">And in some ways I feel that she opened a door for me; and it was two years ago I joined this group, and, also, because I have had, for many, many years, a friend and a lover who is Jewish, and he was solely identified with the Jewish religion and would get very angry at me for having a Christmas tree!</span> <span id="s241">This was a great source of contention.</span> <span id="s242">And because of him, too, I started feeling closer to being a Jew.</span> <span id="s243">Now I have a feeling--I know a lot about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s244">I have heard many, many stories of the children--I mean the real tragedies of people losing,--as you know--losing family; and I feel more connected, because I am connected to people, not to an abstraction.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Tell us how your parents located in the village that you were in--and your particular situation is unique than other survivors or children because you were Jewish and your life really changed in not many ways when the war was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: How my parents came to--well, they finished medical school in 1975, and they were both very, very poor.</span> <span id="s247">They had absolutely nothing to start with.</span> <span id="s248">So, they were looking at the time for a place where they might find a need, where there would be a need for a doctor and they could start working right away and get some money.</span> <span id="s249">So, they were searching for very small places,--living in Paris was out of the question--and in that search they settled on the village, and I don't know why there rather than in the south, for instance.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Where did your parents meet each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: They met in medical school.</span> <span id="s252">They both seem to have had a strong desire to be doctors, coming from childhood.</span> <span id="s253">My father did not pass the exam to go to Vienna, to be accepted in medical school in Vienna--which certainly saved his life--and so he came to Paris--to France--and then went to Montpellier and went to school in Montpellier first and then moved up to Paris.</span> <span id="s254">My mother came from--well, from Harbin (phonetic) because she did not want to go to medical school in China, or it was impossible, and she, also, chose Paris; and so she came by herself when she was 18 years old and learned the language and then went to medical school.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: And in your particular situation while the war was going on and before and after, you did not have much of a change in your lifestyle, in your family--</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Not really, no; or whatever change there was, I am not aware of.</span> <span id="s257">I am sure it was dramatic; but, it was internal.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: And the reason was because there were no Jews in the community; there weren't any in the neighboring communities;--</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Right; right.</span> <span id="s260">We had--</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: (continuing) --there was no slave labor; there were no deportations; there was really no sign of Hitler's war against the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: There was no sign where we lived; and when I say--you know, you have to realize, this was many years ago, and when you live in the village you are so isolated, because you don't travel.</span> <span id="s263">There is no reason to go to the village next door; and so, you live in a very small world; and, going to Amiens (phonetic), which was 35 kilometers away, was a huge expedition.</span> <span id="s264">I mean, we went there very rarely, and it would have had to be something very special.</span> <span id="s265">We lived in the village.</span> <span id="s266">We could have been in the center of the earth!</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: What was the effect on the village by having the Germans occupying your village?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Well, I--we hated them.</span> <span id="s269">You always--you hate the people who occupy you.</span> <span id="s270">I mean, we felt that we were in retreat.</span> <span id="s271">I mean, there was a general feeling.</span> <span id="s272">How it affected me, personally, was, the first thing I knew, I remembered there was--living next to us, in the garden next to us, there was an old lady, and I don't know how old she was.</span> <span id="s273">I would say 97, now.</span> <span id="s274">I am sure she wasn't that old, because, I was so young that she--but, anyway, she lived alone and she had beautiful flowers in her garden.</span> <span id="s275">She had dahlias.</span> <span id="s276">She had just a gorgeous garden.</span> <span id="s277">We had a more pedestrian garden, with fruit, with strawberries and things.</span> <span id="s278">After a while the Germans took her house and made her move, and I don't know where she went or what happened to her.</span> <span id="s279">And after about a year or two they made us move.</span> <span id="s280">They occupied our house, and we moved in with a spinster near the park in NuMeir (phonetic).</span> <span id="s281">So, this was difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: In a small town like that you must have seen them everywhere you were;--</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: Yeah; yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: --when you went to do your shopping?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: But we also had access to everything they wanted.</span> <span id="s286">It was like you live in your own house but you are no longer the master of this house.</span> <span id="s287">You become like a servant.</span> <span id="s288">You become second, or second best.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Were you afraid of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: I think everyone was afraid of their potential, yes--but, it was so very humiliating.</span> <span id="s291">You know, you are occupied.</span> <span id="s292">It's no longer your place.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Was there any resistance to the soldiers being there?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: There was always resistance.</span> <span id="s295">There was just the name-calling, if you like; them being the “boosh” (phonetic).</span> <span id="s296">There was that level of hatred; but, it was hidden.</span> <span id="s297">We wanted them out.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Did the soldiers speak French?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: So, you were able to talk and you really weren't concerned that they were understanding what you were saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: No.</span> <span id="s302">I think it was behind their back.</span> <span id="s303">I think the Germans, you know, got wise pretty soon about what "boosh" (phonetic) meant.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: And you said there was a small resistance group in your village?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: What did they do and how did they--</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: Well, there is--I remember one event.</span> <span id="s308">It was towards the end of the war.</span> <span id="s309">An American soldier had jumped.</span> <span id="s310">His plane had been shot down--there were lots of planes flying all over, over us all the time; and he had been shot down, and he jumped with his parachute and hit a tree and he was killed.</span> <span id="s311">The men went to find him, but, they couldn't.</span> <span id="s312">They couldn't save him.</span> <span id="s313">So, in the village we divided the parachute, and we got the threads of it, which were white and silvery, and my mother had a lady knit a jacket for me--we had no wool at the time--; and it was just a frightening experience, because I thought of the dead man to whom the parachute belonged.</span> <span id="s314">Then we divided the material and I don't know what we did with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Were there any incidents of rebellion with the resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Open?</span> <span id="s317">No; no.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: How many years were they occupying?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: From 1940 until the end of the war.</span> <span id="s320">We were liberated in June, '45.</span> <span id="s321">But towards the end we knew the Germans were frightened, and we knew they were going to leave.</span> <span id="s322">It became more dangerous.</span> <span id="s323">That's when they came and almost killed us.</span> <span id="s324">No; it was not a peaceful time.</span> <span id="s325">You know, it was not like life was going like usual.</span> <span id="s326">But it was more a sense of helplessness that we already had, and it was a life that I was born into.</span> <span id="s327">I did not know any different.</span> <span id="s328">I didn't know the difference.</span> <span id="s329">I can tell the difference when I think back upon it.</span> <span id="s330">Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Is there anything you would like to add to end this presentation?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: I am thinking of Elie Wiesel, who says--and I think this is what--this is being done: "If you remember, it will not happen again.</span> <span id="s333">If the world remembers, it will not happen again."</span> <span id="s334">I am also thinking of what is happening now in Somalia, but more so in Bosnia.</span> <span id="s335">It doesn't feel like "remembering" is enough.</span> <span id="s336">And what troubles me is, you think back in horror; how could the world have let it happen?</span> <span id="s337">How could there have been trains taking people away?</span> <span id="s338">And yet we--me, as a person, I know what's going on in Bosnia, and yet I don't want yet to go there.</span> <span id="s339">And, somehow, it's happening again; and that is what is frightening.</span></p></body></html>
