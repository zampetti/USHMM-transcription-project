makes noise.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: We finished school and I belonged to a Zionist movement.</span> <span id="s39">When I was 12 years old, we started.</span> <span id="s40">And we used to go to seminars with other kids from other cities.</span> <span id="s41">It was well organized in the future what you saw it was working like you know through the city.</span> <span id="s42">It was a poor life in Poland, but we were happy.</span> <span id="s43">We didn't know any other way how to live, so that was it,” you know.</span> <span id="s44">Then when the war broke out in 1939, when the Germans came in the first thing what they did, they collected all the real Orthodox Jews and put into the synagogue and they had to take out all the, you know, and everything the...and everything and put on the sidewalk and burn them”.</span> <span id="s45">Only Jewish people have to do this.</span> <span id="s46">Then they started to grab people to work every single day.</span> <span id="s47">Every Jew who walked by a building where there was a German officer, he had to kneel down and take off their hats when they passed by; otherwise, they would be shot, you know.</span> <span id="s48">Then when they came out to talk to the people, they said, "Good morning, brother ” ."</span> <span id="s49">He says, "Good morning, swine."</span> <span id="s50">You know what swine is?</span> <span id="s51">Pigs.</span> <span id="s52">Okay.</span> <span id="s53">Then they started to grab people to work.</span> <span id="s54">All the time.</span> <span id="s55">Then they start to confiscate all the business what the people had.</span> <span id="s56">So there was a lot of ”Holsterges living in our city, so they knew exactly the addresses and the names of the people who had business.</span> <span id="s57">So they went in and they confiscate everything.</span> <span id="s58">Then while we were sleeping, started to rip off the roofs from the building,...the roofs because they thought they're going to make a garden in the middle of the city so the Jewish people shouldn't live there.</span> <span id="s59">So everybody start to run to different places.</span> <span id="s60">They lived like 10...10 people in one small room.</span> <span id="s61">Then I got sick from typhus.</span> <span id="s62">Jewish people was not allowed to use a doctor or a drugstore or a hospital.</span> <span id="s63">So they...me and may womans...in the outskirts of the city in a little room.”</span> <span id="s64">and they sent in a doctor, a Jewish doctor.</span> <span id="s65">I think he came from Germany.</span> <span id="s66">He had one artificial leg.</span> <span id="s67">There was no medication and everybody was dying every day and I expect to die too, but it was a miracle.</span> <span id="s68">After 8 weeks laying there, I kind of recovered.</span> <span id="s69">There was no medication or nothing.</span> <span id="s70">They cut off the hair and everything.</span> <span id="s71">Then they started to take hostages...people.</span> <span id="s72">They want so much money.</span> <span id="s73">Ten and a half figures, two and a half figures.</span> <span id="s74">People gave away everything.</span> <span id="s75">They got the rings, their watches, even the gold you put in your mouth, just ”to take all those people.</span> <span id="s76">Then…</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: No.</span> <span id="s79">They released them.</span> <span id="s80">They released them.</span> <span id="s81">Then they organized like a Judenrat.</span> <span id="s82">They have a release from all the people, start to make a gold star.</span> <span id="s83">We have to wear one on the left side and one on the right side, so when you walk on the street you know that you're a Jew.</span> <span id="s84">I went out from that thing when I recovered.”</span> <span id="s85">There was no food.</span> <span id="s86">Nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s87">People just starving, families.</span> <span id="s88">I lived in an attic.</span> <span id="s89">It was terrible condition, so we start to ask the Russian...German, "Why don't you kill us?"</span> <span id="s90">They says, "No, we need those guns on the front.</span> <span id="s91">You'll die anyway."</span> <span id="s92">So after a couple of months, they decided they're not going to make a ghetto.</span> <span id="s93">The city's too pretty.</span> <span id="s94">They going to make fine building. ”</span> <span id="s95">It's so close ”through Germany.</span> <span id="s96">They're going to take half of them from Mlawa and half of them to ”Newstadt, the ghetto.</span> <span id="s97">We have to go out the middle of the night, all of us to...to go to a little bridge where the water was to go into that castle.</span> <span id="s98">You know babies was crying.</span> <span id="s99">Somebody picked up a baby, but it's shot right away.</span> <span id="s100">Then inside we had to go out to another...nother door.</span> <span id="s101">On both sides were standing the German, the black uniform and ”throwing down the rifles and beat over the head.</span> <span id="s102">Everybody went down.</span> <span id="s103">The blood was running like water.</span> <span id="s104">Finally, we had to run the truck.</span> <span id="s105">They took the doctor, threw him down on the ground, and the Gestapo stepped on his face with the feet and hand.</span> <span id="s106">He committed suicide in Auschwitz. ”</span> <span id="s107">.</span> <span id="s108">But then they took us to Newstadt.</span> <span id="s109">We came into Newstadt.</span> <span id="s110">There was a ghetto already.</span> <span id="s111">In the...and we watched 20 minutes, they had to beat up a Jew.</span> <span id="s112">There was no place where to go in.</span> <span id="s113">People was running like crazy.</span> <span id="s114">They cut off the hair from the woman.</span> <span id="s115">I ran into a stable.</span> <span id="s116">That where we lived there for a couple of weeks and we organized...we made a kitchen with a little bit soup to give the people.</span> <span id="s117">And whole families die over night.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Tell us...tell us...slow down just a little.</span> <span id="s119">Tell us what it was like in the stable.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: That unreal.</span> <span id="s121">First of all, no water, no food or nothing.</span> <span id="s122">People was dying and we was jealous they're already dead.</span> <span id="s123">Finally, I found out that they hanged my uncles in the other city.</span> <span id="s124">I found out.</span> <span id="s125">I didn't want to tell my aunt.</span> <span id="s126">So she saw me, she said what are you crying.</span> <span id="s127">I said, "No."</span> <span id="s128">"Did you hear something?"</span> <span id="s129">I said, "No.</span> <span id="s130">I didn't hear."</span> <span id="s131">I didn't want to tell her.</span> <span id="s132">She didn't know til the last minute.</span> <span id="s133">Then they decided they're going to take us to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s134">We didn't know where we're going.</span> <span id="s135">They took us in those cattle trains, locked in, for 3 days and 3 nights.</span> <span id="s136">Women are giving the babies urine to drink.</span> <span id="s137">It was bad.</span> <span id="s138">Half of them die anyway.</span> <span id="s139">And they took us ride for 3 days like that.</span> <span id="s140">We came out and everything got to be fast...fast.</span> <span id="s141">We came into Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s142">We didn't know what's going.</span> <span id="s143">It was in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s144">THey always did it in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s145">They...right away, they cut off like let's say a 100 women, men, 200, a 100 men.</span> <span id="s146">You could be young.</span> <span id="s147">You didn't have a chance.</span> <span id="s148">They just cut off a group.</span> <span id="s149">That many they let into the camp.</span> <span id="s150">Right away, we don't see our people...anything...our parents.</span> <span id="s151">In a second, you didn't see it.</span> <span id="s152">They divided.</span> <span id="s153">Right.</span> <span id="s154">Left.</span> <span id="s155">Right.</span> <span id="s156">Left.</span> <span id="s157">Dr. Mengele.</span> <span id="s158">Once they had a little group for the camps, the rest went to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s159">Let's say there was like 3,000 people in that train.</span> <span id="s160">They took out 200 or 300 for the camp.</span> <span id="s161">Then we realized...they took us into a room and they told...we had to take off the clothes, everything.</span> <span id="s162">Cut our hair all over, and then they gave us those clothes.</span> <span id="s163">They didn't even fit.</span> <span id="s164">Gave us those clothes, and they took us into a barrack.</span> <span id="s165">The barrack was...had to hold thousand people, not less.</span> <span id="s166">So there was their ”couriers.</span> <span id="s167">How do you call it...where we in three lines.</span> <span id="s168">Nothing there, no” blankets or nothing.</span> <span id="s169">Some of them slept on the...on the bricks.</span> <span id="s170">Then about 4:00 in the morning, we had to get up and stand naked even in the winter to see if we have a clear skin.</span> <span id="s171">There they count us in 5, a hundred in a group, and the SS with the dogs took us to work.</span> <span id="s172">We had to walk, let's say, maybe 10 miles a day to work.</span> <span id="s173">Many of them died on the way walking so they give us a stick to put us there dead people.</span> <span id="s174">Two have to hold them this way.</span> <span id="s175">One have to hold their feet to take them to the place where we supposed to work.</span> <span id="s176">Then we have to bring them back because the appell.</span> <span id="s177">They have to count the people that everybody's there.</span> <span id="s178">So we have to bring those dead people back, so they put them like on a piece of wood two hold here and the rest of them hold here, to bring those dead people because everybody gotta be counted.</span> <span id="s179">Then when we looked around we saw people are standing in the line to get into the crematorium.</span> <span id="s180">No food.</span> <span id="s181">No bathrooms.</span> <span id="s182">No nothing.</span> <span id="s183">They want to get all already we be dead”.</span> <span id="s184">The crematoriums was going for 24 hours.</span> <span id="s185">Day and night.</span> <span id="s186">Before you saw ””They bring transports from all over Europe, from France, from Belgium, from Holland, from Poland, from every country in Europe.</span> <span id="s187">They didn't miss one country.</span> <span id="s188">I think maybe Norwegian they missed.</span> <span id="s189">The conditions in the camp was horrible.</span> <span id="s190">We didn't see...for 7, 8 months there was no water in Auschwitz, completely.</span> <span id="s191">They just...just put electric wires around for barracks.</span> <span id="s192">There was nothing else there.</span> <span id="s193">No water.</span> <span id="s194">After 7, 8 months, there's no water there.</span> <span id="s195">We have to walk to work every day.</span> <span id="s196">Hungry.</span> <span id="s197">The lice on the whole body, all over our faces. ”</span> <span id="s198">It was snowing.</span> <span id="s199">Beaten up.</span> <span id="s200">One time an SS man beat me up with the rifle.</span> <span id="s201">He thought I'm dead already.</span> <span id="s202">I starts to work.</span> <span id="s203">Beat us up. ”</span> <span id="s204">You know just for fun.</span> <span id="s205">Pulled out a few people, beat us up.</span> <span id="s206">Then they gave us a piece of bread, but we didn't know, should we take a crumb every hour or should we swallow it right away.</span> <span id="s207">We couldn't figure out what to do with this.</span> <span id="s208">When we ate it up, we was sorry why we ate it up already.</span> <span id="s209">This way we have another crumb to eat.</span> <span id="s210">We was going to work...was beaten up, after work all the time, kicked us up, beat us up. ”</span> <span id="s211">That what we have to do.</span> <span id="s212">Slapped us.</span> <span id="s213">Iron wagons with the bricks.</span> <span id="s214">You know, it wasn't actually work, but on top of it just to make people work.</span> <span id="s215">Just to make people work.</span> <span id="s216">Then on Sunday, when we came back from work Sunday, the day off, we had to put our clothes, button up in the back and put in a lot of sand so one place we ”slept to another one.</span> <span id="s217">So people who couldn't run fast, the dogs went after them.</span> <span id="s218">Always beaten up, you know.</span> <span id="s219">It was a helluva condition.</span> <span id="s220">I can't believe...I was 18 years old that that.</span> <span id="s221">I..</span> <span id="s222">.</span> <span id="s223">I can't visualize how people can even go through that without food, without water, with everything.</span> <span id="s224">That was going on for 2 and a half years in...in the camp.</span> <span id="s225">Then when they saw the Russian...the Russian are coming, they took us from Birkenau to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s226">There was already better buildings and a better thing.</span> <span id="s227">In Birkenau, I forgot to mention, that...there was an uprising in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s228">They killed a lot of Germans.</span> <span id="s229">They put them in the oven, but in 5 minutes the whole sky was with so many German airplanes that you couldn't see the skies anymore.</span> <span id="s230">And everybody who was moving was killed anyway.</span> <span id="s231">People start to run.</span> <span id="s232">They wants to find out how those people was organized because nobody can have a pencil or a piece of paper.</span> <span id="s233">One of mine counselor, like a blockaltester, was 5 girls, 5 sisters from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s234">She kind of tried to put on paper what's happened and she hid it in her coat and they find it.</span> <span id="s235">So they said they're going to shot her.</span> <span id="s236">So the other four sisters stood by and they said, "We want to be shot too."</span> <span id="s237">So they shot all five sisters.</span> <span id="s238">Then when they start to figure out how the uprising...there was a girl...I think was her name.</span> <span id="s239">I forgot. ”</span> <span id="s240">I think. ”</span> <span id="s241">And she was organized this thing.</span> <span id="s242">So they wants to take her to hang her, so she cut her veins.</span> <span id="s243">And she slapped the SS man.</span> <span id="s244">He says, "You're dying."</span> <span id="s245">She says, "I die today, but you gonna die tomorrow."</span> <span id="s246">Even make a film from that.</span> <span id="s247">Then one girl dropped...girls who brought in the evening ammunition what they smuggled out” ammunition.</span> <span id="s248">One girl broke down.</span> <span id="s249">They beat her up and she says, "If you tell us, what's happening, you're gonna be ”sleep.</span> <span id="s250">We're not going to torture you."</span> <span id="s251">But that wasn't the...the fact.</span> <span id="s252">She knew three other girls.</span> <span id="s253">That's all she knew.</span> <span id="s254">And one of the girls was ” my girlfriend.</span> <span id="s255">They beat her up.</span> <span id="s256">She didn't tell anything because they would hang a lot of people if she would tell to who she gave and how the things happened.</span> <span id="s257">The girl who gave up was the first to be hanged.</span> <span id="s258">The German punished her.</span> <span id="s259">And everybody have to stay and watch when they hang those four girls.</span> <span id="s260">It was like in...in January.</span> <span id="s261">In January 18, we have to leave the camp.</span> <span id="s262">They announced the microphone, we...I and five girls wants to hide it between the floor.</span> <span id="s263">So they announced on the microphone if they catch anybody, they will be shot on the spot.</span> <span id="s264">So I says to the girls, "Maybe it's no use to do it.</span> <span id="s265">It looks like the world's coming to an end to the German army.</span> <span id="s266">Let's go."</span> <span id="s267">So we starts to walk.</span> <span id="s268">We couldn't walk.</span> <span id="s269">We have to run out from the camp.</span> <span id="s270">And in five in groups.</span> <span id="s271">And who couldn't run was shot.</span> <span id="s272">Right away on the spot.</span> <span id="s273">Some people begged, "I want to just catch my breath."</span> <span id="s274">No.</span> <span id="s275">If you couldn't run, you know, people haven't good shoes and all these things, so they shot.</span> <span id="s276">And we was jealous.</span> <span id="s277">They are already dead, and they don't have to go through all this.</span> <span id="s278">Finally, they took us on a truck” to get deeper to Germany.</span> <span id="s279">We was without covers and the snow was coming on us.</span> <span id="s280">No boots.</span> <span id="s281">And then about thousand woman was walking.</span> <span id="s282">They threw one bread.</span> <span id="s283">You know how many people got killed just to...I never runned for that.</span> <span id="s284">I knew.</span> <span id="s285">The first one got crushed already.</span> <span id="s286">One bread for thousand people. ”</span> <span id="s287">Such a sadistic way.</span> <span id="s288">Then they took us into Ravensbruck.</span> <span id="s289">In Ravensbruck, the hunger was unbelievable, terrible.</span> <span id="s290">Already, they gonna take us to Gross Rosen, and they didn't let us in.</span> <span id="s291">They got a little too many people, so they took us to Ravensbruck.</span> <span id="s292">In Ravensbruck, we was there a couple weeks and saw the Russians were behind, coming, they took to from Mettlenberg, Newstadt ” in the camp.</span> <span id="s293">A room like that was a few hundred women.</span> <span id="s294">If you lay down to sleep, you couldn't turn around.</span> <span id="s295">There was no room.</span> <span id="s296">That's how you had to lay all night.</span> <span id="s297">This was the...we was there in that camp.</span> <span id="s298">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s299">The hunger...they gave us a little piece of bread for 24 hours.</span> <span id="s300">It was unbelievable how people was dying.</span> <span id="s301">The end was near that camp was people...pilots...which they was shot down American planes, and Canadians so the Germans locked the gate and they ran away.</span> <span id="s302">It was in...</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: I don't understand.</span> <span id="s304">Explain.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: When the war come to a..</span> <span id="s306">.</span> <span id="s307">to a finished, the German run away from that camp, from us, and they locked the gate.</span> <span id="s308">And we didn't know that the war was to end.</span> <span id="s309">So those people, those pilots cut the wires...you know was divided, and told us that the war is over.</span> <span id="s310">The Germans went away.</span> <span id="s311">So we starts to run to the...out to get some food, you know.</span> <span id="s312">All the Germans from this city left the houses.</span> <span id="s313">They knew that we come out they're gonna be killed.</span> <span id="s314">They knew that what was going down.</span> <span id="s315">So everybody left those houses...that we went into those houses, and we took food.</span> <span id="s316">We got food for here, but we were... But I even now we was tired walking, so the same day came in the...the American soldiers and the Russians the same day, to Mettlenberg.</span> <span id="s317">And they was kissing each other.</span> <span id="s318">Thank God that the war is over, because in some places the Germans was still fighting.</span> <span id="s319">So there was a guy...a German guy with a wagon with horses.</span> <span id="s320">So we told him to give us the wagon, the horses.</span> <span id="s321">He says, "No."</span> <span id="s322">So a Russian officer walked by, took him by the head, threw him in the.</span> <span id="s323">.</span> <span id="s324">in the...in the yard.</span> <span id="s325">He said, "You give them everything they wanted."</span> <span id="s326">The Russians said that like this.</span> <span id="s327">They were very nice to us.</span> <span id="s328">Real nice.</span> <span id="s329">So we took the horses and the wagon and we start to go out closer to the city.</span> <span id="s330">Then when the night came over, we took out a house, and we went the house to stay overnight.</span> <span id="s331">Part of the way was a lot of soldiers.</span> <span id="s332">You know, they let out from Russia, from the jail everything, and there was a rape of a lot of girls.</span> <span id="s333">So one Russian officer came in, a very intelligent man, and he says, "Listen, the war is over.</span> <span id="s334">There's a lot of people came out from the jail.</span> <span id="s335">They do bad things.</span> <span id="s336">We can't control it.</span> <span id="s337">But I'm going to sit here a whole night and watch you."</span> <span id="s338">We were 10 girls togethers, which was nice.</span> <span id="s339">He was sitting.</span> <span id="s340">While he was sitting, they knocked on the door.</span> <span id="s341">They saw coming in.</span> <span id="s342">So he went to the door.</span> <span id="s343">They ran away.</span> <span id="s344">They was afraid for him.</span> <span id="s345">So he says, "I can't protect you anymore," he says.</span> <span id="s346">You take...try to take the trains and go to Berlin because in the city will be more protected.</span> <span id="s347">So we went on a train.</span> <span id="s348">The trains happened like there was going for an hour and 6 hours there was standing.</span> <span id="s349">It was broken off.</span> <span id="s350">We went in the train.</span> <span id="s351">We was together 10 girls.</span> <span id="s352">And Russian soldiers came in and they took I imagine they saw girls.</span> <span id="s353">They says, "We're going to bring our friends here."</span> <span id="s354">While he was in the other side, we ran out from the train.</span> <span id="s355">The train was standing.</span> <span id="s356">And there was a lot of broken trains.</span> <span id="s357">So we decided every girl would go, lay down under a train.</span> <span id="s358">In the morning, we will board it.</span> <span id="s359">We were laying like that a whole under those broken trains.</span> <span id="s360">You know, every girl.</span> <span id="s361">In...In the morning, we got up.</span> <span id="s362">The train left already with our stuff and everything.</span> <span id="s363">We didn't care already.</span> <span id="s364">So we starts to go from one city to the other til we got into Berlin.</span> <span id="s365">Well, being in Berlin, we didn't have any families.</span> <span id="s366">We didn't have anybody.</span> <span id="s367">They wasn't well organized like after the war, so we decided we're going back to Poland.</span> <span id="s368">Because we got some property there, we're going back to Poland.</span> <span id="s369">So 10 girls came back to Poland.</span> <span id="s370">We didn't realize that Poland was worse than with ”the Germans.</span> <span id="s371">They didn't want any Jew to come there because then they claim their properties.</span> <span id="s372">So they didn't want us.</span> <span id="s373">So when you went out on the street, you saw laying dead Jews, which they came back from Russia or from the army.</span> <span id="s374">They weren't missed by nobody.</span> <span id="s375">They didn't have any family, so nobody knew who they are.</span> <span id="s376">Their families was killed, and they sneaked out from Russia in 1945.</span> <span id="s377">So all the time you saw.</span> <span id="s378">So finally, what we gonna do?</span> <span id="s379">I came back to my city.</span> <span id="s380">With five other girls, went in a house.</span> <span id="s381">The ”Army Kiova went in and they killed those girls.</span> <span id="s382">One was under the bed.</span> <span id="s383">They didn't know that she's alive.</span> <span id="s384">She's 9 years old. ”</span> <span id="s385">.</span> <span id="s386">Anyway, they saw a Jew, they killed it.</span> <span id="s387">They wasn't missed by nobody.</span> <span id="s388">So we decided it's not good we...in the city either.</span> <span id="s389">So we went to Lodz.</span> <span id="s390">I went.</span> <span id="s391">A few...a few remained.</span> <span id="s392">They got boyfriends right away.</span> <span id="s393">I went to Lodz.</span> <span id="s394">I came to Lodz.</span> <span id="s395">I went into a kibbutz.</span> <span id="s396">We got a roof over there.</span> <span id="s397">There's something to eat.</span> <span id="s398">Israel wasn't established in that time.</span> <span id="s399">I was in Lodz.</span> <span id="s400">So one group went to a different city for a..</span> <span id="s401">.</span> <span id="s402">a reunion.</span> <span id="s403">They took off 4 boys...I shouldn't have bring their picture, I think I got.</span> <span id="s404">They took off four boys and a girl and they killed them right away, from the train.</span> <span id="s405">It was 18 or 19 year olds.</span> <span id="s406">So you could only be in that kibbutz 6 months.</span> <span id="s407">We have to smuggle our way to Lodz.</span> <span id="s408">I find out that my brother is alive in Russia.</span> <span id="s409">I want to wait for him.</span> <span id="s410">So I went to Bialystok. ”</span> <span id="s411">We went into a kibbutz.</span> <span id="s412">He was there.</span> <span id="s413">Another kapo man.</span> <span id="s414">Meantime, my brother came.</span> <span id="s415">The police came in one night and this...told us there're going to pogram.</span> <span id="s416">They're going to kill us.</span> <span id="s417">So every 2 hours, 2 other men were standing.</span> <span id="s418">In time, 5 people went back to Lodz, those of us who want to” want to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: I don't understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Five people went to ”Valsa from that kibbutz.</span> <span id="s421">Yal. ”</span> <span id="s422">.</span> <span id="s423">In time, one boy saw what's going to come.</span> <span id="s424">He was hiding by another lady, she had a ” .</span> <span id="s425">So they didn't see that boy.</span> <span id="s426">All the other 12 was killed.</span> <span id="s427">So he told us in Bialystok” that they was killed.</span> <span id="s428">He came into ”Valsa.</span> <span id="s429">It's unbelievable.</span> <span id="s430">People don't realize how many Jews were killed after the war from the Polish end.</span> <span id="s431">The reason I was still in Poland...I didn't go to Israel”, I was waiting for my brother.</span> <span id="s432">I know I had only one...one brother.</span> <span id="s433">He was alive.</span> <span id="s434">So I was waiting in Bialystok”.</span> <span id="s435">Then the Brichah saw that too many Jews get killed in Poland, and we had to go out.</span> <span id="s436">But they came in...People start the killing for Russia because about half a million Jews escaped to Russia when the war started.</span> <span id="s437">But they start to come back.</span> <span id="s438">Some of them got killed in ” .</span> <span id="s439">Some of them died.</span> <span id="s440">Some of them came back....the children.</span> <span id="s441">They came back to the Brichah, took us to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s442">You have to work to the Polish.</span> <span id="s443">You took a train to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s444">And over there, their parents was waiting for us. ”</span> <span id="s445">You couldn't stay too long in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s446">We had to go to Austria.</span> <span id="s447">We came to Austria in the barracks.</span> <span id="s448">I didn't have nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s449">We had to run in...in to the fields and catch a carrot or potato to eat, because they wasn't prepared for that.</span> <span id="s450">So in time, my husband had a couple of brothers in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: Hold it.</span> <span id="s452">Slow down a little bit.</span> <span id="s453">Where did you met your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s455">Well, I was standing like this...he...my husband was liberated in Austria.</span> <span id="s456">He didn't want to leave there.</span> <span id="s457">They gave him a hotel and they put a few people for those they were housing.</span> <span id="s458">The day he ” boat is coming and some brothers in Russia, so he came to see if he'll find somebody.</span> <span id="s459">There's only people from Russia .</span> <span id="s460">They stood in Germany or in Austria.</span> <span id="s461">I said, "Well, the reason I went back to Poland, I knew I wanted to see if somebody is alive from Russia."</span> <span id="s462">My brother.</span> <span id="s463">So I stood there a year in Poland.</span> <span id="s464">You couldn't leave Poland.</span> <span id="s465">The...the Russian was there.</span> <span id="s466">You couldn't leave Poland, when the Russian was there.</span> <span id="s467">You couldn't leave Poland.” ”</span> <span id="s468">But the Brichah somehow got those people out from Poland to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s469">And I met my husband and he told me that he had papers to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s470">A second cousin signed the papers.</span> <span id="s471">If I marry, I can be on those papers.</span> <span id="s472">So I says, "I have no choice.</span> <span id="s473">Either I wasn't established.</span> <span id="s474">I was sick and tired from...from all this life.</span> <span id="s475">I couldn't take it anymore.</span> <span id="s476">So I says, "Okay."</span> <span id="s477">But only if my brother goes with me, but it took the government in Austria to let him in because you not supposed leave the city.”</span> <span id="s478">, only the ” .</span> <span id="s479">So I got married.</span> <span id="s480">Right?</span> <span id="s481">After a week, I got married.</span> <span id="s482">We stood in Austria and we was waiting to immigrating to America.</span> <span id="s483">Here.</span> <span id="s484">But my brother couldn't.</span> <span id="s485">Only me because I was on the paper.</span> <span id="s486">When I came to America, it wasn't like now.</span> <span id="s487">They have...because we had a sponsor.</span> <span id="s488">That sponsor had to be a very cruel man.</span> <span id="s489">He got the papers for somebody else.</span> <span id="s490">So when we came here, we couldn't have any help from nobody.</span> <span id="s491">On the third day, I went to work down town.</span> <span id="s492">You know, I got work right away, and my husband couldn't get a job.</span> <span id="s493">I got a job.</span> <span id="s494">I start to work.</span> <span id="s495">I work overtime.</span> <span id="s496">I worked all the time, just to make a little money.</span> <span id="s497">I said, "I don't want to be poor.</span> <span id="s498">I can't be without shoes, without clothes."</span> <span id="s499">And I start to work....</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: Where did you work at?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: I..</span> <span id="s502">.</span>

work.</span> <span id="s507">I worked all the time.</span> <span id="s508">Then my husband couldn't get a job, so somebody told us to open up a little cleaning store in a Polish©Jewish neighborhood.</span> <span id="s509">My husband didn't speak English.</span> <span id="s510">I speak a little bit.</span> <span id="s511">So we opened up that store.</span> <span id="s512">After work, I came in and worked in the clothing store til 12 o'clock at night to make a few dollars to get an apartment, you know.</span> <span id="s513">So after 2 years like that, then I have my children.</span> <span id="s514">And I had an apartment and I had a little money in the bank.</span> <span id="s515">I had the two children.</span> <span id="s516">My daughters are very well educated.</span> <span id="s517">They all finished college.</span> <span id="s518">And I had...my oldest will have a Masters from Harvard College.</span> <span id="s519">They took piano lessons 10

very real and I dream about it. ”</span> <span id="s535">and I don't know what's going on you know.</span> <span id="s536">But the only thing, if I would...if I wouldn't have my daughter because she's so good to me, it's unbelievable, I wouldn't be alive.</span> <span id="s537">I would finish my life because you have no relatives.</span> <span id="s538">On holidays or something, nobody's

id="s574">All those things what happened.</span> <span id="s575">It's impossible to describe those things.</span> <span id="s576">Just impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: Sonia.</span> <span

id="s590">Can you go back and tell us very slowly the story of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: Yal.</span> <span id="s592">Well, when they took us out from the city to the ghetto, there still was Jewish people in the ”Channo.</span> <span id="s593">They need them for work so my uncle decided he'll go back with...with the daughter, you now.</span> <span id="s594">He was hiding in a attic, and for some reason the German find out about it.</span> <span id="s595">Some of them went a running back.</span> <span id="s596">They shot them right on the spot, you know, when they catched them on the way. ”</span> <span id="s597">.</span> <span id="s598">They took my uncle, and they took the men whose house was there, and my cousin, a couple from another city, a boy, ”Lindenberg from my city.</span> <span id="s599">And because my uncle have a brother, the brother have to be hanged too.</span> <span id="s600">Usually when they hanged people, they sold tickets that the Germans going to be show.</span> <span id="s601">When they hanged my city, I wasn't there when they hanged the five people.</span> <span id="s602">Two they hanged because they was hiding there.</span> <span id="s603">They throw around the things on the cemetery to find out.</span> <span id="s604">So they hanged two people.</span> <span id="s605">Then the hanged five other people, and the family...and they warned them if they cried, they'd be shot so they have to stay and watch it for 3 hours, from 6 to 9.</span> <span id="s606">Mine uncles, because they were prominent people, they paid off the Gestapo, they should make execution another city, so the family shouldn't stay and watch that.</span> <span id="s607">So they took it to ”Mettlenberg, a different city and that happened in ” , and they hanged those seven people.</span> <span id="s608">Mine cousin was fighting back and they shot her.</span> <span id="s609">She didn't want to walk up to the hanging.</span> <span id="s610">There was seven people.</span> <span id="s611">When I find out, I was in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s612">Mine...my aunt didn't know about it.</span> <span id="s613">I didn't want to tell her I find out.</span> <span id="s614">Then when I was in Auschwitz, I thought to myself if I ever survive, that's the only thing what I'm going to do is look for my brother who went to Russia and dig out those people.</span> <span id="s615">So I picked myself up and I went to this city, but a couple of Jews are there already.</span> <span id="s616">I walked into them and I told them to help me how to go through with that.</span> <span id="s617">I know it's not a easy thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: After the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: After the war.</span> <span id="s620">Yal.</span> <span id="s621">They helped me.</span> <span id="s622">They helped me.</span> <span id="s623">They have to have a permit.</span> <span id="s624">They put them in one casket, all these things, and we got them on the Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s625">Then, a day later, I walked out to make a march on this little thing.</span> <span id="s626">I was arrested by the Polish people.</span> <span id="s627">So what are you doing on the cemetery.</span> <span id="s628">I said, "Well, I have to put a ” because I'm going to leave this country."</span> <span id="s629">He says, "You are a spy."</span> <span id="s630">I said, "How am I spy when I have number on my hand.</span> <span id="s631">I was in Auschwitz for 2 and a half years."</span> <span id="s632">He said, "Everybody could make a number."</span> <span id="s633">So they arrested me.</span> <span id="s634">"You're on the cemetery.</span> <span id="s635">You're a spy."</span> <span id="s636">So finally, they let me out, you know.</span> <span id="s637">They finally let me out.</span> <span id="s638">I was glad to leave that country.</span> <span id="s639">It's hard to believe it, what the Polish people did to the Jew.</span> <span id="s640">It's just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s641">If a person went in, he didn't go out alive.</span> <span id="s642">When I was in the ghetto, it was...uh...a Jewish man.</span> <span id="s643">He was a ” .</span> <span id="s644">You know what a ” means.</span> <span id="s645">So he divided between son...the son was by one family, and he was by another family.”</span> <span id="s646">He had to have in the morning girls.</span> <span id="s647">And he paid off those Polish people.</span> <span id="s648">After the war, the guy come up...he's 9 years...their older son.</span> <span id="s649">I saw him when I was in Europe.</span> <span id="s650">He came out.</span> <span id="s651">He went into the other family to look for the father, but the father wasn't there.</span> <span id="s652">So he took a few Russian people and started to dig up in the basement and he was buried.</span> <span id="s653">They took the money, but they killed him on top of it.</span> <span id="s654">So the son ” by a different family.</span> <span id="s655">He was by a different family.</span> <span id="s656">It's unbelievable, you know.</span> <span id="s657">It's unbelievable.</span> <span id="s658">The Jewish people came back.</span> <span id="s659">They have a house.</span> <span id="s660">They figured they'd go and take the papers and get back.</span> <span id="s661">They walked in the house.</span> <span id="s662">They didn't come out alive.</span> <span id="s663">I have a close girlfriend now.</span> <span id="s664">She was in there from Warsaw, and she was hiding in the woods.</span> <span id="s665">She was lost in there.</span> <span id="s666">After the war, she came back to the girlfriend what she went to school together, and she says, "Could I sleep over by you til I get organized and we go further."</span> <span id="s667">She says, "Yes, you can sleep by me."</span> <span id="s668">While she was in bed, she hear the brother came in and he said, "What?</span> <span id="s669">You” took in a Jew?</span> <span id="s670">I'll kill her.</span> <span id="s671">I'll cut off her head."</span> <span id="s672">So she ran out through the window.</span> <span id="s673">Luckily, she wasn't sleeping.</span> <span id="s674">She heard that.</span> <span id="s675">So she ran out from the window.</span> <span id="s676">What?</span> <span id="s677">You gonna save ”a Jew?</span> <span id="s678">After the war, mind you.</span> <span id="s679">That's how it was in Poland.</span> <span id="s680">It was a very danger life in Poland.</span> <span id="s681">I was there almost a year waiting for my brother came back from Russia.</span> <span id="s682">Otherwise I wouldn't probably stay that long over there.</span> <span id="s683">But it's unbelievable what's happened, you know.</span> <span id="s684">People come back.</span> <span id="s685">When we came into Czechoslovakia, the Brichah took us out.</span> <span id="s686">The Russians...they pick them up like a piece of bread, a little milk to get from the kitchen to everybody.</span> <span id="s687">They are different from people to people.</span> <span id="s688">The Czechoslovakian didn't know people are coming.</span> <span id="s689">They all run up and give away the last piece of bread.”</span> <span id="s690">In Poland, ” .</span> <span id="s691">That's the way the situation was in Poland.</span> <span id="s692">It's unbelievable.</span> <span id="s693">I was glad to leave Europe.</span> <span id="s694">When I went back to Israel, they asked me, Don't you want ” "Don't you want to go to Poland to the ” ?"</span> <span id="s695">I says, "I don't want to look at their faces anymore.</span> <span id="s696">I don't want to have nothing to do with these people."</span> <span id="s697">That's the memories of these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: I'd like you to go back to Auschwitz again if you can.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: Yal.</span> <span id="s700">Yal.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: You talked about the...</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: The selection.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: The hanging.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: Yal.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: I'd like to know more about it.</span> <span id="s706">Can you...</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: Yal</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: Tell us what happened when...why did the girls try to smuggle out gun powder and what happened and what was the reaction?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: Yal.</span> <span id="s710">Well.</span> <span id="s711">Well, people decided that we're never going to go out alive from there.</span> <span id="s712">There was no question about it.</span> <span id="s713">The told us every day, "If the world finished 12 o'clock, 10 before 12, you be killed."</span> <span id="s714">That's what they tell us.</span> <span id="s715">But when the Russians start to come to Poland and the Germans start to lose the war, they start to take apart the crematoriums.</span> <span id="s716">They didn't want a see anything left.</span> <span id="s717">One was left.</span> <span id="s718">The...all the other five was done with it, so the people have to take apart.</span> <span id="s719">So we smelled in the air that the war eventually will come to an end, but we not going to go out alive, because that's what they told us.</span> <span id="s720">So the people decided they going to make uprising there.</span> <span id="s721">The only way...they didn't having nothing, so a lot of girls works in a union.</span> <span id="s722">They called the union where they maked ammunition.</span> <span id="s723">So the girls smuggled out ”after work and they gave it to the men to through the wires you know.</span> <span id="s724">A lot of men came into Birkenau camps, so they put a contract.</span> <span id="s725">They came into work in the camp.</span> <span id="s726">So they gave them this ammunition.</span> <span id="s727">Took maybe a year to organize that.</span> <span id="s728">And they decided that one day they gonna cut the wires, run and kill the...few SS what they were there.</span> <span id="s729">Well, it wasn't the case like that because the Polish underground supposed to come to help.</span> <span id="s730">They never show up.</span> <span id="s731">You see, they never show up, so the 10 kids...soon they start to kill a couple of Germans, they put them in the oven and cut the wires, the whole sky was with airplanes, Germans.</span> <span id="s732">You didn't see the sky.</span> <span id="s733">Just airplanes.</span> <span id="s734">And they start to shot down the people start to run.</span> <span id="s735">Out you know.</span> <span id="s736">And then the start to investigate.</span> <span id="s737">They want to know how the whole thing was organized.</span> <span id="s738">And they start to beat up those girls who work and that only one girl broke down.</span> <span id="s739">She couldn't take it anymore, and she told them...she tell them to leave her alone.</span> <span id="s740">So she only knew the three other girls.</span> <span id="s741">In between those three was my girlfriend.</span> <span id="s742">We went to school together.</span> <span id="s743">Well, they beat them up in the office.</span> <span id="s744">I have a girl what she was a secretary there and she told them this.</span> <span id="s745">Stripped them naked, and they beat them up with that...how do you call it?</span> <span id="s746">Uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: A whip?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: A whip.</span> <span id="s749">Yes.</span> <span id="s750">And the whip was between was steel.</span> <span id="s751">They whipped them up on the body and a doctor was reviving them they should tell.</span> <span id="s752">Well, they never told anything anymore.</span> <span id="s753">And then decided they're going to hang them.</span> <span id="s754">And that's what they did.</span> <span id="s755">Like in January.</span> <span id="s756">But 2 weeks before, they took us up on the camps, and we had to run.</span> <span id="s757">The Germans...because the Russians were behind, you know.</span> <span id="s758">And they hanged those four girls and everybody had to stay and watch it while they hang those those girls.</span> <span id="s759">That was the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: What happened to the men who had been involved in the uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: Well, a lot of them got killed.</span> <span id="s762">They start to run out from the camps and they killed them on the way.</span> <span id="s763">Whoever starts to run, they killed them all.</span> <span id="s764">You know, after all, they had the airplanes.</span> <span id="s765">They had ammunition.</span> <span id="s766">The people hadn't got nothing.</span> <span id="s767">But there was an uprising, but an uprising Bialystok they told me.</span> <span id="s768">Some of the people was there.</span> <span id="s769">I went to see that grave.</span> <span id="s770">With little things, they was hiding.</span> <span id="s771">People was hiding bags.</span> <span id="s772">The only thing even people say why the people didn't fight back.</span> <span id="s773">That's a very stupid question.</span> <span id="s774">When you having nothing in your hand, and the Gestapo stays with the...with the guns and with the dogs and they beat you up and you're hungry and you're thirsty, and you don't have a ” ?</span> <span id="s775">How can you fight back?</span> <span id="s776">It's a miracle how the ” for five weeks.</span> <span id="s777">With hunger, with people, with sickness.</span> <span id="s778">Together they wanted to...to buy a gun from the Polish people.</span> <span id="s779">And they fought for five weeks.</span> <span id="s780">I'll never figure...figure out how they could do it when there was sickness and typhus and hunger.</span> <span id="s781">People was dying from the sickness.</span> <span id="s782">Nobody paid attention when somebody was dying.</span> <span id="s783">That's the way it was.</span> <span id="s784">And that's the way it was in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s785">Newstadt they put a big fence.</span> <span id="s786">People couldn't go out.</span> <span id="s787">People was dying.</span> <span id="s788">Without food.</span> <span id="s789">Without everything.</span> <span id="s790">It's...it's just a miracle somebody survived.</span> <span id="s791">I can't figure it out myself.</span> <span id="s792">People can sometimes go hungry for weeks, and that's the way they survive.</span> <span id="s793">But some of them can't.</span> <span id="s794">Some do.</span> <span id="s795">Some can't.</span> <span id="s796">People standing by...by every day in Auschwitz, you have to go up 4 o'clock in the morning, stand in the line, shivering cold, stripped until naked.</span> <span id="s797">That's to look for a little thing on the skin.</span> <span id="s798">Which we didn't have even water or anything for 7 months.</span> <span id="s799">They put them right on the side.</span> <span id="s800">And a lot of them decided, it's not...it's not worth to live.</span> <span id="s801">So they just touched the electric wire and they were dead.</span> <span id="s802">Decided it's no use to live a life like that.</span> <span id="s803">We're not going to go out from here anyway.</span> <span id="s804">So a lot of my friends did, and a lot of men did it.</span> <span id="s805">Suddenly, we used...we could hear the screaming through the wires in the men's camp.</span> <span id="s806">They beat up the men, and the screaming was fill the sky.</span> <span id="s807">It was a horrible situation.</span> <span id="s808">Nobody can...can even visualize what it was there.</span> <span id="s809">Unbelievable.</span> <span id="s810">When we came into the camp, was mud til here cause it wasn't regulated, a sidewalk ” or anything.</span> <span id="s811">People put in a foot, they couldn't go out.</span> <span id="s812">One with the other the hand just to get up from the mud.</span> <span id="s813">.</span> <span id="s814">Just managed to put on the electric wires, but nothing there.</span> <span id="s815">But malaria and sickness and all those things.</span> <span id="s816">The only thing is the one day a Hanukkah.</span> <span id="s817">That as a horrible day.</span> <span id="s818">We was standing in the camp.</span> <span id="s819">Hanukkah.</span> <span id="s820">I remember that day.</span> <span id="s821">And they need people to gas.</span> <span id="s822">They didn't have any transport from the outside.</span> <span id="s823">I mean they cut off hundreds of people, thousands.</span> <span id="s824">I came back to my block.</span> <span id="s825">From thousand girls, only three came back.</span> <span id="s826">The rest was gone.</span> <span id="s827">They had to mark the list.</span> <span id="s828">That's how many have to be killed.</span> <span id="s829">Not one person could be missed.</span> <span id="s830">If they didn't have on the outside, they took from the camp.</span> <span id="s831">And the camp was always a lot of people.</span> <span id="s832">So they just cut off 500 here, 200 here, that's what they got.</span> <span id="s833">When they took them on the trucks to the crematorium, they just had to push one button.</span> <span id="s834">Like you see sometime a truck, lift that and potatoes fell down.</span> <span id="s835">That's how the people fell down.</span> <span id="s836">Every...Everything got to be fast, fast.</span> <span id="s837">Not to wait til they walked out.</span> <span id="s838">Just to push a button and the truck threw over and the people fell down like potatoes, one on top of the other.</span> <span id="s839">It's...it's unreal.</span> <span id="s840">The people doesn't even know.</span> <span id="s841">It's just like you put a drop in the ocean.</span> <span id="s842">Whatever people saying, whatever they seen in film, it's.</span> <span id="s843">.</span> <span id="s844">it's just nothing compared to the reality where it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: How did you...you said that you came back from a thousand girls had been taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s847">Only three girls.</span> <span id="s848">The next day there was another transport coming in.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: How did you escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: Well, we didn't escape.</span> <span id="s851">They just cut us off.</span> <span id="s852">Oh, that came out and the mike fell out.</span> <span id="s853">How you put it in?</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: I didn't escape.</span> <span id="s855">They just cut…</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: Wait.</span> <span id="s857">Wait.</span> <span id="s858">The tape isn't rolling yet.</span> <span id="s859">Okay.</span> <span id="s860">Now.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: Yal.</span> <span id="s862">The three girls.</span> <span id="s863">We was afraid they're going to take us too because they took away everybody so they built like a ” washroom only holes, you know.</span> <span id="s864">So me and those two girls grabbed on a shovel ”and we pretend to be working here, you know, because the barrack had to make room for other people coming in a couple of hours or so.</span> <span id="s865">So they had to make room so we kind of...I didn't think about it.</span> <span id="s866">My girlfriend told me, "Listen, we stay here, they're gonna take us.</span> <span id="s867">You see they took everybody.</span> <span id="s868">Let's run over there, take a shovel ”and a..</span> <span id="s869">.</span> <span id="s870">and a broom and see...pretend that we work here."</span> <span id="s871">And in time they took away lot of people you know.</span> <span id="s872">Everything was so fast going ”down.</span> <span id="s873">It's hard to believe it.</span> <span id="s874">And the people...when they took them from the camp to the crematoriums was worse than when they took them from the train.</span> <span id="s875">They didn't know what's going down.</span> <span id="s876">Everything was fast.</span> <span id="s877">But when they took them from...from the camps, there was screaming and crying.</span> <span id="s878">You know, when you know you're going to die, then it's worse. ”</span> <span id="s879">Yal.</span> <span id="s880">See everything was lying by the Germans.</span> <span id="s881">They always told us that we're going to work, they're going to put us in a different section.</span> <span id="s882">When they took in the last transport the Czechoslovakia Jews from Theresienstadt, they even opened up kindergarten for the schools, for the kids.</span> <span id="s883">Everything so to take away the mind that something is going to happen.</span> <span id="s884">They told them, "You're going to work.</span> <span id="s885">You're going to be in good condition.</span> <span id="s886">We need the people to work."</span> <span id="s887">In the last minute, you know, they took them to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s888">You saw a show.</span> <span id="s889">I went with my daughter to see it twice you know.</span> <span id="s890">So then they told them to go down to this.</span> <span id="s891">They say, "Why you lie to us?</span> <span id="s892">We want to work.</span> <span id="s893">Why did you did to us?"</span> <span id="s894">Start to beat them up and stand naked and nothing...nothing then.</span> <span id="s895">How...how can you fight back?</span> <span id="s896">So they pushed them in the crematorium with the families.</span> <span id="s897">That's how...all the time was lying.</span> <span id="s898">And with the lies, a lot of people believed it.</span> <span id="s899">But when we tried to tell them, you know, you're not going to go out from here alive.</span> <span id="s900">You see the cremator..." They says, "But look at the way they treat us here?</span> <span id="s901">They got special kindergarten for school.</span> <span id="s902">They keep the families together."</span> <span id="s903">So there is a sign maybe something good is going to come out.</span> <span id="s904">Nobody believed it.</span> <span id="s905">They want...they didn't want to believe it.</span> <span id="s906">Let's put it that way.</span> <span id="s907">Nobody want to believe in those things.</span> <span id="s908">So...everything was lying to the people.</span> <span id="s909">Lying.</span> <span id="s910">And...and that's it.</span> <span id="s911">And they always told us at work, don't...when they saw, the airplanes was flying.</span> <span id="s912">Probably American or English.</span> <span id="s913">He said, "Don't be so happy there was planes.</span> <span id="s914">We finish you up before the war."</span> <span id="s915">Twelve o'clock will be the war over.</span> <span id="s916">You will be 10 minutes before.</span> <span id="s917">Which they did to a lot of people.</span> <span id="s918">They put them in special trains.</span> <span id="s919">They gassed them.</span> <span id="s920">They...they didn't...they didn't have the time the last few weeks when the Russians was behind, you know.</span> <span id="s921">They didn't have many...if they had a little more time, not one person would survive.</span> <span id="s922">They didn't have the time to kill all of us.</span> <span id="s923">That was it.</span> <span id="s924">It hurts me when I see German now ” like that.</span> <span id="s925">That hurts me.</span> <span id="s926">Even when the Germans came into our house to take away the possessions, you know what he says to me, "I was here 20 years ago, but I came back."</span> <span id="s927">That what I believe the Germans will do now in 20 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: I don't understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: When they came into the city, they go into every house.</span> <span id="s930">They take away the possession, what you got.</span> <span id="s931">He says to me, "I was here 20 years ago in 1919, but I came back.</span> <span id="s932">But this time we're going to stay here."</span> <span id="s933">That's how you can't trust these people.</span> <span id="s934">One time I was walking in Auschwitz and I saw...they brought up a transport with people, men on a truck, I mean.</span> <span id="s935">You could see there was lawyers and doctors and writers.</span> <span id="s936">They way they was dressed.</span> <span id="s937">Sophisticated.</span> <span id="s938">They didn't even give them a chance to go down.</span> <span id="s939">Straight to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s940">The intelligent people didn't have a chance.</span> <span id="s941">If they knew somebody is well educated, they have no chance.</span> <span id="s942">They finish him off.</span> <span id="s943">You could those doctors and lawyers between them.</span> <span id="s944">Everybody wished they have pills to commit suicide, but we didn't have any.</span> <span id="s945">Everybody would do it.</span> <span id="s946">But beautiful dressed.</span> <span id="s947">Nice, you know.</span> <span id="s948">And you could see.</span> <span id="s949">They looked around and they figure if people are working, maybe we gonna work too, you know.</span> <span id="s950">They thought to themselves.</span> <span id="s951">But that wasn't the case.</span> <span id="s952">Because I saw them driving up straight to the crematorium, because My block was like the third block from the crematorium.</span> <span id="s953">In Birkenau.</span> <span id="s954">I was there 2 and a half years.</span> <span id="s955">I couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s956">I..</span> <span id="s957">.</span> <span id="s958">there was people that couldn't survive l day.</span> <span id="s959">Not l day.</span> <span id="s960">It's unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: How did you survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: Well, I tell you something.</span> <span id="s963">When some people ask me that question, I only have one answer.</span> <span id="s964">People play on the lottery.</span> <span id="s965">One in 10 million wins.</span> <span id="s966">None of my family survived from my father's and my mother's side.</span> <span id="s967">Only my brother who was in Russia.</span> <span id="s968">Nobody.</span> <span id="s969">They wiped out families in our city you know.</span> <span id="s970">Nobody survived.</span> <span id="s971">Nobody.</span> <span id="s972">Couldn't.</span> <span id="s973">It...it was just a..</span> <span id="s974">.</span> <span id="s975">a tragedy that...that people...only one person survived even from a city would be...would be good.</span> <span id="s976">It wasn't the case.</span> <span id="s977">They just wiped out...they were sure that they won the war, which they did won the war in Europe.</span> <span id="s978">Then did won the war, and they figured I'll take care of and everything you know.</span> <span id="s979">They took in a lot of Poles too that was well educated.</span> <span id="s980">I have to admit it.</span> <span id="s981">Everybody who was a pharmacist, a doctor, or a lawyer and come into our city, they took him immediately away to the camp because they figure intelligent people might organize themselves.</span> <span id="s982">And the reason they know who it was because...uh...there was a lot of ” in our city and they knew exactly the names and from everybody.</span> <span id="s983">So they get on the list, and that's...that's how they find out.</span> <span id="s984">If somebody wears a black...a black shirt, that means you are communist.</span> <span id="s985">They send them right away to the camp.</span> <span id="s986">Even in 1940 and 1939.</span> <span id="s987">That was a symbol they say.</span> <span id="s988">If you wore a black, that means you are a communist.</span> <span id="s989">All kind of things.</span> <span id="s990">It's horrible.</span> <span id="s991">I don't know even...even a person could survive those...those... It shows you.</span> <span id="s992">When I got to the doctor and I sometime and tell him...he was a survivor too, but he was hidden in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s993">I said, "Listen, now with the medicine.</span> <span id="s994">Would a doctor believe I was laying with typhus without medicine, not even a little bit of ice to put in the head which I have the highest temperature...and a little bit cold water.</span> <span id="s995">We was laying on the floor and people was dying like crazy, and if you tell them, would they believed it?</span> <span id="s996">I was beaten up in the camps with a gun and blood was running.</span> <span id="s997">We didn't have a mirror.</span> <span id="s998">We didn't know how we looked.</span> <span id="s999">If I come home...If I came back to the block and the girls said, "Look you got so many holes in your head.</span> <span id="s1000">So what...what...you know what the medicine was?</span> <span id="s1001">We urine and we put in the head and we cleared it up.</span> <span id="s1002">That was our medicine.</span> <span id="s1003">It was always beaten up at work.</span> <span id="s1004">Anybody.</span> <span id="s1005">That was their pleasure, you know.</span> <span id="s1006">That was their pleasure.</span> <span id="s1007">That was their satisfaction to beat up anybody.</span> <span id="s1008">And I didn't know that I was bleeding.</span> <span id="s1009">I didn't know what's going on.</span> <span id="s1010">I know I was beaten and I felt it, but I didn't know how I looked.</span> <span id="s1011">Nobody know how they looked.</span> <span id="s1012">They told me, "Listen, take a little bit urine.</span> <span id="s1013">Wash it on the blood because ” .</span> <span id="s1014">We was always beaten up by the Germans.</span> <span id="s1015">Always.</span> <span id="s1016">The look ” worse than animals.</span> <span id="s1017">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1018">We came back from work, you saw people laying dead.</span> <span id="s1019">We had to bring in dead from the...from the camp...from the work.</span> <span id="s1020">You know, like put on a stick.</span> <span id="s1021">Two carry here and one carry here and we had to run.</span> <span id="s1022">The dogs was after us.</span> <span id="s1023">And we put them by their block, because they had to be counted.</span> <span id="s1024">How many die a day.</span> <span id="s1025">Half of them die walking.</span> <span id="s1026">Everybody was afraid to say they're sick you know.</span> <span id="s1027">So they was walking.</span> <span
