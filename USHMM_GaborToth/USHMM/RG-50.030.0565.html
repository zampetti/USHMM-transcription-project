id="s22">I was born in 1925, December the third.</span> <span id="s23">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: And your parents’ names?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: My parents’ names, my father was Smolnoma(ph) Samuel, they called him in – was a religious person.</span> <span id="s26">He was a bookbinder in Novogrudok.</span> <span id="s27">My grandfather was a bookbinder.</span> <span id="s28">And my mother’s name was Shill – Tsil(ph) Amanda Levitch(ph).</span> <span id="s29">And she was born in – not far from Stankievicz, in a village.</span> <span id="s30">In Stankievicz, my family, meaning the Bielski brothers, who were my first cousins, they were born also in Stankievicz.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: So, how were you related to the Bielskis, your –</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: My mother and their mother were sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Ah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: And they used to come to our house very often.</span> <span id="s35">It was about 14 miles from our house.</span> <span id="s36">They still lived in that village, Stankievicz.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: How did you get from one house to the other, were you – walk, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: Well, they – they would come by horse and wagon, or later on some of them were using a bicycle, but it was still 14 miles to go by bicycle, you know, when the children were younger, that’s how they used to come to my house.</span> <span id="s39">In vacation time, I went there.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Did you spend holidays together?</span> <span id="s41">Pesach, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Not really, because we were more on the religious side, and they grew up in the village.</span> <span id="s43">And you know, matzos were very expensive in those days.</span> <span id="s44">So, like, if they had their mother did the ma – the matzos were bought in Novogrudok, in my hometown, that’s where we baked the matzos.</span> <span id="s45">We didn’t get from the United States any matzos.</span> <span id="s46">Later on, yes, in Germany, but not in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: So?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: So, you know, they were not as religious as we were, meaning my father and mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Before we talk a little more about life before, can you just give me the names of your siblings [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: My two brothers, Israel, who was 18 years old, and my younger brother, who was 14, Aron.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: This is when the war broke out, that they’re 18 –</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Yes, 18 and 14, they tried to run away to the Bielskis.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: And they were, unfortunately, pointed out by Christians that they are Jews.</span> <span id="s55">Because they were waiting for us, we made up that we’ll meet them there, at the si – at some relatives house.</span> <span id="s56">And in those days, the family was very closely knitted.</span> <span id="s57">I mean, how we gonna run – they knew how to go there –</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: – without mother and father and sisters and brothers.</span> <span id="s60">So that’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: – how it took place, and they got killed.</span> <span id="s63">After the war, of course, my father and I buried them.</span> <span id="s64">They even threw our dog on them, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: We’ll come back to that, we would – a little before the war, a-and you had two sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: I had two si-sisters.</span> <span id="s67">One was 10, going on 11, but 10, and the other one was six years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s69">And let’s just hop – before we go into the war, a little bit more about life before.</span> <span id="s70">So it was a religious family, you went to a Beis Yaakov?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Yes, Beis Yaakov was, we had like an organization Beis Yaakov.</span> <span id="s72">It wasn’t like here, a Beis Yaakov school, because it was expensive.</span> <span id="s73">My – my brothers went to learn how to daven, so the preference was to pay for the brothers, because you had to pay for it, to go to chayder.</span> <span id="s74">And I went to learn how to daven in Beis Yaakov, meaning bassia(ph) was the organization.</span> <span id="s75">And I went – that’s where I met Itka and also the Kushnars(ph) mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: And you went to a public elementary school?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Yes, I went to Po-Polish.</span> <span id="s78">Polish –</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: With – and did you have any Polisher friends, or did the Jews stay on one side, and the Poles stay –</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Well, not really, because I – there were – in my class there were two Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s81">The people who had money send the-them to a chayder or a Hebrew school, there was a Tarbud.</span> <span id="s82">We couldn’t afford.</span> <span id="s83">My mother and father only send the boys to a chayder, and I went to public school.</span> <span id="s84">And then we were a little bit more comfortable financially, my sister Rivale, who was 10 years old, she went to a Hebrew school, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: And your father, as a bookbinder, was he binding secular books also, or just religious books?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Yeah, all the ones, all –</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: So he had Polish clienteles?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: Oh, my mother used to bring, because she was born in a – you know, in a village, and knew Polish to s – how to speak without an accent and so on.</span> <span id="s89">So she would go to the offices and get the books for my father to be bound, and I knew how to bind the book, because we had to help my father.</span> <span id="s90">Everything was done by hand, the sewing and everything of the books.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: I want to jump to after September 1939, the start of World War II.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: You, your village, Novogrudok was on the Soviet side.</span> <span id="s94">I want to ask you two questions, one is –</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Wasn’t a village.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Ah, town.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: No, it was a town that was like a – like here we have, you know, n-n-not as large as New York, of course, we have the states.</span> <span id="s98">This was like a state in their way of thinking, like New York state.</span> <span id="s99">So I lived in Novogrudok.</span> <span id="s100">The town itself wasn’t big, what – we had, about 5,000 Jews living there.</span> <span id="s101">And that’s why they had the Beis Yaakov and all the Hebrew schools and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: So I was wondering, in these years, ’39 to ’41, I wanted to ask you two questions.</span> <span id="s103">One is, were you aware of what was going on in the part of Poland, western Poland that was under German occupation?</span> <span id="s104">Did any information come through?</span> <span id="s105">And the other question is, did your life change at all under the Soviet Union?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: I personally think my life improved, because when Stalin was, when we – at that time Stalin was the leader of Russia, there was no anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s107">As a matter of fact, we liked it better to be under Russians than the Poles, because the Poles were anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s108">I never went back to Poland, even though my fath – my – my husband – show you the picture – was a – a lieutenant in the army during the war, and was injured.</span> <span id="s109">And the pension was coming to him, but I wasn’t going to go there with him and he didn't go by my – by himself.</span> <span id="s110">So that’s how I felt.</span> <span id="s111">And I’ll get to it why I felt this way.</span> <span id="s112">One wanted to help me and the other one said, here is a Jewish girl in the navy blue jacket.</span> <span id="s113">So, I threw off the jacket and I ran into a ditch, and I yo – survived.</span> <span id="s114">These few days there were very crucial.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s116">And when you were under the Soviet occupation, were you aware of what was going on in western Poland, or was that too far away?</span> <span id="s117">Was there any information leaking through?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: We – we somehow got an idea that the Germans are very bad to the Jews.</span> <span id="s119">But we didn’t think that they can take Russia, that part, back, you know?</span> <span id="s120">I personally was overjoyed, to be honest with you.</span> <span id="s121">I went to their school for one year, I learned Russian, and I got that coat that the other girls were trying on, everybody liked it.</span> <span id="s122">It was wartime, so the idea was oh, she looks so heroic, you know, in that coat, that you saw on my book.</span> <span id="s123">And I was a good student, and then we decided, my father and I, to leave Poland –</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: Do you – can you just –</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: – after a year, close to a year.</span> <span id="s126">A year.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s128">Can you describe day – June, 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: What happened the day the Germans invaded the Soviet Union and eastern Poland?</span> <span id="s131">Where were you when you found out that the Germans had crossed the border?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: I was in my house, I didn't run any place.</span> <span id="s133">And that was a tragic time, because we already got the idea what they are doing.</span> <span id="s134">So, they hoarded us – they – they gave us about five, six ma – months to live still in the house.</span> <span id="s135">I mean, there was nothing that they killed, and sort of did anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Did the German troops arrive in Novogrudok immediately, or were you ignored in the first month?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: Well, they arrived immediately, I would say, because I worked for the courthouse there, not as a – as a secretary, but I wa – we had to go and to get potatoes for them, see that they – they weren’t throw out the ones that weren’t good, the ones that were good, you know.</span> <span id="s138">And they let us there stay about six, seven months I would say, til December.</span> <span id="s139">[doorbell] Not expecting anyone.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Do you want me to pause this?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s142">[tape break]</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: We were talking a minute ago about the first days of the war when the Germans invaded in June ’41, and in your book you talk about how your family fled to the Bielski farm, and about how Tuvia and his brothers were already standing guard, which I thought was an amazing –</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: – scenario, because it gave a sense of what was gonna come.</span> <span id="s146">Can you describe that?</span> <span id="s147">A: Well, what happened was, this wasn’t yet that they didn't kill Jews at that time, they came and they invaded the part that I lived.</span> <span id="s148">And what happened was, their mother, and my mother, of course, they grew up amongst the Christian people.</span> <span id="s149">This was a village where they lived.</span> <span id="s150">And this was only two families, not far from one another, but lived two jeesh – Jewish families.</span> <span id="s151">So when we came there, just to run away from the bombs – as a matter of fact, our house was destroyed at that time by bombing, you know.</span> <span id="s152">They bombed Novogrudok.</span> <span id="s153">So we just went with the horse and wagon.</span> <span id="s154">My mother was born in the village, she knew how to sort of direct the horse and so on.</span> <span id="s155">So, when we came there, and we stayed in the barn, because they had a very small house, very small.</span> <span id="s156">There were 11 children – not at one time, but – and the house was very small, so we stayed in the barn.</span> <span id="s157">We lived – we slept in the barn.</span> <span id="s158">So when we went to sleep in the barn, my Aunt Bella, meaning my mother’s sister, said, you better stay on guard, and – a-at the barn where we were sleeping.</span> <span id="s159">She wasn’t afraid that the villagers will kill us, she was afraid that they’ll come and rob us at that time.</span> <span id="s160">Because we didn’t know about killing that much, that the ger – that there were German and Jew, was n-no human being.</span> <span id="s161">So, anyway, they – as, they said, we don’t have any guns, how we will protect ourselves?</span> <span id="s162">She said take those – I forgot what you – that you cut things?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: The scythes?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s165">That you cut the – the corn or the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: That’s a very sharp thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Oh, the scythe.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Yeah, and it’s like this and like this.</span> <span id="s170">And it’s a sharp one.</span> <span id="s171">And stand – change over and stand on guard at the house, and the barn.</span> <span id="s172">This was heroic on her part.</span> <span id="s173">I mean, a foresight, to do it –</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: – as a woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: And so which members of the family were standing guard that night?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: I – well, there were boys there, so it was either Asael or Zus or Tuvia.</span> <span id="s178">They were the older ones, because you know, I mean the oldest at that time.</span> <span id="s179">Avram, who already was in – the younger one, one was killed.</span> <span id="s180">He was grabbed at one time.</span> <span id="s181">Anyway, at that time on the – he wasn’t killed yet, you know, but he wasn't there because he was married and lived in Novogrudok.</span> <span id="s182">So anyway, that was my experience, to fight, you know, instilled.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: And then – and then – so that’s right from the beginning.</span> <span id="s184">And then you – after the bombing stopped, you –</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: Then we moved back, yeah, we went back.</span> <span id="s186">Our house was bombed out.</span> <span id="s187">We had certain valuables.</span> <span id="s188">We had the basement that had water, so my mother threw in the candlesticks and all those valuables, that – I almost – we weren't that comfortable financially, but certain valuables.</span> <span id="s189">And we went to live with our uncle.</span> <span id="s190">Our uncle came there too.</span> <span id="s191">There was an uncle, my mother’s brother, who lived in Novogrudok.</span> <span id="s192">He came at that time too, with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: And his name was?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Yoshke, yeah.</span> <span id="s195">Yoshke Milalevitch(ph), my mother’s maiden name.</span> <span id="s196">And we, after, of course, our house bo – house was bombed out, and this was a two family house, we – he invites us to live with them.</span> <span id="s197">So we lived there for a number of months, until the end of the year of 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: And then December ’41, I know this is a very –</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: Right.</span> <span id="s200">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: – painful day.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Och.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: But –</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: They were – he – we had to go to the courthouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: And how were you dressed when you went to the courthouse?</span> <span id="s206">Do you reme –</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: We were carrying everything we had, you know.</span> <span id="s208">Let me just think one moment, to sort of put my – according not to jump back from – it wasn’t like yesterday.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Right, none.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: It was in ’41.</span> <span id="s211">We took everything we could from the house and we were marching to that courthouse, everybody.</span> <span id="s212">And I was put in with Kagan(ph) at that time, since you know, Kagan(ph), in the same room.</span> <span id="s213">We were there in one room, maybe 10 - 15 people.</span> <span id="s214">More than that, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: And how long did they keep you in the courthouse?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: With us, it was in until December.</span> <span id="s217">December, the – the – I have it in my book when it was the date, I don’t remember offhand.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s219">But were you in that room for hours, for days?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: For a few days.</span> <span id="s221">I think two days to be exact.</span> <span id="s222">Two or one day, I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s223">But it’s in the book.</span> <span id="s224">And the book is, you know, correct, because I – I had to check it out with my [indecipherable] exactly.</span> <span id="s225">And they took us out in the courtyard, and they were – the army trucks were [indecipherable] and getting in the army trucks.</span> <span id="s226">Step in the army truck, step in the army truck.</span> <span id="s227">And that’s – we didn’t ac – they said they taking us to work, you know?</span> <span id="s228">And then I saw one of the girls, she was older than I, I was at that time more than 15 – 16 probably, not quite.</span> <span id="s229">So anyway – maybe 16, because my birthday’s December the third, so I must have been 16 in ’41.</span> <span id="s230">Yes.</span> <span id="s231">We can figure it out.</span> <span id="s232">If I made a mistake, you’ll forgive me.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: You’ll correct it.</span> <span id="s235">So, I see they’re taking everyone on the truck, and my little sister, who was almost 11 – 10 - 11, so she said, Ma, I want to live a little longer, let’s go to the back.</span> <span id="s236">Let’s go to the back.</span> <span id="s237">So we’re pushing ourselves to the back, because it was a – loads of people, you know, a whole town of people.</span> <span id="s238">They would take it on the army truck, and bring out more from the – from the courthouse.</span> <span id="s239">So anyway, we were pushing ourselves to the back.</span> <span id="s240">And just so happened, after a f-few minutes, it worked very – they were very well organized.</span> <span id="s241">You couldn’t lie down on the floor, they killed you on the floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Was the –</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: On the cart – in the courtyard.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: Was it just Germans who were doing this, or did they have local helpers, were there collaborators also?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: At that time only Germans.</span> <span id="s246">German army.</span> <span id="s247">Army people.</span> <span id="s248">So, anyway, I see a – that in a little while, like we were pushing ourselves in the back of the crowd.</span> <span id="s249">So I see a stabsleiter, Wolfmeyer(ph) was his name.</span> <span id="s250">I’ll never forget that.</span> <span id="s251">My father worked for him, and I worked in the garden.</span> <span id="s252">So I ran over to him with such a powerful – you know, a girl of 16, and grabbed him by the belt, because I figure they’re gonna kill me anyway.</span> <span id="s253">I figured – I knew they killing.</span> <span id="s254">So I grabbed him by the belt, by the – by the way, on the buckle of the belt was written, God is with us.</span> <span id="s255">You know?</span> <span id="s256">That’s how much God was with them.</span> <span id="s257">So I said, my father’s the only bookbinder in [indecipherable] I didn’t know any German.</span> <span id="s258">You’ll need in – him.</span> <span id="s259">And I worked in your garden.</span> <span id="s260">Yeah, wir brauchen haben.</span> <span id="s261">Brauchen haben?</span> <span id="s262">So I started screaming, Ma!</span> <span id="s263">Ro – and the people who were standing closer to me were saying, say that I’m your mother.</span> <span id="s264">You want to save your own.</span> <span id="s265">Ma!</span> <span id="s266">Riva was on – my sister’s name, Miriam, we’re saved.</span> <span id="s267">They couldn’t hear us because it was maybe over a thousand people.</span> <span id="s268">Maybe in front of them was maybe a few hundred, you know, because it’s a very, very large courthouse – court –</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Was a courtyard?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: Courtyard.</span> <span id="s271">As a matter of fact, I have to mention it, because it’s there already, that’s what Kagan(ph) told me, he built a museum there on the courtyard.</span> <span id="s272">And he, of course, has my information because he wanted to put in there.</span> <span id="s273">So anyway, not the information I’m giving you.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: It’s different.</span> <span id="s276">So yes, he gave us two Germans – one German to take us to the living – back to the 700 that at that time survived.</span> <span id="s277">And I started kissing the German, I said, I’m telling you the truth, my mother and my two sisters are here.</span> <span id="s278">And I – I threw myself on this German, a young soldier.</span> <span id="s279">So another German rans – runs over, rassen sünde [speaks German].</span> <span id="s280">You’re gonna be killed like a Jew.</span> <span id="s281">Because he let me do it.</span> <span id="s282">And of course he took us to the living.</span> <span id="s283">He say – he apologized in German, I didn’t know German.</span> <span id="s284">Cause I really was on top of him, grabbing him and telling him, here, I’ll show you the truth, you know.</span> <span id="s285">I was a child.</span> <span id="s286">So he took us out to the living, and Kagan(ph) knows about it, because in that – there are – make the copy, he knows he was there, we were in the same room.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: So, it was you and your father –</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: And that’s it.</span> <span id="s289">My – my little chil – little children, they were little children with my mother, were pushed on the – on the army truck to be killed, and they were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: And your brothers had already tried to run away before this.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: Yeah, right, and they were killed.</span> <span id="s292">But my mother just so happened, knew, because you know, one of the White Russian nis – policeman said, your two – two boys were killed this morning, you know.</span> <span id="s293">And she knew, but she knew that her – and you take it the way it is.</span> <span id="s294">She suffered a great deal.</span> <span id="s295">So that’s how I basically sur – not – yeah, basically.</span> <span id="s296">But then, I could have been killed again.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s298">So after the selection, there’s this small ghetto, and you’re there with your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: And what sort of work were you doing in this ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: Oh, my father was still working outside of town, in the army barracks there.</span> <span id="s302">And I was working for a Polish engineer who worked for the Germans.</span> <span id="s303">He was building roads for them.</span> <span id="s304">I was working about seven months for him.</span> <span id="s305">And then they forbade Jewish girls –</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: This was Mr. Foltanski?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: So you prepared the list.</span> <span id="s308">Yes, Mr. Foltanski.</span> <span id="s309">Mrs. and Mr. Foltanski.</span> <span id="s310">I cooked for them, and I – I do the – I – I did – I’m sorry, see.</span> <span id="s311">I did everything I was told.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: And what – can you describe what sort of people they were.</span> <span id="s313">I mean, you write about it very beautifully in the book, but can you talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: Yes, they were very nice to me.</span> <span id="s315">If not for them I wouldn’t survive at that time.</span> <span id="s316">And my – of course – and my schoolteacher that I met after the war again.</span> <span id="s317">So, of – I worked for them just like a slave.</span> <span id="s318">And I learned how to do the wash by hand, and I’m gesturing, that’s how we used to rub it on that thing.</span> <span id="s319">And helped to cook and helped to serve and clean up and tha – they lived in a Jewish, beautiful apartment, a spacious apartment, because this was a Jewish house, and they got it because he worked for the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Had your family known him before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: Nobody knew him.</span> <span id="s322">We were a few girls that sent from the ghetto, and he select me, you know, we were [indecipherable] my girlfriend was there and myself and another girl.</span> <span id="s323">And he said, well, you will remain, you know.</span> <span id="s324">He interviewed me, interviewed them.</span> <span id="s325">Interview was based on what family you come.</span> <span id="s326">They were from richer families, so they figured probably – he was engineer and in – an educated person, he figured from the richer family they must have had maids.</span> <span id="s327">And I told him my father was a bookbinder, and I worked to help my father, and what I told you.</span> <span id="s328">So he said, Esia, so that’s how I got to work for them, about seven months.</span> <span id="s329">And then they forbade Jewish girls to work in Germans’ houses.</span> <span id="s330">You know, they felt that they – they might weaken and save those people, not only girls, men too.</span> <span id="s331">Stop working in the – he was engineer and the – the people that worked for the Germans.</span> <span id="s332">He build roads for them, they should be able to go through.</span> <span id="s333">So anyway – and I always had in my mind, I hope there will be a day that I’ll be able to help them, because, you know, that I’ll survive.</span> <span id="s334">But at that time, there was no – I – no way that I’ll survive.</span> <span id="s335">So, I was in the ghe – no, I have to backtrack.</span> <span id="s336">I – they said to me, the Foltanskis, whenever you hear that they killing Jews in the ghetto, come running to us and we’ll try to help you.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: How hard was it to get from the ghetto – outside the ghetto?</span> <span id="s338">Was it a wire, or was it an open ghetto?</span> <span id="s339">How were you able to leave –</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: It was wires all around.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: So to get from the ghetto to their house, you went through a gate, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: The gate, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s343">That was legal, I go – I’m going to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: And work we – we weren’t allowed to walk on the sidewalk; the middle of the street.</span> <span id="s346">And nothing is exaggerated here, take my word for it.</span> <span id="s347">So, just painful to talk about it.</span> <span id="s348">So they said that I should come running to them.</span> <span id="s349">And I worked on that particular day out of town, also in the army – they had for the army, special place to work, where they stayed.</span> <span id="s350">The army people, the German army.</span> <span id="s351">So, I had to clean there, the – the – you know, the cabins, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s352">And, like he gave me the leeway, come running to us and we will save you.</span> <span id="s353">So, I un – I heard, somebody said that there will be a shreeta(ph), which means they will kill the Jews –</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Massacre.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: – you know, it’s a shreeta(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: About what month was that?</span> <span id="s357">Was this the – I know there was an action – akcja in th – August.</span> <span id="s358">Was this the summer akcja or the winter one?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: It was – it wa – must have been in August.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Because, when I’ll tell you more, it – I think it’s going to August.</span> <span id="s362">So I come, I – I take off my jacket with the Star of David that I had on both sides, on the back and the front, and I come running to their house.</span> <span id="s363">And she, Miss Foltanski puts on her coat on me.</span> <span id="s364">Oh, you don’t look Jewish, she said.</span> <span id="s365">Don’t worry, you will survive the – you know.</span> <span id="s366">And I started to cry.</span> <span id="s367">I said, my father’s probably killed, I have no one.</span> <span id="s368">I mean, what’s the surviving?</span> <span id="s369">And he had a gun on his desk.</span> <span id="s370">He said, I can kill you, nobody will do anything to me, I can kill you here, if you want to run to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s371">I said, I’m gonna go to ghetto, and I’ll see if my father survived.</span> <span id="s372">So, he said, I can kill you here, it’s just the same.</span> <span id="s373">And nobody would do a thing to him.</span> <span id="s374">A Jewish girl came bothering me?</span> <span id="s375">You know?</span> <span id="s376">So, anyway, she gave me, and I simmered down for life.</span> <span id="s377">So I – I put on her coat, and she gave me some confidence by saying you don’t look Jewish and this and that.</span> <span id="s378">And there was a field, and a ditch in the field.</span> <span id="s379">So, she said, go there, and I’ll bring you tomorrow some food.</span> <span id="s380">So I went there.</span> <span id="s381">She knew – she pointed where the part is, and you know, there were corn that were camouflaging me, and there was a – a little di – ditch – ditch, you call it a ditch.</span> <span id="s382">So I lied in that ditch, and I was saying the Sh’ma, because I knew the meaning of the Sh’ma.</span> <span id="s383">I have it in the book in English, a few words, hear oh God.</span> <span id="s384">And I said Sh’ma a whole night, until I fell asleep.</span> <span id="s385">The next day she brings me some food, Mrs. Foltanski.</span> <span id="s386">And she throws it in a beautiful wide circle, never forget [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s387">And she puts the best food there.</span> <span id="s388">The best was a salami, you know.</span> <span id="s389">You didn’t even ask if it was kosher then.</span> <span id="s390">A salami, and some other food, I don’t recall exactly, but I remember the salami because she slice it up, you know?</span> <span id="s391">So, I did – of course I was hungry, I start eating, I ate.</span> <span id="s392">And I – I was very thirsty.</span> <span id="s393">She forgot to give the sa – me some water, you know?</span> <span id="s394">She meant well, because she could have gotten killed.</span> <span id="s395">She threw it and she disappeared.</span> <span id="s396">So I ate this, and then the other day, I figured, I must go to the pump.</span> <span id="s397">We didn't have like a – to get water, or – closer.</span> <span id="s398">So, I had to cross a street, and cross a few houses – I mean, pass by a few houses and get a drink of water.</span> <span id="s399">So I – I went there – I mean, I was going to cross the street to get from the pump some water.</span> <span id="s400">So of course, I couldn’t because one of the people that I walked by, one of the neighbors, I said, can I get a f – a little bit of water from you?</span> <span id="s401">And so she sends a policeman to – she said, oh, a Jewish girl just went.</span> <span id="s402">So I ran back to that ditch, and he was yelling, we’ll kill you anyway, we’ll find you.</span> <span id="s403">So – we know, she said in a – in a navy blue coat.</span> <span id="s404">So I threw out the coat, because I heard her.</span> <span id="s405">Wasn’t a long coat, a short coat.</span> <span id="s406">And I put – run into that ditch.</span> <span id="s407">So they started shooting, they didn't – there was corn, high corn, they didn’t see the ditch.</span> <span id="s408">So I survived that night, and then I went the next morning – no, I didn’t go to the pump the next morning, because I knew that she is gonna – but again, I figured, I have to take a drink of water before I get killed.</span> <span id="s409">The idea was to go.</span> <span id="s410">I get up and I see my teacher cutting the corn, Fiedrowiczowa, I remember her name.</span> <span id="s411">So, I said, Pani Fiedrowiczowa, in Polish.</span> <span id="s412">I am very thirsty.</span> <span id="s413">Can you bring me some water?</span> <span id="s414">Oh, I’ll bring you some water.</span> <span id="s415">Don’t go too far.</span> <span id="s416">Bring me – so she brought me some water.</span> <span id="s417">And the next – so I drank, drank the water.</span> <span id="s418">And then the next day was Sunday.</span> <span id="s419">This was Friday – I mean Saturday, and the next day was Sunday.</span> <span id="s420">So I said, well, it’s after the action, they called it an action.</span> <span id="s421">I’ll go to my neighbors’ house, who were Christians, and they were nice people, I said, and they will help me out to get to the ghetto and see if my father is alive.</span> <span id="s422">Because I still felt, why survive, I’ll be killed anyway, you know, even though at 16, I felt this way because I was suffering my little girls – little girls, my little sister, the other sister, they were questioning it and they got killed.</span> <span id="s423">So what am I so special, you know?</span> <span id="s424">So then they – that was Sunday morning, and I said th – to the teacher, to Pani Fiedrowiczowa, I said, I’m going to go to that neighbor.</span> <span id="s425">I’m a little repetitious, but forgive me because I can’t think straight when I think about it.</span> <span id="s426">So she said, no, you can’t go.</span> <span id="s427">I said, why not?</span> <span id="s428">So, she said, it’s Sunday, you’re not dressed right, you cannot go to your neighbor.</span> <span id="s429">You’ll go tomorrow, Monday.</span> <span id="s430">So I figured, she means well.</span> <span id="s431">So, of course I didn’t go.</span> <span id="s432">And Monday morning she brought me eggs, and – and water to drink, and she was very, very nice.</span> <span id="s433">So Monday morning, I went to my neighbor.</span> <span id="s434">And my neighbor was next to my uncle’s house, you know.</span> <span id="s435">My uncle got killed, they all got killed.</span> <span id="s436">So I said to her – I knew that he – she has – they were villagers, but they were police, that she’s not gonna send me a policeman that’ll take me to the Germans.</span> <span id="s437">I somehow have the confidence in her as a neighbor.</span> <span id="s438">And sure enough, the confidence was right.</span> <span id="s439">But the police said – two policemen she has ha – she had, from the village, said to me, well, you’re alone?</span> <span id="s440">I said no, I have my father.</span> <span id="s441">I didn’t know if he survived.</span> <span id="s442">We need 200 rubles for this, to take me to the ghetto, because in a way, they are taking a chance.</span> <span id="s443">So yeah, my father’s alive, he’ll gi-give you the money.</span> <span id="s444">My father didn’t have any money, but they took me to the ghetto through the entrance, and they said that the Germans said that they should take me to the ghetto, I still can work and so on.</span> <span id="s445">So – and then my father, luckily, survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: So what was your reaction when you saw your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Oh, I was so happy.</span> <span id="s448">I was praying to God all the time that he should be alive.</span> <span id="s449">So, anyway, he didn't have any money, so he went out.</span> <span id="s450">I said, you must get the money for hi – the – he went out, he was a very honest man and in a small town you know each other.</span> <span id="s451">So he borrowed some money from a few people and he paid them off, the police.</span> <span id="s452">So they left me there, with – of course in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s453">There was still about 200 people or thereabout, because they separated later, and oh, it’s a long s –</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: So, how long did you then remain in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: I don’t want to make any mistakes, so I’m thinking.</span> <span id="s456">I remained in the ghetto, I guess for – well, I was seven months – not for – for a short period of time.</span> <span id="s457">Because there was my girlfriend’s father, who was also from a village, and I found out that they are going go to the Bielskis.</span> <span id="s458">And my father didn’t want to leave the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: And at the time – so, let’s talk about now the escape from the ghetto and going to the Bielskis.</span> <span id="s460">Did you realize that your cousins were forming a partisan group, or did you just say, I want to get out of the ghetto and go to the woods?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: No, no, no, no, nobody knew it.</span> <span id="s462">When I went there, there were over 20 people there.</span> <span id="s463">And there was already from the other family, from the other villages, they came, they joined them, that –</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: So I know there was a –</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: [indecipherable] the one that’s in the picture, she came from –</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: You talk that there was a big of a te – a tension about whether it was safer to stay or safer to escape.</span> <span id="s467">Can you talk about that tension, about deciding whether or not to remain in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: Well, we were afraid, I was afraid they’ll kill us on the road like they killed my brothers, you know.</span> <span id="s469">They’ll recognize it.</span> <span id="s470">But then I thought it over.</span> <span id="s471">I thought it over that this man, Gutel(ph) Gutel(ph) Birkowski(ph), he lived i – also was born in one of the villages there, and he knew his way how to go.</span> <span id="s472">And then it was a – we had already one trusted Gentile, Kozlowski(ph), that already tried to get, because Tuvia wanted as mu – many Jews from the ghetto as he could get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: So, who – describe this – you say that it was December that you left the ghetto, how did you manage to sneak out of the ghetto, how did you go, what path, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: We went at night, and this Gutel(ph) and his wife and his sister-in-law, these were the four people, right, including me.</span> <span id="s475">So, he broke – he took a tool and he broke the part of the fence, and we crawl over.</span> <span id="s476">And like, he know my father didn’t join me then.</span> <span id="s477">He didn't want to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: How long a walk was it to get from the ghetto to the woods?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: Oh, 15 miles, 15 miles, but he n – we went through the woods.</span> <span id="s480">There were woods, you know, it wasn’t like a – you know, streets here, and even the Pelham Parkway, you know, you see woods too, from the side.</span> <span id="s481">So we went through those woods, just to give you an example.</span> <span id="s482">And we came to this Kozlowski(ph), who was a person who we trusted, he knew where he is and so on, and then the Bielskis came and picked us up from there, or they send someone, you know, from the partisans, I don’t recall exactly if they ca-came or they sent someone.</span> <span id="s483">And we went to the woods where they had their base.</span> <span id="s484">And we were only 25 people including us then.</span> <span id="s485">And there was no – I mean, nobody had an idea that we’ll have a group and we’ll have a partisans and this and that.</span> <span id="s486">We were just going into the woods, not to be killed.</span> <span id="s487">So this was at that time, the idea, that they knew the woods like, you know, like I know how to go to Pelham Parkway, you know, to the parkway there.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: So, in the initial stage, when there was just the group of 25, what was your job in the woods?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: Well, cooking.</span> <span id="s490">Cooking and standing.</span> <span id="s491">After that I didn’t get any – specially help to cook, because I didn’t have any arms, nothing.</span> <span id="s492">And trying to get my uncle, who is still alive and his family was intact, from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s493">But there were tremendous opposition, because this was a Miriam there, my little cousin, who was only five years old.</span> <span id="s494">So they figured we change places at night, and during the day, she’s going to cry and so on.</span> <span id="s495">They didn’t – they – they were fighting – not fighting, you know, physically.</span> <span id="s496">But Tuvia, how can you bring a five year old girl here?</span> <span id="s497">And the other cousins of mine, my – I have to backtrack.</span> <span id="s498">My uncle was a machinist.</span> <span id="s499">He used to repair things is – in Novogrudok, like machines and all.</span> <span id="s500">He was very – a machinist I would call it, I don’t know how to say it, was that he would fix bicycles, and he would fix machines, sewing machines and typewriters, you know.</span> <span id="s501">He – that was his job in Novogrudok.</span> <span id="s502">He had already the offices [indecipherable] practice and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s503">So anyway, I said, well, he’s – going on – he’s still young.</span> <span id="s504">He was young, about 40 ad – odd years old, my uncle, maybe younger.</span> <span id="s505">My uncle and aunt and their three children.</span> <span id="s506">And I was really throwing myself on the floor, I have no family, you know, only my si – yeah, I had tro – I have to backtrack about my father, he didn't want to come out.</span> <span id="s507">He said, what are you bringing me there, they should kill me like a dog and leave me in the woods?</span> <span id="s508">No – no Jewish burial, you know.</span> <span id="s509">It was a – a tragedy just to – to be there, to him.</span> <span id="s510">But at one time, I have it in my book, I had to write a letter to him, a threatening letter, that I’m not going to be your daughter any more if you don’t come out.</span> <span id="s511">So he came out.</span> <span id="s512">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: And the cou –</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: – then I – tha-that was before my uncle.</span> <span id="s515">See, I skipped that part with my father.</span> <span id="s516">Anyway, and then Tuvia made a decision, yes, we need him.</span> <span id="s517">And he helped me out.</span> <span id="s518">I kissed him, I hugged him, cause I wanted to save them.</span> <span id="s519">He was in – see, we had two ghettos in Novogrudok later on.</span> <span id="s520">They divided – there was like a working camp.</span> <span id="s521">Not like, because if you read about Novogrudok, and there are a number of people, about 80, who went through a tunnel to the Bielskis later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: And was your father part of the group of 80, or he came earlier?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: Part of the group of who?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: Part of the group that tunneled out of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: No, no, no, he came much earlier.</span> <span id="s526">He came maybe a ma – not even a month after I left, because it was – I wrote him a letter that I don’t want to know him, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: So, describe what it was like – life was like in the otriad.</span> <span id="s528">You’re in the forest.</span> <span id="s529">Was there the sense of constant fear that you had in the ghetto, or were you able to relax at all, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: Was a different fear, you know?</span> <span id="s531">There was the fear you’re gonna get killed, you’re Jewish, there’s no two ways about it.</span> <span id="s532">In the woods, if the – the villagers would say, well, we saw – they’re a Jewish group, you know.</span> <span id="s533">Because how would the Germans know that we were like in a jungle – later on we were like in a jungle-like woods.</span> <span id="s534">But at first the woods, they all knew the woods.</span> <span id="s535">Like in Stankievicz they were surrounded by woods, where my uncle and aunt lived.</span> <span id="s536">We weren’t far from that place, because they knew the woods there, very well.</span> <span id="s537">I mean the Bielskis.</span> <span id="s538">So we knew it’s safer than to be any other place, and that’s what they knew at that time.</span> <span id="s539">And then, of course, they found us out, and we had to run in more dense woods, and that’s when we ran away to the Nalibocka Pushcha, it was called in Polish, which was a jungle-like woods, very dense woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: So what wou –</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: Not far we could – from Minsk, not far from that part.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Can you sort of describe the community, what it was like, what Tuvia was like, this leader, the governance, what people did for –</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Later on?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: The development, how he developed as a leader, what were – your impression was.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: My impression, I was very impressed with them.</span> <span id="s546">As – the movie shows a little different.</span> <span id="s547">Did you see the movie, “Defiance?”</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: Never happened that they fought.</span> <span id="s550">I never saw it.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: So Zus and Tuvia stayed together?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Oh, well maybe they had disagreements at times, but not fighting like they – because what was he fighting?</span> <span id="s553">He didn't want any more – I mean, the idea was that Zus didn't want any more people out, even though his grandchild says differently.</span> <span id="s554">He was against it, for take out the people.</span> <span id="s555">That’s – this they show in the movie, and this was true, because there were money – many people, like women that couldn’t go on missions.</span> <span id="s556">Well, the men had to bring the food, and this was right, what he did, like in the movie that they show.</span> <span id="s557">Because they were rebelling, the men.</span> <span id="s558">And it was called the boyfriend in Russian, different name.</span> <span id="s559">And of course, you go and you risk your life to get from the – from the villagers, the food.</span> <span id="s560">Although they had – what should I say?</span> <span id="s561">Tuvia said, don’t take any cows from any villagers that have only one cow.</span> <span id="s562">You have to, you know, you have to use judgment.</span> <span id="s563">But still, they went there, and they risked their lives to get it, so they want it for their girlfriends, it was a business with girlfriends.</span> <span id="s564">I didn’t have a boyfriend, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: What was it li – is it – we were talking about –</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: I was a Beis Yaakov girl at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: So talk about the – what was going on with the women.</span> <span id="s568">Were women treated very differently than men?</span> <span id="s569">I know that you were one of the only women with a gun.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: How –</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: And Itka.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: And Itka.</span> <span id="s574">So just co –</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: Later it ca-came to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Yeah, describe what it was like as a female partisan as opposed to just a member of the group.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: Well, females had to stand on – on guard, too, you know, they taught us how to do things.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Who taught you how to shoot?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Oh, there was a – an army man, abramov – Abramowicz(ph) – abramov – and that was yesterday, I forget.</span> <span id="s580">Abramowicz(ph), I think.</span> <span id="s581">Bramowski(ph), Abramowicz(ph).</span> <span id="s582">He wasn't teaching only me, he was teaching the young men too.</span> <span id="s583">I was the only girl at that time.</span> <span id="s584">And Itka came from a – a Russian group, so she learned there.</span> <span id="s585">Russian Jewish, I don’t know, from Russian group, she came later.</span> <span id="s586">So, but he taught us.</span> <span id="s587">Abramowicz(ph) was his name, and he was taught in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: Did anybod – any of the men object to the fact that you had a gun?</span> <span id="s589">Did they feel it was being wasted on a woman, when you obtain a weapon?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: No, I didn’t get from Tuvia the gun, or from anyone.</span> <span id="s591">My uncle later on gave me, put together from – he proved himself a very important person, my uncle, so go figure out, they didn’t want him.</span> <span id="s592">He was a mechanic in th – he wa – all the Russian partisans will bring their guns, and – and what do you call the other rifles, I forget.</span> <span id="s593">More than a rifle – the heavy gun.</span> <span id="s594">He knew how to fix the guns.</span> <span id="s595">So in his mind, as a thank you, and I always wanted to be – to go and to – to take nekoma.</span> <span id="s596">That was in my mind, I was –</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: Revenge.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: – it was engraved, revenge.</span> <span id="s599">So anyway, whenever he would fix for the Russians their rifles, and sometimes he would – like they would bring two, three li – rifles to be fixed, and he would say, well, this one cannot be fixed.</span> <span id="s600">So he would save some of the – as a thank you to me, because he knew how I felt about the rifle, he would save a part and put it together.</span> <span id="s601">At first I didn't have a rifle.</span> <span id="s602">I had a rifle, yes, but it was like cut off, like the people who go and – and they just want to rob you, they come with certain rifles that are shorter.</span> <span id="s603">But then he got me a Polish rifle, Polish, an army rifle.</span> <span id="s604">Put together for me later on a gun.</span> <span id="s605">So that’s how I got my rifle, from my uncle.</span> <span id="s606">Because your – that was a very intelligent question.</span> <span id="s607">The preference was to give it to the men, they should have a rifle, a rifle was like gold.</span> <span id="s608">So this is – excuse me.</span> <span id="s609">Oh.</span> <span id="s610">You know what I need?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: Should we pause.</span> <span id="s612">[tape break] So, I’m wondering if you can describe what – a little bit more of how the otriad functioned as a community.</span> <span id="s613">Did you have the sense that it was a town, a-among itself, or is that the glorified version of the Bielskis?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: Glorified.</span> <span id="s615">Some of it later, yes.</span> <span id="s616">But – yes, I’ll gi – I have you – you know, if I wouldn’t get this stupid headache, I’m gonna just take an aspirin in a little bit.</span> <span id="s617">Then – you know, because that gloried part – not glorified, we had this, but not to the extent, the way.</span> <span id="s618">It was organized in a nice way.</span> <span id="s619">You call it glorified, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Like was there a – s-social activities in the woods?</span> <span id="s621">Were –</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Well, men and women were together without marriages.</span> <span id="s623">My father did one marriage.</span> <span id="s624">[indecipherable] you know [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s625">And that was one couple.</span> <span id="s626">And this in the movie, it was different.</span> <span id="s627">I am – calmed it down a little bit, because if you would see it at first – toned it down, I should say, through channels.</span> <span id="s628">It was a girl with a white dr – dress, and with this part on their head and everything.</span> <span id="s629">I said, why did you do it?</span> <span id="s630">We didn’t have it.</span> <span id="s631">I – I got very angry that they are glorifying it.</span> <span id="s632">And then the main part that got me from the movie was that I suffered, because I reminded myself, when they went through the water.</span> <span id="s633">That really killed me while I was watching it.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: So dis –</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: Because they had my [indecipherable] I’m gesturing, in my bra, and they all got [indecipherable] from my hometown, from my mother, from my sisters, brothers and so on.</span> <span id="s636">And we went up to here in water.</span> <span id="s637">You know, it wasn’t exaggerated, I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: A-And this is where – the part that I thought that we’re gonna drown.</span> <span id="s640">We survived, God was with us, it seems.</span> <span id="s641">And when we went out from the water, there was, you know, a coal, that coal, meaning that they war – you can – from woods, coal.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Charcoal?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: No, that the Germans were sort of making a fire.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: So they – the parts were still hot there, when we went out through the water.</span> <span id="s646">They would have killed us.</span> <span id="s647">It just so happened – cause it was regular army, they killed a few people.</span> <span id="s648">In my book, my girlfriend’s mother was killed.</span> <span id="s649">And we were running back and forth on this [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s650">But, what happened was, we had a man that knew the woods very well there, where we were going through the water.</span> <span id="s651">How would we know that that’s a safe place?</span> <span id="s652">Tuvia didn’t know that there is a safe place there.</span> <span id="s653">One of the men who was working before the war, you know, to get woods, to – to build the houses, we had wooden houses in Novogrudok.</span> <span id="s654">As a matter of fact, my mother and father, we had a wooden house.</span> <span id="s655">We didn’t have made out of brick, the house.</span> <span id="s656">So the wood had to come from the woods, and these jungle-like woods, that person worked there.</span> <span id="s657">And he knew the way with – to go through water.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: How long were you actually in the water?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: Well, I would say, two days.</span> <span id="s660">Overnight, sort of.</span> <span id="s661">Not for long we were going.</span> <span id="s662">And of course we – there was no food in this.</span> <span id="s663">And, you know, there are a lot of details that you can’t – partially, I forgot already, but I do remember this distinctly, because when my grandson and myself were sitting and watching the movie, he saw how I felt when the water part came.</span> <span id="s664">And then the director of the movie called me, what do you think, Mrs. Shor?</span> <span id="s665">Because he asks me.</span> <span id="s666">So, my grandson said, Grandma, don’t go now.</span> <span id="s667">You are not at the state of mind to – because I was crying all the time that p – when that part came.</span> <span id="s668">It was so real to me, you know?</span> <span id="s669">So, I didn’t go to the director at that time.</span> <span id="s670">He interviewed me, but I didn’t go the director.</span> <span id="s671">I am very surprised I didn't stay in the movie that long.</span> <span id="s672">I feel that – well, who am I?</span> <span id="s673">I should have been longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: Let me ask about another [indecipherable] in your book, you talk about having gone on one raid with some Soviet soldiers, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Oh, that was –</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: Can you describe that?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: That was brutal.</span> <span id="s678">That was brutal.</span> <span id="s679">In just the way it’s in the book, what can I tell you?</span> <span id="s680">I didn’t exaggerate anything.</span> <span id="s681">That was brutal.</span> <span id="s682">Because there is a part that I – I don’t have a good sense of direction even now.</span> <span id="s683">So, I figured, oh my God, I’ll be killed like a dog and thrown in there.</span> <span id="s684">But God was with me.</span> <span id="s685">I believe very much.</span> <span id="s686">I was – I’m not as religious as I should be, but God was with me that time.</span> <span id="s687">If he could show me the way back to the villager, and I should say that I have a gun, which I didn’t, you know, and scare him to take me to the Niemen, to that river, that was heroic, because they ask for a drink of water, and they dra – dry [indecipherable] they – they – yeah, I mean, drive their horses – horse and wagon away.</span> <span id="s688">And I didn’t see them when I came out.</span> <span id="s689">And I wanted to help them.</span> <span id="s690">And I was brought up that you don’t go to bed with anyone.</span> <span id="s691">And this was the commander that wanted me.</span> <span id="s692">A young girl was – you know, sex, and that’s part of it.</span> <span id="s693">That was brutal.</span> <span id="s694">To leave a girl, that I went with them, and I watched their sick person, you know?</span> <span id="s695">I went with them because I wanted to revenge, to go and under – because the idea was, they were challenging me.</span> <span id="s696">We – they were –</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: They being Soviet partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: Right.</span> <span id="s699">They were challenging me, they were the same house, and they said, oh, you have a gun, and a – now, that time I had only a rifle.</span> <span id="s700">You have a rifle, well, what do you do?</span> <span id="s701">Nothing.</span> <span id="s702">You don’t fight.</span> <span id="s703">Come with us and we’ll see what a fighter you are.</span> <span id="s704">So, in a way maybe I was lucky th – because they could have killed me.</span> <span id="s705">Because a man got sick, and I was so disappointed, and they left me with that partisan, to take care of him.</span> <span id="s706">It’s in the book, and I still remember it like it was yesterday.</span> <span id="s707">So, I was with him, and this might have been that that was meant for me.</span> <span id="s708">What would I do if they would kill me there?</span> <span id="s709">Nothing.</span> <span id="s710">Nobody would say a word.</span> <span id="s711">But, you know, I – I was challenged by them, that Jews don’t fight, and Jewish girls specially don’t fight.</span> <span id="s712">So that’s why I went.</span> <span id="s713">Why would I go with them?</span> <span id="s714">And I wanted to do something in revenge, what they did to my family and the rest of the Jews.</span> <span id="s715">So this was my experience with a – forgot, they were [indecipherable] I think.</span> <span id="s716">And then the man survived, that I took care of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: But by and large you stayed on the base, for the most part?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: I went a few times to get food, because otherwise they – they were saying, she has a rifle, she can – you know, I wanted also to – to go and do something.</span> <span id="s719">Because this was on my mind, the revenge business.</span> <span id="s720">And to help out.</span> <span id="s721">So I went a few times, just to get food.</span> <span id="s722">One of my friends even said that I went with them and so on, and he’s not here any more.</span> <span id="s723">You know, even if I would want to say well, here is a witness, there is not.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: And so when you went to get f – food, did you actually meet the farmers, or you just –</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: No.</span> <span id="s726">I stayed –</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: Got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: – outside.</span> <span id="s729">Yes, I stayed outside.</span> <span id="s730">I went with them.</span> <span id="s731">That was my group, I had the confidence to go with them.</span> <span id="s732">So, there were other things that were brutal too, but what are you gonna do?</span> <span id="s733">This is [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s734">I was telling them that at that time we had already a part that the Russians – soldiers were – he was the – Platon was the main leader there, his name, I still remember the name, because I was fighting with the Russian, I said, if you do something wrong to me, I’ll take you to Platon, I will tell him, that what – what you did, you know.</span> <span id="s735">I would take the telephone and tell them.</span> <span id="s736">But, it was a terrible experience.</span> <span id="s737">But later on – you know the story probably, later on [indecipherable] say that Tuvia made with him friends and so on, and they – they were – they took away the rifles, the Russian partisans from our boys, 10 boys at one point.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: What po – this is before liberation that they took the rifles away?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: Oh, way back, when we met Victor.</span> <span id="s740">I forg – trying to [indecipherable] can’t remember the second name, Victor was his name.</span> <span id="s741">So what happened was, Victor’s partisans and you know, where Victor came from – where they come from, the Russians?</span> <span id="s742">They came – they ran away from the – what is called when you are fighting, and you are in a – a group, the – a-as a soldier?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: What, the unit?</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: Not from the unit.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: The otriad?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: Not from the otriad.</span> <span id="s747">They ran away from the Germans that captured them.</span> <span id="s748">Anyway, Victor was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: Well – well, let me you – you – when we first started out the interview, you said that you actually had very fond memories of what life was like under the Soviets.</span> <span id="s750">Were you surprised by –</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: Oh, that was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: – the behavior of the Soviet partisans, having –</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: Oh, very much so.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: You expected them to be more sympathetic to Jews, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: Of course, of course.</span> <span id="s756">Many of them were, you know.</span> <span id="s757">But Tuvia had made up with them later on, because he came out very strong.</span> <span id="s758">He said, if you take away the rifles from our boys, they went to fight, or to get some food, it was part of our survival, those boys, 10 boys, took away their rifle.</span> <span id="s759">A rifle was like gold.</span> <span id="s760">Next time you’ll do it – he said, a bullet from a rifle shot from – in Jewish hands can kill just the same as yours.</span> <span id="s761">And that it was – he sort of was strong.</span> <span id="s762">Tuvia was very strong.</span> <span id="s763">So, with – then they shook hands and became friends, and so on.</span> <span id="s764">And we were friends.</span> <span id="s765">And then, of course, it’s a little more than that, too.</span> <span id="s766">A girl, a this, a that, you know.</span> <span id="s767">I don’t think you want this [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: So, if you’re to – in retrospect, what do you attribute the success of the Bielski group to?</span> <span id="s769">Why do you think they were able to accomplish what no other partisan groups, in terms of this large rescue, how do you think –</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: Well, there weren't Jewish groups like ours.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: They were always mixed, a few Jews in the Russian partisans, that’s where Itka was.</span> <span id="s773">Well, he was a strong leader.</span> <span id="s774">They were army people.</span> <span id="s775">Tuvia went to the army, Asael went to the army, and Zus went into the army.</span> <span id="s776">Only Aron, the younger one – of course, he was younger than I, he lives in – he’s still alive, thank God, he lives in Florida, Aron.</span> <span id="s777">So this were the people who were army people themselves.</span> <span id="s778">And they – they didn’t ha – need training.</span> <span id="s779">And I got – not only I, I mentioned the name Abramowicz(ph), so – Abramowicz(ph) we called him.</span> <span id="s780">And he was teaching, not only Essie Shor, I was the only girl, but teaching the other men how to use the rifles that they got.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: And in terms of the organization of – the food organization, and the –</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: Distribution?</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: – house – of distribution, and the housing?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: I think that was done beautifully.</span> <span id="s785">Not thinking that because I’m a cousin.</span> <span id="s786">I have a social work degree, and I would put it in the way it has to be put it in, in a delicate way there, I would say something wrong.</span> <span id="s787">But no, there was – ther-there was only when – you know, in the movie that they killed that man, they were right, because he wanted only for the girlfriend, for th – him, because he went and he risked his life.</span> <span id="s788">The risking, yes, there is the life, but you came back to us, and this was your mission, to go and – and risk your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: Let me move then to ju – July 1944.</span> <span id="s790">How did you realize that your area had been liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: Oh, well, we had this [indecipherable] how did we realize?</span> <span id="s792">They – oh yeah, the Germans were retreating.</span> <span id="s793">As a matter of a – that’s when Itka and myself and the Russian partisans, we went together, but we couldn’t find the [indecipherable] it was a regular army.</span> <span id="s794">You know, army trained, German army trained people.</span> <span id="s795">So, the Russians said, we have to retreat.</span> <span id="s796">And we retreated, and we ran after [indecipherable] crossing bridges, you know, through water, back to the base.</span> <span id="s797">When I came on the base – before I came, and Itka, they killed my girlfriend’s mother, they killed the young boychik.</span> <span id="s798">They passed our base.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: The Germans passed the base?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: Yes, that’s how dangerous it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: And got into the – even to that bunker, to kill that woman.</span> <span id="s803">That’s how they felt.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: And this was just days before liberation, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: Days – days before rebala – though yeah – thi-this is just unimaginable.</span> <span id="s806">From one side the Germans were retreating, from the other sides the Russians, to liberate us.</span> <span id="s807">And when we – they weren’t – Tuvia said, we are partisans, in Russian, don’t kill us, you know?</span> <span id="s808">They saw people there.</span> <span id="s809">So that happened in one day.</span> <span id="s810">But that girlfriend’s mother was killed and 10 people – nine or 10.</span> <span id="s811">Nine, I think, I’m
