few.</span> <span id="s670">There’s the story going to ba – to – to Syria via – the trip with [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s671">On the trip that we went to with the Boyovich(ph) in the car, what happened – oh, this is –</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: Oh [indecipherable] A2: Absolutely – absolute – this is one.</span> <span id="s673">When – the story when he went –</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: Let me finish, le – let me – let me to tell the story, because I will forget it.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A2: No, I will tell it.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: N-No, no.</span> <span id="s677">You – you want to say the story?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A2: Yeah, because I remember it well.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: Oh we – okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A2: Yeah.</span> <span id="s681">Well –</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: While you were living in Antwerp?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A2: While we were living in Antwerp, okay.</span> <span id="s684">Fili – first of all, he gave concerts all over Europe.</span> <span id="s685">I mean, we were in – in Manchester, England, London –</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: Europe, South America, and America – A2: Moshe, please.</span> <span id="s687">If I talk, let me talk.</span> <span id="s688">We’re not jumping to South America, I’m talking about Europe now.</span> <span id="s689">Moshe likes to –</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: It’s okay, it’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A2: Yeah, okay.</span> <span id="s692">I said, Manchester, London, li – Liverpool, Glasgow – oh, Glasgow we have a story.</span> <span id="s693">I – I must tell a story with Glasgow because it’s – remember Mendelson, the story?</span> <span id="s694">Okay, I’ll come back.</span> <span id="s695">And, of course Amsterdam, Paris, everywhere, he gave concert.</span> <span id="s696">So, once we were invited to go to Zurich, Moshe was supposed to give a concert in Zurich, and wi – wanted – and when we lived in Europe, in Europe you used the train then, cause it’s a convenient.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: Right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A2: So, a friend of ours, a Mr. Boyovich(ph) came and said, I heard you’re going to Zurich.</span> <span id="s699">I happen to go the same week to Basel because I have a sister there, and then I’m going to Zurich, so I can take you.</span> <span id="s700">So we thought it’s a good idea, because he told us that go – traveling to Switzerland, you have to go through Luxembourg and – and France, and we haven’t been there yet.</span> <span id="s701">So we said fine, we’ll go with you.</span> <span id="s702">And we went.</span> <span id="s703">We – til we came to si – to Canada, we traveled everywhere in ti – on the Israeli passport, okay?</span> <span id="s704">So when you come to Luxembourg, then with the custom, that when you arrive on the border, the people from the – you know, they’re sitting in the hut, in a ho – little house?</span> <span id="s705">They come to the car, they take your passport, they check, they did what they do, and they bring it back, and goodbye.</span> <span id="s706">So about five minutes – am I too fast?</span> <span id="s707">No.</span> <span id="s708">About five minutes later, they bring back the passport for – to – to the couple that are friends, and not our passport.</span> <span id="s709">And we sit, and we sit, I don’t know, maybe it was only five minutes, but to us it looked like half an hour [indecipherable] we didn’t know what’s going on.</span> <span id="s710">And we thought also that friend of ours, what were they saying?</span> <span id="s711">Maybe they are saying we are smuggling diamonds or something, because why don’t they come back with the passport?</span> <span id="s712">Eventually – yeah, eventually somebody comes, one, walks around the car, looks in it as we were the back, looks, goes back.</span> <span id="s713">Another one comes, same thing, and a third worker.</span> <span id="s714">We didn’t know what’s going on, because eventually this one comes and gives us the passport to say thank you, you can go.</span> <span id="s715">Well, she said wait – wait a second.</span> <span id="s716">What happened here?</span> <span id="s717">Why did it – what happened?</span> <span id="s718">Why did they come – it was in 1956, and this was when the Suez War was.</span> <span id="s719">And this is when the Suez War was.</span> <span id="s720">And this is when Israel was the first time on the map aft – you know, big, big because of – and they knew.</span> <span id="s721">And the first time in the life, they saw –</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Saw Israeli – A2: – Israeli passports.</span> <span id="s723">So they wanted to see how Israeli looked like.</span> <span id="s724">And this is the one story.</span> <span id="s725">Okay, now we continue.</span> <span id="s726">When we came to France – til today I don’t know where it was, a small city.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Twas in the night.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A2: Yeah, it was night, and it was pouring rain, we couldn’t see in front of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: Raining [indecipherable] A2: Okay.</span> <span id="s730">So we decided to stop and stay the night, and we’ll continue the next day.</span> <span id="s731">We stayed – we went to the hotel, and a – we took, of course, a room, and our friends were – took a room, and Moshe said he is going to take a shower first.</span> <span id="s732">So while he was in the shower, there’s a knock on the door.</span> <span id="s733">Knock at the door, I open the door and I see three men, all dressed in black suits, very, very – and very serious.</span> <span id="s734">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: May I stop you?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A2: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: If I – if I get to say I had to get – A2: I didn’t forget – I didn’t forget the passport.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: – you forg – you forget to say I had to give – you forget to give – you had to give the passports – A2: Yeah, oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: – and there was written – A2: No, no, no –</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: – in English –</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A2: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: – there was written –</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A2: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: – in French –</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A2: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: – prime minister from –</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A2: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: – Prime Minister Kraus.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A2: No, no Moshe, let me, sorry –</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: Mr. Kraus, Prime Minister.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A2: No Moshe, let me, please.</span> <span id="s752">It’s true –</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: But it was my title, prime minister.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A2: I’m – I’m coming to it, but you’re spoiling it.</span> <span id="s755">You’re spoiling the whole story.</span> <span id="s756">When we came in the hotel, okay, then was the customs also, you have to give a passport.</span> <span id="s757">And when you leave –</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A2: – they give it back to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A2: Okay.</span> <span id="s762">I didn’t remember what’s written in the passport.</span> <span id="s763">And again, as Moshe mentioned to you, he was the chief cantor of the city, and – and our passport was written all in French.</span> <span id="s764">So in French his title –</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: I was city cantor.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A2: Yes, you said that already Moshe.</span> <span id="s767">It was written, where they say the title, prime minister of [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s768">This was his title.</span> <span id="s769">In French it me – you know, in Europe, a cantor and a rabbi is a minister, like in England, you know, so he was a minister premier, chief minister.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: Oh, the chief minister.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A2: Yeah.</span> <span id="s772">But seeing the chief minister, an Israeli passport, so if they s – so that man at the – at the desk, when he opened the passport, he called right away the manager, said look, the Prime Minister of Israel is here.</span> <span id="s773">Yeah.</span> <span id="s774">Well, I didn’t know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: You didn’t know that either.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A2: No, no, we didn’t – we didn’t see [indecipherable] no, it didn’t occur to us –</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: That’s very cool.</span> <span id="s778">I like that story.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A2: Yeah, well, so the three men start speaking, of course, in French, they apologize.</span> <span id="s780">They apologize, they apologize, apologize, and we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s781">If we would have known, this government would have made a welcome party.</span> <span id="s782">We would invited the press, and – and we would have put the – and I am kvelling, you know, I think – thinking well he’s – he’s fame – I mean, I didn’t even know where we are, I didn’t even know if there are Jews there, so how do they know who ca – came – the famous Cantor Kraus is?</span> <span id="s783">But then they said, if we would know he is coming, we would have put the flag out.</span> <span id="s784">Wait a second, flag?</span> <span id="s785">What’s going on here?</span> <span id="s786">I – I really wasn’t that stupid, it was a semi-misunderstanding – misunderstanding.</span> <span id="s787">So – but to make sure, I said wait, and I called my [indecipherable] my French was, but not perfect, I said, I’m not understanding well, you know?</span> <span id="s788">So I – I went to next door, called my friends, and I hope they’re not undressed yet, yeah, and I asked them, see what’s happening.</span> <span id="s789">So this is what the story was, they thought he is the prime minister of Israel, and they wanted to – to – di-di-di – anyhow –</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: Should have said he’s better than the prime minister.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A2: Wait.</span> <span id="s792">So, yeah, so this – they said okay.</span> <span id="s793">But in the morning, they will come to say goodbye, you know.</span> <span id="s794">Needless to say, we left, I don’t know, five in the morning, we ran away, you know, because we didn’t want to – to tell them that they’re – and you know, for I think weeks, we checked every Israeli passport, to read – Israeli newspaper, sorry, to see if the Shin Bet is not looking for imposter, prime minister imposter.</span> <span id="s795">Because they don’t know the story, and if the [indecipherable] there was a prime minister</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: That’s great.</span> <span id="s797">It’s a very good story.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A2: I think it’s a very funny story.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: It’s a very good story.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A2: Yeah, okay, th-this is one story.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: Why do you – don’t you finish off the story?</span> <span id="s802">What happened in Basel when we arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A2: It’s – it’s – no – yeah, Basel, okay, yeah.</span> <span id="s804">So, anyway – one way – on the way what – yeah, and – when we arrived in Basel first because he went to see sister.</span> <span id="s805">So, before he – and he said, we’ll wait, we’ll walk a little bit and he will come and pick us up, we will continue [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s806">But before we left, he told us he – he and his wife were in the – in the zir – in Basel the whole we – the – the time of the war.</span> <span id="s807">The time of the war.</span> <span id="s808">They had survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: And everybody knows them.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A2: No, wait a second.</span> <span id="s811">And he did – he couldn’t work, he didn’t have a work permit.</span> <span id="s812">So he was walking the street, in all the cafes, he was – didn’t know what to do, so he said, you know, everybody knows me.</span> <span id="s813">Fine.</span> <span id="s814">So as he’s telling that, a young man comes close, and – and Moshe says, here, ask this young – young man.</span> <span id="s815">Said, so, Mr. Boyavich(ph) – boyo – boyo – boyas – Boyavich(ph) –</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: Boyovich(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A2: Yeah.</span> <span id="s818">Asked him, do you know me?</span> <span id="s819">Says, I don’t know you, but I know Cantor Kraus.</span> <span id="s820">What happened, he was – it was a – lived in Basel, but he – he was learning in the yeshiva in Antwerp.</span> <span id="s821">So in Antwerp every da – everybody knew Cantor Kraus.</span> <span id="s822">Well, the Boyavich(ph) was as if he gave him – you know.</span> <span id="s823">So this is –</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: Biovich(ph), Biovich(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A2: Biovich(ph), okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: Biovich(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A2: So this is just a little story.</span> <span id="s828">Okay.</span> <span id="s829">Now, when we came to Zurich, course he gave the concert, it was terrific, I will say.</span> <span id="s830">So that’s a stor – this is the end of this story.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: So they want to fill the position.</span> <span id="s832">But I to – I choosed – I choosed the – the honest work.</span> <span id="s833">You choosed the honest work.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A2: No, no, no ma – this was later Moshe, sorry, this was later.</span> <span id="s835">So, okay.</span> <span id="s836">Now there’s another story, interesting story with Grenoble, when we went to a concert for Shabbat to Grenoble.</span> <span id="s837">This is a really interesting story.</span> <span id="s838">He was invited to – there was a Bar Mitzvah, somebody had the Bar Mitzvah, and invited him to come to do the service on Saturday.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: Grenoble.</span> <span id="s840">Grenoble.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A2: Grenoble.</span> <span id="s842">You know Grenoble, France?</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: Yes, yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: Ci-City in the second – second city in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A2: It’s not the second, but sure.</span> <span id="s846">Anyhow –</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: Number one city from the – from the – from the – from the – from the – A2: Yeah.</span> <span id="s848">Do you remember back to –</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: – university.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A2: Yeah, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: Yeah, the university, it’s a nice – A2: The university.</span> <span id="s852">I don’t know if you remember the story about the Finali(ph) twins, children.</span> <span id="s853">No, no, you – nevermind.</span> <span id="s854">There was a big, big, big scandal right after the war.</span> <span id="s855">Somehow, before the war, the parents gave those two twins into a – a – a cloister, or a –</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: A church.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A2: – a monastery.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: Or a monastery.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A2: No, a monastery.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A2: To keep them.</span> <span id="s862">And if they survive, they’ll pick them up.</span> <span id="s863">They didn’t survive, but they told other members of family, the fact that the children are there.</span> <span id="s864">So after the war, the – the relatives, I don’t know exactly who –</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: Twin boys?</span> <span id="s866">Two boys?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: Twin boys, yeah.</span> <span id="s868">Finali(ph) boys, the – yeah – went to the cl – place to – to claim them, and that – they didn’t want to give them.</span> <span id="s869">Said they’re Christian, they are converted.</span> <span id="s870">They denied sto – they wouldn’t give.</span> <span id="s871">Was a big scandal.</span> <span id="s872">In Israel was – all the papers was full of it, full, because it was a first story – this kind of story after the war – well, there were many –</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A2: – but this was very famous, yeah, okay.</span> <span id="s875">The lawyer that was for the Finali(ph) children was a Mr.

id="s1443">[indecipherable] Five million dollars.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">A2: I don’t know but this has nothing to do with – it’s a waste of time, Moshe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">A: I had to [indecipherable] I had to [indecipherable] A2: It’s a waste of time, cause that has nothing to do with you.</span> <span id="s1446">I’m sorry Moshe, I’m sorry –</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A2: But really.</span> <span id="s1449">No, because we only one day and we want to –</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">A: Very, very interesting story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">A2: Okay, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">A: And the finish is very interesting, but no, no, there she – A2: Yeah, anyhow –</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">A: If I have a good story, she wouldn’t let me to tell it.</span> <span id="s1454">She wants to tell the stories.</span> <span id="s1455">Okay, you tell the stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">A2: No, I’m not telling, I’m just reminding –</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">A: No, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s1458">You tell the stories, you want to tell it, I don’t say – A2: From South Africa.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">A: – I don’t say more a word.</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">A2: Moshe, it’s nothing personal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">A: But as soon you finish, and we will eat lunch, I will finish with the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">A2: Yeah, good.</span> <span id="s1464">It’s nothing personal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">A: Because – and leave – leave a little open place to have the punch.</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">A2: Okay, from South Africa we traveled to Istanbul.</span> <span id="s1468">I just remind you, you can tell a story what was in Istanbul.</span> <span id="s1469">I just remind you, Moshe, what was special Istanbul.</span> <span id="s1470">No, you’re not talking?</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">A: What?</span> <span id="s1472">No, no, I – I don’t – I don’t want to talk.</span> <span id="s1473">I’m not talking more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">A2: Okay.</span> <span id="s1475">So I – I don’t – okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">A: You will tell the story, they came to listen to you, not to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">A2: Then in Teheran, the story in Teheran.</span> <span id="s1478">No?</span> <span id="s1479">You wanted to tell –</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">Q: I think that’s here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">A2: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">Q: Cause I remember something about that in the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">A2: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">Q: But I’m not going to start looking through this, but you could – what happened at Teheran?</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">A: She will tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">A2: Okay, we – we came to Teheran just for three days.</span> <span id="s1487">We arrived Friday, we suppo – supposed to leave Sunday.</span> <span id="s1488">So, I found – we found the embassy, Israeli embassy, and asked them where can we have Shabbat, we want to pay.</span> <span id="s1489">And they send us to a family, we stayed there.</span> <span id="s1490">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: An Israeli fellow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">A2: Yeah, they were Israeli, right.</span> <span id="s1493">It was a shaliach.</span> <span id="s1494">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1495">Whenever we came to a place, and Moshe didn’t have to perform – Q2: What was the name of the [indecipherable] A2: This I don’t remember, yeah.</span> <span id="s1496">Where we stayed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">Q2: No, of the shaliach.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">A2: I don’t remember – this was – I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">Q: Just cause his uncle was in Teheran.</span> <span id="s1500">What years are we talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">A2: This was in ’62 – ’62, yeah.</span> <span id="s1502">Anyhow, so we stayed there.</span> <span id="s1503">And when we traveled to a city Moshe didn’t perform, he s – he didn’t even say his name right, he said Moshe Shapiro, or Shamir(ph), or Shapeer(ph).</span> <span id="s1504">I said, Moshe Shapeer(ph).</span> <span id="s1505">This was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">Q: You went just for a tr – just for a trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">A2: No, we – we stopped there –</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">A: She talks; I won’t talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">A2: – from Israel, when we traveled to – I think to is – no, from Johannesburg that time, when you travel to Israel, we have to stop in – in Teheran.</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">A2: Because the – El Al couldn’t fly over Africa then.</span> <span id="s1512">So we – they flew through Teheran.</span> <span id="s1513">So we were there three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">Q: It’s ironic today to think that you couldn’t go to Africa, but you could go to Teheran, for Israelis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">A2: Yeah, to ir – yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1516">Well –</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">Q: The world has changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">A: And I was rece – and I was received by the shah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">A2: Now wait, wait.</span> <span id="s1521">So, we were there.</span> <span id="s1522">Shabbat, we went to shul.</span> <span id="s1523">There were the Ashkenazi shul, where all the mishulachim(ph), all the Israelis doubled, and a few Ashkenazim, because mostly they had Sephardic shul, and the service guest.</span> <span id="s1524">So they ask him – they gave him Haftorah.</span> <span id="s1525">They didn’t always.</span> <span id="s1526">Said Moshe Shapeer(ph).</span> <span id="s1527">Yeah, I said, he’s a diamond merchant from Johannesburg, this is what he said.</span> <span id="s1528">Because we knew, once they hear [indecipherable] sing something for us [indecipherable] because you know.</span> <span id="s1529">So, this is how we – the way how we avoided it.</span> <span id="s1530">So, but when he – when he said Haftorah, they saw in the Haftorah that’s – that’s unusual.</span> <span id="s1531">His diction, first of all, is perfect, and his voice, even not singing, but reciting – so they looked at him.</span> <span id="s1532">And I was – like this is what they wou – the ladies’ shul, I was standing in the door, because I wanted to see and hear, and I was the only lady there.</span> <span id="s1533">So I hear two men walking up and down, walking up, down.</span> <span id="s1534">And they’re looking at – look at him, and I hear one says to the other, are you sure this is Moshe Shapeer(ph)?</span> <span id="s1535">Because I could swear this is Moshe Kraus.</span> <span id="s1536">I know him from the army.</span> <span id="s1537">This was a story in Istanbul that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">Q: In Teheran.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">A2: – in Teheran, Teheran.</span> <span id="s1540">Wait.</span> <span id="s1541">Then, when we walked out the shul, we went out, we see thousands of people in the street.</span> <span id="s1542">By the way, don’t know if it’s interesting, but then in ’62, all the sewage in te – in Teheran were open.</span> <span id="s1543">It was – the main st – is it no?</span> <span id="s1544">It was open.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">Q: [indecipherable] was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">A2: Of course, I got sick, by the way.</span> <span id="s1547">But this – I’m not going to tell this.</span> <span id="s1548">I sit [indecipherable] waiting in the street, so we ask, what’s happening?</span> <span id="s1549">They told us that then was Brezhnev the secretary of Russia, of the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">Q: Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">A2: – yeah.</span> <span id="s1552">And he’s coming for state visit.</span> <span id="s1553">And the shah, an-and Fra(ph) Diva(ph) went to the airport to welcome him, and they will come by – back this way.</span> <span id="s1554">So is this where the people stood.</span> <span id="s1555">So we said we will wait, we’ll see.</span> <span id="s1556">And then we really saw.</span> <span id="s1557">We saw beautiful golden carriage, with horses, you know.</span> <span id="s1558">We saw the shah and Mr. Brezhnev.</span> <span id="s1559">And you know, the shah was dressed beautiful [indecipherable] with a suit and – and then the second carriage was Fra(ph) Diva(ph) and Mrs. Brezhnev.</span> <span id="s1560">Well, Fra(ph) Diva(ph) was as if she just walked out from Dior.</span> <span id="s1561">She was beautiful, young and beautiful.</span> <span id="s1562">And Mrs. Brezhnev, she looked as if she just came out from the corhose(ph).</span> <span id="s1563">Honestly, with the duke an-and of course of as – this [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1564">So this is when we saw the shah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1565">So this is Teheran, I don’t remember what else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">A: Very interesting story.</span> <span id="s1567">But not more interesting than my story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">A2: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1569">Okay, what else?</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">A: [indecipherable] terribly disturbing, you see, this is the difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">A2: And then in ’64 was a very ebag – a big event in our – in our life, because the Jewish Grand Congress sent Moshe for a concert to – behind the Iron Curtain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">Q: So this is something that’s in detail –</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">A2: It’s there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">Q: It’s in detail here – A2: Okay, so – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">Q: – and I read about it, cause I was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">A2: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">Q: – particularly interested.</span> <span id="s1578">I was very involved with the Soviet Jewry movement, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1579">The fact that you did this singing tour in the 60s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">A2: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">Q: – in the Soviet Union is fantastic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">A2: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1583">And does he – di-did he remember to tell you he was nearly arrested there?</span> <span id="s1584">Is the story there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">Q: [indecipherable] I can remember the detail –</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">A2: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">Q: I remember reading about the – A2: No, because it’s important.</span> <span id="s1588">You see, they – they send a si – a Jew ship – shi – was supposed to be the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1589">He – he was – he used to take all this – this is there?</span> <span id="s1590">Don’t remember?</span> <span id="s1591">He took all his music, because he had printed music for the pianist, yeah, and he checked what he was singing.</span> <span id="s1592">And anything that has to do with Jerusalem, or freedom, or Israel, it was nyet(ph), they put a stamp, nyet(ph).</span> <span id="s1593">But she doesn’t know Moshe.</span> <span id="s1594">He failed at his f – his duty is to sing those songs, to sing for the Jews about Jerusalem, and about [indecipherable] and all that.</span> <span id="s1595">So after he finish –</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">A: So the pianist couldn’t play.</span> <span id="s1597">He couldn’t – he couldn’t – he couldn’t – A2: Because he didn’t have the music.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">A: – couldn’t [indecipherable] with me.</span> <span id="s1599">So I sing it without the piano.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">A2: Because they took away the music so he shou – he shouldn’t sing that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">A2: So after, when he finished the concert, this censor was a Jew, came to him – and what did he tell you in Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">A: He will burn in Siber(ph) – A2: In Yiddish, in Yiddish he told you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">A: – his [indecipherable] in Siber(ph) A2: No, you – no, you will rot in the Siber(ph).</span> <span id="s1605">We will send you to Siber(ph) –</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">A2: – and you will rot in there, because he defied order –</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">A: [indecipherable] in Siber(ph) A2: And we are going to arrest you and send you there.</span> <span id="s1609">But what saved him –</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">A: And I was afraid, but there were so many [indecipherable] I hoped – A2: Because it was a historic e –</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: – I hoped they will not do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">A2: No.</span> <span id="s1613">It was an historic event, the first time that a Jew came to sing for the Jews in Russia, the first time.</span> <span id="s1614">So all the press was invited.</span> <span id="s1615">The Russian invited the press because they wanted to show they’re open, you know, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">Q: This was organized through the – the World Jewish Congress?</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">A2: Yes.</span> <span id="s1619">And this was in 1960 – in 1960 –</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">Q: Four.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">A2: Four, yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">A: Brezhnev asked – Brezhnev asked a singer from the Jewish Congress, he wanted to show the world – A2: They’re open.</span> <span id="s1623">Yeah, I said that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">A: – that the Jewish singer can – A2: – I said that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">A: Yeah, but – but – but what happened, they decided pa – Moshe Kraus is more interesting, they wanted Koussevitzky.</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">A: But they said Moshe Kraus is more interesting because Koussevitzky sang only hazzonahs(ph).</span> <span id="s1628">I sang hazzonahs(ph), Yiddish, Hebrew, hasidis(ph).</span> <span id="s1629">I had four programs.</span> <span id="s1630">So I gave two hours, but they were not boring.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">A2: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">A: Because this was every – everything –</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">Q: It’s a variety.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">A: – was a different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">Q: Was a variety.</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">A: He only again hazzonahs, again hazzonahs(ph), again hazzonahs(ph) for two hours.</span> <span id="s1637">It was a little too long.</span> <span id="s1638">It was a – A2: And a – and another thing –</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">A: – a-after – then in the second hour, people wanted to – already that he shall finish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">A2: And another thing.</span> <span id="s1641">I don’t know if Moshe mentioned that he was the chief cantor of the Israeli army.</span> <span id="s1642">Did he mention that?</span> <span id="s1643">So as a – as an officer of the army, he was a, you know, bigger draw than a cantor from the States, all right?</span> <span id="s1644">Okay, so this is one story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">A: Because Goldman wanted to send Koussevitzky.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">A: But then they said to them, no, Moshe Kraus [indecipherable] Moshe – A2: Yeah, now tell them the story with the – the Jew that came to sh – to your shul, and he told you – he sang the song of – of his father, and he told you to –</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">Q: When you went to – one sec – when you went to – to the tour of the Soviet Union –</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">A2: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">Q: – you were s – you went from Johannesburg.</span> <span id="s1651">Now, you were living in Johannesburg and you went from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">A2: Yes, yes, yeah, yeah, ’64 we were still in johan –</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">A: No, we were – A2: Okay, I’ll come back to it.</span> <span id="s1654">When we – we arrived the first sta – the first stop –</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">Q: Did you go with him on the tour of Soviet Union?</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">A2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I si – then – then I traveled with him everywhere.</span> <span id="s1657">Now he goes by himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">A: She was afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">A2: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1660">The first stop was Belgrade, where we stopped, when we came to this – and Belgrade was the most open, they –</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">A: They didn’t put the [indecipherable] they nearly put in the jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">A2: No, that’s another story, and this is in Prague.</span> <span id="s1663">You’re [indecipherable] Moshe</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">A: In Prague – A2: No, I’m – I talk bel –</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">A: Prague is also by –</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">A2: No –</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">A: – communists – A2: Yeah, but their country, Moshe, I –</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">A: The country – A2: l – I’m – I’m s – first in Belgrade –</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">A: Okay, I’ll not interfere, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">A2: Yeah, okay, this is import – no, yeah, don’t interfere.</span> <span id="s1671">In – in Prague, in Belgrade, the cons – the Israeli consulate invited us for lunch, and they asked us where you going, and Moshe told them, we’re going behind the curtain.</span> <span id="s1672">So this what he told us, it’s very important.</span> <span id="s1673">He said – and – and I – we traveled til we came to Canada.</span> <span id="s1674">I told you, we traveled Israeli passports –</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">Q: Israeli passports.</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">A2: – yeah.</span> <span id="s1677">So, he said, this is the word that he told me, it’s important for later, he said, if you are behind the Iron Curtain, and anything happens to you, if for some reason they don’t like the color of your eyes, this what he said, and they arrest you, remember, there’s nothing we can do.</span> <span id="s1678">There’s nothing we can do, the Israeli can do, because they –</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">Q: There’s no diplomat – A2: – the – the time, okay.</span> <span id="s1680">That’s important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">A: They had no connection.</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">A2: That’s important for a later story, what you said.</span> <span id="s1683">From per – Belgrade, yeah, this is very important.</span> <span id="s1684">We left the hotel Friday morning –</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">A: You want me to tell a story, what story?</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">A2: No, I’m going to tell the story in Belgrade, we stayed a shi – the whole night.</span> <span id="s1687">Friday, the story with the storm.</span> <span id="s1688">You’ll – you’ll hear it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">A: It’s Hungary?</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">A2: No.</span> <span id="s1691">Wait a second.</span> <span id="s1692">We – we stayed in hotel.</span> <span id="s1693">We’re supposed to leave Friday morning at – it’s an hour flight to Budapest.</span> <span id="s1694">So nine o’clock we’re supposed to leave, so we [indecipherable] we’ll arrive 10 o’clock Friday, it’s a long day, right, because we – of course we don’t travel on Shabbat [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">A: Because I never fly Friday, I never travel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">A2: No, no, til then we did.</span> <span id="s1697">After this we stopped, we said no.</span> <span id="s1698">So anyhow, we arrived, and th-th-the plane doesn’t move, there’s a snowstorm unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1699">So we’re leaving at 10.</span> <span id="s1700">Then they said we leave at 11 – 11 – by the time it was one o’clock, they said the flight is cancelled, but you know what?</span> <span id="s1701">We couldn’t go back to town because everything was frozen.</span> <span id="s1702">There was no taxis.</span> <span id="s1703">It was such a – a snowstorm they never had in history.</span> <span id="s1704">So we couldn’t go home – back to the hotel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">A: Twenty centimeters – A2: Yeah, n-no – no taxi would travel there.</span> <span id="s1706">So the main dis –</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">Q: Sounds like Montreal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">A2: And then, at that time, this was ’64, this was – no, this was actually sic – December ’63, I don’t – the end of the year, and at that time there was no hotel at the airport.</span> <span id="s1709">I don’t know today, but

had to meet somebody.</span> <span id="s1891">I – I also have to tell you that besides giving concert, he had the mission, something – something to – to help Jews leave the country, and – and so he had to meet somebody, I don’t know where, but [indecipherable] he didn’t want to this – so, you said to me, oh, you said, I forgot my umbrella, let’s go back to the hotel – because it was raining or

you’re right.</span> <span id="s1910">From Vienna we went to Prague.</span> <span id="s1911">In Prague we have a few stories, a few stories.</span> <span id="s1912">The first one, we stayed in a hotel, and there was no western people there.</span> <span id="s1913">The only people who stayed in this hotel was so dark from – from iddel – Middle East Arabs, I don’t know, a-and Russians.</span> <span id="s1914">And we were the only ones [indecipherable] of course, Israeli passport.</span> <span id="s1915">So one day, the desk calls us and they said, there’s a man come to see you.</span> <span id="s1916">We didn’t know it – who it is.</span> <span id="s1917">To make the story short, there was a man in – in – his name is Singer.</span> <span id="s1918">Actually, he was an opera

<span id="s1921">So he came to see us.</span> <span id="s1922">At that time a local person couldn’t come into hotel, the hotel was only for international visitors.</span> <span id="s1923">You couldn’t walk in.</span> <span id="s1924">And if you walked in, you had to leave his passport at the desk, and they had to check what it is, and report to the [indecipherable] and then he came to see – then he is allowed to come and see us.</span> <span id="s1925">And of course that was emotional to – Moshe didn’t remember – you remembered him?</span> <span id="s1926">You did remember?</span> <span id="s1927">Anyhow – okay.</span> <span id="s1928">And then he tells us a story like this, which is unbelievable story.</span> <span id="s1929">He says he is married, he has four children, one son, one daughter and twin – twin girls.</span> <span id="s1930">And he remained a Jew.</span> <span id="s1931">He was also in the camp and survived, but he is still a Jew, in heart.</span> <span id="s1932">And he knows that if he’ll stay with the chil – with the family in – in Prague, they will lose the children.</span> <span id="s1933">They’ll become goyim.</span> <span id="s1934">They will intermarry, because the Jewish life wasn’t as interested – as organized.</span> <span id="s1935">I don’t know if they had the chief rabbi there – they did – yeah, they did have a chief rabbi.</span> <span id="s1936">And – and their son is already 18, and he’s already a member of the youth – they were poor – poor gi – poor – poor communists, of course, [indecipherable] communists, and he’s afraid

the golem?</span></p> <p><span id="s1949">A2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1950">So – so –</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">A: I saw myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">A2: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1953">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">A: So I see the golem, because the – there was a –</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">A2: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">A: – there was a mirror.</span> <span id="s1957">I had – I told them I want to see the golem, go up and [indecipherable] is a mirror – A2: No, he said –</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">A: – you will see him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">A2: No, he said – he told us that American when they come, they want to see the golem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">A2: So yeah, sure, you can see him, but it cost five dollars –</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1963">A2: – to go up.</span> <span id="s1964">And then they started going – okay, so – so what do you want from us, children.</span> <span id="s1965">Listen to this, I mean it sounds unbelievable, he said, I want you to take the children out.</span> <span id="s1966">I leave them in – them in your hand, and you only have to promise me one thing, that you give – give them the best Jewish education, they should remain Jews, that’s all I want.</span> <span id="s1967">Can you believe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">A2: I mean, if – really, I mean, I – we have proof, because it stil – but otherwise people won’t believe a story like this, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">Q: And?</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">A2: And wait.</span> <span id="s1972">So Moshe said, I can’t promise you anything at the moment.</span> <span id="s1973">I’ll tra – I’ll see what I can do, and we’ll see.</span> <span id="s1974">And – and wait.</span> <span id="s1975">We didn’t leave yet, there’s another story.</span> <span id="s1976">For when we were in Prague, Moshe got a call from Rabbi Rosen, chief rabbi from Bucharest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">Q: Of course.</span> <span id="s1978">And chief rabbi of Romania.</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">A2: He has to go – yeah, yeah, he has to go back for this mission, for whatever, you know.</span> <span id="s1980">So he gave me my – my passport, he gave me some money, and he left.</span> <span id="s1981">Sh-Shall I tell the story what happened to me?</span> <span id="s1982">It’s not important.</span> <span id="s1983">I don’t have to, but it’s remarkable, but I don’t know – okay, I –</span></p> <p><span id="s1984">A: Right, you – you are the boss.</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">A2: – no – yeah – no, I won’t tell, I won’t tell.</span> <span id="s1986">I just tell the sh-short.</span> <span id="s1987">So Moshe left, and I remained in pra – in Prague alone.</span> <span id="s1988">It was very unpleasant, it – to be in the hotel, it was all those Arabs, a woman alone, and they looked at me all the time, you know.</span> <span id="s1989">This is not important.</span> <span id="s1990">But this Mr. Singer, he was my connection.</span> <span id="s1991">He is the only one I knew.</span> <span id="s1992">And as it happened, it – ish – sho – told me where to go, to the opera, and the ballet and all that.</span> <span id="s1993">So then, we had an agreement, he didn’t know how long he’ll be in – in Bucharest, so – and I remained a week in Prague, because this was my passport, I couldn’t leave [indecipherable] or something.</span> <span id="s1994">So we had – we stayed from there – at – at – in the meantime we were in Russia, but we told you about Russia.</span> <span id="s1995">You forgot one story in Russia.</span> <span id="s1996">Was the man who came to told you – tell you that he’s grandson of this – that he sang this song for you, the Yiddish song.</span></p> <p><span id="s1997">Q: That’s there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1998">A2: It’s there?</span> <span id="s1999">Okay, so we’ll skip it.</span> <span id="s2000">Okay.</span> <span id="s2001">So – so I left at the airport this – by the way, nearly – I was nearly arrested because – just for you I’m telling this, it has nothing to do with the story – because when we went to those countries, each time we came in, we had to show the passport, we had to tell them exactly how much money we have, in what – what currency, and also, I had to declare my jewelry, every si – piece that I had.</span> <span id="s2002">And when Moshe left for Bucharest, I told you, he gave me the passport, the money, forgot this paper.</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">Q: Ah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">A2: And he left.</span> <span id="s2005">And when I came to the airport, they ask for the paper, I didn’t have it.</span> <span id="s2006">When I told them husband left and he took it [indecipherable] they nearly arrested me, because they told me I’m a spy, and I was – I sold my jewelry black market.</span> <span id="s2007">Anyhow, I left.</span> <span id="s2008">But it was terrible, I was nearly –</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">Q: Yeah, at the time it’s very scary – A2: – I – ye-yeah, no, no –</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">Q: – it’s very frightening.</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">A2: – if I – yeah.</span> <span id="s2012">So I left, I came to Brussels, and in Brussels I was – waited for him, I don’t know, three days.</span> <span id="s2013">And then we decided if we don’t meet in Brussels I’ll continue to London, and we’ll meet – we’ll meet in London, right?</span> <span id="s2014">Yeah.</span> <span id="s2015">This is how we left.</span> <span id="s2016">Actually, there’s one little co – he was in London [indecipherable] how it was, I remember we were in Hotel dorte – Dorchester, yeah.</span> <span id="s2017">At that time, when we traveled – I still have it, when we are in Israel years ago, we both made special cu – cu – leather coats, for me, one for him.</span> <span id="s2018">And we were we – I was wearing this leather coat when I travel, and I had hat to match, also gloves.</span> <span id="s2019">So – and also, at this hotel at that time, when you came with luggage, you didn’t go into the main entrance, there was a side entrance.</span> <span id="s2020">And with the luggage you went to side entrance and checked in.</span> <span id="s2021">As I was checking in, wearing the coat, all of a sudden he arrived, and I arrived, of course, with my taxi with my luggage, yeah.</span> <span id="s2022">All of a sudden, he arrive with his taxi, with his luggage.</span> <span id="s2023">And he comes to me, and of course we embrace.</span> <span id="s2024">And – and I told my – the woman at the desk, oh, this is my husband.</span> <span id="s2025">Cause I checked by myself first.</span> <span id="s2026">So she looked, oh how did you find a husband, was what she said.</span> <span id="s2027">Anyway, said, yeah, but he’s my husband – he [indecipherable] I was so excited, cause I didn’t know –</span></p> <p><span id="s2028">Q: It had been a wa – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2029">A2: I’ve – no – I didn’t even know if I’ll see him, because when he went for this mission it was very dangerous.</span> <span id="s2030">But he knew – this time I d – I don’t know if you remember the –</span></p> <p><span id="s2031">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2032">A2: – atmosphere.</span> <span id="s2033">And here I see him, he’s alive, he came back.</span> <span id="s2034">So – so I was so excited.</span> <span id="s2035">I said, but he’s by husband.</span> <span id="s2036">So – so, yeah, but – but where do you find him?</span> <span id="s2037">So – and there – lucky – he – he wore also the same coat, that I told you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">Q: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">A2: So I look at – oh, look, he wears – wear – we have the same coats.</span> <span id="s2040">And they let us so – if not the same coat – because his passport was still in his suitcase, and we were so excited we forgot to show them the passport, it’s the same name, we just show the co – the coat.</span> <span id="s2041">So this is one little episode about that.</span> <span id="s2042">Okay, what can we tell them more about the trip behind the cu – Iron Curtain?</span> <span id="s2043">Is there anything else?</span> <span id="s2044">Oh yeah, in Prague, was true – true stor – yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s2045">So this was one story, the Prague, that he wanted to give us children, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">Q: Yes, yes, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">A: Okay, so let’s – I’ll finish this and I’ll have another story.</span> <span id="s2048">When we were in London –</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">Q: So what happened with those children?</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">A2: Wait.</span> <span id="s2051">This is the story.</span> <span id="s2052">When we were in London, Moshe got in touch with the chief rabbi, who was the che – Jacobowitz was?</span> <span id="s2053">I don’t remember, who was rabbi che –</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">A: Jacobowitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s2055">A2: Jacobowitz, yeah.</span> <span id="s2056">And he told them the story.</span> <span id="s2057">So – no, no, it wasn’t that s – that – that fast, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s2058">It wa – it took a few years, because yeah.</span> <span id="s2059">He – every year – okay – it’s po – it’s important.</span> <span id="s2060">In Johannesburg Moshe was chazzan the shul.</span> <span id="s2061">The shul was 1500 seats.</span> <span id="s2062">But we have 2100 members.</span> <span id="s2063">So 600 people davened every Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur in the hall, that made it [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2064">So Moshe brought this Singer to be the chazzan in the hall.</span> <span id="s2065">But the Singer never was a chazzan, he was an opera singer.</span> <span id="s2066">So we brought him a fa – I don’t know, a week or two earlier.</span> <span id="s2067">And day and night, and literally day and night, he taught him, learn si – he could read.</span> <span id="s2068">He knew the davening, he was a Jewish – I told you a Jew, but he didn’t know the nusach, and chazzan is not just singing, it’s nusach.</span> <span id="s2069">I don’t even know what I’m talking about, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">Q: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">A: And yeah, he taught him and he beca – became the chazzan in – so he brought him for about three years –</span></p> <p><span id="s2072">Q: To Johannesburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">A: – to Johannesburg to be the chazzan, and he got – he could take the money out, because he was a foreigner, and he took it back to – to – to Prague, and they had money extra.</span> <span id="s2074">Prague was very bad at that time, I – I’d have to tell you, because I remember I was asking the hotel if they have an orange.</span> <span id="s2075">They looked at me – and it was winter – they looked at me as if – as if I’m asking a diamond.</span> <span id="s2076">An orange, winter, th-they didn’t ha – they didn’t have food.</span> <span id="s2077">The only place – yeah, yeah, we took – they had one store for the tourists, and there was everything, and also for the communist, for the high –</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">Q: Yeah, yeah, for the high ranking – A2: So, because we were tourists, we took him, you remember, to the store, and we bought him – I remember he bought sour cream, we never – sour cream for the children.</span> <span id="s2079">He was so excited, he’d been missing for years sour cream.</span> <span id="s2080">This is just an episode –</span></p> <p><span id="s2081">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">A2: – that was – I don’t know if it’s interesting.</span> <span id="s2083">Okay, so this’ll – yeah, later, later, we came to London, Moshe came to London, yeah, and he went to the chief rabbi, tell him the story.</span> <span id="s2084">So the chief rabbi said, first of all, what we have to do, we have to take out the family, because how can we take – because we – we can’t take children without family, it’s important.</span> <span id="s2085">So what did we do?</span> <span id="s2086">They made co – a fake – a fi – a fictional – fiction contract, is that fiction, no.</span> <span id="s2087">Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2088">Q: Fictional, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">A2: Fictional contract with a certain – with a shul that the rabbi arranged.</span> <span id="s2090">They invited this Mr. Singer to be a chazzan in the shul for three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">Q: In London?</span></p> <p><span id="s2092">A2: In London, and go to the government to show them the contract, and tell them we are going for three years, and why the – and they allowed him to take the whole family, why?</span> <span id="s2093">Because in London they – they have – I don’t have other city in the world, but London has an international school, every language.</span> <span id="s2094">So they have also school for Czech.</span> <span id="s2095">So the government allowed them in – in – in – on condition that he takes them to – the children to school, the Czech, yeah, and he had to leave everything behind.</span> <span id="s2096">He had to buy books and paper, as if he is going to a school.</span> <span id="s2097">We knew it’s fiction, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2099">A2: – he had to prove the government.</span> <span id="s2100">And he left everything behind.</span> <span id="s2101">Everything.</span> <span id="s2102">All the ma – furniture, everything.</span> <span id="s2103">And only what they – they could take some clothes and this, and they came to London.</span> <span id="s2104">And they never went back, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">Q: Fantastic.</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">A2: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2107">And – and there were – he was in London for a short while, and then Moshe worked to bring them to Johannesburg.</span> <span id="s2108">How do you bring a family from the communist country to Johannesburg?</span> <span id="s2109">Impossible.</span> <span id="s2110">South Africa didn’t have any connection with any – any diplomatic connection with those cun – any of the countries, communist countries then.</span> <span id="s2111">So how – and how can you bring a family?</span> <span id="s2112">I remember the public prosecutor in Johannesburg, Dr. Yuta(ph) was a great friend of ours, so Moshe went to tell him the story.</span> <span id="s2113">Said I want to bring a family.</span> <span id="s2114">They’re Jews, they’re not communists, I – I guarantee, and I want to bring them here.</span> <span id="s2115">So, remember what Yuta(ph) told you?</span> <span id="s2116">It ma – it made so he said, when here will grow hair, the government will allow a family to co – a communist country family to come to South Africa.</span> <span id="s2117">This is what he told you, right?</span> <span id="s2118">I remember that.</span> <span id="s2119">But you don’t know Moshe, he doesn’t take no for an answer.</span> <span id="s2120">He went to Pretoria – Pretoria the capital, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2121">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">A2: And he got in touch to the rabbi, Rabbi Katz, I remember, and he told him the story and he said, just make an appointment with the foreign minister, or I don’t know which minister had to do with the – with the papers, and he made the appointment with him, and he came to him and he si – talked to him.</span> <span id="s2123">He said – he told him the story, and he burst out crying.</span> <span id="s2124">He said, I am a Jew, he is a Jew.</span> <span id="s2125">He is not a communist, he wants to run away from the co – do – and he burst out crying, and he touched this man’s heart, and he gave – he ba – he gave him the visas for five people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2126">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2127">A2: Which is unheard of.</span> <span id="s2128">Wait.</span> <span id="s2129">Then when we – they brou – we brought them all.</span> <span id="s2130">So yeah, first of all we had to collect money to send them tickets.</span> <span id="s2131">And we brought them all, we find them an apartment, where to buy furniture [indecipherable] dishes, clothes, sink.</span> <span id="s2132">The whole city wa – col – was sending.</span> <span id="s2133">We – we – it was in the papers, of course, we put – the whole story was in the paper, and everybody brought something.</span> <span id="s2134">We di – made the furniture.</span> <span id="s2135">And Moshe gave him position, he became a cantor in Johannesburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2137">A2: He was there for years.</span> <span id="s2138">When we left in ’70, South Africa, he was still cantor there.</span> <span id="s2139">So this is a story.</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">Q: You sa – you saved his life, his family, fantastic.</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">A2: Five – five people, five people saved.</span> <span id="s2142">This is one story.</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">A: It’s not the only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">A2: Yeah, the other – yeah –</span></p> <p><span id="s2145">A: There is a doctor what I saved – A2: – this – I’m going to tell the other story.</span> <span id="s2146">This also ve – a very interesting story, the other story.</span> <span id="s2147">I didn’t mention you – to you that in – in the building, you see there next to the shul, there’s a building, yeah?</span> <span id="s2148">On the left is the big, famous shul, but on the right, this is the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s2149">And there is the only place where you can eat kosher, because they have a kitchen [indecipherable] kitchen.</span> <span id="s2150">The food, I mean, mostly potatoes that time, there was much – not much to eat.</span> <span id="s2151">But this is the only place we ate.</span> <span id="s2152">When we went there for our meals, nobody will talk to us, because they saw – everybody was suspicious, thought we are spies, they don’t us, why should they talk to us?</span> <span id="s2153">And even there, people didn’t talk anything personal, because they were afraid of the shadow, that atmosphere then, unbelievable frightening.</span> <span id="s2154">And – and also, by the way, when we went to – to the – Singer’s home, he took us to his home, they were all sitting with coats, because they didn’t even have heating.</span> <span id="s2155">This was in – in – in January, in winter, yeah.</span> <span id="s2156">Terrible, terrible condition.</span> <span id="s2157">[indecipherable] was – so okay, so one day, in the hote – in the restaurant, we met those two brothers in the restaurant over in shul where?</span> <span id="s2158">Don’t remember where we met those two brothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2159">A: I went to visit him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2160">A2: No, but where did we meet the first – we didn’t know – whe-where did we meet the first time?</span> <span id="s2161">In shul, or in restaurant?</span></p> <p><span id="s2162">A: No, I got to know that they are there, and I went to visit them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">A2: You – who ar – did – oh, he told you, Singer told you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2164">A: Mr. Singer – A2: Yeah, all right.</span> <span id="s2165">Singer told you know, you know there are two men from the same city.</span></p> <p><span id="s2166">A: We went to together in chayder.</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">A2: Chayder, right.</span> <span id="s2168">Two brothers from the city, from – from [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">A: One was the – and one was the Minister of Health, and one was the head of the NKVD.</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">A2: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2171">A: You know what the NKVD is?</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">Q: Oh yeah, oh yeah, that’s a –</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">A2: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2174">Q: – precursor to the KGB, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2175">A2: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s2176">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">A: Aye, aye, aye, aye.</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">A2: Yeah, so one day when you were in the restaurant, when you left the restaurant, they were waiting for, the two brother, and they walked with us.</span> <span id="s2179">The only place where people would talk to us when we were in the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">A2: So all the Jews that didn’t talk to us in the restaurant, whenever we left, one or two stuck to us and – and he s – used to [indecipherable] out and tell us stories from his life; what they suffer and how they want to get out, but of course they couldn’t get out that time.</span> <span id="s2182">And the same thing, those two brothers waited outside and we – they walked us to the hotel, and on the way to the hotel, they told us their life story.</span> <span id="s2183">What was their life story?</span> <span id="s2184">They both survived somehow – they was also in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2185">And after – after the war, they thought communism is of course the solution for everybody.</span> <span id="s2186">You know, brotherhood, even –</span></p> <p><span id="s2187">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2188">A2: – many people believed – or at least they – they – it [speaks foreign language] So one became a high – a policeman.</span> <span id="s2189">He was hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s2190">A: NKVD, the head of the NKVD.</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">A2: Okay.</span> <span id="s2192">And the other one is Minister of Health.</span></p> <p><span id="s2193">A: The Minister of Health.</span></p> <p><span id="s2194">A2: Yeah, okay, yeah.</span> <span id="s2195">But on the street when they talked to us, they told us that it’s all a lie.</span> <span id="s2196">They did it because they have to survive.</span> <span id="s2197">They want to leave, they want to run away, they don’t know how.</span> <span id="s2198">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2199">A: Oh, Rivka, you tell the story so wrong, unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s2200">A2: So tell it, take it.</span> <span id="s2201">Ta – go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s2202">Q: Go ahead, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s2203">A2: Go ahead, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">A: So wh-why do you – why do bring up a story which you don’t know to tell?</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">Q: Okay, so tell, tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">A2: Ca – bu-but short, short.</span> <span id="s2207">Come on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">A: I’m sitting by the doctor in the home, and they speak about Brezhnev, and they speak about communism.</span></p> <p><span id="s2209">A2: I’m sorry Moshe, I have to interrupt.</span> <span id="s2210">You do – you – you mix with the story where the wife was from South Africa.</span> <span id="s2211">That’s another story.</span></p> <p><span id="s2212">A: But –

was a woman that says the government chased her out because she claimed she bel – communism something they chased her out, and we didn’t know where she went, we didn’t remember the story.</span> <span id="s2231">When we came to Prague, I don’t know, somehow we heard this woman lives in Prague and she is married, with – and the husband is a doctor and she has children, and they live in Prague.</span> <span id="s2232">So I don’t remember how we got in touch with them, how we met, and they invited us to their home, and this is where the story – they told us they’re so happy – come on, if you want to tell the story, take it over.</span> <span id="s2233">They believed that communism is – is – is – is the solution, and she’s dreamt all his life, da-da-da, and he’s a doctor there, and

jail one night.</span></p> <p><span id="s2664">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2665">A2: I’m telling the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s2666">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2667">A2: Okay, the – you want to tell the story?</span></p> <p><span id="s2668">A: Yeah, what story?</span> <span id="s2669">I had an accident.</span></p> <p><span id="s2670">A2: This – okay, I’ll tell the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s2671">A: Yeah, an – an officer went in in my car.</span></p> <p><span id="s2672">A2: Okay, let me tell the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s2673">Q: And – and – no, and?</span></p> <p><span id="s2674">A: A-A-And I – they – an officer was god in – in – in Me-Mexico.</span> <span id="s2675">I had nothing to say.</span> <span id="s2676">Straightaway jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s2677">A2: Now let me explain, Moshe.</span></p> <p><span id="s2678">A: And then came a millionaire.</span></p> <p><span id="s2679">A2: Now Moshe, please let me explain it, it’s – it’s a pity [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2680">In Mexico was a law, if there’s an accident, whate – before anything, the two people have to go to jail, and then they clean out who, what, when.</span> <span id="s2681">This is the law, yeah?</span> <span id="s2682">So it’s important because when – and why did we have the accident?</span> <span id="s2683">The man w-was a – later we found out he was an officer, he was drunk, and he w-went into ours in the back.</span> <span id="s2684">Nothing happened to us, because – but he was bloody, because he – you know, he bang.</span> <span id="s2685">So they took them to – both to jail, and this was [indecipherable] Pesach, I remember.</span> <span id="s2686">Why I remember?</span> <span id="s2687">Because we were on the way – way to Cuernavaca, he was supposed to give a concert, why in Cuernavaca?</span> <span id="s2688">It’s a la – I have to explain it.</span> <span id="s2689">Is a city an hour and 15 minutes away from Mexico, and there is one weather the whole year.</span> <span id="s2690">The whole year, spring.</span> <span id="s2691">Nobody knows why, but because it’s spring there, and Mexico City is –is 800 feet up, so the Jewish ho – old age home is in Cuernavaca.</span></p> <p><span id="s2692">Q: Oh, because of the climate.</span></p> <p><span id="s2693">A2: So this is – yeah, so he wa – went to give a concert in the Jewish for – for Pesach [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2694">And this is what happened.</span> <span id="s2695">So they took – yeah, so when this happened, we’re standing.</span> <span id="s2696">We didn’t run away, of course.</span> <span id="s2697">And all the cars that passed by, that saw us standing, said run, run, because they knew they’ll take us to j – to jail.</span> <span id="s2698">Doesn’t matter who – who – who is at fault, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2699">Q: Who’s at fault, yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2700">A2: So Moshe said, I can’t run away, I’ll stay.</span> <span id="s2701">Just only you go home.</span> <span id="s2702">Because why should we both, you know?</span> <span id="s2703">And he was the driver anyhow.</span> <span id="s2704">So I – I went home.</span> <span id="s2705">I don’t remember how I got home, because he stayed with the car.</span> <span id="s2706">And they took him to jail.</span> <span id="s2707">So, you’ll tell what happened in jail, but I’ll tell you what happened in Mexico.</span> <span id="s2708">I went – I came home – we have – we have friends, as it happens, these very, very, very rich people, very.</span> <span id="s2709">And I told them the story, they took Moshe to jail.</span> <span id="s2710">What – what to do?</span> <span id="s2711">I told them when it happened, told them where.</span> <span id="s2712">So he said, leave it to me.</span> <span id="s2713">He starts calling around.</span> <span id="s2714">What happened, he could – they couldn’t find him.</span> <span id="s2715">They didn’t know which jail he is.</span> <span id="s2716">Why?</span> <span id="s2717">Because – because the man, the injured man was an officer, they didn’t take him to – they took him to a – a hospital, an army office – in the ar – in the army, yeah?</span> <span id="s2718">So that people couldn’t find him, they didn’t know.</span> <span id="s2719">They checked all the civil hospitals, no, couldn’t find him.</span> <span id="s2720">And they couldn’t find him, they can’t do anything.</span> <span id="s2721">So later Moshe told me that he was in jail, sitting in a chair.</span> <span id="s2722">It – they didn’t even –</span></p> <p><span id="s2723">A: Not just sitting in a chair, I walked around all the night – A2: The whole night, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2724">A: – in the yard, I wouldn’t sit

Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2736">A: – I wouldn’t sit with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2737">A2: And it was Pesach, cause he wouldn’t eat anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2738">A: All the night walking around.</span></p> <p><span id="s2739">A2: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2740">Not drinking a f – glass of water, no for food [indecipherable] yeah.</span> <span id="s2741">Okay, so this

right?</span> <span id="s2818">What trouble?</span> <span id="s2819">And I asked Moshe, tell me the truth, because Moshe [indecipherable] he never liked to tell me bad news.</span> <span id="s2820">He used to tell me bad news much later.</span> <span id="s2821">Can you imagine when my mother passed away in Israel and he didn’t tell me.</span> <span id="s2822">He got a phone call, and he didn’t tell me.</span> <span id="s2823">What – can you imagine?</span> <span id="s2824">An-Anyhow, so I’d – I said, Moshe, look, this is the time, no secrets.</span> <span id="s2825">Tell me what – when – do you

different.</span> <span id="s2831">When we want to call it’s night there, an-and he’s a very busy man.</span> <span id="s2832">I think he’s tried three time til we got him, too.</span> <span id="s2833">When we got him, what happened?</span> <span id="s2834">So – yeah, first thing Moshe calls, he said, Moshe, where are you?</span> <span id="s2835">You’re not in jail?</span> <span id="s2836">Where you calling from?</span> <span id="s2837">He said home.</span> <span id="s2838">You’re not in jail?</span> <span id="s2839">No, what jail?</span> <span id="s2840">So I heard y-yo – I

<span id="s3092">But, he was chazzan in the big synagogue, Beth Shalom, from ’76 til ’80.</span> <span id="s3093">He had a problem, Moshe had a problem with the shul.</span> <span id="s3094">Was the

Epstein(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s3123">A2: – in ’80, Moshe started –</span></p> <p><span id="s3124">A: Not Epstein(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s3125">A2: Moshe started discussing with them, he wants a – they should take out the microphone.</span> <span id="s3126">And they didn’t agree, so the – to make the story short, Moshe left the position.</span> <span id="s3127">And since then, all the time we’re living here, he became a free –</span></p> <p><span id="s3128">A: Freelancer.</span></p> <p><span id="s3129">A2: – freelancer.</span> <span id="s3130">Freelancer.</span> <span id="s3131">So

<p><span id="s3144">Q: – [indecipherable] oh, but not for Pesach.</span> <span id="s3145">Not for Pesach, they came home –</span></p> <p><span id="s3146">A: What wa – what was their –</span></p>

hotels.</span></p> <p><span id="s3164">A2: Yeah, because the owner of the hotel then was Chazzan Shainey(ph), when Moshe was 18 years old, Chazzan Siegirt(ph).</span> <span id="s3165">So he was Chazzan Shainey(ph), right?</span></p> <p><span id="s3166">A: His father was Chazzan Shainey(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s3167">A2: His father?</span> <span id="s3168">Oh, his father was,

Brody(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s3375">A2: During the war, during the war.</span> <span id="s3376">Before –</span></p> <p><span id="s3377">A: During the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s3378">A2: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3379">A: And all of a sudden came in a Israeli officer who came from somewhere from Africa where there are very few [indecipherable] and they let him off for a week to have an – A2: Holiday?</span> <span id="s3380">A break?</span></p> <p><span id="s3381">A: – in – in – in Cairo.</span> <span id="s3382">It was in Cairo, that they should have a hol – a holiday there.</span> <span id="s3383">And he came in in the hotel, he stood around with chew – two chief rabbis.</span> <span id="s3384">He sat down with the two chief rabbis, and he ma – and he ma – in talking, he told them a story that when he arrived – A2: In Lorenzo marques.</span> <span id="s3385">Lorenzo marques?</span></p> <p><span id="s3386">A: – in – in – in – in Lorenzo marques.</span></p>

In Yiddish, in Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s3398">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3399">A2: In Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s3400">A: [indecipherable] dollar [Yiddish] So from there, he remembers that her name is Rochel(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s3401">A2: So many years later, can you imagine, when he was told that two Jewish women here, say, is one of them Rochel(ph).</span> <span id="s3402">You can’t win [indecipherable] Okay, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s3403">A: This is a true story.</span></p> <p><span id="s3404">A2: Okay, so – yeah.</span> <span id="s3405">And then – this was Lorenzo marques, but what was with Kariba dam and – and Victoria Falls, it’s interesting.</span> <span id="s3406">We toured, by car, we went with another couple, one of these friends from Johannesburg, we went to Rhodesia, north Rhodesia first, which is today Zambia.</span> <span id="s3407">Zambia, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3408">Q: Zimbabwe.</span></p> <p><span id="s3409">A2: No,

natural dam.</span></p> <p><span id="s3419">A2: No, there isn’t such a thing and ach – they build the dam.</span></p> <p><span id="s3420">A: They build the dam?</span></p> <p><span id="s3421">A2: Of course, they build it for years.</span> <span id="s3422">And they told us how many people, brought a lot of people from Italy, workers, how many killed – were killed by lions, animals, because you know, it was the city, it was the jungle, or whatever.</span> <span id="s3423">So we saw the dam, we were very, very impressed.</span> <span id="s3424">Very impressed.</span> <span id="s3425">Later, when we came to Victoria Falls, which is in the border of s-s – South Africa and ziba – then it was south Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, we saw the Victoria Falls.</span> <span id="s3426">Well, when we saw the first time, Moshe started singing ca – I remember every word.</span> <span id="s3427">[sings in Yiddish] Because it’s so mighty, it’s unbelievable.</span> <span id="s3428">And what was so

a film and now you have one.</span> <span id="s3443">And that’s it?</span> <span id="s3444">Because it’s no comparison.</span> <span id="s3445">First of all, at that time when we were there, I don’t

koleshem(ph) bada(ph), koleshem(ph) bakurach(ph).</span> <span id="s3455">Yeah, and you said, this was man-made and this was nature.</span> <span id="s3456">This is what God made, look what he made.</span> <span id="s3457">Yeah, this is what I wanted to tell you the story about.</span> <span id="s3458">Yeah, and of course, he – when we were in Lorenzo marques, when we walked back singing, I told you, I called them all to come to my room in hotel, and I gave them cholent.</span> <span id="s3459">Ah, this was an event, they talked about this cholent for – for years, because they never expected it, you know, to eat in – in a [indecipherable] so much cholent for Shabbas.</span> <span id="s3460">Yeah, okay, so this was that.</span> <span id="s3461">[inaudible] Yeah, this other thing I
