happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">He died in Mauthausen .</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Do you know the date?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">As I found out, probably it was the 10th of May, one day after the Americans liberated them.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">What did he die of?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Probably of starvation and - who knows?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">What was your father’s occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">He was a timber and veneer merchant - wholesale and retail.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Tell me how much were you involved in Jewish culture life in [Ujpest?]</span> <span id="s27">?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Well, very little really.</span> <span id="s29">Because, well, in those times, someway, we didn’t have much religious teaching.</span> <span id="s30">Didn’t have much religious teaching.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">And we were always Jewish.</span> <span id="s32">We kept all the holidays and so on, but that was as far as it went.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">So you didn’t actually went into some special Jewish company?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">All my friends were Jewish but not in any organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Did you have any Christian friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Well, there were a few, but none of them very close.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Yes, and .</span> <span id="s39">.</span> <span id="s40">What was like to grow up in Hungary in this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Well, I can speak of myself.</span> <span id="s42">We had no problem before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Well there was some anti-Semitism - now and then some unpleasant remarks and all that but that was all.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">We were in good financial circumstances so we really didn’t have any problem ‘til just about ‘44 when the Germans came in and took over Hungary.</span> <span id="s45">And then it started.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">That was 19th March?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">19th of March.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">And what happened when the Nazis began to arrive actually?</span> <span id="s49">Did you sort of feel anything before?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Before?</span> <span id="s51">Yes, well it was unpleasantness but nothing more.</span> <span id="s52">So let’s say it didn’t touch us very close.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Your father’s business was in [??]</span> <span id="s54">Not before that.</span> <span id="s55">Not before that.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">He could keep his business right up to the Germans came in??</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">And what about at school?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">At School there were some boys who spoke up against the Jews, and it happened that I hit them.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">You had fights?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Yes, but nothing serious really.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">And your parents you say were not affected by anti-Semitism much Well as far as I know, not very much.</span> <span id="s63">So it was mainly unpleasant.</span> <span id="s64">That’s about all I can say.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Do you have any special education.</span> <span id="s66">?</span> <span id="s67">Jewish education?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Jewish education no.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Just what the… Just what We had some Jewish education lessons in the school.</span> <span id="s70">As the best one hour a week.</span> <span id="s71">That was all.</span> <span id="s72">And of course I studied for my bar mizvah.</span> <span id="s73">I had my Bar Mitzvah Did you know about Jewishishness besides eh.</span> <span id="s74">.</span> <span id="s75">?</span> <span id="s76">Yes, yes well we were very much Jewish, all of us.</span> <span id="s77">Yes, you know everything er.</span> <span id="s78">.</span> <span id="s79">?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">And when did you have initial contact with Nazi occupation?</span> <span id="s82">Only on the 19th of March?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">19th of March, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">What was the nature of the encounter?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Well, I was still attending school and the fact was that the German soldiers were standing on the street catching people.</span> <span id="s86">And we had to go on side streets to avoid them.</span> <span id="s87">And well that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">And they were standing on the main street?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">On the main street.</span> <span id="s90">And as I said, I had a few proper nice Christian boys and they went ahead and came back to tell “Go the other way”.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">What did they do, the Germans, when they caught the people?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Nobody knows.</span> <span id="s93">They disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">They disappeared?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Well as far as I know.</span> <span id="s96">I never heard of them again.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Did you have any responses from Gentiles, or any reactions from them?</span> <span id="s98">Besides your school mates?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Besides…Not really only the anti-Semitism came out more than ever.</span> <span id="s100">Because they were free, completely free to express their real feelings.</span> <span id="s101">That’s about all.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Yes, and just tell me what happened in 1944 to your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">In 1944, nothing special til the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s104">At that time.</span> <span id="s105">.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">I mean after the Germans came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">When the Germans came in I was still in school.</span> <span id="s108">They came in on the 19th of March.</span> <span id="s109">I had my matriculation on … if I remember well on the 22nd of April.</span> <span id="s110">I already had it with the yellow star on, and after that.</span> <span id="s111">.</span> <span id="s112">three weeks after the matriculation I was called up and taken to Bor.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Yes.</span> <span id="s114">What was the date then?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">I seem to remember it was the 21st of May when I went to Vac.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Were you taken to Bor by the Germans or the Hungarians?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Well the commander on the train was Hungarian, and I didn’t see a German soldier on the train.</span> <span id="s118">So it must have been the Hungarians.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">What was the commander like?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Oh, well I think I saw him once when the train stopped and everybody run to the water.</span> <span id="s121">And I heard him saying – “These filthy Jews always want to wash.”</span> <span id="s122">That’s about all I can say about him.</span> <span id="s123">I remember his name [Karoly??]</span> <span id="s124">.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Do you know what happened to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">No, no.</span> <span id="s127">I don’t think he was a bad man.</span> <span id="s128">He didn’t do anything bad on the way.</span> <span id="s129">So there was nothing special I can say about him.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">What about the other soldiers who were looking after you or guarding you?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Well there was one soldier in our wagon.</span> <span id="s132">We had to mind his gun.</span> <span id="s133">He was an old man and he had no idea what’s going on in the world.</span> <span id="s134">An old peasant.</span> <span id="s135">He didn’t have the slightest idea where we are going, what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Weren’t they told?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Obviously not, or if they were told, he didn’t understand.</span> <span id="s138">Very primitive, but he was OK.</span> <span id="s139">As long as we left him alone he left us alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">How many were in the wagon?</span> <span id="s141">You were in a cattle wagon?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Yes, in a cattle wagon.</span> <span id="s143">It was full.</span> <span id="s144">I would say about 70 or 80.</span> <span id="s145">So, when we lay down for the night, everybody had to turn the other side together, otherwise – no go.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">What was your sanitation?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">There wasn’t any.</span> <span id="s148">The door was open a little bit and two people held the third one out.</span> <span id="s149">Hanging out.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">What about food?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Well we got very little, but we had some food from home.</span> <span id="s152">So nobody was hungry in the way out.</span> <span id="s153">It took if I remember rightly it took about five days to get to Bor, but we were not really hungry then.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">So you arrived to Bor five days after you started out.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Yes on a …they changed it to a narrow gauge railway in Serbia.</span> <span id="s156">It was an open cattle wagon then.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">We stood there, stacked up.</span> <span id="s158">And we arrived and we went through a gate and the first thing was the gallows.</span> <span id="s159">The rope was hanging with a noose there.</span> <span id="s160">That was the first thing we saw there.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">And then we had to stand up there and came the commandant.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Hungarian or?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Hungarian.</span> <span id="s164">Murai.</span> <span id="s165">And he pointed at a mountain and said “You see that mountain?</span> <span id="s166">You won’t go home before you level it”.</span> <span id="s167">Well we didn’t take him seriously.</span> <span id="s168">We were number one young and didn’t know what goes on very much.</span> <span id="s169">Number two we were expecting the partisans every minute.</span> <span id="s170">Because we saw their work all the way.</span> <span id="s171">All the trains were blown up.</span> <span id="s172">And we saw a peasant riding a horse next to us, had a good look at us, went away, and we went through, while all the other trains were blown up.</span> <span id="s173">They knew who we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">So what happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">So we were waiting for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">And we kept waiting and waiting and waiting for four months and then they came and they liberated us.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">So in eh.</span> <span id="s178">.</span> <span id="s179">Did you actually eh.</span> <span id="s180">.</span> <span id="s181">That was your first place, your first labour?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Yes, that was the only one really.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">And you were 18 years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Yes I was 17 then.</span> <span id="s185">I was .</span> <span id="s186">.</span> <span id="s187">We left Bor.</span> <span id="s188">.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">They said they were taking us back to Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Yes but we are talking about when you were drafted into the labour camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">I was 17 then.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">You were 17.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Did you actually know where you were going, or rather, that it was a forced labour camp you were going to?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A forced labour camp.</span> <span id="s195">That’s what we know.</span> <span id="s196">We never heard of Bor before.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">But you knew that it was a labour camp you went to?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Oh yes,yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">I see.</span> <span id="s200">And.</span> <span id="s201">.</span> <span id="s202">How many Jews were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">In Bor?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">No, in your place, in…Your um.</span> <span id="s205">.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Town?</span> <span id="s207">In Ujpest?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">No.</span> <span id="s209">How many Jews were actually in Bor where you were together with?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Oh in Bor?</span> <span id="s211">Well, in our.</span> <span id="s212">.</span> <span id="s213">There were different lagers there.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">In your unit I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">In our unit, about 250.</span> <span id="s216">250?</span> <span id="s217">Roughly, roughly.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Were [all ] Jews there?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Well there were Jews or there were some who were well, Jews who converted to Christianity.</span> <span id="s220">They had white arm band instead of yellow.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">But not real Christians?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Well not born Christian.</span> <span id="s223">Or perhaps they were born, perhaps their parents were Jewish.</span> <span id="s224">So anyway they were considered Jews by the Nazi laws.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">And tell me what was the attitude of the officers towards the Jews?</span> <span id="s226">In Bor?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">In that camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">In that camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Well we had one Hungarian officer there who had only one important problem there - -how much is there to drink?</span> <span id="s230">Otherwise he left us alone.</span> <span id="s231">I don’t even know if I ever saw him at all, only from far.</span> <span id="s232">Our commander really was a sergeant who was an idiot and a sadist.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A sadist?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Yes he was beating the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Because he enjoyed his power.</span> <span id="s237">Simply, that was the simple reason.</span> <span id="s238">He was caught after the war mind you, and got 15 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Do you know his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">[Sbrunek??]</span></p> <p><span id="s241">What nationality?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Hungarian.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Probably some Yugoslav origin, sounds like it, but he was Hungarian.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Did somebody report him?</span> <span id="s245">Or how was he caught?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Oh well I don’t know.</span> <span id="s247">Only, we were back in Budapest and I heard the story that he was caught and he got 15 years.</span> <span id="s248">I don’t know how he was caught.</span> <span id="s249">I don’t know the details.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Where is actually Bor?</span> <span id="s251">Could you tell me exactly?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Yes, in Yugoslavia there is a corner where Yugoslavia Rumania and Bulgaria meet.</span> <span id="s253">And it’s in that corner.</span> <span id="s254">So we saw the English American aeroplanes every day by hundreds every day above us.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">We knew if they go north it’s Rumania, if they turned south, it’s Bulgaria.</span> <span id="s256">Some way they always turned above us.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">But they didn’t bomb you?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Never.</span> <span id="s259">They were shot at.</span> <span id="s260">And actually I remember they shot down three aeroplanes,</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Above us.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">And they bailed out, we saw the parachutes coming out.</span> <span id="s264">The Germans run to catch them, [but] they never found them.</span> <span id="s265">The partisans were there already.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Who was shooting?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">The Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">So you were surrounded by Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Oh, the German army was there.</span> <span id="s270">Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">And you didn’t have anything to do with the Germans yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Yes, we worked under the German Todtist organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">What is the Todtist?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">That was the work organization of the German army.</span> <span id="s275">So we worked during the day with them, and every evening they gave us back to the Hungarian commandant.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">And how did they behave towards you?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">We never had any problem with the Germans, only the Hungarians.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Is that so?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Well they wanted you to work, but as long as you worked it was alright.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">In fact it’s very interesting that the boss of the … I don’t know his rank you know, of the Todtists there…was a very nice man from Vienna, who found a man among us who was his boss before the war.</span> <span id="s281">And he helped him in any way.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">And well, it was a good custom with us that if any Todtist came .</span> <span id="s283">.</span> <span id="s284">well, we tried to sleep a bit.</span> <span id="s285">If any Totist came whoever saw him he shouted “Odon!”</span> <span id="s286">.</span> <span id="s287">And one day this boss came and nobody noticed him and so he arrived there and he shouted “Big Odon!”</span> <span id="s288">.</span> <span id="s289">So he was a very nice man really, and he… Odon was the name of that man was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">No, it was just a silly Hungarian name.</span> <span id="s291">It was just a code name that somebody is coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Ah yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">And actually he comforted us that it won’t last long.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Bor had a reputation actually that it was one of the worst labour camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Well, for some people.</span> <span id="s296">Because some people worked in the copper mine, and that was very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">We were building a railway.</span> <span id="s298">Which wasn’t that bad.</span> <span id="s299">It was hard work and well we didn’t get, practically food, at this time.</span> <span id="s300">So we were very hungry.</span> <span id="s301">But I don’t think it was too bad there.</span> <span id="s302">Well, er, we had I think seven people died in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">What from?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">One probably died of starvation.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Weren’t you actually fed enough?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">No, no it was practically nothing.</span> <span id="s307">But the main problem with this man was of course again, he was a very religious Jew.</span> <span id="s308">And he only ate something … anything which was kosher.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">In Bor.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">In Bor.</span> <span id="s311">Which was actually against the religion because save your life was the first thing.</span> <span id="s312">So anyway.</span> <span id="s313">.</span> <span id="s314">The other six died in a storm.</span> <span id="s315">They were swept off the mountain.</span> <span id="s316">Terrible storms there.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">You actually had to climb up the mountain?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Well it was all mountains.</span> <span id="s319">Terrible up and down and we worked in the mountains.</span> <span id="s320">Building that railway.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Inside?</span> <span id="s322">In the mountain?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">No.</span> <span id="s324">On.</span> <span id="s325">Through the mountains.</span> <span id="s326">Up and down.</span> <span id="s327">And of course we had no shoes.</span> <span id="s328">That was the first thing, they took away our shoes, so.</span> <span id="s329">.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">What was did you put on your feet?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Barefooted , or some, oh, wooden how do you call that - thongs you would call it here, but very primitive.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">And sanitation?</span> <span id="s333">How was it there?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Well it was - in the camp - latrine.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">What sort of camps were you in?</span> <span id="s336">Was it a proper.</span> <span id="s337">.</span> <span id="s338">camp, or building?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Well there were two buildings there.</span> <span id="s340">A third one was for the guards of course, which was the only proper building.</span> <span id="s341">Well it was full of bedbugs, lice and fleas.</span> <span id="s342">But when I say lice, it means that you could grab it by the handful really.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">You didn’t get sick with the typhus?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Well luckily we were there only for four months.</span> <span id="s345">Perhaps that’s what it is.</span> <span id="s346">But, actually, strangely enough there few sick people.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">There was a bad thing, of course, this lack of vitamin.</span> <span id="s348">And I remember that I was in the sick bay too at the end, because I couldn’t stand on my legs – they were full of sores, which didn’t heal.</span> <span id="s349">It was lack of vitamin.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Just the same when they said we are going home, you can stay here if you can’t walk, I stood up and went.</span> <span id="s351">And walked I think some five hundred kilometers, up and down in the mountains.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">So um, so you were in Bor for some four months?</span> <span id="s353">Yes.</span> <span id="s354">Well we left Bor on the 29th of September 1944.</span> <span id="s355">And what happened after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">We were taken by two stages – they said we are going home – to Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">The first stage was 4000 people.</span> <span id="s358">And of course we were very sad that we were left until the second stage.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">How many people were there altogether?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">6000.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">We were very sad that we were left and only later we found out that they killed all the 4000.</span> <span id="s362">I think about 50 people came home.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">How did they do it?</span> <span id="s364">They just shot them.</span> <span id="s365">Who did?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">German SS.</span> <span id="s367">On the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">I don’t remember the place, I knew the place where it happened.</span> <span id="s369">This famous poet Radnoti Miklos was among them.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Then they just lined them up and shot them.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Shot 4000 people?</span> <span id="s373">Just like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">And no other reason just because they were Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Oh yes, yes.</span> <span id="s377">Actually I know one who escaped.</span> <span id="s378">He was standing there already, and he started to sing and dance and when they were surprised he ran away in the darkness.</span> <span id="s379">And somehow succeeded.</span> <span id="s380">I met him in Budapest.</span> <span id="s381">Bandi Andre was quite a name.</span> <span id="s382">He was writing plays.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Plays?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Plays for theatres.</span> <span id="s385">He was writing plays and articles in newspapers.</span> <span id="s386">He was a very nice man.</span> <span id="s387">He was the only one I know of who.</span> <span id="s388">.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">How did you find out that these people were shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Later on, from the partisans.</span> <span id="s391">Later on with this second stage, we left later, and – on the 29th of September and on the way as we went in big fog, among the mountains suddenly we saw a partisan standing there, on the road.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">What nationality?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Serbian.</span> <span id="s394">Tito partisans.</span> <span id="s395">And then we saw another one, and a third one and we hardly dared to look at them.</span> <span id="s396">We had 200 Hungarian guard in the front, 200 at the back behind us going with machine guns and all that and plus a German Tiger tank in the front.</span> <span id="s397">Didn’t know what goes on.</span> <span id="s398">And then we found out – they captured us.</span> <span id="s399">One partisan jumped out on the road in front of the commandant, grabbed him – “Surrender!”</span> <span id="s400">And he surrendered.</span> <span id="s401">Didn’t dare to fight with them.</span> <span id="s402">We were surrounded by the partisans, as we found it out.</span> <span id="s403">So they found out what happened to the first 4000, and that’s why they freed us.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">They couldn’t help them before they were shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Well they didn’t.</span> <span id="s406">That was….</span> <span id="s407">They didn’t expect it perhaps.</span> <span id="s408">I don’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s409">But they found out what happened, so they stopped us.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Then you were walking?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Then we were… They took us into the mountains.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">What mountains were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">The Serbian mountains, who knows what is the name – one after the other, you know.</span> <span id="s414">And then they told us the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Who was that?</span> <span id="s416">The partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Tito partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">At that time you weren’t under the Germans or.</span> <span id="s419">.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">No, no.</span> <span id="s421">They captured all this 400, and as I heard they hanged them all.</span> <span id="s422">I’m not sure about that but that’s what they said.</span> <span id="s423">And they told us what happened and we at once told them we want to be partisans too.</span> <span id="s424">Good, then come to the headquarters.</span> <span id="s425">And then we went for five days, wait a minute, eight days, eight days and that was about 500 kilometres.</span> <span id="s426">Now and then the Germans were bombing us with aeroplanes, they were after us.</span> <span id="s427">And they took us back to Bor, which was already occupied by the Russian army.</span> <span id="s428">And there the partisans : “Now, come on, put the ammunition on the trucks!”</span> <span id="s429">And we couldn’t move the ammunition, which one of them threw up on the truck.</span> <span id="s430">Four of us couldn’t move it.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">The partisan’s ammunition?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Yes.</span> <span id="s433">I don’t know, and then they said Go to hell!</span> <span id="s434">And so we went, and we lived begging and stealing food.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">So you left Bor again a second time?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Yes, and on our own.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">And begging and stealing food we went to Rumania.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">How many kilometers were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Oh, I don’t know how many - it wasn’t far…On some of the way we went on Russian trucks, you know.</span> <span id="s441">.</span> <span id="s442">They gave us some lifts, and we arrived to Turnu Severin.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Where is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">In Rumania.</span> <span id="s445">We just crossed the Danube, and there was Turnu Severin.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">[How do you spell it?]</span> <span id="s447">I’ll write it down.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">[Spell it for the interview] Oh!</span> <span id="s449">Just a minute.</span> <span id="s450">T-u-r-n-u S-e-v-e-r-i-n.</span> <span id="s451">It’s a beautiful town on the Danube.</span> <span id="s452">And we got a wonderful reception from the Jews there.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">From the Rumanian Jews?</span> <span id="s454">From the Rumanian Jews.</span> <span id="s455">Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">They gave us everything it was possible to imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">What date was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Well, it was end of October.</span> <span id="s459">I remember we were in Negotin, a Serbian town on our way to the border, How do you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">N-e-g-o-t-i-n.</span> <span id="s461">And that’s where we heard the radio and it said the date - the 20th of October.</span> <span id="s462">Well, from there, well, perhaps one or two days to get to Rumania.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">So I would say… So that part of the countries…Rumania, Yugoslavia?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">It was all under the Russians It was occupied by the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Yes.</span> <span id="s467">Yes.</span> <span id="s468">So we were free.</span> <span id="s469">Went to Rumania, and er, really wonderful reception.</span> <span id="s470">We never stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">[.</span> <span id="s472">.]</span> <span id="s473">Well we never stopped eating.</span> <span id="s474">They dressed up us and we were taken to families.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">They weren’t.</span> <span id="s476">.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Timisuara They [the Jews] weren’t bothered by the Germans as much as the Hungarian Jews were?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">No, for one good reason, that, as I heard it, and I can believe it, seeing what goes on there, they bribed the king, and the government.</span> <span id="s479">So they were left alone.</span> <span id="s480">So the Jews were OK there.</span> <span id="s481">Except in the part where the Hungarians went in.</span> <span id="s482">They killed the Jews – the Hungarians.</span> <span id="s483">But the Rumanians were bribed properly, and they left the Jews alone.</span> <span id="s484">I suppose they had unpleasantness and this and that, but - nothing serious as far as I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Actually, anti-Semitism wasn’t that serious in Rumania?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Probably not.</span> <span id="s487">Probably not.</span> <span id="s488">There was.</span> <span id="s489">.</span> <span id="s490">after all there was the Iron Guard which was the Nazi Party there, but it seemed that they couldn’t achieve what they wanted .</span> <span id="s491">.</span> <span id="s492">the Iron Guard.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Now I have to change the tape.</span> <span id="s494">Just one moment please.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">This is the second side of the first tape.</span> <span id="s496">Interviewing Mr. John Weiszmann from Maroubra.</span> <span id="s497">Yes Mr. Weiszmann?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">From Turnu Severin we went to Timisuara, and that’s where we were given out to Jewish families, and we got everything we could want.</span> <span id="s499">We were dressed up with new clothes and food, and even pocket money every week, which I myself went to the opera, bought up all the tickets for the week, and spent the rest in a patisserie, on cakes.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Did they have so much to eat there?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">It was fantastic.</span> <span id="s502">They were so rich in food.</span> <span id="s503">In the most peaceful Hungary I never saw that kind of food, than in Rumania after the war.</span> <span id="s504">It was first class.</span> <span id="s505">Of course we were starved out, so everything was good for us, but I think whatever way I look at it it was first class food.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Yes but it was… And as much as you wanted.</span> <span id="s507">And cheap, even for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">How long did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Well, we stayed there really until the middle of February, when Budapest was freed.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">From September?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">No, from end of October.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">October.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Til February ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Yes, and …</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Except .</span> <span id="s516">.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">It was all 2000 people there?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">No, they went to different…some of them went to Timisuara, some to Arad, and some very soon went to Seged, which is a .</span> <span id="s519">.</span> <span id="s520">south – town in the south of Hungary – that was liberated soon.</span> <span id="s521">But many of us waited until we can go home to Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Yes, So, anyway not 6000, only 2000.</span> <span id="s523">And even that’s not all, because about 300 was left in Bor who were really sick.</span> <span id="s524">And er.</span> <span id="s525">.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">In Bor.</span> <span id="s528">In a hospital.</span> <span id="s529">They called it hospital – it was a big barn.</span> <span id="s530">And actually, as we heard it later, after we left the Germans set it on fire.</span> <span id="s531">But everybody escaped.</span> <span id="s532">The partisans broke in from the back of the hospital, and got them all out.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">I thought that they were already liberated from the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">No, when we left Bor for the first time.</span> <span id="s535">Not when the partisans took us back.</span> <span id="s536">That’s when it happened.</span> <span id="s537">That’s when the Germans tried to burn them.</span> <span id="s538">But they didn’t succeed.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">How come ?</span> <span id="s540">The Germans were.</span> <span id="s541">.</span> <span id="s542">?</span> <span id="s543">When you first left… Let’s make this clear : when you first left Bor .</span> <span id="s544">.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">It was.</span> <span id="s547">.</span> <span id="s548">Did you say it was liberated already?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">No, not yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">No it wasn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">No, we went under the German and Hungarian commandant.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Yes.</span> <span id="s553">And then you met these partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Yes.</span> <span id="s555">And then we went around for eight days and then we got back to Bor, and the Russians were already there.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">And in between this, the first and second time,</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">you were in Bor, these people were burnt?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">They were not burned.</span> <span id="s560">They only tried to burn them but as I say the partisans rescued them all.</span> <span id="s561">Partisans rescued them all.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Well that’s what we heard.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">That was the time when the Germans tried.</span> <span id="s565">.</span> <span id="s566">tried to harm them?</span> <span id="s567">Yes In these eight days?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Anyway let’s go back to Timisuara.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">We were in Timisuara and then after a while, probably because we were young and restless, we went to Bucharest.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">How far is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Oh, about a thousand kilometers.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">How did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">On train.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">On train?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">The trains were running?</span> <span id="s577">Everything was so.</span> <span id="s578">.</span> <span id="s579">?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Oh yes, yes, everything, trams.</span> <span id="s581">.</span> <span id="s582">everything.</span> <span id="s583">There was nothing damaged there really.</span> <span id="s584">Well, not obviously at least.</span> <span id="s585">We didn’t see any real damage.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">We went to Bucharest, and we spent there I think only three days.</span> <span id="s588">Slept in empty offices.</span> <span id="s589">One night we slept in a Zionist headquarters.</span> <span id="s590">And another night in the Scantea Publishers.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">What was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">That was the publisher of the communist newspaper.</span> <span id="s593">And they threw a bomb in it too that night.</span> <span id="s594">We didn’t… We only found out in the morning – we slept.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">You weren’t hurt at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">No.</span> <span id="s597">No I don’t think anybody was hurt.</span> <span id="s598">It was a big building and I don’t know where it happened, but.</span> <span id="s599">.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">We just slept through it.</span> <span id="s601">And the next day, well you couldn’t get on the train back from Bucharest, because even the roof of the train was full, so we bought a passenger wagon, no a cattle wagon.</span> <span id="s602">From a porter.</span> <span id="s603">That’s how it goes in Rumania.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">You actually bought it for money?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Yes.</span> <span id="s606">For a thousand lei.</span> <span id="s607">Something which is very little money.</span> <span id="s608">But he connected it to the train.</span> <span id="s609">He connected it to the train, and three of us travelled in luxury there, ‘til Brashow, when the Russians kicked off everybody from the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Where is Brassow?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Brassow is in Transylvania.</span> <span id="s612">[South of?]</span> <span id="s613">It’s a beautiful old.</span> <span id="s614">.</span> <span id="s615">Town from the Middle ages, and it looks like it, in beautiful condition.</span> <span id="s616">Probably the most beautiful town I ever saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">And it wasn’t hurt by the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">No, it wasn’t hurt by anybody.</span> <span id="s619">And we stopped there.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">How do you spell it?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">B-r-a-s-s-o-w.</span> <span id="s622">And we arrived there.</span> <span id="s623">We were kicked off the train there on a Friday evening, so where to go?</span> <span id="s624">We went to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s625">And the Jews took us in.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A lot of Jews were there?</span> <span id="s627">Living there?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">I wouldn’t say a lot of, but quite a number.</span> <span id="s629">It’s not such a big town really.</span> <span id="s630">But there were some Jews and they took us home, and then they arranged for us to go to .</span> <span id="s631">.</span> <span id="s632">some.</span> <span id="s633">.</span> <span id="s634">on top of a truck.</span> <span id="s635">On top of a truck back to Timisuara, and well of course it was in December, terribly cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Why did they want you to go back to Timisuara?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Well we wanted to go back.</span> <span id="s638">We wanted to go home, after all, as soon as possible.</span> <span id="s639">We had nothing to do in Brassow.</span> <span id="s640">And well we got back after all.</span> <span id="s641">After some adventures.</span> <span id="s642">They had to scrape us off the truck because we had frozen to the truck.</span> <span id="s643">But…</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Open truck?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Yes open truck of course.</span> <span id="s646">So we got back to Timisuara and we stayed there until the middle of February.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">How many of you in this group?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Well, well, we were boys together, we were in school together.</span> <span id="s649">In the camp together.</span> <span id="s650">We started about 12 of us, but er, some of them didn’t come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">From where?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Well, they went with the first stage.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">With the first 4000?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Yes.</span> <span id="s655">With the first 4000.</span> <span id="s656">So, oh, I don’t know now.</span> <span id="s657">Suddenly I … Oh, five or six of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">That was a big help though.</span> <span id="s660">Probably that’s why we stayed alive.</span> <span id="s661">We were together and helped each other in everything.</span> <span id="s662">And middle of February went back to Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">From Timisuara?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">From Timisuara.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">How did you go back to Budapest?</span> <span id="s666">Walked, or?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">By train, by Russian truck, and by walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">How far is [??]</span> <span id="s669">?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">I can only guess – 3 - 400 kilometres.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">How long did it take you to go back?</span> <span id="s672">To get back then?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">That’s something I don’t really remember, but I don’t remember sleeping anywhere on the road, so perhaps we did it in one day, but I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Yes.</span> <span id="s675">During these times, travelling times who fed you?</span> <span id="s676">How did you got fed?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Well in Timisuara we lived with the Jewish families, so we were fed there, and we had some pocket money.</span> <span id="s678">So actually when we left Timisuara we filled up our rucksacks with a lot of.</span> <span id="s679">.</span> <span id="s680">with as much food as we could carry, so it was no real problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">And then you arrived home?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Arrived home.</span> <span id="s683">I found nobody at home except … What was the date?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Oh, I would say – around the 25th of February perhaps.</span> <span id="s685">But I’m not sure about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">The war wasn’t over yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">No, no, but Budapest was already freed.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Uh uh.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Went home.</span> <span id="s692">.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Both Buda and Pest?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Was free, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Or only Pest?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">No, both of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Went home.</span> <span id="s698">The only one I found there was our old dog.</span> <span id="s699">And some people lived there, Christians.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">In the same place?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">In our house.</span> <span id="s702">Well I kicked them out.</span> <span id="s703">So I told them: tomorrow you have to move out.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">And they did?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">They did.</span> <span id="s706">They were scared of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">And your parents – what happened?</span> <span id="s708">What?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">I didn’t know much about it.</span> <span id="s710">Well after all…Then I found out things about Auschwitz, and .</span> <span id="s711">.</span> <span id="s712">I didn’t know where they were taken.</span> <span id="s713">As it happened they were taken to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Both of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Yes.</span> <span id="s716">And, well, nobody ever saw my father again.</span> <span id="s717">My mother came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">When did she come back?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Um, in.</span> <span id="s720">.</span> <span id="s721">I think in August 1945.</span> <span id="s722">She was in Auschwitz, Bergen Belsen , and they worked in Magdeburg.</span> <span id="s723">Ammunition factory.</span> <span id="s724">And then they were liberated there.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">And from there she came straight home?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Yes.</span> <span id="s727">They mainly walked home.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Yes.</span> <span id="s729">What condition was she in when she came home?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Well she was very thin, but otherwise she was alright.</span> <span id="s731">She was 45 then.</span> <span id="s732">So, young, then.</span> <span id="s733">I met her on the station.</span> <span id="s734">Railway station.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Did you know that she was going to arrive?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">I was walking on the street when someone came and told :“Your mother is on the station”.</span> <span id="s737">So I run there at once.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">And found her there.</span> <span id="s739">That was in Ujpest?</span> <span id="s740">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">That is a… sort of a… Well, a district of Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">District of Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Today it’s called the Fourth District.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Well then we lived in our own house, and well, I was at the University then.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">What did you study?</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Medical.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Medical ?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Medical university.</span> <span id="s750">I actually did two and a half years in one and a half year.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Which one [??]</span> <span id="s752">Yes.</span> <span id="s753">And then I had to stop because, well we started our business, because we had to earn our living too.</span> <span id="s754">And opened the old business, and well, my mother couldn’t do it on her own.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Actually what happened between the time that your mother came home and you started the business.</span> <span id="s756">?</span> <span id="s757">How long time did it go?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Oh well, I think it must have been 1946, end of ’46 when we started the business.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">From ’45?</span> <span id="s760">.</span> <span id="s761">.</span> <span id="s762">when did she come home?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">She came home end of ’45 I mean in August.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">August.</span> <span id="s765">And what did you live on?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Probably nothing, thinking of it.</span> <span id="s767">But – number one we had a goat.</span> <span id="s768">So I had milk.</span> <span id="s769">And then, …</span></p> <p><span id="s770">In Ujpest?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s772">We got that goat when the war started and it was difficult to get milk, we got a goat.</span> <span id="s773">And it was still there.</span> <span id="s774">And then, and actually I went to the people I knew they had our money and other things hidden, What, your parents gave some money…?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s776">Of course then they denied I but I told them that’s alright, I believe every word of them, but I have a good friend in the KGB.</span> <span id="s777">I’ll ask them to go and look around.</span> <span id="s778">So at once they had our money.</span> <span id="s779">Of course I never had a friend at the KGB.</span> <span id="s780">So I got a little money here, and a little money there, but they stole an awful lot, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Could you buy food?</span> <span id="s782">Was it available?</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Well, not at the beginning, but at the beginning I had food because I brought a lot with me.</span> <span id="s784">And then, I remember the great day when I heard that you can get bean soup at a place.</span> <span id="s785">At the beginning I had bean soup every day.</span> <span id="s786">And so, I managed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">And so you went to university straight after you came home?</span> <span id="s788">Yes.</span> <span id="s789">After two-three weeks we decided with a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s790">.</span> <span id="s791">Universities were open?</span> <span id="s792">By then?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s794">Of course there was no transport, so we walked.</span> <span id="s795">From Ujpest we walked into the university every day, which was about ten kilometers.</span> <span id="s796">And walked home.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Well, there wasn’t that much teaching.</span> <span id="s798">I know the first day I went in they took me to the anatomy institute.</span> <span id="s799">“Go and cut”.</span> <span id="s800">There was a corpse.</span> <span id="s801">I didn’t know where to start – what to cut.</span> <span id="s802">But that’s how it started.</span> <span id="s803">And well, sooner or later it got more in order, but I think the main reason for that was they had too many corpses – they didn’t know what to do with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">What about the professors, the teachers?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Oh, there were some around, there were some around.</span> <span id="s806">And actually there were some first class professors there.</span> <span id="s807">And well, so I did that.</span> <span id="s808">It took one and a half years, and then I had to stop it and go to the business, which was of course nationalized in 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">So your business was… you started the business in ’46?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">’46?</span> <span id="s811">Probably.</span> <span id="s812">Probably the beginning of ’46.</span> <span id="s813">That was the same business what you had?</span> <span id="s814">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Your father had?</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Did you had materials to start with?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Well, there was some left.</span> <span id="s819">What they didn’t manage to steal yet.</span> <span id="s820">And well we had a good name so we got material from the factory in.</span> <span id="s821">.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">So there were factories around already working and.</span> <span id="s823">.</span> <span id="s824">?</span> <span id="s825">producing things.</span> <span id="s826">.</span> <span id="s827">?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Well, working slowly.</span> <span id="s829">.</span> <span id="s830">you know, if you had good connections, you could get something here and there.</span> <span id="s831">And well, we knew everybody then.</span> <span id="s832">.</span> <span id="s833">in the trade, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Yes, and .</span> <span id="s835">.</span> <span id="s836">Where could you sell your work?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">To the joiners.</span> <span id="s838">Joiners.</span> <span id="s839">Well, there were plenty in Ujpest – at least one joiner in every house.</span> <span id="s840">It was the centre of joinery in Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">And it was a lot of buildings to repair?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Yes.</span> <span id="s845">That too, but mainly furniture.</span> <span id="s846">Furniture, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">And of course the Nationalisation came in ’48, but we found it out one day earlier, .</span> <span id="s848">.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">What date was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Oh, I don’t remember the date, no.</span> <span id="s851">No I don’t remember the date.</span> <span id="s852">But one day earlier we found it out so we gave our licence back.</span> <span id="s853">Which was a good thing because.</span> <span id="s854">.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">To whom?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">I don’t know – to the Council, government or whatever.</span> <span id="s857">Which meant, they didn’t take it away.</span> <span id="s858">So we were left with the material, which we were able to sell slowly in the black market.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">But that’s interesting.</span> <span id="s860">They didn’t come after you to check?</span> <span id="s861">No, no, because officially our business didn’t exist.</span> <span id="s862">On that day.</span> <span id="s863">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">So we were left the business itself, which was a very big area.</span> <span id="s865">And actually we rented it out with the .</span> <span id="s866">.</span> <span id="s867">So it was all left.</span> <span id="s868">When my mother came out she sold it.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Before she came?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">So, what happened after ’48?</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Well, after that I tried a lot of things, and then I got a job at the – I don’t know how to say it in English – Bizomanyi Aruhaz – “Commission store” you could say, perhaps.</span> <span id="s873">.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Commission store, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">I became a valuer.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">What did you value?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Well, I valued just about everything – watches, photography equipment, instruments.</span> <span id="s878">.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">What do you mean valuer?</span> <span id="s880">What did you have to do.</span> <span id="s881">.</span> <span id="s882">?</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Well, people brought in second hand stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">And we took it in and sold it again.</span> <span id="s886">And I was the one who valued it.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Yes.</span> <span id="s888">.</span> <span id="s889">how much it …cost… And well, I did that until ’56, when I left.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">From ’48?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">No, I started it in ’50 – 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">There is a hiatus – when, I don’t know - I did little things.</span> <span id="s893">.</span> <span id="s894">I..</span> <span id="s895">I can’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">So you can’t remember what you did between ’48 and ’50?</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Not really.</span> <span id="s898">Not really.</span> <span id="s899">I..</span> <span id="s900">there was a time I studied upholstery, I know – worked in an upholstery shop.</span> <span id="s901">There was a time I went to learn to drive, which was quite a big business then, you know.</span> <span id="s902">It took some six weeks or what.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">What did you live on?</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Well, we had enough then, to live on, really.</span> <span id="s905">So we were not poor.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Yes.</span> <span id="s907">And in 1950.</span> <span id="s908">.</span> <span id="s909">?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">’50 I started as a valuer, until I left Hungary.</span> <span id="s911">In fact I got some decorations there.</span> <span id="s912">The ‘best worker of the trade’.</span> <span id="s913">And things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">That was under the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Oh, yes, under.</span> <span id="s916">.</span> <span id="s917">in Communism.</span> <span id="s918">Yes, and it was a good job really.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">How did you leave Hungary?</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Well, secretly.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Together with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s922">No, no.</span> <span id="s923">On my own, on my own.</span> <span id="s924">I was caught on the border the first time I went, but there were so many they just sent us home.</span> <span id="s925">So the next evening I walked through again.</span> <span id="s926">And I succeeded.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">And somebody would show you.</span> <span id="s928">.</span> <span id="s929">?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">No, on my own.</span> <span id="s931">In fact I think it was the real chutzpah, because I walked to the guard, who stood there with a machine gun, and walked to him, and I said “Good evening,” and walked through.</span> <span id="s932">He was just staring at me.</span> <span id="s933">And I walked through.</span> <span id="s934">I don’t know if it was luck or whatever, but, I got through.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">And where was that?</span> <span id="s936">Where did you go through?</span> <span id="s937">From where to where?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Oh, well, .</span> <span id="s939">.</span> <span id="s940">er.</span> <span id="s941">.</span> <span id="s942">I know I went to Gyor, and from there to the border…I don’t know the exact spot.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">And what was the country you walked in to?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">I went to Vienna.</span> <span id="s947">I was there for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">What happened to you mother in Hungary while you were away.</span> <span id="s949">.</span> <span id="s950">?</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Oh, she was alright.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Yes.</span> <span id="s953">She was alright.</span> <span id="s954">We kept correspondence and after five years she came out.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Officially?</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">To Australia?</span></p> <p><span id="s958">To Australia, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">So, in Vienna.</span> <span id="s960">.</span> <span id="s961">You went to Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Went to Vienna, and I was helped by the JOINT.</span> <span id="s963">And applied for the Australian landing permit.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Why Australian?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Because it was far enough from Europe.</span> <span id="s966">That was the main reason.</span> <span id="s967">And anyway I had a cousin here, and at least I thought I know somebody there.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">He is still here.</span> <span id="s970">So when I got the visa and as soon as it was possible I left Vienna.</span> <span id="s971">I went to Salzburg.</span> <span id="s972">I was in a camp there.</span> <span id="s973">And from Salzburg I came out.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">You were never married in Hungary, were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">No.</span> <span id="s976">No.</span> <span id="s977">I only got married when I was 37.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Oh?</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Better late than never.</span> <span id="s980">That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">So you came out to Australia ?</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">And to your cousin?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Well, I came to his place and as soon as I got a job I left him and went on my own.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">What job did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Well my first job was in a clockmaker factory.</span> <span id="s987">I told them I was the second best clockmaker in Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">I was prepared if they ask who was the first one I would say that he died.</span> <span id="s989">As a matter of fact I never saw clock making from close.</span> <span id="s990">But that didn’t matter – I did what the next one did and that was OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Except that they went broke.</span> <span id="s992">Then I left them.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Who went broke?</span></p> <p><span id="s994">The company.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Yes.</span> <span id="s996">Because of you, or.</span> <span id="s997">.</span> <span id="s998">?</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Not because of me, I think because of the foreman and the manager.</span> <span id="s1000">The manager was lying on the desk all day stone drunk and the foreman took at least a dozen clocks home every night.</span> <span id="s1001">So, not surprising they went broke.</span> <span id="s1002">And then I got a job at the ICI factory.</span> <span id="s1003">I was there for a few months, and then I got a job as a photographer.</span> <span id="s1004">And I did that for five years, and then I started my own photo studio, which I did ‘til ’77.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Anyway, so you got married here in Australia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Yes.</span> <span id="s1007">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">To an Australian lady?</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Who became a Jewess?</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">And you have children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Three children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Three children.</span> <span id="s1015">All Jewish of course?</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">All Jewish.</span> <span id="s1017">My little daughter just came back from Israel.</span> <span id="s1018">The.</span> <span id="s1019">.</span> <span id="s1020">My son is in Israel for a year in a kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1021">And my big daughter is still, well, working on her art.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Yes.</span> <span id="s1023">She is an artist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">She is an artist and .</span> <span id="s1025">.</span> <span id="s1026">She would like to go too, but she wants to finish things here at first.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Tell me, what do you think that you became a …?</span> <span id="s1028">What was the reason that you became a survivor after you were a victim?</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Well, you can say number one luck.</span> <span id="s1030">Number two, that we were together – young boys- we were already friends – we helped each other, and I think the way of looking at things.</span> <span id="s1031">It never once occurred to me that I won’t go home.</span> <span id="s1032">There was a friend of us, who was very pessimistic and he always said: We will never go home, we will never go home - and he didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">But I think our mentality really was that there’s no way that we would stay here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">And what made you do this interview?</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Well, I read about this invitation to it and I agree with the idea that these things should be kept – should be known, at least on paper, somewhere.</span> <span id="s1036">Nobody ever heard of Bor, as far as I can see, so it is time that there should be some mark of it left.</span> <span id="s1037">Actually I have a few friends who were in Bor.</span> <span id="s1038">Here, in Australia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Anyway, we’ve nearly finished our tape, and I just want to thank you very much for this interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Thank you for listening to it.</span> <span id="s1041">And it was very enlightening.</span> <span id="s1042">Well.</span> <span id="s1043">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Thank you.</span></p></body></html>
