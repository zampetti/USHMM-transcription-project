recently moved there?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s75">I think my father, maybe he was -- maybe.</span> <span id="s76">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: I -- with my mother I met when I was nearly 18 years old.</span> <span id="s79">I did not have a relationship with her before.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Well, explain this to us.</span> <span id="s81">How did it happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: My parents divorced after I was born when my father did not believe that I was his daughter, and -- but then I -- they put me with a couple they paid monthly to raise me, and I was by then nearly one-and-a-half years, and my mother was a picaflor.</span> <span id="s83">(Laughing.)</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: What does that mean?</span> <span id="s85">What does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: He liked all the flowers, men flowers.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s88">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: And so he -- he could not believe that I was his daughter, but when I grow a little bit older, I was the one what looked more like him.</span> <span id="s90">I had the same nose.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s92">So that's how they -- you know, in those days they didn't have DNA testing.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: And my father always said he had a Catholic nose, and I am born with a Catholic nose like he had.</span> <span id="s96">So my -- they divorced, and my mother disappeared.</span> <span id="s97">I think she went to Brazil.</span> <span id="s98">She lived in Brazil then.</span> <span id="s99">And years later, my father had -- she had a son, no, my brother, and one day when the -- he went out, and he saw his son looking between garbage; said, "What you are looking?"</span> <span id="s100">He said he is hungry.</span> <span id="s101">"You are hungry.</span> <span id="s102">Where is your mother?"</span> <span id="s103">"At home."</span> <span id="s104">"And why you are here?"</span> <span id="s105">"She sent me out."</span> <span id="s106">And then my father went to the judge and said, "I like to have the right of my children."</span> <span id="s107">So my mother -- they took her right away as mother to take care of the children, and he raised me and his -- my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: That sounds like a very sad beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s110">I never had a mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: And I think I can tell you I am grateful to her that she sent me the documents that I could come out from Germany, but she was a person that is very hard to believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: It is.</span> <span id="s114">It is.</span> <span id="s115">Tell me this, was your father -- were you close to your father as you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Oh, my father loved his children.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s118">And what are some of your earliest memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: My earliest memory?</span> <span id="s120">I had varied caretakers, what my father took for the half of his house and for to raise his children.</span> <span id="s121">We spoke only German at home.</span> <span id="s122">I didn't learn another language.</span> <span id="s123">And some of them I liked much, but some not so.</span> <span id="s124">We had some of them that teach me from Jesus Christos.</span> <span id="s125">I think they wanted to convert me when I was five years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: So you would have -- you would have caretakers who wanted to -- who wanted to save your soul, in other words?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s128">(Laughing.)</span> <span id="s129">It is funny.</span> <span id="s130">And – but we are not religious at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s132">That was my next question.</span> <span id="s133">So your father didn't go to synagogue much?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s135">I don't know.</span> <span id="s136">Maybe when he came to Germany and we lived on the _______strasse, and the ones near synagogue that he went by my brother, he took him to the synagogue, and I remember I must have been three or four years old, and my brother went to the synagogue, and they called him to the Torah – you know what is the Torah?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s138">Explain.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: And then I cried I like to go also, so they took me.</span> <span id="s140">And when they called my brother to the Torah, I said, "I like to go, too," so next time they put me pants on that I looked like a little boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: Really.</span> <span id="s142">Did your father have any of his own family in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: No.</span> <span id="s144">He had a cousin -- an uncle, yeah.</span> <span id="s145">It was a brother from his father.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: And -- but not a relationship because my father came to Germany, maybe he didn't speak German then and they made fun of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: Oh, I see.</span> <span id="s149">So he was -- I mean, he was actually quite alone in raising you and your brother?</span> <span id="s150">There wasn't any large -- you know, extended family to help?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: No.</span> <span id="s152">But, you know, neighbors, children from neighbors that were my age.</span> <span id="s153">And then my father, he had a store, a men's store, and he had a partner, and they lived near us, and they had three children, and the lady of the house, she always say about me, "She is sweet like sugar, but she is bitter like galla(ph)."</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s156">But her daughter what was more or less my age, maybe a year older, was not -- was a little bit handicapped --</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: -- mentally.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Oh, I see.</span> <span id="s160">So she was sad that --</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: But they divided.</span> <span id="s164">The partner moved out to another place, and

she was in Buenos Aires, they lived in Buenos Aires, and her older daughter died in France.</span> <span id="s173">She was older.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: The one who was handicapped?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: That was handicapped?</span> <span id="s176">Oh, she find a guy what married her.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s178">Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: And she was not very good -- good looking, and she -- and I went to the wedding.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Oh, did you?</span></p> <p><span

<p><span id="s312">Q: And he had to then tell you what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s314">He said, "Learn to read," but I didn't go to school yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s316">Were you close with your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: I was closer to him than he to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s319">I see.</span> <span id="s320">Did that change at some point?</span> <span id="s321">When children are small --</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: No.</span> <span id="s323">No, my brother left the house when he was 18 years on his birthday.</span> <span id="s324">When my father married, and my stepmother, she criticized my brother too much, and my father and my brother were very close in the beginning.</span> <span id="s325">And so he left.</span> <span id="s326">She criticized him.</span> <span id="s327">And if he could, he defended me.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: What did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: Defend me.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: He defended you, your brother did?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: My stepmother, she liked that I clean this and this, and I was 10 -- 10 years old, 11 years old.</span> <span id="s334">So he said, "Why she cannot have friends to come?"</span> <span id="s335">"She has to clean the house."</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: So in some ways your stepmother -- do you think it was a little bit like Cinderella, Ashenputtel?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: No, my father didn't realize this.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Was your stepmother German, did you say, or Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: My stepmother was German, yeah, and she converted to Judaism, told her to ______ and to get a husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: Were you ever close to her or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: I was not close and I was not far, but I hold my distance.</span> <span id="s344">But she has -- she had a sister; I liked her sister.</span> <span id="s345">She was married without children.</span> <span id="s346">And later, when I started to earn money, I gave her all the money, my stepmother, and I had other people – other lady, she had a little store, and once a week mostly she called me if I not make the bookkeeping, I was good in numbers, and she gave me money.</span> <span id="s347">I didn't ask for the money, but she gave me.</span> <span id="s348">And one day she asked me, "Jutta, what you do with the money?"</span> <span id="s349">I said, "I save it."</span> <span id="s350">"Oh, where do you save it?"</span> <span id="s351">With my -- with the sister for my stepmother.</span> <span id="s352">And later, much later, when I already was married and far away, she -- when I spoke -- she called -- no, I called her, and she said, "You made money with her, and you give it to my sister, not to me."</span> <span id="s353">People are strange.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: But I was glad that I saved the money that when I needed it to leave Germany, I didn't have money, so I had money.</span> <span id="s356">I had to pay for the -- go to Hamburg to get my visa and a lot of things, taxicab, and for the -- to help me with the luggage and things like this, each one like to be paid.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Well, tell -- well, that sort of begs the question of couldn't your father help pay for these expenses?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: My father was not there.</span> <span id="s359">My father went underground, and then he went to France and lived in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s361">So we will come to that part.</span> <span id="s362">Let's -- let's talk a little bit about again school life and -- and your neighborhood in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: Yeah, I had a lot of friends, older, younger, yeah.</span> <span id="s364">We were mixed, all mixed.</span> <span id="s365">But then afterward that Hitler came and took the Jews, we were more together than the other ones.</span> <span id="s366">I had -- in the building where we lived, above us lived a family.</span> <span id="s367">I don't know, I never saw the father, so maybe from divorce or she didn't have a father, and she -- they always invited me, and she played with me, and her grandmother was very nice, "Jutta, come up, come up."</span> <span id="s368">And then after Hitler, she from the window told, "Oh, Jews.</span> <span id="s369">Oh, Jews."</span> <span id="s370">So I felt a little bit put by side.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Of course.</span> <span id="s372">Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Really, I didn't know what was the difference.</span> <span id="s374">My father was not a religious man.</span> <span id="s375">He was an atheo.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: He was atheist, you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: My father was an atheo.</span> <span id="s378">He didn't believe in nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s380">But for a small child, such things are both painful and confusing.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: Yeah, it is.</span> <span id="s382">But then when I became eight years, nine years, I heard from _____+ organization, and I had other one that took me with them, so I was interested in Judaism.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: So your parents; that is, your father and your stepmother, tried to find other playmates for you and other activities for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: Oh, I looked for myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Oh, you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s388">How did your neighborhood change by the 19 --</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: I think the neighborhood was mostly the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s392">It was working class here.</span> <span id="s393">It was mostly the same.</span> <span id="s394">It changed a little bit when my father married.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: And that was what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: He married in December 1934.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: It was already forbidden Jews to marry Christians, but she insisted and she converted to Judaism, and she went to ________ in Prague, she lived three months to get the papers, and then she said to my father to come to Prague, that they can marry.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: And what was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Elna(ph) Shilla(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Elna(ph) Shilla(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: And you said that you had a half-sister --</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s405">No, this is from the other lady.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: From the other lady?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s408">Really, I met my half-sister from the other lady when we lived in Argentina, and I invited her to come to Argentina so she could live with us if she likes a year, so I met her, and I brought her to my brother, too.</span> <span id="s409">So it is funny, we sent her the money to come, and then he went and paid also, but he was not a big giver, but he didn't like to look shabby.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: And she was a year with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: And she lived -- did she grow up with her mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s414">And the mother later married, and she had from the -- the mother had another daughter and a son.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: And did they live far from you?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s417">Senftenberg.</span></p> <p><span

nice people.</span> <span id="s432">And when she went to Senftenberg for vacation, she always took me with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: I say to her "tante."</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: That's to -- to your half-sister's mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: You said you would say -- you would call

you said at one point -- your father had this business -- the store together with somebody else, but then that person left?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Yeah, yeah, they divided, and the other, he opened up a store, the same store a few blocks away, but must be that he didn't go away with him, they left Germany and went to France.</span> <span id="s449">His wife had family in France.</span> <span id="s450">And then after years I met her again in Buenos Aires, and they told me that they came to South America, and the older daughter died.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s452">The one who had been handicapped?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: No, this was a second one.</span> <span id="s454">She was more or less my age.</span> <span id="s455">The older daughter was three years older than me, three or four years.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: Did your father have business difficulties after 1933, after Hitler comes to power?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: No, in '38 to -- when was the Christmas – the glass?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s460">People came to ?</span> <span id="s461">streiten lang?</span> <span id="s462">and cried against the Jews, "Oh, that's a Jewish store."</span> <span id="s463">But there were some between those people that said, "No, come, come, come, ______+," so it was not destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s465">That's unusual.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s467">But after, my father didn't open up again.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s469">So he was able to maintain the store until Kristallnacht, and after that no?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: No, he closed it.</span> <span id="s471">No, they didn't destroy it.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s473">But here is my question.</span> <span id="s474">Between 1933 and 1938, was it harder for him to make a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: No.</span> <span id="s476">It was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: It was okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s480">How come he was in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: Why -- it came a time where they went and looked for Jewish men to take them to Sachsenhausen, and a lot of -- a lot of what he met disappeared in Sachsenhausen, so he disappeared, too, but not at Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s482">He went underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: How long did he stay away?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s485">When he was crossing the ______ to – I think to Bergen somewhere, they catched him and they sent him back to Berlin, and then he had to go every week to the police that he was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: So he had to register with the police --</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: -- every week?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: But after -- I don't know how long it took, a few months maybe, he didn't need to go anymore, but then before the war -- maybe four or five months before the war he disappeared again, but the store was closed.</span> <span id="s490">He didn't open it up after Kristallnacht, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: So how did you eat?</span> <span id="s492">How did you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s494">He made it -- he made the business

Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s499">So he became more like a wholesaler --</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: -- rather than to -- direct to customers?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s503">And we had a lot of -- my father had friends what was not Jewish, and one of them said, "Abraham, why you don't convert?</span> <span id="s504">I spoke with the vater."</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: "I spoke with the priest"?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Yeah, it was a priest, but my father was not interested.</span> <span id="s507">He didn't believe in one; how he would believe in another one.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: Well, yeah, that is logical.</span> <span id="s509">That makes sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: Did his manner change?</span> <span id="s512">Did he -- did the pressure show on him of all these things that were going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Maybe.</span> <span id="s514">Maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Did you see this change at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s517">Since he had not a wife at home, he

id="s521">That's before he married your stepmother?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s524">And then --</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: My stepmother, and then she organized it to play the cards at home, then so her father came and somebody else from her came, and my father learned Schach.</span> <span id="s526">Schach.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Oh, Chess?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s529">So they played Chess.</span> <span id="s530">And then when they married, they came -- always came the relatives from her for dinner.</span> <span id="s531">I thinks it better in our house or looked to save money.</span> <span id="s532">And they sent me out to buy in the feinkost.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: In the good food, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s535">And bring this, and bring this.</span> <span id="s536">And this was after hours, maybe it was 7:30, 8:00.</span> <span id="s537">And then when Hitler was there, they always go, "Oh, Hitler, we will have each one a car for free, the auto."</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: Really.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: That's what people would be saying in the streets?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: Yeah, when the Germans were winning the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Were you -- when you were a teenage girl in the 1930s, like a young teenage girl, were you frightened to go out on the streets after Hitler came to power?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: No, I was not one what like to go out if its dark.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: _____+, but I -- I was not an unafraid adventurer.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s547">Did --</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: I was a house girl.</span> <span id="s549">I liked to read.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: Well, it also sounds that as if -- did you feel somewhat abandoned; that is, when your stepmother came on the scene, did your father's attention --</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: No, she was jealous of my brother, and – and for me, she looked that she has somebody what helps with the housekeeping.</span> <span id="s552">Even you know what I didn't like, she had a very nice mother, no, and the mother came every day to us, and she let her wash the dishes and all this.</span> <span id="s553">I think it was terrible.</span> <span id="s554">And all for food?</span> <span id="s555">So I don't know if the people had money.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: I don't understand.</span> <span id="s557">Can you repeat this.</span> <span id="s558">Her mother would come every single day?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: Yeah, every single day to help her and to wash and to iron, and she was madam.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s561">I see.</span> <span id="s562">So she got other people to do those household chores?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: Yeah, what -- when she found something, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: When -- when Krystallnacht came around, you were already about 15 years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: Yeah, I was working.</span> <span id="s566">I was a kaufmannischer lehrling in a big store, in household appliances.</span> <span id="s567">Not a

would take care of you."</span> <span id="s572">And I said to my father, "Papa, they will take care of me and I can go to London and learn English and this and that."</span> <span id="s573">"No.</span> <span id="s574">How would you go to England?"</span> <span id="s575">He didn't allow it.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s577">Oh.</span> <span id="s578">So they -- they had offered you a way of leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s580">And so I lost my job in this office.</span> <span id="s581">And in the same building was a

was with my stepmother.</span> <span id="s648">She was not good, she was not bad, but that's hard.</span> <span id="s649">For her it was hard, and for me, too.</span> <span id="s650">But one day I cleaned my library and one book fell down, and I took the book up and pulled the letter out.</span> <span id="s651">This was a letter my mother had sent to me in '38, --</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: -- to see what was going on in Germany, it is not good; if I wouldn't like to come live with her.</span> <span id="s654">And my father said, "What, you will write her?</span> <span id="s655">You don't know your mother.</span> <span id="s656">You don't know what person she is."</span> <span id="s657">So I never answered the letter.</span>

Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: And she sent me the paper for Uruguay.</span> <span id="s661">And I didn't know how she looked, and Werner was on the ship, and he saw a lady call, "Is Jutta Popower on the ship?"</span> <span id="s662">And then he came to me, "Jutta, I think the lady what is calling is your mother."</span> <span id="s663">It was true.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: What happened to your brother?</span> <span id="s665">When he left at age 18 because your stepmother was criticizing him all the time, where did he go?</span> <span id="s666">What did he do?</span></p>

he left the house on a trip to England, and in England they took his passport and everything away, and after it was his time to leave England, they shipped him over to Germany.</span> <span id="s675">But he didn't come home.</span> <span id="s676">He went to Belgium, and in Belgium he entered into -- did something from _____+, this was a Jewish school to teach -- he learned in like an engineer plan, things like this, for two years, and then was from Dunkirk that the English took all the people out while the Germans started the war.</span> <span id="s677">It is before the war.</span> <span id="s678">So he came to this --</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: Oh, so you're talking about Dunkirk?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s681">He came to England, and then he came to England, they deported him to live on the Island of Man.</span> <span id="s682">Did you hear of that one?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: Yes, I've heard of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: Yeah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: So was he a prisoner there?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: No, no, it is not a prison.</span> <span id="s687">It

to the English Army, and he was a -- he fixed when the tank or something couldn't work anymore, he fixed this.</span> <span id="s689">This is what he learned.</span> <span id="s690">And he was to the war; he was in the Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: Well, this is -- it is simply -- I've heard of other German Jewish refugees coming to England --</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: My brother was not German.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: My brother had a Polish passport.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: He

Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: And that's why he could go into the English Army.</span> <span id="s702">Because a lot of German Jewish refugees ended up being, well, quarantined, imprisoned not in bad prisons, but, nevertheless, treated like enemy aliens.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Don't tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: No, I remember he wrote me, he had to make a testament and say something happened to him, no, he put me in in his testament and I get the money.</span> <span id="s706">I'm glad nothing happened to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: So when did you next see him?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: I saw him in 1950, when he went to Israel.</span> <span id="s709">It was -- he was then living in Israel.</span> <span id="s710">He was a soldier, and they had like a -- well, a soldier girl from the Army, where they went for food and things, no, like a restaurant, and over there he met a girl, she was from Hungary, Jewish, and -- but he left, it was the _____+, so he went to Israel, and then she followed him, and he married her.</span> <span id="s711">When he married her, after a while he found out she

him her age.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: And he liked to go away on trips for a month or so, and then he would say -- then he said, "Yeah, I'm going to visit my sister," and this was not true.</span> <span id="s717">He never came to visit me in Argentina.</span> <span id="s718">And when I came to Israel and I met her, she hated me.</span> <span id="s719">And she -- when we lived in Argentina, she wrote to my father-in-law that her husband give all the money what he has to me, and this is no.</span> <span id="s720">He lied to her, so she hated me.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: Such complex human relations sometimes, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: And such painful

<span id="s743">So it was a complete accident?</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s745">And she was not living no more at the address, but the people what received the letter know where she was living, so they went over and gave her the letter.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: And what were you doing -- what kind of work were you doing by the time you left?</span></p> <p><span
