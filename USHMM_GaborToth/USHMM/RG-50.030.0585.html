appreciate it now.</span> <span id="s15">And, like always with our interview, we want to start at the very beginning like in the fairy tales.</span> <span id="s16">So where were you born -- your parent's names, what their professions were, a little bit description of the world you were born into.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Answer: Okay.</span> <span id="s18">I have to start even first.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: Before.</span> <span id="s20">That's okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: My mother was born in Merecz, Lithuania.</span> <span id="s22">My father was born in Moscow, Russia.</span> <span id="s23">Generally, since Lithuania was occupied by Russia -- or was part of Russia there -- they took -- they draft the young boys for 25 years to serve in Russia army.</span> <span id="s24">My grandfather evidently was well-off, and he sent his sons to United States.</span> <span id="s25">My mother was sent to Moscow to study in the Moscow University.</span> <span id="s26">When the Revolution came, she got married and lived in communist Russia till 1923.</span> <span id="s27">In 1923, Lenin decreed that the small bourgeoisie should be liquidated, and they started to arrest and so forth.</span> <span id="s28">Anyway, my grandfather and my father, my grandmother -- they all fled to Poland.</span> <span id="s29">My grandfather was killed.</span> <span id="s30">They went -- they got wounded.</span> <span id="s31">Anyway, they got to Poland near the Russian-Romanian-Polish boundary, and they settled in Lodz, L-O-D-Z, Poland.</span> <span id="s32">My mother went to Lithuanian boundary, and she was expecting me.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: So your parents were married already?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: She was -- she was -- oh, sure.</span> <span id="s35">She was late 19 months.</span> <span id="s36">And she said, "Look, my husband is dead.</span> <span id="s37">I'm going to my parents.</span> <span id="s38">They wait for me to go."</span> <span id="s39">I was born in Merecz.</span> <span id="s40">You know at that time people not registered right away when they were born.</span> <span id="s41">They waited for kids to survive.</span> <span id="s42">Anyway, making long story short, as long as she could -- she went to Poland, wrote my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: First, let's say, were born in Merecz, Merkine?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: But I wasn't registered.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: What date were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Oh, I was born -- officially, I was registered in October 16, 1923.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: October 16, 1923.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: But you were born a few days before.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: Do you know how many days before?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: I know, my mother is the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: You know.</span> <span id="s55">I mean, that really didn't --</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Wait a minute for a second -- wait, wait, wait.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Oh, I am sorry.</span> <span id="s58">By somebody from Holocaust Museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: Oh, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: Years, years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s63">But anyway -- coming back to this --</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: So your mother gave birth to you October 16, 1923 officially --</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: -- and then joined her husband in Borch[?]</span> <span id="s67">.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Yeah, she joined me, and I was registered as a child in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: So you were the oldest of the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: I was the only child.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: You were the only child.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s74">I'm not letting you do that yet.</span> <span id="s75">I want to find out a little bit more about your father.</span> <span id="s76">What did he do for a living?</span> <span id="s77">Did your mother help him?</span> <span id="s78">Did she do something else?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: No, we were quite well off.</span> <span id="s80">We had a factory.</span> <span id="s81">And they manufactured -- they weaved materials, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Like ricotash[?]</span> <span id="s83">-- something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s85">And we were very comfortable.</span> <span id="s86">I don't know if -- anyway, I was sent to, in Poland, to gymnasium.</span> <span id="s87">This is equivalent of academy in this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Like a high school -- something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Yeah, that's right.</span> <span id="s90">But very expensive one.</span> <span id="s91">So â€“</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: I want to go even back further.</span> <span id="s93">Sorry.</span> <span id="s94">I want to ask you, "What are your earliest memories that you can recall from your childhood?</span> <span id="s95">From your mother?</span> <span id="s96">From your father?"</span> <span id="s97">I want to get a sense of where you grew up.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Could you take that off?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Okay, we can pause.</span> <span id="s100">We will pause.</span> <span id="s101">All right.</span> <span id="s102">Let's -- this is a photograph of you with your mother.</span> <span id="s103">About how old were you here?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: I imagine probably two, three years old.</span> <span id="s105">I cannot tell.</span> <span id="s106">My guess is as good as yours.</span> <span id="s107">But my uncle sent me the photograph, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: She looks very chic, very elegant in the style of the time -- your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: So I -- well, now I can continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: So I grow up.</span> <span id="s112">I was the only child.</span> <span id="s113">Oh, I was born in 1923 when the war late in October.</span> <span id="s114">So, when the war started, I was still in the gymnasium or academy.</span> <span id="s115">And the Germans came.</span> <span id="s116">After a few months, they press us in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: This was Olen Woj [?]</span> <span id="s118">.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Olen Woj, yeah.</span> <span id="s120">The ghetto was -- when they left, the ghetto was something between like 2 and 250,000 people.</span> <span id="s121">We were lucky enough -- we went here and there.</span> <span id="s122">We move to the area which was ghetto about two months a year.</span> <span id="s123">What happened, since we had a very nice apartment and lived in a very good neighborhood, the Germans used to requisition the apartment for the Germans which were expelled from Russia -- no, no.</span> <span id="s124">They came.</span> <span id="s125">They told us that you have two hours.</span> <span id="s126">You can take whatever you can carry in our hands.</span> <span id="s127">And don't forget to leave the flowers on the table.</span> <span id="s128">[chuckling].</span> <span id="s129">Okay.</span> <span id="s130">We went, and we were able to rent a room in the only building which has a flushing toilet in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s131">One room.</span> <span id="s132">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Tell me -- your father lost his business when the Germans came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: They took it away -- sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: They took it away.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s137">They put it troiken[?]</span> <span id="s138">there, which is whatever that administrator, and -- well, okay.</span> <span id="s139">I was in the ghetto, and they are -- you see, there were a lot of Jewish kids who went to other gymnasiums -- who went to the public school and who went to other high school gymnasiums.</span> <span id="s140">And they put us all together and allow us to continue in school, which was located in the part of Russ -- near the the cemetery called Marysin.</span> <span id="s141">M-A-R-Y-S-I-N.</span> <span id="s142">And then we continue to school till 194 -- end of 1941.</span> <span id="s143">At that time --</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Hang on -- I have a few questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s147">First question -- about the school, the very prestigious gymnasium that you went to -- can you tell me a little bit about what this coursework was?</span> <span id="s148">What you studied?</span> <span id="s149">Was it a Jewish one?</span> <span id="s150">Was it a Polish one?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: No.</span> <span id="s152">No.</span> <span id="s153">This school was a -- most of our teachers have Ph.D.s.</span> <span id="s154">The school was recognized by Polish authorities or government as a school which does not require examination for the entrance to university.</span> <span id="s155">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: It was very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s158">And we get two type of abitur.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: I know abitur -- so we mean high school diploma.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Two type of high school diploma.</span> <span id="s161">One was in Polish, and second was in Hebrew, and you could go from us -- you could go to Palestine at that time and enter Hebrew University without examinations.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: So it was nevertheless a Jewish school --</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Yeah, that's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: -- you were taught Hebrew, and you were taught Polish as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s166">The head of schools -- there were two, three schools in Poland.</span> <span id="s167">One that was in Lodz.</span> <span id="s168">That was sometimes in schlunks.</span> <span id="s169">Silesia and some other place.</span> <span id="s170">And the head of school was a Polish -- she was appointed as a member of the senate.</span> <span id="s171">She was Polish senator.</span> <span id="s172">Okay.</span> <span id="s173">Well, that was a mishmash for me -- the ghetto students came from various schools.</span> <span id="s174">Anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: My second question -- I'm so sorry for interrupting, but I need to get the context.</span> <span id="s176">You spoke which language at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: I spoke Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: And at school?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: My parents spoke Russian among themselves.</span> <span id="s180">To me they spoke Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Polish.</span> <span id="s182">And in school you studied in Polish and in Hebrew; is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s185">Did you know any German?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s187">I had it as a subject at high school.</span> <span id="s188">German and high school English.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Those were my other questions.</span> <span id="s190">By the time you got into the mishmash of the ghetto school, I wanted to get a sense of how many languages --</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: And I didn't -- you see -- if you want to know the sense, I will tell you how ghetto look.</span> <span id="s192">The Jewish community was essentially split in two parts.</span> <span id="s193">There was 250,000 Jews out of 600,000 people -- or 650,000 people.</span> <span id="s194">Half of them were hasidim, you know?</span> <span id="s195">And we seldom even went to their neighborhood, because they spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s196">I didn't spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s197">I had a problem.</span> <span id="s198">I wen't one.</span> <span id="s199">I don't know why I went.</span> <span id="s200">I was close there, and I went to the school.</span> <span id="s201">And we all wore uniforms -- high school uniforms -- so I took my cap off.</span> <span id="s202">And the guy took a broom to me and wanted to chase me out.</span> <span id="s203">How is a Jewish kid come and embarrass her friend?</span> <span id="s204">I never went there.</span> <span id="s205">This was mish -- both of these communities were mixed in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s206">Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: What was that like for a young boy -- well, teenage boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Confusing.</span> <span id="s211">Although, I remember as -- I wanted to go to -- I wanted to -- you see, one of the brothers of my father was left in Russia.</span> <span id="s212">He didn't want to go.</span> <span id="s213">He joined evidently the party, become one of the editors of Isiestia [?]</span> <span id="s214">-- and he wrote to my father that "If you sent me there, I could -- he didn't have any children.</span> <span id="s215">He would send me to university."</span> <span id="s216">Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: What year did he write this?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: When did your uncle write this?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: In 1939.</span> <span id="s221">You know, when there was still peace between Russia and between Germany.</span> <span id="s222">My mother visited them in 1938, and she did -- you know, they gave her permission, but the -- they were -- they had to have a guide with them.</span> <span id="s223">And the guide was probably member of NKGB.</span> <span id="s224">So, when she came to see them, they saw the men who came with them -- they said, "Look, we are very happy that you are happy.</span> <span id="s225">You have your life.</span> <span id="s226">We have our life."</span> <span id="s227">And my mother understood what it is.</span> <span id="s228">She cried when she came home.</span> <span id="s229">And she -- "We wish you all the best," and that was all.</span> <span id="s230">Year later, after the war, you know?</span> <span id="s231">He wrote to sent me there.</span> <span id="s232">Well, my father told me -- I wanted to go, we all go in Russian zone.</span> <span id="s233">He said, "Look, you can go to Russia.</span> <span id="s234">But, once you go, the door will open, but you never came back.</span> <span id="s235">I fled once Russia, and I am not going.</span> <span id="s236">The German are civilized people.</span> <span id="s237">You know -- blah, blah.</span> <span id="s238">And I speak well German.</span> <span id="s239">We will take our chances.</span> <span id="s240">We want to last longer."</span> <span id="s241">Well, when they ask us to put first the --</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: The armbands?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: -- the armbands.</span> <span id="s244">I told my father, "I'm not putting this."</span> <span id="s245">I went out.</span> <span id="s246">A Polish teacher recognized me and pointed to the Germans.</span> <span id="s247">And I came in, I was black and blue.</span> <span id="s248">And I went into hysteria.</span> <span id="s249">I told my dad that he's going to kill himself, your mom and me.</span> <span id="s250">And then my father didn't said very much.</span> <span id="s251">Next morning he said, "Look, we really don't know what's going to happen.</span> <span id="s252">If you feel that you can save yourself, go."</span> <span id="s253">They took my shoes.</span> <span id="s254">They putted [sic] some gold pieces in this, and they sent me.</span> <span id="s255">When I went away, my mom look at me and said, "Take a good look at your parents.</span> <span id="s256">You'll never see them again."</span> <span id="s257">And I was a 15.5 years old boy -- close to 16.</span> <span id="s258">And it hit my head, you know?</span> <span id="s259">I was -- I said, "If I survive and they die, how's I left my parents?"</span> <span id="s260">I was on the Russia boundary, and you could -- the Germans let people out at that time, and Russia admitted them.</span> <span id="s261">And I went back.</span> <span id="s262">When I went back, when I came back, shortly enough we went into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s263">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Did your parents -- were they happy you came back, or were they distraught that you came back?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Would you repeat yourself?</span> <span id="s266">If my --</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: Were they -- how did your parents react when you came back?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: They were delighted, and they were very happy.</span> <span id="s269">That's about all.</span> <span id="s270">I mean, they regained back their son, and I was going to try.</span> <span id="s271">But anyway, when we went into the ghetto, I understand Yiddish, and I can probably speak halfway Yiddish and halfway German, you know?</span> <span id="s272">But I spoke -- I never really learned.</span> <span id="s273">Well, when they closed the school, I was at that time probably 17 years old.</span> <span id="s274">And in the ghetto --</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: They closed the ghetto school.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: Yeah, that's right.</span> <span id="s277">Well, close in ghetto, which was closed in 1940.</span> <span id="s278">I continue my school education until September 1941.</span> <span id="s279">Then they have -- then they closed the school, and they send there the transport of German and Czech Jews there.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Until that time, you had a mishmash.</span> <span id="s281">But the mishmash was from Borscht [?]</span> <span id="s282">?</span> <span id="s283">The mishmash was Jewish community from Borscht.</span> <span id="s284">Nobody mixed in yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: Nobody from any place else?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s289">What was that like?</span> <span id="s290">Was Romkowski already the Jewish community leader?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: Oh yeah -- he was already.</span> <span id="s292">That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about him?</span> <span id="s294">What you remember?</span> <span id="s295">What did you see him?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: I can tell you a lot about him.</span> <span id="s297">I lived under his regime for 4.5 years.</span> <span id="s298">Till liquidated the ghetto.</span> <span id="s299">Romkowski -- all right.</span> <span id="s300">Romkowski was a widower who was probably well comfortably, and he retired that he was on the board of orphanages.</span> <span id="s301">And he had his place by his wife, which was boarded over there.</span> <span id="s302">Over there it went to his head, and he started -- well, you know, he probably felt that the only way for the ghetto to survive is to -- not only to cooperate with the Germans, but to create industry in the ghetto so they would become indispensable economically.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: What kind of industry did he try to create?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: What kind of industry did he try to create -- what kind of economic basis?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: Oh -- oh, they made what you wanted.</span> <span id="s307">They made the shoes.</span> <span id="s308">They made the garments.</span> <span id="s309">They made the belts.</span> <span id="s310">They made all kinds -- that was all army resource.</span> <span id="s311">All come to this right here.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Your father was a well-to-do person.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: My father didn't want to be part of ghetto administration.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: That was my question.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: He bring -- we brought enough money or whatever you had that just to take care on ourselves.</span> <span id="s316">Which you couldn't afford -- you couldn't afford -- food was extremely expensive.</span> <span id="s317">What we get was a 2-kilogram bread for one week and maybe few potatoes.</span> <span id="s318">There was no coal, nothing.</span> <span id="s319">People already started -- the poorer people started to die out pretty early.</span> <span id="s320">But Romkowski created industry, and people had to work.</span> <span id="s321">Because in order -- No. 1 -- we got a dose in school to get the soup.</span> <span id="s322">They got the soup in addition to the bread, which they got -- at the working place.</span> <span id="s323">When the school -- and that -- I -- well, my address in the ghetto was Berka Joselewicza 60 Brunnenstrasse 16.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: Brunnenstrasse 16.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Berek Joselewicz was the hero of one of Polish uprisings.</span> <span id="s326">They renamed it Brunnenstrasse.</span> <span id="s327">I told you that the ghetto was closed on 1940.</span> <span id="s328">I continued my high school education until September '41.</span> <span id="s329">And, when the school closed, I was assigned to labor department.</span> <span id="s330">I was 17 or 18 years boy.</span> <span id="s331">I mean, you know, just out of school.</span> <span id="s332">So I -- I did -- well, I worked in economic department that was called Vir turizam.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: Hang on a second.</span> <span id="s334">I want to ask a question about the school.</span> <span id="s335">So it was a mishmash you say.</span> <span id="s336">What was the quality of the teachers for the year that it existed?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: That was a put-up faculty of the people -- a lot of people fled.</span> <span id="s338">I mean, teachers from various schools -- Jewish, we're talking Polish school and by us -- they made the -- they were our this.</span> <span id="s339">One of our professors -- his name was Silverbogen -- he became the -- he became the principal of the school.</span> <span id="s340">Well, anyway -- where I was?</span> <span id="s341">When the school ended, I did it whatever they asked me to do.</span> <span id="s342">I filed.</span> <span id="s343">I run errands.</span> <span id="s344">My working hours probably were from morning till evening, close to ten hours a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: What was the work of the Vir turizam?</span> <span id="s346">What was its purpose?</span> <span id="s347">The place where you worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: They called Vir turizam?</span> <span id="s349">They administered -- well, it was one of the departments which he created.</span> <span id="s350">I think they assigned the living quarters.</span> <span id="s351">They make that administrative work.</span> <span id="s352">That was --</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: So did you come into daily contact with him?</span> <span id="s354">With Romkowski?</span> <span id="s355">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: No.</span> <span id="s357">I saw him one time in person for a long -- in 1944.</span> <span id="s358">I'll come to this.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Now.</span> <span id="s361">I was there to about 1942.</span> <span id="s362">Then I was reassigned to work in court.</span> <span id="s363">There was court.</span> <span id="s364">And they -- you know, they really had that "people stole this," "people stole this."</span> <span id="s365">Mostly -- they were mostly -- there were no murder cases, you know?</span> <span id="s366">There was crimes of property.</span> <span id="s367">Well, I work over there to about -- well, the running errands.</span> <span id="s368">Don't forget there was no phone calls.</span> <span id="s369">Those -- you know, if you wanted to talk to somebody five blocks away, either you went by yourself, or you scribble few words what you want and you summon a kid like me -- I took it over, I brought answer, you know?</span> <span id="s370">Well, in 1942, I got a job in a court.</span> <span id="s371">And again, I filed, you know?</span> <span id="s372">And I run errands.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: But you know, this seems like -- pardon me for thinking, but it seems like fairly easy work considering what kind of work it could have been.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Oh yeah -- oh yeah -- oh yeah.</span> <span id="s375">My cousin who was also in the ghetto; he was CPA in Vir turizam.</span> <span id="s376">So he got me over there.</span> <span id="s377">And, when there was reduction in force over there, because they wanted to have people to work in the resorts, which manufactured seats for the Germans.</span> <span id="s378">He got me in the court.</span> <span id="s379">So I worked over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: What did your father do during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s382">Dying of slow hunger death.</span> <span id="s383">We bought it as long as we could.</span> <span id="s384">As the money lasted.</span> <span id="s385">Don't forget -- in 1942, the bread costs over -- loaf of bread costs over $100, $150.</span> <span id="s386">When the Germans troops came, they were quite well-assimilated.</span> <span id="s387">They were quite number of them were intermarried.</span> <span id="s388">Some came without something -- with wives, you know, that the -- or with the husband, who was German, didn't want in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s389">And I remember it would -- it is not comic.</span> <span id="s390">It is tragic.</span> <span id="s391">You know, when we were picking up, you had to work some place to get stamps.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: My father got stamps, because he was sick, okay?</span> <span id="s394">But -- so they got the stamps.</span> <span id="s395">And they were going to the head of the line some of them.</span> <span id="s396">And they said for science uda and the Reich uda[?]</span> <span id="s397">I am a German Jew -- and they expected that we let them eat.</span> <span id="s398">Well, the people were not in the mood.</span> <span id="s399">And this -- they were very brutally pushed to the end of the line.</span> <span id="s400">And a lot of them committed suicide.</span> <span id="s401">Large number of them committed suicide.</span> <span id="s402">They couldn't take it.</span> <span id="s403">Well, continue with me.</span> <span id="s404">I was -- in May 1943 -- I'll give you this -- I was transferred to the fire department.</span> <span id="s405">Well, we were not a fireman.</span> <span id="s406">I was a young kid.</span> <span id="s407">What our job there was, when we -- to walk, you know, in the resort -- when people sit by machines, sewing machines, and this -- see that nobody smokes a cigarette, throws away, and if a fire would start and you couldn't put a bucket of water, we really had to call the -- [pause] -- well -- well, we look for unsafe practice like smoking.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: Almost preventative fire.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s410">And, if the fire really started, we called the fire brigade who are trained as a firemen; they came and they took care of the fire.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: Can I just ask one point for clarification?</span> <span id="s412">When you talk about a "resort," you're make -- you -- it sounds like you're talking about a manufacturing department --</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: -- not a resort.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: That's Arbeits Resort.</span> <span id="s416">That's how they call in German.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: So it would be like a manufacturing area, or a workplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: Shops.</span> <span id="s419">Or minor factories.</span> <span id="s420">That's more like a factories, because they -- you might have people, 5, 600 people working this.</span> <span id="s421">And, when they were doing shoes, they said when they all sat by sewing machine and another.</span> <span id="s422">And we were moved around, you know?</span> <span id="s423">I didn't work in the same place.</span> <span id="s424">Every day we were assigned -- "You go here," "You go here," "You go there."</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Were you ever -- was there any manufacture of German military equipment?</span> <span id="s426">Ammunition?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: A lot.</span> <span id="s428">A lot.</span> <span id="s429">There were uniforms.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: Aha.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: There were torn uniforms, which probably -- from people who died during the war.</span> <span id="s432">And there were -- they -- the Germans supplied the material.</span> <span id="s433">They manufactured material uniforms.</span> <span id="s434">The same thing with the shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: What about weapons?</span> <span id="s436">Munitions?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: No.</span> <span id="s438">One thing which we didn't do.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: But that was economic -- what they Romkowski interested the union.</span> <span id="s441">He wanted to make himself economically indispensable -- or nearly indispensable -- to the war effort.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Did you see selections?</span> <span id="s443">Were there selections in the Woj ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s445">Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s446">They demanded -- they demanded people who could work and so forth, and periodically they took.</span> <span id="s447">They took them.</span> <span id="s448">We didn't know where they went.</span> <span id="s449">They took them about 2 or 300 miles from Lodz.</span> <span id="s450">They were experimenting.</span> <span id="s451">There were no concentration camps -- crematoriums.</span> <span id="s452">What they -- when they came, they put them in a van, in a big truck, and the fumes were transported --</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: So gas vans.</span> <span id="s454">It was gas vans -- murdered by gas vans.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s456">Then, when they came, they unloaded this -- some of the prisoners -- other prisoners stripped them.</span> <span id="s457">Their things were stripped back in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: Did you know about this at the time if you think back?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: Rumors.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Rumors.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: Rumors.</span> <span id="s462">Because, if a woman in a shop, she took a picture, and the picture was somebody whom she knew or knew about or what, they understood that these were personal things and something happened to the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: The person.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: That was in 1942.</span> <span id="s465">And then later they were periodically -- they took people away, because people were unable to work.</span> <span id="s466">They got emaciated.</span> <span id="s467">They died out.</span> <span id="s468">We had about hundred funerals a day.</span> <span id="s469">My parents died in Ghetto 2.</span> <span id="s470">They died hunger death.</span> <span id="s471">I don't know if it's -- it's very hard.</span> <span id="s472">Well, you can -- the worst you can put it.</span> <span id="s473">But to imagine how it looked.</span> <span id="s474">A normal person start to lose weight.</span> <span id="s475">He gets thinner, thinner, and thinner.</span> <span id="s476">Now, since most of the thing, what you had was a slice of bread a day, in order to fill the stomach, people used to cook -- put it in the water -- and make --</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Make it expand.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Well, that's right.</span> <span id="s479">And they started to swell.</span> <span id="s480">And you saw people who are unsteady on his feet, swollen, and so forth.</span> <span id="s481">At the end of the ghetto, I was also -- I was also swollen.</span> <span id="s482">I was taken to the hospital, and they took one liter of liquid out of my lungs.</span> <span id="s483">I'm getting a ghetto panacea for this.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Who went first with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: Mine father.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Was he older than your mother, or was he sicker than your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: About four, five years older.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: So not much older.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: Not much older.</span> <span id="s490">But he went first.</span> <span id="s491">My mother -- I remember when my mother told me -- "Remember Ami, if you ever survive, if you survive, you have uncles in the States.</span> <span id="s492">Try to educate yourself.</span> <span id="s493">Make something of yourself."</span> <span id="s494">She died in 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: And your father before?</span> <span id="s496">So for several --</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Before.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: So he fairly soon after.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s500">And I lived by myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: In the small room.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s503">You see, what they did -- the family -- they gave one family per room.</span> <span id="s504">They might be seven people, might be three people.</span> <span id="s505">Everybody got their room.</span> <span id="s506">We got a room -- small room in this building -- because we came early, and we were able to rent for a lot of money.</span> <span id="s507">And so, they left me alone over there.</span> <span id="s508">I mean, I was working fire department too.</span> <span id="s509">They started to look for the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: What were you working?</span> <span id="s511">What were you working at when your father died?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: As a fireman.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: You were the fire -- you were in the fire --</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s515">I was a -- they called us firemans.</span> <span id="s516">We were really, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: -- untrained firemans.</span> <span id="s519">We were watching that people don't smoke cigarettes, that no fire starts.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: I'm sorry to keep back at this, but it is an important point.</span> <span id="s521">It is sort of chronicling sometimes the most difficult experiences.</span> <span id="s522">Were you at work when this happened?</span> <span id="s523">Did you come home from work and find he wasn't there?</span> <span id="s524">Were you expecting it?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: No, my father died in sleep.</span> <span id="s526">My mother contracted typhoid, and they brought her home.</span> <span id="s527">And she did not -- another two weeks she died.</span> <span id="s528">Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s530">Did you have any other close relatives in the ghetto with you or any family?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: They all died -- my whole family.</span> <span id="s532">Everybody died.</span> <span id="s533">As a matter of a fact, one -- I was the youngest from all my cousins.</span> <span id="s534">After the war, when I tried to search for them, I found out that she committed suicide.</span> <span id="s535">You know, they experiment with a beautiful young woman.</span> <span id="s536">At that time I was -- 1944 -- I was probably 22, 25, 27 years old.</span> <span id="s537">And she was all cut up.</span> <span id="s538">And she didn't want to live.</span> <span id="s539">She committed suicide after the liberation.</span> <span id="s540">When I was -- well, the ghetto was liquidated in the 19 Lodz transport.</span> <span id="s541">I tried not to go.</span> <span id="s542">We didn't know where we were going.</span> <span id="s543">We didn't know that we're going to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s544">Because, if you know what Auschwitz is, you have better to die there from the bullet than to board that --</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: And people knew about Auschwitz already in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: Not in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s547">Not in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s548">The German who was omslighter[?]</span> <span id="s549">of the ghetto, Hans Biebow.</span> <span id="s550">He and Romkowski, were going, "we are going -- try to go to families.</span> <span id="s551">Germans boys were dying on the Russian front.</span> <span id="s552">They want thank you that you work for us."</span> <span id="s553">Anyway, people didn't believe, but they didn't know what -- we felt that we are going to go to Arbeitslager.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Work camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s556">I remember -- I told you that I saw Romkowski really close.</span> <span id="s557">One time -- because whenever they gathered us to send us to the various Arbeit resort this fireman that was huge -- about maybe half a square mile place -- he called all the people together and Romkowski got over there on a podium.</span> <span id="s558">Not a podium, you know, whatever table or this makeshift.</span> <span id="s559">And said, "Children, give me your own parents.</span> <span id="s560">Parents, give me your own children.</span> <span id="s561">So the rest of us can survive."</span> <span id="s562">I take that on my conscience.</span> <span id="s563">I mean -- otherwise, if you want to give it, the Germans will come and they'll take it.</span> <span id="s564">And there will be a bloodshed.</span> <span id="s565">Well, no, no -- we all go anyway.</span> <span id="s566">They declared spare us.</span> <span id="s567">Nobody could leave their homes for three or four days.</span> <span id="s568">They went from selection, they make selection in each building and took people.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: So Romkowski and his helpers.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s571">All the people who couldn't work.</span> <span id="s572">Then I saw -- well, jumping back when they liquidated ghetto, I was -- that was 1944 in August.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: So you were a young man -- 21 years old --</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: -- almost 21 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s577">I waited -- well, I was very very thin, I mean, but I still could walk on my feet.</span> <span id="s578">Mengele was our -- the guy who select us.</span> <span id="s579">You went, and he "left, right, left, right," right you went later into Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s580">Left -- as a matter of fact what happened before -- you know, they told us we can take it so and so many pounds of baggage.</span> <span id="s581">So they figure that probably the best thing -- if people taking, they take the best thing they have it.</span> <span id="s582">When they putted [sic] us, they putted us like herrings -- 80, 90 people to a small cattle car.</span> <span id="s583">And one of the men told me that he knew my parents.</span> <span id="s584">I said old man, he was in his 40's.</span> <span id="s585">And "would you help me, I'm unsteady on my feet," and so forth?</span> <span id="s586">Okay.</span> <span id="s587">When we came -- arrived in Auschwitz, there was night.</span> <span id="s588">There was sea of lights.</span> <span id="s589">Out, out, out -- we all jumped.</span> <span id="s590">I tried to help the man.</span> <span id="s591">And they said, "Whoever cannot walk -- they were lined up Red Cross cars.</span> <span id="s592">He can go to the Red Cross cars, and he'll be transported there."</span> <span id="s593">The men -- I tried to help him, and I saw a guy in a striped uniform.</span> <span id="s594">I didn't know at that time that this was the prison uniform.</span> <span id="s595">We eventually found out.</span> <span id="s596">He grabbed me, "Where are you going?"</span> <span id="s597">And he was Russian.</span> <span id="s598">I didn't spoke Russian, but I understood Russian from my parents.</span> <span id="s599">And I try to explain to him that he's sick and this -- he told me, "Go there."</span> <span id="s600">I still try to proceed him.</span> <span id="s601">He grabbed me and give me a kick and shoved me go where other men were going.</span> <span id="s602">He saved my life.</span> <span id="s603">Because if I'd have gone there, they'd have straight to gas chambers.</span> <span id="s604">Well, I pass the selection, and I was in Auschwitz for about two or three weeks.</span> <span id="s605">I wasn't even tattooed at that time.</span> <span id="s606">This was September already.</span> <span id="s607">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: In '44.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s610">And the Russian army was on the march.</span> <span id="s611">So they were preparing to send us as fast as they can deep into Germany.</span> <span id="s612">And I was caught and pushed on a train and they sent us to Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: But you didn't know the Russian army was on the march at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: All you knew, you're pushed one place, you're pushed another place, and you're on the train.</span> <span id="s616">And so --</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s618">I mean, I found out after the war.</span> <span id="s619">When we came over there -- well, there was one time they tried to bomb us Allies.</span> <span id="s620">Let me show you something.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: Wait a minute for a second.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: You have seen this.</span> <span id="s623">Well, anyway --</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: This is a photo of Birkenau extermination taken by the Americans by satellite probably on 13th --</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: Not satellite; by American bombers.</span> <span id="s626">You see part of the Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s627">We are not in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s628">We are in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s629">We call that such.</span> <span id="s630">Birkenau was Vernichtungslager.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: Was an extermination camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s633">Auschwitz also a working lager, and they manufacture artificial rubber.</span> <span id="s634">And the German needed this.</span> <span id="s635">So American plane came to bomb this.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: Do you remember those planes, or were you already on the way to Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: No, I was still in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s638">We just cheered and the -- and the -- and the --</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s640">We can pause.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: We were not afraid of bombs, because we felt that you never get alive from there.</span> <span id="s642">And so -- but they just flew.</span> <span id="s643">Well, this is another thing.</span> <span id="s644">I mean, this is a matter of big controversy why they didn't bomb -- why don't go into (indecipherable).</span> <span id="s645">So I went to Dachau -- Dachau was -- there was Dachau proper and there were some Dachau subcamps around.</span> <span id="s646">The Jewish prisoners were not transported to the -- to the Dachau itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: But to subcamps?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s649">And we were building the roads and so forth, but we were -- a lot of people very often when our commander was hundred, hundred, 50 people who went to work, you had to carry three people who died because the tally in the evening has to, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: Match.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: -- agree.</span> <span id="s652">That's right.</span> <span id="s653">I worked for Organisation Todt.</span> <span id="s654">That was the Organisation T-O-D-T.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Todt.</span> <span id="s656">'Todt' means 'death' -- the death organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: No, no, no, no, no, no -- that's not Todt.</span> <span id="s658">Todt -- he was man who -- the German who was in charge of road buildings.</span> <span id="s659">And we were building roads.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: So how long -- excuse me, you were in Auschwitz for a short time then?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: Four weeks, maybe a month.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: Relatively short time.</span> <span id="s663">I mean, anything would be long.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s665">But I still remember the planes.</span> <span id="s666">And over there we were -- a lot of people died naturally, but in the middle of April, they trans -- I became very sick, and they transported back to Kaufering, which was also a sub-camp --</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: Of -- ?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: -- of Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: They were supposed to finish at there.</span> <span id="s671">We knew.</span> <span id="s672">Weeks.</span> <span id="s673">We never believed we would come out of it.</span> <span id="s674">We knew that that's the end.</span> <span id="s675">Then, whenever I arrived there, two days later they put us on the train -- and this was maybe 25 miles from Dachau itself.</span> <span id="s676">And they kept us on the sidelines for about -- everything was bombed.</span> <span id="s677">After a few days, they unloaded us.</span> <span id="s678">In the mine train probably out of -- I don't know how many people -- 68, 100 -- most of them were dead.</span> <span id="s679">Few of us jumped.</span> <span id="s680">I was just half alive.</span> <span id="s681">Then we were liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: By -- ?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: And the Russia's history, you know?</span> <span id="s684">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Do you remember?</span> <span id="s686">Do you remember your impressions of when it was the Americans who came?</span> <span id="s687">For Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: Do you remember the first American you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: We were lame, and I couldn't walk anymore.</span> <span id="s691">Suddenly somebody -- some people came up in some uniforms, said "You are free.</span> <span id="s692">You are free."</span> <span id="s693">And one of them started to wave a small American flag, and all what we started are food.</span> <span id="s694">You know what are C rations?</span> <span id="s695">C rations is what the military gets.</span> <span id="s696">They were throwing us C rations.</span> <span id="s697">I was -- I met over there one of the chiefs.</span> <span id="s698">Not my particular this close friend, but I met him over there.</span> <span id="s699">And he was my neighbor.</span> <span id="s700">And I opened my box, smell it and started to vomit.</span> <span id="s701">I couldn't take it.</span> <span id="s702">He ate his and asked me, "Can you loan me yours?"</span> <span id="s703">So I said, "You'll get sick."</span> <span id="s704">"Look, we saved everything what we have it."</span> <span id="s705">Flower, carrot or whatever we found it.</span> <span id="s706">You are afraid of it?</span> <span id="s707">Here you are.</span> <span id="s708">Next morning he was dead.</span> <span id="s709">A lot of people -- right away the military who were in charge came in, and they tried to -- they chase out the soldier.</span> <span id="s710">"Don't give to the people.</span> <span id="s711">You kill them.</span> <span id="s712">You kill them, you know?"</span> <span id="s713">Okay.</span> <span id="s714">I was liberated, and I went -- I decided to go back to Poland to see if anybody from my extended family -- because my cousins few years older than I, but they were, you know, I mean I knew that they were transported, so if anybody has survived --</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: So you come to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: You know, it's strange.</span> <span id="s717">We live in a house.</span> <span id="s718">Our neighbors live on a floor above us.</span> <span id="s719">The men was Polish officer, veterinarian Polish army, but he had a responsible administrative position.</span> <span id="s720">And -- but my mother carried their daughter, and she carried me on the hands.</span> <span id="s721">You know, two, three years old.</span> <span id="s722">And, before we knew that, we knew that our apartment is going to be taken over, because the number of people in the neighborhood -- there was a nice neighborhood.</span> <span id="s723">They were requisitioned.</span> <span id="s724">So my mom took the silver, everything what we had it.</span> <span id="s725">And she told them, "I don't think so you will see us again -- but in case anybody survives, we'll come back."</span> <span id="s726">We lefted [sic] them.</span> <span id="s727">I went up there and knocked to the door.</span> <span id="s728">And don't forget that the woman, I was closer to her than to my aunts.</span> <span id="s729">I lived, you know -- she opened the door, got all white, and tried to slam the door -- said, "We don't have nothing."</span> <span id="s730">And I just put my food inside, "Look, did anybody ask for me?"</span> <span id="s731">"No."</span> <span id="s732">And I played with her daughter in the sand; we were children.</span> <span id="s733">I could not -- I was just walking down, and the girl run after me and said, "Eugene, I want you to tell me where are you staying."</span> <span id="s734">I said, "Look, go in peace.</span> <span id="s735">Leave me alone.</span> <span id="s736">Best of luck."</span> <span id="s737">"No, my father would want to talk to you."</span> <span id="s738">She never let on.</span> <span id="s739">I told her I was staying.</span> <span id="s740">The men came in the evening and said, "Look, I don't know what you are thinking, but you have to understand what happened.</span> <span id="s741">I am a Catholic, and we don't divorce.</span> <span id="s742">I live my family.</span> <span id="s743">My oldest daughter married a folk Deutsch -- met a folk Deutsch -- it was ethnic German -- and my wife said, "This thing will bring us luck," and gave her everything.</span> <span id="s744">When the Russian came, since he was an ethnic -- that's right, they were both shot.</span> <span id="s745">But, when she saw me, she just froze.</span> <span id="s746">Then the men takes a gold watch and tell me, "That's all what I have, but I want to -- we live together.</span> <span id="s747">You live together with my children as neighbors all your life till you were taken away.</span> <span id="s748">I mean, why don't you have this."</span> <span id="s749">And I look at him, and I talk to him, "Look, I mean, in Auschwitz I saw blood, dollars, gold, everything mixed on the floor when we are dressing.</span> <span id="s750">I don't need it.</span> <span id="s751">I'm not staying here."</span> <span id="s752">And three days later I went -- at that time the Jewish emissaries from Palestine, or whoever wanted to go, they were guiding us out of Poland, and I went and I came to Frankfurt am Main.</span> <span id="s753">Well, that ends, I think, the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: So this --</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s756">Now, that what I told her later.</span> <span id="s757">This is probably you have thousand of these stories.</span> <span id="s758">And I understand the purpose of it.</span> <span id="s759">But I told him that at that point in life when we are -- you know, I am 87 today.</span> <span id="s760">What happened to the people after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: I want to know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: Well, we came here, and -- well, I met my -- well, no, no -- after the war, we decided that we are going to continue with our education.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: Who is "we?"</span> <span id="s764">By this point -- because you sound like --</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: Me and few friends in Salzheim, which was near suburb of Frankfurt am Main.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: I need to ask a question here.</span> <span id="s767">I can understand -- no, let me rephrase it -- I can't understand.</span> <span id="s768">I can't imagine what it would be like to go to a family friend with whom I was close and have the wife shut the door in my face.</span> <span id="s769">I can't imagine that.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: I don't -- I never hate against her.</span> <span id="s771">She didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s772">I mean, her daughter was dead -- everything -- she panicked.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: And the daughter -- well, I know the girl all my life.</span> <span id="s775">I mean, she ran after me, and she wanted that her dad would come and explain to me what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: What the situation was.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: But what I want to say is, "That was more painful for you to stay and watch -- to stay there than to live, at least temporarily, in Germany?"</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: No, we didn't want it.</span> <span id="s780">We didn't want it.</span> <span id="s781">We just wanted out.</span> <span id="s782">Polish -- Poland was quite unsymmetric.</span> <span id="s783">And we felt that --</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: There's no place.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: -- there's no future there.</span> <span id="s786">I didn't know nobody; they were Poles.</span> <span id="s787">I met a few of my classmates who survived.</span> <span id="s788">Oh, what they told me, "Look, I mean, if you join, you see very few native Poles -- communists -- would arrest a priest."</span> <span id="s789">They wouldn't.</span> <span id="s790">To the Jews, who today you come, and they were in the uniforms of the Polish political police and this -- if you joined for a year and a half, they'll forgive you everything -- that your father own a factory.</span> <span id="s791">You know, it was communist Pole.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: That you were bourgeoisie, and so on so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s794">That you could go to university.</span> <span id="s795">I said "Good luck -- I'm going back."</span> <span id="s796">I went back.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: So for -- if I can paraphrase -- for a variety of reasons.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: No. 1 -- there's no family left; there's nobody close.</span> <span id="s800">No. 2 --</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: What would I do there?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: -- as a society, Poland is anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s803">No. 3 -- your choices are to join the police to maybe arrest a priest, and that's your ticket to get to university.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s805">That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: And what choices are those?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s808">I went back.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: And I learned that in Frankfurt am Main, that was displaced person camp in suburb, maybe 20 miles Salzheim.</span> <span id="s811">And there were few boys whom I met who also were going to the same class with I. And we decided that we better go -- No -- and then we realized already -- it was 1946.</span> <span id="s812">We realized that we are not going -- that no country would admit us so soon.</span> <span id="s813">And to stay over in Germany, relented.</span> <span id="s814">So we went and enrolled in university.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: Which university is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: Johann Wolfgang Goethe-UniversitÃ¤t.</span> <span id="s817">I call this University of Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s818">What really happened, we went, and they were very, very forthcoming.</span> <span id="s819">"Oh, yeah?</span> <span id="s820">You are survivors?</span> <span id="s821">You don't have to pay the tuition.</span> <span id="s822">You'll get free books -- this, this.</span> <span id="s823">Where is your abitur?"</span> <span id="s824">You know what is abitur?</span> <span id="s825">Abitur -- it is probably something --</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: Like a certificate.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: -- like in New York Board of Regents certificate, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: Well, we said, "Well, if that's what you wanted, you have to look in the Auschwitz for it."</span> <span id="s830">"Well, we are very sorry.</span> <span id="s831">You don't have the papers.</span> <span id="s832">We cannot admit you."</span> <span id="s833">And we decided to go to Wiesbaden, which was 20 miles from Frankfurt am Main headquarters of American army.</span> <span id="s834">And we got to so-called "education officer."</span> <span id="s835">He was a man -- I think he was some associate professor before at University of Michigan.</span> <span id="s836">You know Europe was very, very conservative.</span> <span id="s837">Could be 95 degrees, but when you go to table to eat, you wear a jacket.</span> <span id="s838">Here it's a guy with an open shirt, one foot on the table with big cigar, "What can I do for you, boys?"</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: [chuckling]</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: And we are talking -- we are explaining to him.</span> <span id="s841">He interrupted us, and he said, "You know what it is?</span> <span id="s842">It's a telephone.</span> <span id="s843">All what I have to do is to give one phone call, and you'll be --</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: -- admitted.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: He said, "But what are you going to stay in Germany?"</span> <span id="s846">I said, "No, we want to emigrate."</span> <span id="s847">"Well, I will tell you -- I taught in the United States.</span> <span id="s848">As much as they will sympathize from you, you have to produce some kind of equivalence certificate before you got admitted to university.</span> <span id="s849">So what I'll arrange for you -- I'll assign -- I will call the hesen[?]</span> <span id="s850">.</span> <span id="s851">I will call the government of hesen, the education ministry, and they will assign three people, and you'll be screening people who want to continue education."</span> <span id="s852">We did.</span> <span id="s853">I was the first president of Jewish Student Association over there.</span> <span id="s854">In 1948, started with three or four people.</span> <span id="s855">Went to almost 100.</span> <span id="s856">But the 100, a great majority of them were kids who came -- who parents fled with them to Russia -- they came back.</span> <span id="s857">There were few programs in Poland.</span> <span id="s858">And they continue --</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: -- West.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s861">I met my wife.</span> <span id="s862">And she was in a nursing school.</span> <span id="s863">We got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: How long were you working with the Jewish students?</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: How long were you working there in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: About three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: That's a long while.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s870">I took a number of courses.</span> <span id="s871">But when I came here, the courses are called different.</span> <span id="s872">They gave me number of credits.</span> <span id="s873">They gave me number of credits.</span> <span id="s874">I -- I had to relearn the language.</span> <span id="s875">I was going to study pharmacy.</span> <span id="s876">They told us that medical profession's very hard to breakthrough for newcomers.</span> <span id="s877">But wasn't really the case.</span> <span id="s878">When I came, they told me, "Look, you have a lot of credits, but you're in Poland.</span> <span id="s879">When you finish school, you went to university.</span> <span id="s880">You didn't take sociology, you didn't take economics and so forth.</span> <span id="s881">That's all the courses you did in high school.</span> <span id="s882">In the university, you were studying in your faculty."</span> <span id="s883">So I had to take the courses in English --</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: All this liberal arts stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s886">I'll show you something.</span> <span id="s887">Because, for me, it was mostly repetition.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: It was mostly repetition?</span> <span id="s889">This is --</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: That's a watch.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: That's a watch.</span> <span id="s892">But this is the gold medal, and it is --</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: You have it here engraved.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s895">Let me see what it says.</span> <span id="s896">"Awarded to Eugene Miller of the College of Pharmacy of Butler University?</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: And where is Butler University?</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: Indianapolis, Indiana.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: [to girl] You would know what it is, right?</span> <span id="s901">You went to school there?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: [girl] Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: [interviewee] You went to Butler?</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: [girl] Not to butler.</span> <span id="s905">Indiana University.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: [interviewee] Oh, I finished pharmacy.</span> <span id="s907">Well, okay.</span> <span id="s908">(phone ringing)</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s910">So, in other words, you didn't listen to them and you went to pharmacy school.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s912">I went.</span> <span id="s913">I didn't understood the system here.</span> <span id="s914">I could have gone to university and get most of the credits.</span> <span id="s915">But in Germany, your faculty was your state board.</span> <span id="s916">They were employees of the government.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: Not here.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: So I -- so they told me, "You have to."</span> <span id="s921">But anyway, I repeat it.</span> <span id="s922">I got my license.</span> <span id="s923">And -- okay.</span> <span id="s924">And I started to work, and I didn't care for a pharmacy here, because that's -- that's not even a drugstore.</span> <span id="s925">You got everything here.</span> <span id="s926">This is not aptekacia [sic].</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: That's right.</span> <span id="s928">This is not apteka.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: Anyway, I decided after 40 years, I told my wife, "You know what I'll do -- it's easy to transfer for the second shift.</span> <span id="s930">Everybody wants to work in the morning.</span> <span id="s931">Maybe I can make a master degree."</span> <span id="s932">I was -- and we were -- then we moved to Chicago.</span> <span id="s933">I was at that time in Chicago.</span> <span id="s934">We moved because my wife's family lived over there.</span> <span id="s935">And I -- I went -- I called University of Chicago, which is on quarter system, not on semester system.</span> <span id="s936">And I called in the middle of the quarter; I didn't want to be hasty about this.</span> <span id="s937">My wife didn't work.</span> <span id="s938">We have a small house.</span> <span id="s939">We have already two children.</span> <span id="s940">So I call, and I wanted to find out particulars.</span> <span id="s941">And a man answered.</span> <span id="s942">I said, "May I speak to the secretary of the department?"</span> <span id="s943">"Well, she's indisposed today.</span> <span id="s944">Can I help you?"</span> <span id="s945">Well, I told him.</span> <span id="s946">He said, "Why don't you come out here, Eugene?"</span> <span id="s947">And I came.</span> <span id="s948">He was talking to me.</span> <span id="s949">Then he take a piece of paper, "Sketch your grades."</span> <span id="s950">It was almost straight A's.</span> <span id="s951">He said, "Look."</span> <span id="s952">He opened -- "I have here a pre-doctoral public health National Institute of Health scholarship.</span> <span id="s953">If I offer to you, we'll help you financially.</span> <span id="s954">Can you start tomorrow?"</span> <span id="s955">I look at him and said, "Doctor Roth," I told him.</span> <span id="s956">"You don't know much about me, but I have a house -- small house -- with a large mortgage.</span> <span id="s957">I have a wife, doesn't work now.</span> <span id="s958">I have two children, and I have a dog.</span> <span id="s959">I just cannot drop everything and live on the 600 -- or whatever they offer as -- to help."</span> <span id="s960">And he said, "Well, I'll tell you something.</span> <span id="s961">Maybe you can earn something.</span> <span id="s962">Anyway, this offer is good for three months to next quarter."</span> <span id="s963">I came back, and I talked to my wife.</span> <span id="s964">I talked her what happened.</span> <span id="s965">She said, "What's the problem?</span> <span id="s966">I'll go to work."</span> <span id="s967">She went on -- she went, took a streetcar, and the second day she had a job.</span> <span id="s968">So I went.</span> <span id="s969">And I finished.</span> <span id="s970">I got my Ph.D. in pharmacology in medical school, University of Chicago.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: And as I was -- and I still was working and teaching in the lab.</span> <span id="s973">And one day the Food and Drug Administration Director of Bureau of Science was giving a lecture and chairman of my department introduced me.</span> <span id="s974">There were very few new pharmacology departments.</span> <span id="s975">That was in '60's.</span> <span id="s976">That was after the Russian put the Sputnik and Kennedy put money, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: -- "Science, science, science."</span> <span id="s979">And okay -- so I -- I got over there, and to him for an interview.</span> <span id="s980">And he said, "If you want a job with us, you have a job."</span> <span id="s981">And I accepted.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: Let's see.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: This is my

GS 15, I was chief of metabolism branch.</span> <span id="s1040">And I directed research -- the entire research.</span> <span id="s1041">You see, we were a Freestone Facility in Belsford.</span> <span id="s1042">That was -- we had a large animal facility.</span> <span id="s1043">We done -- that was all kind of research done -- cancer, heart, brain, you know?</span> <span id="s1044">It was a facility with the laboratories.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: I have a question -- there was someone who spoke to you this morning who -- is everything okay?</span> <span id="s1046">Is that on the

Oh, you want to show me something.</span> <span id="s1051">Good.</span> <span id="s1052">So you show me, and then I'll ask my question.</span> <span id="s1053">It is -- there are some people who would never be able to really get past what they went through, and today -- I mean, there's a lady who we spoke to who was amazing, but she told us that every once in awhile some wave will come upon her --</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: Oh yeah -- oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: And so, with -- to be able to have such accomplishments.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: No -- let me explain to you something, and you understand -- that's very easy.</span> <span id="s1057">When you came here, we wanted not to forget, but we wanted not to think, not to have the nightmares.</span> <span id="s1058">So work, work, work, work.</span> <span id="s1059">I worked two shifts.</span> <span id="s1060">When I went to university, you know, I still -- that was my native language.</span> <span id="s1061">You very simply tried to do whatever you could -- I mean -- and -- and I remember in the school, in the pharmacy school, where they are saying these things "I was on top of my class."</span> <span id="s1062">I mean, look -- people like -- there were two or three.</span> <span id="s1063">I mean, the older people -- I was in my 20's -- what we are, there are finals.</span> <span id="s1064">A week before we have a big dance, and they are sitting and studying, you know?</span> <span id="s1065">It isn't fair.</span> <span id="s1066">Well, but that, you know, you wanted.</span> <span id="s1067">You wanted to be busy, busy, busy.</span> <span id="s1068">I did things besides going to school.</span> <span id="s1069">When we came here, I was -- I worked in the neighborhood, and I -- I was the one who established -- we collected money, Neighborhood Tutor Organization Training Leader Conference in Wisconsin.</span> <span id="s1070">And what we did, we financed this, collected the money.</span> <span id="s1071">I was busy.</span> <span id="s1072">I was busy, because simply you wanted to be involved in something, not just to be sitting.</span> <span id="s1073">But there was a many nights.</span> <span id="s1074">And German don't understand this -- or maybe they do -- you wake up all sweated because you have a nightmare.</span> <span id="s1075">I -- I -- the boy what I told you who died, I was -- well, I -- I -- I knew him, but you know he was another boy in the class.</span> <span id="s1076">He was the oldest son had a relatively young father.</span> <span id="s1077">I remember when I -- when they liberated me after four or five days, I found a big stick, and I supported myself.</span> <span id="s1078">I said, I was looking for, "Maybe I'll recognize some face."</span> <span id="s1079">And her father, he called me in and said, "Did you?"</span> <span id="s1080">I said, "Yes, I was with your son in Kaufering in Da -- in the various subcamps.</span> <span id="s1081">And the guy just squeezed my hand.</span> <span id="s1082">"I won't live till tomorrow.</span> <span id="s1083">Tell me that my son is alive."</span> <span id="s1084">I couldn't tell him that his son was dead.</span> <span id="s1085">I said, "Yes, he is alive, but I'll come tomorrow."</span> <span id="s1086">Tomorrow he was dead.</span> <span id="s1087">I mean, and this things -- you know, hounds you.</span> <span id="s1088">Not many times, but if this -- it is hard to take, but life goes on.</span> <span id="s1089">You see, I have two kids.</span> <span id="s1090">And they know.</span> <span id="s1091">I mean, I told them.</span> <span id="s1092">But they cannot understand.</span> <span id="s1093">Well, they can understand, and they cannot understand.</span> <span id="s1094">And my son is a nuclear engineer.</span> <span id="s1095">He is in charge of nuclear reactor here behind the navy.</span> <span id="s1096">My daughter is vice president of a large pharmaceutical company.</span> <span id="s1097">And they have their lives.</span> <span id="s1098">They know from -- I really wasn't talking to them, because I felt that they would never understand how just frightened as a children.</span> <span id="s1099">But they know.</span> <span id="s1100">My daughter was very active in the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s1101">You know they go.</span> <span id="s1102">They visit Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s1103">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Q: Did you have a conversation with them like we have today of, you know, such -- two hours?</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: Oh, they know.</span> <span id="s1106">They know everything.</span> <span id="s1107">But they -- it's very hard for somebody understand to see his parents, and almost yourself dying hunger death.</span> <span id="s1108">You know, this is worse probably than the labor -- than the labor in the camp.</span> <span id="s1109">I mean, it's -- no -- I still feel that somebody had to go through it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1111">We're in the museum -- we're not --</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: My wife had a completely different experience.</span> <span id="s1113">Number one, she's five years younger than I. And she lived in -- on the other side, on the Russian occupation Dugna, Poland.</span> <span id="s1114">Now it's Ukraina.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: Can you pause for a second?</span> <span id="s1116">Sorry.</span> <span id="s1117">It's a golden rule with us that she calls me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: Well, she was 11 years old when the war started.</span> <span id="s1119">And when the German -- and she was blond and had a green eyes, and she could pass -- if you know what I mean -- she could pass, and she couldn't pass.</span> <span id="s1120">She never got -- oh, she got some money from Germany.</span> <span id="s1121">But they rejected her application.</span> <span id="s1122">They didn't understood this.</span> <span id="s1123">One time she said -- her parents bought birth a certificate of deceased Polish peasant girl.</span> <span id="s1124">Peasants don't talk with the same accent which people in big cities will speak whole Deutsche.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: That's true -- and chatte Deutsche.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s1127">So that was fine for the Germans.</span> <span id="s1128">Blond, green eyes child --</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: She's okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: -- no problem.</span> <span id="s1131">But in the village -- there was mixed village -- Ukrainian and Poles.</span> <span id="s1132">And, after her par -- her father escape, he was in Parczew[?]</span> <span id="s1133">with me.</span> <span id="s1134">There were five, six people with guns, and they survive in the woods.</span> <span id="s1135">He lived through liberation.</span> <span id="s1136">He died here.</span> <span id="s1137">And there were -- so they said that -- oh, and so, who saved her was their maid.</span> <span id="s1138">She worked for the Gentile maid.</span> <span id="s1139">She worked for them for 15 years.</span> <span id="s1140">And she went to her village.</span> <span id="s1141">But what -- but, when she would have grown up and talked to the neighbors, she just opened her mouth, they would know that she's not a girl -- deceased girl from a little Polish village.</span> <span id="s1142">And Ukrainians (indecipherable) her and (indecipherable) her sponsor.</span> <span id="s1143">So, when she wrote that this and this, she said "Well, how come she has the papers and she has to hide and this?"</span> <span id="s1144">She said, "To hell with you -- I don't want the money," and she dropped it.</span> <span id="s1145">She got some money later from Germany.</span> <span id="s1146">They give $5,000 to every survivor -- that she got.</span> <span id="s1147">But for the indemnity -- what she went as a halfway -- she said she's not going to go into it, it will tear her apart.</span> <span id="s1148">Her mother was a pharmacist.</span> <span id="s1149">The father paid somebody to drive a carriage, and he was supposed to meet them.</span> <span id="s1150">She never made it.</span> <span id="s1151">Her sister was dark.</span> <span id="s1152">Her mother looked Jewish.</span> <span id="s1153">The sister was dark-eyed.</span> <span id="s1154">She was still some place on the way.</span> <span id="s1155">And he survived in the forest.</span> <span id="s1156">The men slept for two years on snow -- period.</span> <span id="s1157">They stole few potatoes.</span> <span id="s1158">The Poles -- the Polish farmers were afraid to tell Germans, because they're afraid that the people who survive will set their house on fire.</span> <span id="s1159">So later, when the Russian liberated him, they sent him in the army.</span> <span id="s1160">They took one look at this man and said, "He cannot serve in the army."</span> <span id="s1161">And they sent him to Siberia to work as an accountant in a -- and that was not bad, she said.</span> <span id="s1162">He walked three miles a day to here through the snow.</span> <span id="s1163">Finally he got sick.</span> <span id="s1164">Some Russian soldiers brought her, and he get reunited after the war with my wife.</span> <span id="s1165">She wanted to go back.</span> <span id="s1166">She wanted to go back.</span> <span id="s1167">When she -- when the war ended, the village was about five or eight miles away from her town in Lewino [?]</span> <span id="s1168">, so she went.</span> <span id="s1169">And all she said that the house was bombed, her broken bicycle was laid.</span> <span id="s1170">And she started to sit down to cry.</span> <span id="s1171">So some neighbors came and said, "Look, there are some Jewish survivors.</span> <span id="s1172">They live here and there."</span> <span id="s1173">When she went there -- and she didn't know her father survived.</span> <span id="s1174">She wanted to go back.</span> <span id="s1175">Because what happened to the woman, she took her to a priest.</span> <span id="s1176">And she said, "I'll tell you something.</span> <span id="s1177">She doesn't look Jewish.</span> <span id="s1178">If nobody survives, raise her as a Catholic.</span> <span id="s1179">If her parents survive, let her go to her people."</span> <span id="s1180">Well, she never found.</span> <span id="s1181">She said, "I'm going to go back."</span> <span id="s1182">She said, "No, no -- you don't go back.</span> <span id="s1183">Not only kill you, they'll also kill the girl who sheltered you."</span> <span id="s1184">So anyway, she later got reunited when he was sick, brought back with her father and her cousin.</span> <span id="s1185">And we met in Germany.</span> <span id="s1186">She was studying in Munich.</span> <span id="s1187">I was studying Frankfurt am Main.</span> <span id="s1188">But I was member of executive board of Jewish student unions in Germany.</span> <span id="s1189">So, when I came over there, I met her through another girl.</span> <span id="s1190">Well, we dated after -- we married in 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: So it's been 62 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1193">But that's the story.</span> <span id="s1194">And you can have a this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s1196">I have one question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: Let me just show you one more thing what I wanted to show you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: I wanted to ask you too -- did you ever regret that you came back from the Russian border and didn't go to your uncle in Moscow?</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: Probably I would have nightmares that I -- oh, I would have (indecipherable) cancers, because that's what I felt.</span> <span id="s1200">"I was the only child, and I left my people to die."</span> <span id="s1201">I don't know what would have happened.</span> <span id="s1202">If I would have survived, they probably would have taken me in the Russian army.</span> <span id="s1203">You see -- in 1997, we got in touch.</span> <span id="s1204">And there was a number of us -- oh, I think around 60 or 70 people, and we decided to have reunion -- take a cruise together.</span> <span id="s1205">So we went to Boca Raton in Florida, and we for three days there, and then we took a cruise.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: How wonderful.</span> <span id="s1207">How wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: You can have this too.</span> <span id="s1209">I have a copy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s1211">Thank you.</span> <span id="s1212">Is there anything else that you would like to add to this interview?</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: No.</span> <span id="s1214">No.</span> <span id="s1215">But you have it essentially.</span> <span id="s1216">I mean, all essentials are here.</span> <span id="s1217">I told you other things, I mean, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">Q: That's what we wanted to know.</span> <span id="s1219">We wanted to know all of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: Thank you very much, sir.</span> <span id="s1222">This ends our interview with Mr. Eugene Miller on September 13, 2010.</span> <span id="s1223">Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: You're very welcome.</span></p> <p><span
