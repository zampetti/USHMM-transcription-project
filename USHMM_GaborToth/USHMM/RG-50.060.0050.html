became Poland , and is now Russia.</span> <span id="s4">My parents moved to Vienna before the first war.</span> <span id="s5">So, I grew up in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Parents: My fathers name was Maurice, my mothers name was [???]</span> <span id="s7">.</span> <span id="s8">I had a brother and three sisters who all survived.</span> <span id="s9">My parents perished and my grandparents.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">Childhood: I went to grade school and middle school.</span> <span id="s11">At 14 a quit because it was only compulsory up until 14.</span> <span id="s12">I had some training at trade schools.</span> <span id="s13">My older sister survived.</span> <span id="s14">She went to Switzerland and then to England.</span> <span id="s15">My younger sister went to Italy with her husband.</span> <span id="s16">I was considered a Polish subject, but in reality I was stateless.</span> <span id="s17">My youngest sister was deported from Belgium to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Was life comfortable in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">It was comfortable but the Austrians were very anti-jewish.</span> <span id="s20">If something was wrong , it was blamed on the jews.</span> <span id="s21">But we were young.</span> <span id="s22">We didn't pay much attention.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Was there any personal discrimination?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Not really.</span> <span id="s25">My neighborhood was about 20% ~ewish.</span> <span id="s26">Once the propaganda from the Nazis came, we felt it.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">05:00 ( 1 2 : 1 7 } Before the Germans came, [???]</span> <span id="s28">wanted all the votes for him.</span> <span id="s29">Before he [Hitler?]</span> <span id="s30">marched in he counted all the jewish votes.</span> <span id="s31">We would have voted for him anyway, we had no choice.</span> <span id="s32">In Vienna, the jewish population was about 10%( about 250,000}.</span> <span id="s33">It was , somehow, pretty comfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">I was working in a factory house which had to close up in 1932.</span> <span id="s35">After that I had many odd jobs.</span> <span id="s36">About a year before Hitler came, we had a guild system.</span> <span id="s37">If you wanted to learn a profession, you had to sign up and get an apprenticeship.</span> <span id="s38">My mother had a permit to conduct business.</span> <span id="s39">She didn't use it, but she paid for it, because you never know when you~d need it.</span> <span id="s40">I discovered this, and I said ~ Maybe I could use it my mother's name.</span> <span id="s41">It was march 1938 that the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s42">I took my brother and we travelled to Germany and Belgium, where we were caught.We were sent back and to jail.We were sent to a concentration camp called [???</span> <span id="s43">-burg].</span></p> <p><span id="s44">1 0 : 00 { 1 2 : 22 } My brother had a heart condition.</span> <span id="s45">I said, " Go see the doctor".</span> <span id="s46">So, he went to see the doctor, who was an elderly gentlemen.</span> <span id="s47">The doctor said," What are you doing in jail.</span> <span id="s48">What did you do?"</span> <span id="s49">.</span> <span id="s50">"Nothing", my brother said.</span> <span id="s51">The doctor said he could get us out.</span> <span id="s52">Two weeks later, under funny circumstances, we were released.</span> <span id="s53">We came out and there was somebody waiting for us outside.</span> <span id="s54">He said, " If you don~t go back to Vienna, and you are caught again, you will go straight to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s55">Don~t try to stay".</span> <span id="s56">We decided to cross the border into Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">How did you make it acro~s the border?on foot?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Somebody gave us a piece of paper with a plan.</span> <span id="s59">We took a streetcar to the border.</span> <span id="s60">When we got near the border we had to go into the forest.</span> <span id="s61">The first time we were caught we just stopped.</span> <span id="s62">A border guard was screaming~ What the hell are you doing?</span> <span id="s63">~ He pointed out where the border was.</span> <span id="s64">He must have known.</span> <span id="s65">That couldn't have been the first time.</span> <span id="s66">WE gave him cigarettes and he let us cross the border.</span> <span id="s67">We were in Brussels for two weeks before the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s68">When the Germans came in, we [got] 15 kilometers from Brussels.</span> <span id="s69">We were offered a ride.</span> <span id="s70">He said, " Are you Germans, you're not from here."</span> <span id="s71">We said, " No, we are jewish.</span> <span id="s72">"So, he took us to a prison.</span> <span id="s73">From there we were transported by cattlecar to [???</span> <span id="s74">France ???]</span> <span id="s75">.</span> <span id="s76">This transporter was bombed by the English after four days in the cattlecar with no food or drink.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">~ Missed a lot here 1 5 : O O { 1 2 : 2 7 } The French soldiers had to protect us.</span> <span id="s78">But they were angry that they had to protect Germans.</span> <span id="s79">They had mixed feelings.</span> <span id="s80">After four weeks we came to a camp, and we stayed there under terrible conditions.For two weeks after this, many people were sick.</span> <span id="s81">Sickness was the worst thing.</span> <span id="s82">Very painful.</span> <span id="s83">We couldn't complain.The Germans closed in and the French moved us to [SaintSoucrain??}</span> <span id="s84">It was close to the sea, and the conditions were terrible.</span> <span id="s85">Imagine eating onions for days.</span> <span id="s86">The commander from the camp bought food but we had to throw it away [ because it was spoiled].</span></p> <p><span id="s87">You say you were in a camp.</span> <span id="s88">The~e were French people?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">French people.</span> <span id="s90">Before, a man came who spoke German.</span> <span id="s91">He said, I hear there are some jews who want to fight against Hitler.So, we stood in line to sign the papers .</span> <span id="s92">But do you know what he wanted us to sign?</span> <span id="s93">Papers to join the foreign legion.</span> <span id="s94">We wanted to fight Hitler not go to Africa.</span> <span id="s95">He said, "I'm giving you an opportunity to get out of this camp, and you don't want it?"</span> <span id="s96">Some people signed.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">20:00 ( 1 2 : 3 2 } In the camp, there was a lot of corruption.Some people had some money.</span> <span id="s98">So, since there was nothing to eat, some soldiers came in to sell us bread from their rations.They were punished.</span> <span id="s99">People started to die.</span> <span id="s100">A few jewish doctors were there and were helping us.</span> <span id="s101">They[ the french] didn't want to admit it ~ the conditions ], because they didn't want the population outside the camp to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">When I was sick .</span> <span id="s103">I found I couldn~t stand up.</span> <span id="s104">I had another friend and we decided to sneak out of the camp.</span> <span id="s105">There were guards, but one day there was a sandstorm.</span> <span id="s106">The guards were hiding and we sneaked out.</span> <span id="s107">We went to a town.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Did you speak French?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A little bit because I was living in Belgium.</span> <span id="s110">.</span> <span id="s111">My sisters husband was a sports reporter and his father was a foreign correspondent for Austria.</span> <span id="s112">My mother used to make fish.</span> <span id="s113">On this friday night, we sat around to eat.</span> <span id="s114">My mother wanted to meet the in-laws.</span> <span id="s115">They had to leave at 12:00 to work on the Sunday edition.Mr burg said, " Stan, we have to go to work~ My sister said to her husband, " You are not going" He said, ~Yes, I am going".</span> <span id="s116">She said, " If you go you will not find me when you get back~.</span> <span id="s117">His father said he had to go.</span> <span id="s118">That same night, he was arrested.</span> <span id="s119">He was put in a camp with two parts and there was an [ alley] between them.</span> <span id="s120">You were not allowed to go up to this fence.</span> <span id="s121">But you could here people talking--Austrians, Germans.</span> <span id="s122">So one day we went, thinking we would meet somebody there.</span> <span id="s123">We were in between the two parts and I said to my brother, "You know , this is crazy" We knew our brother in law was sent to battle.</span> <span id="s124">We heard a voice.</span> <span id="s125">It said, " who are you?"</span> <span id="s126">."</span> <span id="s127">Why can't I see you?"</span> <span id="s128">WE wanted to see each other.</span> <span id="s129">Someone said, "I have a candle in the barracks".</span> <span id="s130">This Mr. burg was a stately man.</span> <span id="s131">When we saw him,we shrunk.</span> <span id="s132">His hand was missing.When they arrested him, they didn't want him leaving any evidence with his writings.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">~ Missing a part ~ When he was [released?]</span> <span id="s134">his wife knew he was coming to Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">I met my wife in Belgium.</span> <span id="s136">She was Polish.</span> <span id="s137">She and her parents fled on foot to Belgium and then France.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">30:00</span></p> <p><span id="s139">{12"42} You were married at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Yes.</span> <span id="s141">I was married.</span> <span id="s142">She had fled with her parents to France , and she didn't know what happened to me.</span> <span id="s143">She checked the Red Cross[ etc].</span> <span id="s144">We are sitting in the camp one day and somebody walked by with an envelope and I recognized the handwriting.</span> <span id="s145">I said, " Hey, is that l~tter for me?"</span> <span id="s146">.</span> <span id="s147">He said; " Here."</span> <span id="s148">So, anyway, I knew where she was.</span> <span id="s149">When I left the camp I went to Toulouse.</span> <span id="s150">Toulouse is not too big a town.</span> <span id="s151">There was a lot of people who were not French.</span> <span id="s152">There were a lot of refugees, mostly ~ewish people.</span> <span id="s153">The Vichy regime was cutting off sections of the city and sending people to camps there.</span> <span id="s154">We went to Belgium and stayed there until 1941, when became again impossible.</span> <span id="s155">One day, they knocked on my door and gave me a .</span> <span id="s156">It said that I was needed and should report to work for the war cause.</span> <span id="s157">When they came, I closed my apartment and looked for one .</span> <span id="s158">There were many vacancies but people don't always want you.</span> <span id="s159">And you don~t know who you are talking to.</span> <span id="s160">One lady looked at us, and she said to stand over there.</span> <span id="s161">We asked if she had a room to rent.</span> <span id="s162">She took us in.</span> <span id="s163">We stayed there as long as possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">35:00</span></p> <p><span id="s165">{12:47} In the meantime we had contact with some resistance people and we went out at night sometimes.</span> <span id="s166">We left and went to France, and there was an underground there.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Can you tell us about the underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">One time we came to a little town and I saw the commander of the French , and this was the nan I was looking for.</span> <span id="s169">I hung a crucifix on my wife .</span> <span id="s170">One lady too~us in and made us food.</span> <span id="s171">When we left, she warned us-" ~e careful.</span> <span id="s172">Ihere are many jews out there.</span> <span id="s173">I can see that you are catholics."</span> <span id="s174">So, we found out this commander and we went to his house.</span> <span id="s175">There were kids running around.She [his wife] said he was not there.</span> <span id="s176">WE waited, and she was putting dishes away with my wife and they liked each other.</span> <span id="s177">When he came, I told him that someone had told me who he was and he blew up.</span> <span id="s178">But then he calmed down.</span> <span id="s179">He said I could stay with him, and I could go out with him.</span> <span id="s180">He said, first I have to ask you something.</span> <span id="s181">He said, " Are you ~ewish?'</span> <span id="s182">.</span> <span id="s183">My instinct was to say "no".</span> <span id="s184">The next day he asked again and I said, ~' no'~.</span> <span id="s185">I had false papers , and by coincidence his wife was Belgian.</span> <span id="s186">She remembered a family with this name in a ~rench</span></p> <p><span id="s187">40:00 {12:52~ region.</span> <span id="s188">I spoke French with an accent.</span> <span id="s189">She said, " Why don't you speak French" We went into the forest and there were maybe twenty people talking.</span> <span id="s190">He asked again if I was ~ewish.</span> <span id="s191">I said "No.</span> <span id="s192">But what is the difference?"</span> <span id="s193">.</span> <span id="s194">He said then that he wouldn't waste one of his men for a jew.</span> <span id="s195">W~ left and never stayed two nights in one spot.</span> <span id="s196">France was divided.</span> <span id="s197">W~ went to the other side of France.</span> <span id="s198">Meanwhile it had been a long time since we left Belgium.</span> <span id="s199">IN 1943 we tried to go to Switzerla ~.</span> <span id="s200">They wanted to keep my wife and my son and send me back.</span> <span id="s201">Myr'screamed and grabbed my legs.</span> <span id="s202">They said, " Okay, for a while you can stay, but you cannot contact anybody here."</span> <span id="s203">There was a law to deport people from Switzerland.</span> <span id="s204">I got a letter later that the war was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">How did you support yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">There were many labor camps in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s207">I got pennies--hardly enough for cigarettes.</span> <span id="s208">My wife was working in a camp also.</span> <span id="s209">After the war, my wife was a citizen of Belgium, so she could be</span></p> <p><span id="s210">45:00</span></p> <p><span id="s211">{12:57} repatriated.</span> <span id="s212">Her, not me.</span> <span id="s213">I left Switzerland and went to France, where I was arrested and put in jail with Germans.One day , a Belgian officer came to take Belgian citizens home.</span> <span id="s214">There were six rewish boys there.</span> <span id="s215">Two were from Belgium.When we came to see the captain, I told him I was ~ewish, and my wife was in Belgium.</span> <span id="s216">He said if I didn't have any papers I had to [ contact someone in Belgium?]</span> <span id="s217">3 or 4 days later, a man walks in and says, " Where are the jews that want to go to Belgium?</span> <span id="s218">A couple of days later he took us out.</span> <span id="s219">He said,~' I am President of the Jewish Community.</span> <span id="s220">First of all, eat".</span></p> <p><span id="s221">50:00</span></p> <p><span id="s222">{1:02} What authority did he ha e to do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">He was President of the ~ewish community.</span> <span id="s224">But, the authority was with the Belgian commander.</span> <span id="s225">He didn't want us.</span> <span id="s226">Nobody knew me in France.</span> <span id="s227">They knew me in Belgium.</span> <span id="s228">He drove us around and brought us to city hall to give us some [ Belgian marks?]</span> <span id="s229">.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">We went to the ~ewish people that we knew.We were looking for a place to stay the night.</span> <span id="s231">[ A woman] with an apartment said she would take me in.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">So, were you reunited with your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">My wife had been repatriated legally and would be arriving in two weeks.</span> <span id="s234">She came home, she asked everybody where I was.</span> <span id="s235">She didn't know what to think.</span> <span id="s236">I was hoping to have an apartment and everything before she came.</span> <span id="s237">So, she went to the landlord we had before.</span> <span id="s238">He offered her a room in the attic.</span> <span id="s239">I came back and I didn't know where to go.</span> <span id="s240">So, I went to the same landlord.</span> <span id="s241">He said~' Oh, you're back already.</span> <span id="s242">Your wife must be happy".</span> <span id="s243">I didn't even know my wife was there.</span> <span id="s244">Later, someone asked me " How is your sister?"</span> <span id="s245">I knew she had been at Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s246">I said, " She's here?"</span> <span id="s247">, and he said, " sure she's here".</span> <span id="s248">I found out she was very, very, sick.</span> <span id="s249">She needed hospitalization.</span> <span id="s250">So, we were told that they didn't have enough room for there own people and that we would have to go back to Austria.</span> <span id="s251">.</span> <span id="s252">So.</span> <span id="s253">the Red Cross took her back to Austria.</span> <span id="s254">Then one day I read an article in the paper.</span> <span id="s255">There was a lady in a camp, she was being accused by the British of helping the Nazis kill people.She mentioned my sister as a witness that she didn't do it.So, they took my sister to Hamburg to be a witness~The judge said, " Is it true that she gave you shoes and she gave~bread?</span> <span id="s256">.</span> <span id="s257">"She said, " I cannot answer unless you let me give my commentary".</span> <span id="s258">The judge said, " What is your commentary?"</span> <span id="s259">The commentary was that she took it from people she killed.</span> <span id="s260">THey administered pills to kill them.</span> <span id="s261">You would put the pill on your tongue.</span> <span id="s262">She knew it, but she still gave the pills to the people.</span> <span id="s263">She was hanged later.</span> <span id="s264">My sister asked them[ THe British} to take her back .</span> <span id="s265">They wouldn't do it.</span> <span id="s266">She had to go back on her own.</span> <span id="s267">She was very sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Did you then find her?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">I didn't know where to look.</span> <span id="s270">But she found her husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">What about your brothers and sisters?</span> <span id="s272">I had three sisters and one brother The brother that was with you?</span> <span id="s273">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Did he survive?</span> <span id="s275">Yes , he survived.One sister went to Italy.</span> <span id="s276">From there , they went to the republic.</span> <span id="s277">They told us at the Red Cross that we</span></p> <p><span id="s278">60:00 { 1 : 1 2 } could write letters.</span> <span id="s279">We didn't know where everybody was.</span> <span id="s280">But one sister I knew was in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s281">~ Hard to follow for about two minutes ~ Four weeks later we got a package .</span> <span id="s282">My sister sent us papers.I was not there at the camp.</span> <span id="s283">I had gone to Belgium.</span> <span id="s284">So, he [ brother?]</span> <span id="s285">wrote me from the camp.</span> <span id="s286">He had been transferred to another camp.</span> <span id="s287">He wrote, " Should I wait for you?</span> <span id="s288">~.</span> <span id="s289">I said, " I will follow you" He went to the Republic.</span> <span id="s290">It was the last, or one of the last , ships who left Europe and Africa.So, I lived in Belgium until 1951.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Were you reunited with your son?</span> <span id="s292">Yes, because he was with my wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">.................................................................</span></p> <p><span id="s294">.......................................</span></p> <p><span id="s295">What can I tell you?My family, counting parents, uncles aunts[etc].</span> <span id="s296">There were 60 or 70 people killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">So, you left in '51 with your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Yes.</span> <span id="s299">I lived in Belgium and I didn't want to stay there.</span> <span id="s300">I went to the American consulate.</span> <span id="s301">They told me I would have to wait ten years.</span> <span id="s302">My family said why don't you come to the Republic if you don,t want to stay in Belgium.</span> <span id="s303">It's not like living in Europe.</span> <span id="s304">It's a backward country.</span> <span id="s305">I went to the Republic in 1951 and stayed there until 1960.</span> <span id="s306">In 1958, the trouble started and I didn't want any part of it.</span> <span id="s307">So, I went to the American consulate</span></p> <p><span id="s308">65:00 { 1 : 1 7 } to apply again.</span> <span id="s309">They gave me a questionnaire.</span> <span id="s310">They asked me what happened to the first request.</span> <span id="s311">Two days later I had a Visa.</span> <span id="s312">I came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Did you bring your
