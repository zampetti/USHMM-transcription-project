HELEN TICHAUER AND ANNA PALARCZYK
August 16-7, 1996 [Transcriptionist note: the interpreter is designated by “I” ]
Answer: I went through my library and selected out of 15 books, two or three which are correct and such as __________________ that is, there are two Auschwitz publications,_______________ of Auschwitz, _______________ has the wrong _____________, so if they had got to swindle or to retouch or to add something to an aerial view, then the whole United States aerial view, aerial view photographs should be now investigated.
Question: If who swindled?
A: There are photographs, you said, taken by the Air Force.
Q: Well, yes.
A: That doesn't look to me like a photograph taken by the Air Force. That is a photo mounting of aerial, of aerial, aerial view of the region and a drawing which was added on top of the, of the map, just for educational purposes.
Q: It looks...
A: What?
Q: Yes, _______________.
A: But I thought you are going to bring me some real aerial. [pause]
Q: Sorry.
A: I've been moving from barrack to barrack in the whole region, including later on, _______________ new zone that was established with the new camp and I had the permission to measure each barrack, each, to take all the measurements because I pretended that I don't, that I want to do that myself because I don't want to use _______________ original architectural drawings. Because we were smuggling out plans and if we would have ever caught, then they would have suspected that I have been involved, yeah? So I camouflaged my whole operation by, by, measuring the whole model which I made, measuring barrack by barrack and distances from each barrack and so on. So I had set camp in, still in my head, I can know the numbering system, good or bad, whatever ________________ _______________ afterwards, I couldn't care less, but I, I produced a camp model and a good one which were sent, taken away and _______________ _______________ sent first to the, to the headquarters of the SS and then they told me it was to Berlin. And so did all my other, other work of drafts and diagrams went to the_______________ ofttimes. But we had no fifth row in the _______________ camp flag like produced in all of those drawings. As I have shown you, I have here some publications, with correct, with correct drawings, with correct numbers. Everything else were done and copied by, by a people who were more interested in, in, in, telling their stories than to make a correct, authentic, they are people who could not read a map then and from young people like Kitty Hart(ph), I don't where she learned to read an architectural map or a land drawing or so. And she just copies it and if go further you will find dozens and dozens, many dozens of ______. But how could the Air Force produce aerial views if, of things which did not exist then, I mean that is a very touchy, touchy, situation, don't you think so?
Q: Yes, yes.
I: Ann and I want to add is that yes, is that she remember that Helen made a map and it was really the big size of this table.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: Exactly. _____________.
Q: Which is about what? Four by...
A: _______________.
Q: Four by three or something. No, no, four by two, I don't know.
I: Very good. We can measure.
Q: Very precise mapping, very good mapping.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: All SS men came and they were very delighted of the job. Very good, very impressed.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here] three dimensional model. But his originals, even, even the, the barbed wires, even electric flashlight which went over the whole camp was there. The electrician, your friend...
A: Pojemsky(ph)?
I: Pojemsky(ph).
A: Pojemsky(ph) Henyuck(ph).
I: Henyuck(ph). He mounted ______________ battery under the table and you had to push some button and we had light. So it wasn't, it was fun, why are you laughing?
Q: She always asks me why I laugh when she says something funny.
I: What did I say?
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]
Q: I think what we should do, is we should sit there, comfortably, we're all standing, sitting, moving. Let's get comfortable.
I: No, I had something to... [pause]
Q: You want to finish?
I: I put some food in _____________.
Q: Now?
I: Yeah, because we need at least an hour.
Q: Yeah?
I: To get warmed up, yeah?
Q: Okay, that's fine then. We won't forget.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: High, high visitors of top management, they're not ordinary SS peoples, they were coming from Berlin.
A: Berlin [speaks foreign language here]
I: Yeah, yeah, what else?
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: No ____________, listen carefully, listen carefully. Would you like to translate that? I have_______________ record, I have a tape, ______________ and record, from the _____________, from the ______________. From [speaks foreign language here], where she mentioned, was the event, was the same thing she remembers so well of that model and_______________ the SS [speaks foreign language here] there practically instead to come and to be and to be, demonstrated sample beating of an inmate, they forgot about all that and brought the SS into, the high officers into, into my camp drawing office, to_______________ little childrens, they've got totally, totally impressed by having the model and I was not allowed to do more _________________, who was then in charge of the camp, Hessler(ph) or Hersler(ph), he was Hessler(ph), but everybody's calling him Hersler(ph) and he signed during the, during the trial in Bergen-Belson, his name was Hersler(ph) too, so we have a problem here because we called him Hessler(ph) to distinguish him between Hirst(ph) and Hessler(ph) and himself. _______________ Hersler(ph) in Bergen-Belsen. [speaks foreign language here]. What I wanted to say is that the, the SS had [speaks foreign language here].
A:[speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]. They put on glass cover on top, see [speaks foreign language here] and picks the thing up and I was told, [speaks foreign language here].

I: A stencil, my God, shame on myself. Yeah, a stencil, so stencil paper is produced with ordinary, good quality paper but impregnated with oil, in oil. So that what I have used and then I painted over the barracks with the necessary colors, they had green roofs, they had all kinds of wooden, no, green wooden, wooden, color of the barracks_______________ wooden barracks. Brick barracks and which have produced a _______________, but it looked very, very natural, very well. So that, you know, I was the artist of the camp. And the men, the men are [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: The men can't_______________ and they were jealous, yeah?
A: Yeah. I.. .
I: Go ahead.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I:_______________ replaceable, yeah?
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: She said that, drawing office of_______________ was a, was actually the [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: _______________, it was an attraction, it was an attraction.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: ...in the woman's camp and it was...
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: Yeah, it's the_______________ office, the_______________ camp had nothing similar like that and they always said that office is__________ ____, the officer, who knows what they said, is unreplacable, we had no competition. And I have sat in on, I have a little report from Katya(ph), where she is reporting on that particular drawing office and one day we may compare her, her statements, okay?
Q: Okay.
A: [speaks foreign language here]. Good?
Q: Okay. [pause]. I'm more nervous than everybody.
Q: Okay.
Q: All right.
I: Why do you hate technology?
Q: I don't hate it.
I: Good.
Q: Just a _______________.
I: That's better.
Q: It appears...
I: The technology is good to you, you would not be able to do what you are doing without technology.
Q: You're right, _____.
I:_______________.
Q: Yes.
I: So I think that was enough.
Q: Okay. All right, now.
I: What shall I do?
Q: A little closer.
I: _______________.
Q: Yeah, yeah, this is good.
I: [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
Q: ________________. What are you going to speak?
I: Look, we are going to talk Polish and German.
A: Polish-German.
I: Because there are certain words I know in German or she knows in German and I don't, I am not Polish, I am not German, but I understand enough and certain things I can express in German much better than in Polish and vice versa. Or in English, so we'll see. We will need somebody who is bi, bi_______________ lingual to make sense of us.
Q: But I think we shouldn't bother with you translating too much.
I: Yeah.
Q: You can translate generally.
I: Right.
Q: So that I have an idea.
I: Correct.
Q: But not, not exactly.
I: No, no, no, no, not in detail, _________________.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: She said that I spoke Hungarian in those days...
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: So I said, I still speak Hungarian, it nearly cost my life because I speak Hungarian. [speaks foreign language here]. I volunteered to come this _______________ into the block, into the barrack, the Hungarian newcomers there, _______________ SS wanted to_______________ the ride home. Now this _____________, huh? That's interesting. So _______________, when I went with her [speaks foreign language here], she instructed me what to tell_______________ girls. So she said, write home, write to your people and write to them whatever you want, that you are here and you are alive and you are well off. Each helped us, so what I did, I said to the Hungarian girls, "Look, you are told to write to your people but please don't write to the correct addresses of your people because some of them are in hiding or so. Write to the center Jewish office and ask them to forward it to certain people." And the Hungarian girls were mad at me because I told them not to write to their people, but to write through a center office. So they're running to the SS woman and told SS woman that I told them not to write. Now, then what could I do, she nearly, she went mad. She said, "Are you out of your mind?" I said, "No, they did not understood Hungarian." So, but it, it was, it wasn't fun.
Q: ___________________.
I: [speaks foreign language here]. The Nazis not believe me, but they believed the SS woman. And [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]. That was dangerous.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here] asking me, "Are you out of your mind,?" Yeah. [speaks foreign language here]. She was caught in ____________, SS woman...
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]. You will read about her, it's a book, which I _______________ with ______________, there_______________ is, I made a statement to the author about ______________, but in connection with _______________, not with my own experience.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: Yeah. _______________. [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: Do you, would you have some patient, to translate a thin book to your mother, if I make you a present? From English into ______________?
Q: It's, it's, it's, of course.
I: Because that's a biography, this is the biography of Gracie. Gracie ______________.
A: Yeah. [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: Now I'm telling her about one situation because she's ________________ arrived at the end of '42, but she's did not know prior to that what I have experienced as being amongst the very first women in the camp. And she's interested because the Auschwitz people at the museum, in their whole research and report have very little reports on the day by day happenings during. We have general, general idea, but we don't know individual cases and so my case is a unique one, because as I have been spared by a camp commander of Birkenau, was only for two months, who had a secretary who was [speaks foreign language here]. She had a Jewish boyfriend and for that she was arrested. Now, there is a special, an English expression for ________________, you probably know it, but it turns my tongue around and I have to look that up. In any case, if a Jew and a non-Jew live together, were married together, they were either forced to, to divorce, or if they were unmarried, the man were arrested if he was Jewish and usually killed and the German woman ended up in a concentration camp. The insignia of the badges turned into a combined yellow-purple star, yeah and so that commander of the camp, whose name was Miller, he was there only for two months, had a secretary who was one of those Jew lovers and, and she begged for mercy. I, because I was sitting there just to be loaded onto the trucks and while walking she walked from her barrack during lunchtime or so, to her office, which was in front of the entrance of the temp women's camp and I called out to her, "Look, honey, I'm here." And she was running up to her office and all of a sudden, a notorious SS man arrived, his name was Shteebitz(ph), "Where is that inmate so and so?" And then they guided him to me and then he asked me, "What are you doing here?" I said, "I don't know. I want to go back to work." So he said, "Come with me." Took me back to the barrack and asking me to go up and_______________ three tier of, three rows of bed which were built, one on top of the others, exactly the one you have at your museum, asking, I had Typhus and I was very sick, asking me to go up and down and up and down and up and down several times. Little he knew that I was trained to, to go up and down mountains and I'm_______________ a girl, I could climb and I, I was very weak, but still I, I, I managed. I was used to go up the ladder, by doing murals during my professional career and so on. He didn't know that and I managed nicely up and down as many times as he wanted me to do and then taking me out, asking me to jump over the, the, what was this thing, ____, it's a ditch, yeah. There were ditches alongside the center, the central camp road, not like, _______________ said, [speaks foreign language here].
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: Ah.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here] We are laughing because he, he translated this so funny. And he's a friend of her, so. Of, now what have I, yes, so he took me over to jump over the ditch and off to the...
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: Ah, she said that was, that was ______________. [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: It was quite, and I could jump, yeah, so I jumped. So I passed my jump, I passed my up and down and then, into the camp infirmary. [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]. In that office, there was Orly(ph), a German...
A: Yes. ______________, Orly(ph).
I: Orly(ph) ______________, who was a _____________, no _____________.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]. In any case, there were a lot of girls, _______________ German women from the_______________ first group that my friend Enna(ph) Weiss(ph) who was then already_______________ on the doctor, physician __________________.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]. Then there were some employees, some nurses, everybody, yeah and the men in charge, the SS men in charge, Heinry(ph) Schwartz(ph), yeah? And he, he was not happy that the camp leader, sending over _______________ who was ______________, to overrule his desire to kill everybody and to gas everybody who is, who was there already waiting to be loaded onto the trucks. And while he, he, and, so he made it his business, he didn't know exactly how, what to do. Hirst(ph) described him as the most reliable SS man in the camp, yeah? So whenever he had an order, he was 100 percent. That's the fax.
Q: Let's wait one second. [pause]
I: ...idea.
Q: What?
I: We had met, anyway...
Q: You have to speak so I, so I will understand.
I: I tell you the story which I started at the other time.
Q: Okay, then finish...
I: No, it's another time, it had nothing to do with our meeting, yeah?
A: Yes.
I: I have been transferred to a camp office after being released from the, from...
[end of side one, tape 1]
Q: This is side two of tape one.
I: Is, is, is that item which I gave you okay?
Q: Yes.
I: You never said anything.
Q: I did, I said it worked.
I: No.
Q: That's why I'm able to wear the earphones. That's why I look like something from outer space.
I: Now you see how good I.. .
Q: You are.
I: ...how good technology is?
Q: Yes.
I: I knew that I have something. But go ahead and find, among so many things Irving left behind, no I kept things in order.
Q: I know.
I: Because of technology.
Q: I know, you're a very ____.
I: Hm?
Q: You're very in order.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]. No, I bring you your fax.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]. Wait a minute. [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: No. [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: No, ______________ haven't learned a damn thing and I just, she just reminded me that I've been, during my_______________ because that is a real hole in my, I've remembered fragments. I become a fragmental woman like what's her name? Elizabeth, Elizabeth Lightner(ph) or Isabella Lightner(ph)? Yeah, no, the time from, of my _______________ ordeal, yeah, I have a lot to memorize. I've rememorized a lot, but I lost the time, the times, time, development, step by step. I don't know what happened before and what happened afterwards, yeah?
Q: When did you get Typhus?
I: Still in Auschwitz.
Q: Auschwitz I?
I: Auschwitz I and I have been relocating to Birkenau on, crowding on those necks and arms, it was a horrible thing, but I had to do it because they were, they were killing some people who were left behind and were reported sick.
Q: So you got it before you moved to Birkenau?
I: Yeah.
Q: In July?
I: Something, something...
Q: You moved into, August? July- August?
I: Yeah.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]. Yeah, in, in English, why don't you use the German word? It's [speaks foreign language here]. What are you calling ____?
Q: ________________ is Camp(ph) Street.
I: Yeah, but what are you using in English?
Q: Well lager(ph) is camp.
I: Yeah.
Q: And strasser(ph) is street.
I: Yeah, but if you, if you, if you write, or publish, what are you using, what are the people using?
Q: You could say lagerstrasser(ph).
I: Road, the road, Camp Road? It was more road than a street, a street looks different. [speaks foreign language here]
Q: Which one, which, where is the lagerstrasser(ph)
I: Always in the center of the road. In the center of...
A: Center of the...
I: ...the camp
A: camp, of the camp.
I: Yeah. Then center road of the camp, yeah. And a strasser(ph) and a road, is that was [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: It was not an avenue, it was not a street, but it was a road. Like what I said.
Q: Okay.
I: You see?
Q: When did you, when did you arrive in Auschwitz, Birkenau?
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: '42, _________________.
A: Yeah. [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]. Good. So she arrived...
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: She got the job when she arrived, a very honorable job, she had to peel potatoes.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: That was a work detail. So potato peel commando, yeah.
Q: And where did you live first?
I: Block B, One A, number one.
Q: Number one?
I: Block One_______________ One A.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]. After she arrived and put into block one at B one A, she was selected to work in the potato peeling, in the work detail and then transferred to the Barrack 10, where all the potato peelers were in, okay?
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I:_______________ was beautiful, because...
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: Yeah, see, they were, they were exempted from, from _______________.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: She had, but there was, was one, one disadvantage...
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: They had to, they had to grow up much earlier than anybody else because they had to be already in the kitchen where the peeling took place, they were sitting and peeling potatoes, yeah? But they had to be there before the whole camp was, was alarmed to wake up and before roll call took place. So that was the only disadvantage.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: And then she turned, then she became ill.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: But she reported immediately to the hospital, but she was warned don't do it, because if you will do that, you may be subject in selection for ______________.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]. I'm always explaining to people generally, _______________ times, [speaks foreign language here]. I always explain that in the beginning, non-Jewish inmates were gassed too. [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: But she, as a non-Jewess was three times selected. So when I made the statement to several groups of people or individuals, that non-Jews, Poles and Germans alike were gassed, selected, they were selected and gassed, just like the Jews, people do not believe me, yeah? And here you have a witness, who went through three selections. But then later on, some of the researchers already _______________ sometimes it is mentioned, but all Jewish people do not want to hear that, yeah.
Q: And it was through out the entire time, or did it become different?
I: In the beginning.
Q: In the beginning, right.
I: And later on, I don't know at what occasion, I would say, let's listen to her. [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: They stopped approximately in April '43, when the large influx of transports, of Jewish transports arrived from Holland, France, Greece and so on. Then _________________, when they discovered another thing, not _______________, was they discovered then, that the Jewish numbers, the tattooed numbers, [speaks foreign language here], they did not, they couldn't distinguish all of a sudden who is Jewish and who is not Jewish among the women, by selecting and when the, when the switch or the change of policy occurred, the Jews, non-Jews should not be gassed any more, during an in-house selection, because there were no transports coming from outside, where non-Jews were selected like the Jews, but I'm talking about in camp selection, there was, they stopped when the big influx of Jewish people were coming. But then they discovered, all of a sudden that we are carrying the same number, the Jews and non-Jews alike. So how to distinguish during the selections? With a man they could do anything they want as they were marked, but a woman was not circumcised. So they had some big idea we are going to supply, we are going to include a triangle under your number for Jewish women. And then when the triangle, the tattoo triangle was invented. And no one of those big shots who are now in research, engaged in Holocaust and Auschwitz research have the slightest idea why is the triangle is there. Now they started to put the triangle retroactive, but I was hiding. I knew what it meant and I just took, I decided if I can go away without the triangle, I do. And I'm still running around without the triangle of course it could have saved my life once in awhile, yeah, but not always because you were not gassed before your identity not established _______________ anyhow. But you know, that ad hoc, ad hoc selection, I escaped many times those things because I had no triangle.
Q: So non-Jews, when they were selected, it was only inside the camp, it wasn't on the ramp, it wasn't in coming in.
I: Never. Only the_______________ transports, let me explain that to her. [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]. Most of the non-Jews were coming from jails, from police stations and then transferred into system of ________________. [speaks foreign language here]. If Jews were coming from a police station, they were entered as _______________ or_______________ and could not be gassed.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]. Yeah, I'm just explaining that some difference between newcomers, from jail or_______________ or yeah. What the difference was administratively, even if a Jew went from police station in front of a judge, just for not wearing a star or for stealing a_______________ or who knows, but he was, he had some guarantee not to be gassed, he could be killed, he could be starved to death, but he was not allowed to be gassed, because he belonged to the same category of criminals, like the non-Jews.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here], the description of certain categories of inmates are described in the secretaries of death, because those women were [speaks foreign language here].
Q: When did you meet Tsippy(ph)(ph)?
I: [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]. As a newcomer, she had Typhus and [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: She had what? Why are you laughing? Because no, she had, she felt sick and she was diagnosed as a Typhus candidate. So, girls were standing there naked, it was hot, waiting...
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: Yeah, waiting for the SS doctor. They had all temperature. If the people were diagnosed as Typhus,_______________ patient, they were killed with injections. We had an inmate doctor there, an Slovakian doctor, under the name Anna Weiss(ph).
A: Anna Weiss(ph).
I: And she took over. As the_______________ doctor arrived, she reported not Typhus, but flu, flu, flu, flu. And she was a flu patient all of a sudden and that was the moment she was saved from being killed. So [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]. Ah, there were no doctors on, on, on, on, at the hospital, go ahead.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: No I, sorry. I propose to speak Polish...
Q: Yeah, yeah, I understand.
I: ...because it's easier for her, she can express herself much better, she understands Polish, I understand Polish, so I can still ask question in between to get the more out of her.
Q: Okay, that's fine, that's fine.
I: Go ahead, _______________. [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: In those days Jews and non-Jews were together.
A: Jews together.
I: Yeah.
A: They were not together. [speaks foreign language here]
I: In the barrack of the hospital. Now you arrived, you had to find yourself a bed, there was an empty bed, so you occupied it, okay? Nobody advised you what to do?
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: They were two in one bed, bed, yeah? And [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: Oh, oh boy, full of human, full of human, um...
Q: Waste.
I: Waste? Good. And that was more or less the environment.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: But wait a minute, [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: The only, only living, it doesn't _______________, domestic animals, well they were lice.
Q: Lice.

I: No medication, no pharmaceutical products, all_______________ were measuring the temperature.
A: [speaks foreign language here]

Q: Oh no, no, no, please _______________.
I: No, why? You were not thinking, she__________ _____.
Q: Now I'm thinking, now I'm thinking.
I: No, what did she said, one day_______________ was an SS man and that and selected sick people, correct?
Q: Yes.
I: And they were Jews and non-Jews alike.
Q: And what he did, he just touched a bed and that's, that was the way he made selections, this person, supposed to _________________.

So I said, "But that's not enough. We had cases where people were left, were discharged because there was not enough proof or we couldn't explain it. It is not enough to say that you went direct to crematorium." But those people, who were stating sometimes, who worked in, in the stores, closing stores...
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: Yeah, closing stores [speaks foreign language here], sometimes recognized the clothing which was returned from the crematorium with a number and when that happened then they, then we had more confidence and proof that the people were not with us any more. And it was still, today you still have to argue with non-believers, with revisionists, even with our own Jewish people. How do you know, how do you know, how do you know? But_______________ proof, that wasn't very reliable proof, that when, when the clothing was sorted or cleaned or, or steamed, deloused and some numbers were still on those clothes and the inmates of course, if is an individual, wanted to know if one, if the inmate is still there that just went to the barrack where he used to live, ________________, but it was very complicated, very hard to prove to the world that we know what happened.

I: __________________.
I: 20th of July she arrived to Barrack four and she remembers that it was very dirty, full of lice place and they didn't have a floor, the floor was just a mound. Then later on they put the floor and let me think what, what else has been said. Well, the, the...
I: We had to sleep in the beginning, outside.
I: Yeah and from the beginning they had to sleep outside.
I: Outdoors, because they couldn't wait until the barrack was not put into order and cleaned. Because the men were living before us there and that, they were not as good as a woman would have been by keeping the barrack clean. In any case, it was a dirty barrack. Full of all kinds of fleas, bugs. I remember there were rats too, but she does not remember. Rats. [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: See how,_______________ have used some poisoned gas for the gassing and the, the, for, my God, they are not even using that any more, those things.
Q: What, extermination?
I: For extermination of the barrack. And so it's couldn't even enter or sleep there because after the extermination, which took place in _______________, it was smelly and we were afraid to sleep indoors because we had the impression that's the same gas they have used for the extermination, but they've used on, on humans, so it took awhile until the whole barrack was allowed, of us, we were able to enter, to breathe, to sleep and to work.
Q: So they actually tried to clean the barrack?
A: Yeah. Because the _______________ neglected the whole thing and the women were afraid to enter.
Q: Now were the women actually treating the barracks better than the men?
I: Definitely, definitely. [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: I am going to translate, but I'm going to historically answer your question, okay? Because it was not 100 percent answer to be what you want it to be. If men were, if a woman was, if our women were better in housekeeping than previously the men, that was your question. Now my answer and her answer combined is that when the barrack was assigned for the administrative, administrative work details, to work and to be housed there, it was very a neglected one, the male prisoners left for the male camp and we were assigned to that barrack, which was Block four, a wooden barrack. So disinfecting took place and then the women organized the barrack to be cleaned, cleaned, __________________, we had enough of water and scrubbing material, all wooden parts, floors, whatever we had were cleaned and was, the barrack was assigned for half of administrative activities, like the camp office, as the private room of the _________________ Katya and special room for the drawing office, of which I _______________ became part, not part, but in charge. We were administratively part of the camp office adjacent, but they assigned me to a private room where I could prepare my activities and, and work undisturbed. What _______________ underlined, which is of importance, and among others, end result of my, of the beginning of my career was that any trait, profession or activity, which had to be performed, like repair of the roof, laying of the floor, of the wooden floor, repairing of any inside work to be done, erecting some walls up between, between the, in the barracks to, to, to have some partitions erected actually, to have an room, you see it was in big hall and then it was divided into certain rooms for certain activities, so the camp office was erected by putting ________________ wall and, and, and dividing that into a certain size. Then the private room also, top administrative inmate, like Katya, who was, became the report _______________ and another room which I, which was assigned to me where I could work and was called the drawing office. They had neglected the _______________ drawing office all the time, I don't know why, I have been known ___________, known as the_______________ from the camp office, but I was actually in charge of the drawing office, in addition to, to, to the administrative belonging to the camp office. So drawing office became ________________ office of the drawing office. So I was _______________ from the [speaks foreign language here]. But, but she, especially on the _______________, certain functions could not be performed by a woman, because we had no know-how, like repairing of the roof, the replacing of broken glasses, putting a new floor, building partitions to, to divide ________________ camp,_______________ barracks, ___________, designated to us, into a housing or sleeping, sleeping area and another area, so there we had the first time, certain male work details who were coming from the mens camp to perform those activities. And what I just want to add to it, that because of that, the policy was, if there's a woman who can perform anything a man would have had to do, a man was, if there was a capable woman, able to perform those that did it as they preferred, a woman, because they wanted to avoid the, the contact between men and women and that was always an opportunity to exchange certain views, to spread certain news, or words or whatever. And if that wouldn't have been the policy, I would have never obtained my drawing office, never have been put in charge of the drawing office, where I could practice whatever I have been trained for, that means graphics, okay?
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]. I have been just explaining what I said, what I've been adding to her previous statement and made my remarks that while reading, while counting the kind of professions, which women could not perform and therefore we had to engage male prisoners, well, in addition she added painters. So I said but we had painters only later and they have been always looking for painters in the ________________, but in those days we had no painters, no.
Q: I wanted to ask you, when Katya came into your barrack...
A: Yes.
Q: Was this Barrack four?
A: No, no, no, no.
Q: No, 10, was it?
A: No, no, it was Barrack 10, 10, [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]. We are not talking about ______________, so yeah?
A: [speaks foreign language here]
Q: Yeah, yeah, I understand.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]. The first time _______________ Katya open a office, we were at Block 12 in B one A, which was an wooden barrack. It was a good barrack.
Q: Both of you?
I: Both. [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]. From Block 12, B one A, we relocated to Block B one two Block four. [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: Good. Block four [speaks foreign language here]. So we are back where we spoke before.
Q: Yeah, yeah, I know, but what I'm trying to do is get at another aspect .
I: I know that but she is not underlining the part of the camp, so I was irritated, you will be irritated and everybody will be irritated.
A: Nobody's irritated.
I: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Q: No, no, no, no. How...
I: [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: Yeah. No. [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: Now you understand translation can drive you crazy. I talk.
Q: Yeah, yeah.
I: One is the Katya...
End of Tape 2.
Tape 3
Q: This is, my question is this...
I: In plain English.
Q: I'll be very, I'll try to be very plain. Katya wants to organize a block to help the prisoners, so that it will be...
I: Reorganize, or organize.
Q: Well, reorganize, yes, okay? Reorganize. Who designs Block four and who allows her, who, who allows this building to be transformed so you have a camp office?
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]
Q: But why...
I: [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
Q: Nobody knows?
A: No. Nobody knows.
I: No.
Q: Do you understand that what I'm trying to figure out is why is it that Mendel(ph) and Drexell(ph) agree with Zanger(ph) to...
A: [speaks foreign language here]
Q: Katya.
A: Yeah, with Zinger(ph).
Q: With...
A: Zinger(ph)
Q: Zinger(ph)?
A: Not Zanger(ph), yeah, Zinger(ph).
Q: Z-i-n-g-e-r?
A: Like a singer.
Q: It's like a singer, a Zanger(ph), Zinger, Zinger. Why did they agree to create this organization? If it's Katya's idea...
I: Wait a minute, [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: Look, there is an existing, an existing standardized, existing standardized layout for a concentration camp indoor, indoor establishment and, and so, so, it isn't standardized policy, we need_______________ where we need that, we need that. Only the size had to be decided. The, the [speaks foreign language here]
Q: But the men's office had no drawing office, yes?
I: No, never.
Q: So how, how come? How come you, the women had one?
I: Because we were adding a room, that's all. Yeah. [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: It's the right person, it's the right time that you add.
I: She said that was something that the reason that the men didn't have the drawing room, there was something really new and really unusual that women in this barracks had a drawing room and then because of Tsippy(ph)'s(ph) talent, she was a very talented drawer and, and, and graphic designer, so that was the reason why they opened a drawing room in, in the Barrack four.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I:_______________ was organized because of Tsippy(ph).
Q: That room was organized because of Tsippy(ph)?
I: Yes.
Q: But do you understand, I don't, I don't want to belabor the point, but do you understand my question? If Katya comes in to Anna's barrack, now I don't know how you got into it, so just, one, one moment Tip, and she says she wants to reorganize.
A: Yes.
Q: What, what is she reorganizing? If, if the organization...
I: ________________, the camp. Reorganize the camp.
Q: All right, but what is it before and what happened...
A: [speaks foreign language here]
Q: So she wants to change the...
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: She had no intention to change, because she couldn't, change the system, but she wanted to exchange the personnel in charge of the inmates to be able to conduct a more efficient organization _______________, but to, to obtain an out, an better out, yeah, so she switched from one inmate in charge to a better one. She was a very efficient person, a very success oriented person and all of a sudden she had here on one hand, a primitive prostitute from Ravensbruck in charge of the Polish women who were wives of officers of and, and, and the high ex-Polish officials, where the balance was impossible, I mean you can imagine how primitive Slovakian girl, even from village with a highly trained Polish intellectual, she could not deal, she only could be rough and was not able to perform anything of what was asked her to do, not even a list of an inmate because they could hardly write. So he or she matched the inmate population of one barrack to the people in charge, who will, were, will be able to conduct exactly what she needed to bring her system or the system in which, which was created by the Germans in a certain way, to satisfy the Germans but not to serve the Germans, to satisfy the Germans and to help us. [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: Now you understand.
Q: Yeah, so that the, the ________________
I: [speaks foreign language here]
Q: Right. Are all German, it's, it's...
A: [speaks foreign language here]
Q: Yeah, yeah.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]. What is, what was the question, what's the answer? We had a private discussion.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]. She mentions the word political ________________, so I said, I added, [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]. Yeah, no I explained to her that I am taking the liberty to add and to clarify certain things which 50 historians, no 100 historians in 50 years were not able to do. We can solve that by adding the wording and explaining the difference, exactly how it is, how it was and how people may, will be able to understand. And she mentioned [speaks foreign language here]. I added to it, registration. Because the [speaks foreign language here] meant Gestapo and we were not Gestapo, but they, they had the [speaks foreign language here] Gestapo in the [speaks foreign language here]. And that is something not you understood before and not,_______________ understood or explained before, not the Auschwitz museum ever printed the [speaks foreign language here], that's all.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: Correct. [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: Bravo. [speaks foreign language here]. Did you understood? I said we make history right now.
Q: That part I understood.
I: By bringing something to the attention for the first time, the difference which was never understood, never told and never even take... People could care less because so what? [speaks foreign language here]. SS, SS, what's the difference, yeah? And that's why we are where we are, in a vacuum. No, I will not talk any more. I said enough.
A: Really?
Q: Do you want to say any of it in English?
I: What?
Q: What you just said.
I: I told you what I said, I.. .
Q: No, not...
I: ...that I explained to her. I also told you that we may create opposition ____________________.
Q: That I understand, but you...
I: Then I told her the same thing, then I told her we may, we now have reached the point where we were able to compare and to explain and_______________ feel that isn't, that is an was an very important morning and she agreed.
Q: But did you, you...
I: What?
Q: There are two different offices?
I: There are two different systems.
Q: Systems.
I: Yeah.
Q: One.
I: The camp.
Q: Right.
I: [speaks foreign language here]
Q: All right, let me.
I: [speaks foreign language here]
Q: But let me...
I: [speaks foreign language here]
Q: Tip, let...
I: [speaks foreign language here]
Q: But let me ask you something, because this must be confusing to other people, even though you've said it in a, in a certain, clear way.
I: [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: Auschwitz was a central administrative _________________.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
Q: No, no, no, my, my question is this. Tsippy(ph) says that...
I: [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
Q: That_______________ served the SS and the camp office served the inmates, but the camp office also had Drexel(ph) and Mandell(ph), who are Germans, who are SS, yes?
I: Every work detail, every barrack, had an SS man in the camp, in charge, who signed for anything. That means we served the camp office, the function ________________ of the camp office was logistic supply of everything, organizing the camp for our betterment, we tried to, but the SS had in mind, first of all the SS had, that was a network. We had blocks, barracks, we had work details. Inside work details, outside work details and for each inmate in charge, there was an SS man who was not a very high, high ranking SS man, just a puppet to ____.
Q: For every, for every...
I: Function. For every...
Q: For every function?
I: Yeah.
Q: SS men or SS women, or?
I: And/or, and/or. [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: To serve the inmates, yeah, was a function to serve the camp. Each function had an SS man in charge, who was more or less on a rubber stamp, yeah? [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: We were in charge, in the camp, to serve the inmates, assigned by the system, an SS personal member to give the rubber stamp, yeah. That was all, we had nothing but [speaks foreign language here]. Every employee of the SS was a Gestapo and the inmates who worked there worked for this Gestapo man. We did not work for any Gestapo man_______________ in the camp. Is that clear?
Q: Yes, that part is clear, but you understand that if someone's listening to this organization...
I: ______________________.
Q: To explain, no, I under...
I: [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
Q: But what I'm trying...
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: She is just trying to say, not to misunderstand that the women who were working and living in the _________________, yeah, were not, were not collaborators.
A: No, not collaborators.
I: Yeah? Correct?
A: Mm-hm.
I: You had certain...
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: Yeah, correct,_______________ they are not collaborators. So that you have to draw the line somewhere, they were forced [speaks foreign language here]. You see the difference was, once you were serving the SS in the _______________ of the Gestapo, you could not get out of it, you could never resign. You can, you could refuse in the camp by saying, oh I am not capable to do it, let somebody else do it. So she went to Katya...
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here], they have all...
[end of side one, tape 3]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]. He described very in detail, the camp organization, but again from the point of the male. [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: So the women's organizational structure was never really taken very serious, in spite of the fact that the women's lager(ph) was in a huge camp, if it comes to, to numbers of inmates. So_______________ as well, the women's structure they didn't know, they couldn't care less. Nobody who visited us in the camp office from the main prisoners had an idea what we are doing, how we are function. [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]. There were more women in the _______________ than men. So those four, five Polish prisoners who worked there, they are known, they were giving their testimonies, but they still, the _______________ people, the secretaries of top management did, did not know what we are doing, they didn't know about our function. The SS secretary from, from [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]
Q: Did, did you know, if the men didn't know the organization of the women's camp, did you know the way in which the men were organized?
I: Yes. Exactly like us, only we were perfect and they were, they were, they had difficulties [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: She said that you can ask any question you want to ask, because she's _____________.
Q: Did you know about the way the men organized their camp office?
I: She didn't know much about the office at all. [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: About our lives, the men and, and, and from and men and women, they know about each other lives because they were sending secrets letters, there was only the road which divided the men camp from the women camp and the, of course there were families, so the husband was in the men camp and the wife in _________________, so that the letters and they, sometimes they talk through the wires, so was a certain way of sending information about the_______________ camps __________________.
A: Birkenau, Birkenau, [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]
Q: Did you have meetings in Block four about the organization, about how things were working, I mean how was there communication inside the block about the, since this was the, this is the organization of the camp prisoners, did they have meetings so that they made decisions together, how?
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: I bring you something to ________________.
Q: But, but come back Tsippy(ph).
I:_______________ I bring a bottle_______________ glasses.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: Can you, yeah, can you be more clear? So you want to know about the...
Q: Well in all organizations, when people have different functions, they have meetings. Now if, in spite of the fact that this is an extermination camp and a concentration camp, they had functions to perform, did they have meetings where they discussed problems, where they had to make decisions or did Mandell(ph) and Drexel(ph) simply say, or Katya, you do this, you do this. I'm just wondering if there's a certain...
I: We don't know that.
Q: We don't...
I: The SS had no sessions in front of us.
Q: Well then did you as prisoners have meetings?
I: No. You received orders.
I: [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]
A: No, no, no.
Q: No, no, no, that's not what I meant Tsippy(ph), I didn't mean, I meant was there any, how was decision making, I didn't...
A: [speaks foreign language here]
Q: Wait, wait, one at a time.
I: I know what you mean, you compare_______________ with civilian, normal civilian procedure, yeah?
Q: Well no, I'm not comparing it, I'm asking if there's any comparison.
I: No, no, no. See [speaks foreign language here]. What is an environment in Deutsch?
Q: In Deutsch, I.. .
I: What's an environment? [speaks foreign language here]. No. _______________ _______________ military environment, yeah? Military?
I: [speaks foreign language here]
I: Yeah, the whole system, the SS system, wait a minute, the SS system...
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]
Q: But you...
I: Yeah?
Q: But you, you understand, when you, when you say that, you were working for the prisoners?
I: Yeah.
Q: Right?
I: Right.
Q: And if Katya...
I: Theoretically, theoretically.
Q: No theoretically understand, the larger structure is an SS structure, it's the German structure, it's not your structure.
I: No.
Q: You are working within a structure to try and make things work more efficiently, you're trying to help people in that structure.
I: We're trying to help them, the SS...
Q: So that...
I: But with the, with, with the purpose in mind to help ________________.
Q: So you're trying to satisfy the SS, while you are at the same time trying to help the prisoners?
I: Exactly.
Q: So, right.
I: Exactly.
Q: Okay.
I: [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: Correct.
I: Any, any_______________ made by SS, they are trying to figure out how they can avoid it and their way can help inmates, to, to, to help them. [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]. You want me to translate?
I: Yes, because you speak also German and sometimes I don't follow the story, so you...
I: Yeah, I have been under the impression that I am talking too much, so I don't...
Q: No, it doesn't, no, no, it doesn't, it doesn't, it doesn't matter. What we're trying to do is get at the information here.
I: So, so the answer of hers is the same _________________. We tried to figure out how to make the appearance that we follow the instructions, but our main purpose, most of our women who were assigned by Katya, our main purpose was to serve our people, yeah? To serve our inmates. We had individuals who were not intelligent enough to, to follow that kind of the line. We had inmates who took orders and behaved cruel, without any thinking, they were just like, like reflex animals, yeah. We had a beautiful woman who turned out to be stupid enough to become too, be cruel and then she had to pay with her life for it. [speaks foreign language here]. Nobody forced you to be cruel. They expected you to be cruel, but you could always behave like a human being. And if somebody was not willing to do so, paid for that later on, after the war, yeah? We had many cruel people, behaved cruel, but they could have behaved just normal, like any normal human being, we had normal, good people. So here you are, the system was established and ________________, it depended on the inmate in charge how to, how to exercise her power and her position, yeah?
Q: If there was an SS around...
I: No, not always.
Q: No, no, I said if. If there was an SS around...
I: Then there be...
Q: And the expectation was that they would be cruel...
I: Yeah.
Q: Would a person usually then be cruel?
I: No. If an SS was around, they were screaming, they were hitting, but afterwards they apologized to the inmate, we had to do it, yeah and just to give the impression and to impress the SS. But they never meant [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: Good. I am glad it's been so [speaks foreign language here]
Q: Were you ever in a circumstance like that?
I: [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
Q: A lot of times.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]. What is ____________? Order?
A: Order.
I: What does it mean, yeah?
A: What is mean, yes. [speaks foreign language here]
I: Exactly
A: Is, is possible to make something? No, no, no [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]
A: It was our...
Q: Our, our house.
I: Our aim.
I: Our aim to, to, to
I: Our aim to pretend that we are SS,_______________ obey their orders, but we always behind in our mind, how to help our.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: Now, I, may I interrupt _______________? I have an interview [speaks foreign language here]. I have said, I have interviewed Katya, asked somebody to interview Katya, you know it. [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here] somebody who transcribes it. [speaks foreign language here]. I would like and I, if I would, if it would be necessary for us or for all of initial get together or later on,_______________ particular interview transcribed and edited, and edited, [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]
I: Tsippy(ph), Katya said in her last statement before she died, did Tsippy(ph) had [speaks foreign language here], I had a special skill, the SS [speaks foreign language here] and to pretend [speaks foreign language here], but in reality, in the, in the [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: She would like to tell you about the underground, yeah? Because you asked what did the inmate, what is the_______________ SS_______________ underground.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: The Polish underground was, international underground was very well organized in _________________?
A: Auschwitz [speaks foreign language here]
I: Auschwitz one.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: ___________________.
Q: Wait, wait, excuse me. Just a moment.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
Q: All right, this is, this is what I propose.
I: Underground.
Q: You tell me some about the underground and then we get Tsippy(ph) to talk about her work in the drawing office.
A: Yes, drawing. [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]. I just want to say something. [speaks foreign language here]
I: _______________________.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]. Sorry, I.. .
I: What about, what about underground?
Q: Yes.
I: [speaks foreign language here]
I: Yes, she, she wanted, she wants to say that the, the, the underground in a women's camp wasn't very well organized because they, they believe that the, the main goal was to help each other and try to save other lives then organize underground.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: She, she didn't , she wasn't in any underground organization.
I: In any organization.
A: In any.
Q: In any organization.
A: In any, in any.
I: No because the war myth, m-y-t-h, about the underground is not like in a, in the civilian life you are a member, you pay your membership, you are, you have your meetings, that I don't know about. People have no idea that an underground, to belong to the underground was not the way they are imagined, yeah? But people like her, who was not accepted because she was no Communist, she was not anti, anti, anti, yeah? She did her job by doing what she felt is important. She did probably more underground work, than the member of the so-called underground, yeah? And she will tell you what she did. [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]
I: No, no, she said there's, they have conferences and meetings but I don't know anything about it and there's...

We never said a single word to each other [speaks foreign language here], he only came [speaks foreign language here]. Do that for me and do that for me. [speaks foreign language here], I never ask what for or to. [speaks foreign language here], then it appeared to me, to be nonsense, or whatever, like for example, [speaks foreign language here]. He brought me a watch without a content inside. [speaks foreign language here], without a trademark, [speaks foreign language here]. Paint me this, or print me this little miniature letters, [speaks foreign language here], that was a well known trademark. [speaks foreign language here].

[speaks foreign language here], our whole relationship, I knew exactly that he is doing a lot of strange things, [speaks foreign language here] End of Tape 3.
Tape 4
I: [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: Do you understand now what happened?
Q: Yeah, so you're saying that you didn't really know what he was doing.
I: I knew.
Q: You knew.
I: I suspected.
Q: You suspected.
I: I suspected. I had him daily with another request and that served him daily for whatever he asked for, but I never wanted to know and that was the basic, the basic of a good relationship, he trusted me and I, because he got anything he wanted and I knew he was no idiot. So whatever appeared to me stupid or funny or strange, I never asked any...
Q: And how come he could come into the camp every day?
I: [speaks foreign language here], he was living there. He was the only one, the only male inmate who was living in after the_______________ men who were surrounded by, by wires, did you spoke about that?
Q: No, I ask...
I: Uh-huh. Ask her and then I fill in, okay? He was living there, in the camp.
Q: Okay, all right, let me...

A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: They had, they had a radio, somewhere, hidden radio.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: He had a very good contact with underground organization, because sometimes the news that they received, they knew earlier, before they were published in newspaper.
I: Can I say something?
Q: Yeah.
I: You go back to Washington and read Hennick(ph), Pojebsky(ph), Uph(ph) and Garlinsky(ph). Good?
Q: Yeah, yeah, I, yeah, yeah. Did he ever ask things of you?

I: [speaks foreign language here]. She was the one who smuggled the plans, through, with her plans they're smuggled to, off the crematorium, Theresienstadt was the transport who were plan, they were planning to bring to Auschwitz a family camp. Now Vera worked together with_______________ and Vera and they had planted another woman from the underground into my drawing office, she had nothing to do with drawings, nothing to do, was no artist. She had a very strange function, yesterday I mentioned that she produced vouchers for the canteen, as a matter of fact I called her last night, but the phone was constantly busy the whole night so we have to wait until they repair in Prague the phones and I'm going to talk to her. Yes, now through Vera Forteen(ph) and ___________________, which was planted into my drawing office and I accepted her with pleasure, I was engaged with the carrying out of those plans.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: Katy was more beautiful, was more beautiful than_______________ picture.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]
Q: Explain, explain to me, explain to me what you've just said.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]
Q: The plans that went from Auschwitz to __________________. What is, what is going on, why are they, they sending plans for what purpose?
I: Because they wanted to know, they wanted them to know...
Q: What was going to happen?
I: When they arrive, to know where they are going or what is going to happen, because they thought if they are going to be carried straight away to the gas chamber and they will know about it, that a mass of people, they will be able to revolt, yeah? Or to resist.
Q: To whom did they send these, do you know?
I: To, to ________________ to certain people in Theresienstadt.
Q: It was contacts that they had?
I: Of course, yeah.
Q: And how would, do you know how these were sent?
I: Wait until she comes because there was Tosha(ph) involved. You see that was ________________, I, I, I played an very important part, see I never spoke about it, but if you want to know I may mention something and I wanted to speak yesterday to _________________, but she, there was no, I'm afraid she's not alive because since two weeks I'm trying to contact her and just a constant busy sign. Finally I asked the_______________ operator yesterday to, there was only, the telephone, busy sign, but no conversation, so.
Q: All right, let's wait til Anna comes back.
I: Never made it my business to, look I cannot fight, on how many fronts shall I fight?
Q: Tsippy(ph), I'm not arguing with you.
I: I know, I'm just asking, I'm asking myself, on how many fronts can I fight? I have been fighting with, fighting, I mean_______________ fighting, all right? Since the Auschwitz exhibit at the UN, arguing about the, about the correctness, that's better, yeah, of the insignias, which was, they were wrongly interpreted, the Washington Holocaust office, the Washington Museum produced wrong information, the Auschwitz people in the, what's the museum in Auschwitz? Produced wrong information, cause they engaged in so-called consultants, a famous ________________ from Auschwitz, who didn't know the difference between an, an, Jehovah Witness and an Jewish and a non-Jewish person who had a love affair with a Jewish man, they were differently marked, the women's camp had their own, yeah and I will probably sit down with you and explain to you my activities and my functions and my work in the drawing office. And then you will understand why I'm objecting to the insignias, why I'm objecting to other things, to, to the plans of Birkenau in general. I have never disclosed to anybody because I've never been asked, never been understood what I did because to be, to have, I mean the historians don't even know how to read a map, to be quite honest, they don't look for the, for any clues which could be misleading. They are looking things from an entire different angle and I cannot blame them. But if there comes some graphic artist, who, who was trained and worked all her life in the profession and is trying to argue about something of, of a graphic nature with an historian, it is an tragedy, yeah? Because I had cases where, was mentioned yesterday, I had to explain what a stencil is, yeah? By explaining what I designed for a particular, in a particular situation. So I'm fighting against many thing, it's not fighting, I'm just arguing about it and I always, I never had a real sympathetic ear by anybody to listen to me and it's, I've developed a situation where I suffer from an certain kind of loneliness, I cannot talk always to myself. People don't know what I'm talking about. I'm not quoted in any_______________ world famous historical literature because I've been living a world of silence due to my handicap, where I couldn't hear, where I couldn't communicate and when I finally opened my mouth it was, I was totally isolated, misunderstood and too technical for their taste. No, now you know. Now let's come back to the aerial views. The aerial views as we've discovered is that they were, I mean for the purpose of explanation and important that they have inserted the plans and, and brought out the area they were, the area in question, but why couldn't they do the right thing, why have they used and copied the wrong thing, that is my, I am had no, no objections that they have inserted the camp, the women's camp on their aerial views. I've given strong signal, yeah? Can I call that...
Q: You mean, you mean with a diagram as opposed to a photograph?
A: With a diagram, correct. But then they had not and you cannot even blame the people what they did because from the first day on, the very first publications after World War 2, produced in Poland, by famous researchers like Dr. _______________ for example, he published the very first book on Auschwitz and it's a good one, I have that in both languages, in German and in, in, in Polish, which he forwarded to me because I, that's always active and tried to keep in touch with the post-war Auschwitz family of inmates, I mean, it's not the families, but we got a small family of people who tried to stay in touch with. That was in Warsaw in headquarters of the international Auschwitz committee, under the stewardship of ____. And then there was the museum and there are people who tried to do their best but the world was not very sympathetic, they had no money, they had no, they were not very, we were not very popular because the world had enough in those days, so there was a stagnation of interest and after awhile people started to publish correct or incorrect. But then it comes to diagrams and to the drawings of the camp, there were irregularities, they were using some, they couldn't, tools, all those_______________ by foot, they had no experts to perform, they, to perform a layout of the measurement instruments, they had no access to the camp building office, they didn't even know then that it ever existed. People, the historians who were trying to start to bring the history down to paper, had no idea that there was an Auschwitz official building office and so that those, that, maps and drawings and sketches were preserved miraculously, yeah. We know today how the camp looked, we know and, but somebody was,_______________ sit down and _______________ complain. So the first plan was used, the first basic information was used from __________________, that document of, the Berlin planning of Auschwitz. I mean they tried and they still have enough of material and they had enough of material, but it was wrongly interpreted because the draftsman who was able to read the drawings, was not reading the historical background, yeah? If they would have done what I did all my life before I had to perform a drawing for my husband for his publication, I first had to learn the text and to translate his scientific language into simple lines and diagrams. The people who were assigned to make the sketches of the first sketches after the war, were not presented with an historic background, they're not even asked to read or to understand what they are drawing, what they are doing and so we have know the after effects.
Q: Tsippy(ph) where was the, where were the, the building plans office? In the men's camp or in the women's camp?
I: No, you can spot that in one of the aerial views or you have to [speaks foreign language here]. You know, we have now the same...
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here] and if I would not know the camp by here in my head, I would, I'm asking her where was that, the answer. No, it was not in A, it was in B, you see, because it couldn't have been but if you, she would not talk to me about it and I wouldn't know, it would get lost.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]. We are trying to reconstruct where was this, you have asked me where was_______________ and I'm asking her in addition, where was ___________________?
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]. No, what is it now? What do you want to know? The underground?
Q: No, let's do the underground in Washington.
I: Good.
Q: Tell Anna we'll talk about the underground in Washington, I want to ask her something else now.
I: [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
Q: What was your relationship with Tsippy(ph) in Block four?
A: Our relation was good, I think.
Q: No, but no, what did you, what did you do together, did you...
A: I was Block_______________ and she was in [speaks foreign language here]
I: I was living in the borders of the block.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: I had a studio in the block, correct. Believe me, it was better established than any other studio here in New York City. I had a beautiful room, I even had beautiful curtains, glass windows around. [speaks foreign language here]. Now, if I wanted to be alone and undisturbed, [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I:_______________ was how it looked from the outside.
Q: So tell me.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: I had a window from the outside too.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here] was next to her room where she was living. [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here] [end of side one, tape 4]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]. You see, I have a very important interview from Katya which had to be translated into a normal language.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]. Did you understood? No.
Q: You want me to get this transcribed and translated?
I: No, no, no, no, no, I have the transcription, I have it transcribed, badly.
Q: You need, it needs translation?
I: I need somebody to type what I am translating from German into German, for corrections, editing. I don't need a German editor, I can do it myself, because I know the way of thinking of Katya and I know what she meant. I will need somebody who will, I may dictate that into an tape recorder and somebody's going to transcribe that in German. The good, good edit, good edition, which I am going to make. _______________ somebody translating from German into English and then we'll have from Katya an very important statement, out of her own mouth, okay? And you know who did it, the stupid Susan, stupid Susan, an idiot, she was talking all the time and she didn't know and I gave to her instruction, question, A, B, C, D, she never sticked to. You know that Susan up til now had, did not produced anything, anything useful?
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here], we have been the first 10 months in Auschwitz in the, some women arrived, the Slovakian women and some of the German women, all the women in Auschwitz_______________ lager(ph), the first 10 blocks and then in September or August, we relocated to Birkenau and...
A: [speaks foreign language here]
Q: August 1942?
I: She's __________________.
I: [speaks foreign language here]
I: It's not too strong for me, but be careful with that.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
Q: Right, not Auschwitz, ____________________.
A: One and one week after [speaks foreign language here]
I: She just finished up speaking English __________________, yeah?
Q: But you came in 1943?
I: No, '42.
Q: '42. July 20th.
A: Yeah.
I: July 20th, that was her birthday.
I: No it was a day before her birthday.
I: A day before, I said, it was Hitler's birthday.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: Could you write something down for me? The name of Katya's __________________, please. Do you have one sheet of paper?
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: She had an couple,_______________ an couple [speaks foreign language here]
A: Mm-hm.
I: Yeah?
A: Mm-hm.
I: [speaks foreign language here]
A: Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm.
I: So what next?
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]. Now, front, you can write in Polish or in, in, in English, Katya's __________________, Katya's maid, that's good enough. Now, what is it?
Q: Anna, what do you, what is your most vivid memory of Tsippy(ph)? When you think of Tsippy(ph) in Auschwitz, what do you think of first?
I: [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: In the drawing office.
Q: Drawing? Serious?
A: No. [speaks foreign language here]. It was an interesting person.
I: Interesting person, yes. She was interesting.
Q: Was she funny? Sense of humor?
A: Yes, yes. She was...
I: A sense of humor.
A: ...sense, sense, sense of humor is very, very good. [speaks foreign language here]
I: She had a great sense of humor.
Q: Yes.
I: And she has.
A: [speaks foreign language here]. That was her personality.
I:_______________ a special personality.
Q: Did she ever give you, did she ever give you trouble?
A: Trouble? [speaks foreign language here]
Q: Huh?
I:_______________ trouble maker.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: Anna said that sometimes...
I: It didn't went, if things didn't went my way, then I was giving trouble.
I: She was trouble.
Q: And what, what kind?
I: [speaks foreign language here]. I screamed because they were constantly disturbing me and I had quite an...
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: ________________, I worked at night, why? Because the, the Polish bloody underground, yeah, were coming for men, during the day the male prisoners were coming, gathering all the Polish women in my office, in my drawing office, throwing me out so that they can discuss their secret connections and messages. I went out walking around the camp and having fun visiting all people and then at night I had to perform my duties because I had to deliver. So then, sometimes, while working, or wanted to work, it was intellectually, mentally, a very demanding job. I performed many, many things where I had to concentrate, where I had to be correct and where I had to, not wanted to be disturbed because it was sometimes a very delicate job I performed. So then anybody was coming in of those little monkeys and talking to me and, and so I started to scream, get out of here, because I have to work, yeah. And that she remembers, that I have thrown out many times.
A: You see?
I: [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: Yeah.
Q: You remember?
I: Yes, very good.
Q: Now, when you were talking to, stop looking at the book, you were talking about the plans being sent to Terezín...
I: Oh, yeah.
Q: And I want the two of you, because, does, does Anna know about this, was she...
I: No, listen, may I ask something in between?
Q: Yes.
I: Anna, [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]. Is possible, but I don't know.
I: All right, [speaks foreign language here]
Q: You're talking about them burying the plans in her, in her room?
I: Not burying, but delivering.
Q: Delivering.
I: But she, it must not have been to her, I think it must have been either to Tosha(ph) Biankoffska(ph) and she didn't even know what it is, yeah? Look, I must explain, you want the whole process okay, but it went through her room. [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
Q: So you don't know?
A: No.
I: No. That was underground work, okay? Effective one.
Q: Tsippy(ph), you once said to me that before the family camp came, you knew what was going to happen to them, how? First translate for Anna what I said, so that she knows.
I: [speaks foreign language here]. We suspected, we suspected, we have [speaks foreign language here], that was a reason, [speaks foreign language here]. That was the reason why we have tried to bring that to the attention of the management in Theresienstadt when they arrive, to know in what direction, what the, how the camp was established and which direction was the crematorium.
Q: Did you know that when they were going to bring in people from Terezín...
I: Yeah?
Q: That they were going to bring them together as a family camp, before...
I: We didn't know much, we didn't know, we just knew when they arrived.
Q: When they were established...
I: Yeah?
Q: ...as the family camp...
I: Yeah, mm-hm.
Q: Were you surprised that they kept them, the men and women, the families together?
I: No, no because in Auschwitz nothing, in Auschwitz [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: We were not sure what they are going to do, [speaks foreign language here], you see these, nobody knew, I think the people in Berlin didn't know what to do with them, they knew somehow they are going to bring an end to the people of Theresienstadt, but didn't know when the time was right. The political situation, how to camouflage things, how to pretend, how to lure the people into be able to be driven into the gas chamber without any resistance. So we were, nobody was sure the Germans in Auschwitz had no idea when, when and what order will come from Berlin, huh?
I: [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
Q: Or understood. Now here's another question. The Gypsy camp is also men and women, the Terezín, the family camp is men and women. What is the relationship of the men's camp to those camps and what's the relationship of the women's camp? Because all the rest of the camp is divided by sex, pretty much.
I: Okay, only, only the role call.
Q: So you took care of, the women's camp took care of the role call of the Gypsy family camp and the Terezín?
I: Correct. We knew exactly how many Gypsy women, Gypsy children, female, she does know that, because...
A: [speaks foreign language here]
Q: And Gypsy?
A: Together.
I: Yeah, yeah.
Q: No, no.
I: [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
Q: Does that, does that mean that there were work details for the women from, from the...
I: They were not working.
Q: They were not working?
I: No.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]. Only inside, inside necessary details for distribution of food and cleaning and so on.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: Yes. That's different. [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: They had, in, inside, what I said, inside activities like food distributions, looking after the children, they had a little bit of cultural activities because there was nothing else to do, but there was no physical work performed, like in our so-called [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: The tragedy was that they made no use, during a war, where manpower or womenpower was short to use the young family members, men and women for something productive, yeah?
Q: You mean the Germans didn't use any?
I: No.
Q: All right. And...
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: Yeah, before them, before them, before they were gassed, they were asked to write letters, predated yeah? Predated [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
Q: This is the Terezín family camp?
I: Terezín. And so we have no_______________ the possession of letters, before dated, compared with the date of, of, with the date of death of those people, while they were gassed, so we know only now how they were luring and pretending inside of the camp, the whole situation, to prevent disorders or disturbances.
Q: Is it...
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here], nobody wanted to believe any more because the information from the camp underground, or whoever was sending ____________________, Theresienstadt, the report what happened and then the predated letters, the people in Theresienstadt and the world was confused. And that what the Germans tried to do, but what you don't know is and you have not reported and never mentioned, [speaks foreign language here]. Katya overheard once in an telephone conversation, while she was on her own, it is actually, but I'm not [speaks foreign language here], I wouldn't like to talk about it because it's very, very described what I have to say about Katya in one of the books of _______________ wrote in his last years. [speaks foreign language here], so let's bypass Katya, we are now back to Theresienstadt, yeah. The Theresienstadt _______________ from the [speaks foreign language here]. You see we, we received the, the lists of death simultaneously, simultaneously [speaks foreign language here], so they, when they were gassed in the night [speaks foreign language here] and they were gassed, next morning, next morning, we already had the list of death and we had to administer that and, and absorb [speaks foreign language here], I was so [speaks foreign language here], with my head [speaks foreign language here]. So I'm tell you, we knew in the morning, they were taken at night, they were gassed. In the morning we had the list and we had to take out the women from the livings in the dead [speaks foreign language here] and I had to change my [speaks foreign language here].
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: What have I done at night, I'm asking her, she doesn't know. [speaks foreign language here]. I will tell you that afterward. [speaks foreign language here] End of Tape 4.
Tape 5
I: [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: Now listen carefully. Don't you think that I'm sitting idle. I want to show you something, yeah. I want to show her something. Hold it for me please, yes, thank you. That's [speaks foreign language here] a whole book. I have here a diagram which I produced, [speaks foreign language here]. I have here an diagram. In 1942, what I'm saying on that sheet, I carry the information what an historian needs a whole book to write. And that means, where are my, where is my, yeah. It says, a year by month, 12 months in '42, '43, '44 and the beginning of '45, yeah? [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: Every camp in Birkenau [speaks foreign language here], were frowned on, where female, women were located, so you will see, in 1942, [speaks foreign language here], women were there from March til August, clear?
Q: Yeah.
I: In B one A, the crosses are male, yeah? [speaks foreign language here] and there were women in B one A from here to here. In B.. .
Q: B one B.
I: In B one B, [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: Here, here we went, we arrived in that part of Birkenau in June _______________ and we're there til '44 October. [speaks foreign language here] what is it?
Q: [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here] you see, the duration of the Czech family came, where women and men were together and then in October '44, we relocated here, from here to here, [speaks foreign language here], it didn't existed any more. [speaks foreign language here] you can read in B to, B to D, there were men and B to C, [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: Yeah, that's the Hungarian camps are so-called. [speaks foreign language here]. Look, what I'm trying to show you, it's an diagram of the history of Auschwitz, where you can see men and women, when they were there and how long they were there.
Q: Now why?
A: It's very important.
I: Yeah?
Q: Yeah, yeah.
A: It's very important.
Q: Yeah, yeah. But Tsippy(ph), why here, in A one, Auschwitz one stomlager(ph).
I: Yeah?
Q: There, aren't there men in those months?
I: Yes.
Q: But you don't have that there are men and women.
I: Because it was, it was...
Q: No, I'm just asking because here...
I: You are right.
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: I, I had no, I will, you are right, I have to add, but no good. Why I have put here men...
Q: Because they were together.
I: ...and women together, they were living together.
Q: Together, yeah, yeah.
I: Yeah, you can see I made the connection here, good. So I have, have not found that, I wanted to bring out the women and not the men.
Q: Yeah, yeah, no, no, that's fine, I, but it's, yeah...
I: I kept the men in the background. But, do you think it's an important diagram?
Q: Absolutely.
I: And for that an historian how many pages need?
Q: It depends how much they write.
I: [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: I am trying to show you...
Q: So it's visually, it's very...
I: For my future publication, I am prepared with many answers, with many simple, simple explanations and nobody can take that away from me. Come on. [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: Okay?
Q: Yeah.
I: I'm sorry.
Q: It's okay. This is the insignias?
I: More or less. That's for myself.
Q: Where's this from?
I: That is _________________, and anybody else I will, wait a minute. _______________ was, we will talk about that, but I want to show you something more interesting. [speaks foreign language here]. Now I'll show you something. [speaks foreign language here], I started something. I started the history of the SS. The SS [speaks foreign language here] with the ranks, their position, [speaks foreign language here]. And so I have when they arrived to Auschwitz and they left. [speaks foreign language here]. That is a sample, an example. [speaks foreign language here]. All SS members that ever been in Auschwitz, I want to bring on one sheet and have their history, with their rank and their position, on one sheet, instead of hundred other sheets historians are writing about and sometimes...
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: [speaks foreign language here]
Q: It's the light, the light went out.
I: Yeah.
Q: Yeah.
I: Don't worry, that will start to, to, to whistle. [speaks foreign language here]
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: I'm just trying to tell you that is an example, that is not authentic 100 percent, but I want...
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: Here. [speaks foreign language here] Correct. [speaks foreign language here] to perform something like that, I cannot do it myself, all myself, by myself. I would love to have somebody who would concentrate on Auschwitz. I could teach him or her and I could teach him graphics, I could teach him. That is something nobody does. It's just an example I've selected on couple of [speaks foreign language here]. Now listen carefully. Do these here, that is something of big value. These two here, [speaks foreign language here]. That means in the category of German prisoners, women prisoners, into the category of German women prisoners went German women, the Austrian women, some, the Polish and the French women who had lovers, Pole lovers with, no lovers...
A: [speaks foreign language here]
I: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, stop it. Poland [speaks foreign language here]
Q: You mean Germans who had Polish...
I: Polish lovers and German women who had French lovers. [speaks foreign language here]
Q: And these were only Christian women?
I: They were only Christian women [speaks foreign language here].
Q: They didn't care?
I: Huh?
Q: They didn't care if the Jewish women...
I: They went into [speaks foreign language here]. If they had some relationship [speaks foreign language here]. You can see what I did. [speaks foreign language here]
Q: Jewish ______________________.
I: [speaks foreign language here]
Q: No, no, no, no, Christian, not Jewish.
I: [speaks foreign language here]
Q: No, no.
