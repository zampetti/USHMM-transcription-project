id="s4">Q: The date is April 2, 1992.</span> <span id="s5">We’re speaking with Jack Trompettor Cambridge, Massachusetts.</span> <span id="s6">Mr. Trompettor, could you please tell me you name at the time of the war, your date of birth and your place of birth and anything you possibly can about your family background and you childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s7">A: Well my Hebrew name is Isaac, Yitzhak.</span> <span id="s8">I was given the name Jack at the time because it was not safe, I suppose, to call children Isaac.</span> <span id="s9">I was born in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s10">I was born in a hospital which, at the time, was taken over by the Germans and used for their Wehrmacht wounded.</span> <span id="s11">So there was my mother lying there and having me and because the family name in Trompettor, not Cohen or Nathanson, it wasn’t evident giveaway that it was a Jewish name.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: The date, when was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: This was August 2, 1942.</span> <span id="s14">When my mother gave birth to me it was also the same time that my father had been arrested.</span> <span id="s15">He was arrested in what’s called a razia which was a raid which was what the Germans at that point would do in 1942.</span> <span id="s16">They would come into a Jewish neighborhood, seal off the streets, and then just pick up all the men that they could find and in this case my father was caught and he was taken to Oester Park, East Park which is a park in Amsterdam where they held them.</span> <span id="s17">And then they transported them, to the Uterperstaad which was where the Gestapo had their central headquarters and it was a school that they took over and they had some kind of, I think, gymnasium building, or some gymnasium-like building where they had all the men lie down, belly, face down and they beat the men on the backs and on the legs.</span> <span id="s18">We, of course found all this out afterwards.</span> <span id="s19">My father was arrested.</span> <span id="s20">My mother did not know where he was.</span> <span id="s21">She gives birth to me.</span> <span id="s22">She is understandably terribly, terribly anxious and afraid.</span> <span id="s23">There was a curfew at this time and no Jews are allowed on the streets at certain hours which made it all very difficult to do shopping and even visiting someone at the hospital.</span> <span id="s24">But it turned out that my mother’s father, he was a man in his late sixties who wasn’t afraid and really didn’t, I suppose, care about this curfew.</span> <span id="s25">He was going to see his daughter and grandson.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Did he wear a yellow star on his coat?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: You know, I don’t know; it’s a good question.</span> <span id="s28">He came to visit my mother every day during the period when my father was -- his whereabouts were unknown.</span> <span id="s29">My mother got ill after she gave birth to me.</span> <span id="s30">I guess anxiety and everything.</span> <span id="s31">She was beside herself.</span> <span id="s32">Finally, and I don’t know within how many days this transpires, I think maybe three or four or five, my father is let go.</span> <span id="s33">He calls up his work place.</span> <span id="s34">They send a cart which was what you had in Holland then which was to transport goods.</span> <span id="s35">You had a bicycle with sort of a cart in front and they put him in the cart and they took him home.</span> <span id="s36">The reason they did that was because he could barely walk because he was beaten on his legs.</span> <span id="s37">It’s an interesting story how he actually got out.</span> <span id="s38">And how he got out was, as he told it, all the captives were lined up.</span> <span id="s39">And they had the Gestapo, they had the green police, they had the Dutch police, those Dutch police who were collaborators.</span> <span id="s40">They had all levels of police.</span> <span id="s41">Everyone wanted to be a brute of some kind.</span> <span id="s42">Everyone wanted to get in, in some way.</span> <span id="s43">The Germans were very, very concerned with TB.</span> <span id="s44">They were very, very concerned with that, I guess, what’s the word I’m looking for, plagues or some kind of -- what’s the word I’m looking for -- not a plague.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Contagion.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Some contagious disease, thank you.</span> <span id="s47">And they had a doctor who was a Jewish doctor look at all the men and ask the men, the captives, questions.</span> <span id="s48">Based on these questions the men were let go.</span> <span id="s49">And to be let go meant to be kicked in behind and told to get the hell out and never come back or whatever.</span> <span id="s50">The Germans were so afraid of contagious diseases that their solution to contagious disease was to throw people out.</span> <span id="s51">This doctor was someone my father had known.</span> <span id="s52">In the twenties my father had some kind of a lung problem and it wasn’t TB.</span> <span id="s53">But at the time you carried with you some kind of identity card I think that you with if you had some kind of a medical emergency you could whip it out.</span> <span id="s54">So he had a card with him and somehow he had the good sense to have the card out or show it to the doctor and the doctor and German officers are standing at this point in front of my father and the tension is throughout all this very, very intense and very high and a lot of questions are being asked and crisscrossed.</span> <span id="s55">At the same time the German asks the doctor if this man has TB because of the card.</span> <span id="s56">He ends up saying yes.</span> <span id="s57">But if turns out he’s saying yes to another officer’s demand who is saying, mach shnell, mach shnell, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.</span> <span id="s58">The level of tension was purposely created by the Germans.</span> <span id="s59">This is what they did to disempower people, to terrorize them.</span> <span id="s60">And it was a tactic; it was a strategy.</span> <span id="s61">It wasn’t simply people losing their temper.</span> <span id="s62">It was a strategy of terrifying people.</span> <span id="s63">So they’re asking what’s going on, mach shnell, yes.</span> <span id="s64">It seems to be misunderstood by the head officer that my father indeed had TB.</span> <span id="s65">So they grabbed him, they boot him in his behind, they throw him out, lucky him.</span> <span id="s66">He gets to a phone, calls up his work place.</span> <span id="s67">They send over the bicycle and the cart.</span> <span id="s68">He comes home to discover he’s had a son.</span> <span id="s69">I don’t think he was able to visit my mother or myself in the hospital.</span> <span id="s70">My mother comes home.</span> <span id="s71">Everybody is very happy to have me.</span> <span id="s72">I was named Isaac, Yitzhak, he who laughs.</span> <span id="s73">The first time I asked my parents, when talking with them about the war experiences why they would want to have a child during this time, why they had me.</span> <span id="s74">They said it was their blow against Hitler.</span> <span id="s75">And I have very mixed feelings about this.</span> <span id="s76">It makes me a little choked up as it does right now because I feel in some way it casts me in some kind of historical responsibility and there are times where I would say I wish that they didn’t have me then on one hand.</span> <span id="s77">On the other hand I’m always grateful that they provided themselves to bring me into the world.</span> <span id="s78">That’s the bottom line.</span> <span id="s79">So I am the blow against Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: That is a responsibility.</span> <span id="s81">Can you back up a little and tell me about your family history.</span> <span id="s82">Are they long time Dutch Jews or had they come from Germany or …….</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: Yes, my family name Trompettor.</span> <span id="s84">There is some dispute whether we are Sephardic which is Trompaita or whether we are Ashkenazim from the East.</span> <span id="s85">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s86">I tend to think we were Sephardim.</span> <span id="s87">The reason for that, actually, is a number of years ago Time Magazine, the New York Times Sunday magazine had an article on Spain.</span> <span id="s88">On the cover they had a picture of a young boy who trained horses and it looks just like me, like I did when I was young.</span> <span id="s89">So there’s a cast to my face that would give that some authenticity.</span> <span id="s90">So I think we were Sephardim although we did not speak Latino in our family nor did we speak Hebrew in our family.</span> <span id="s91">My parents were working class people.</span> <span id="s92">My mother had three brothers.</span> <span id="s93">My father had three brothers and three sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q They all were from Amsterdam?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Yes, we were Amsterdam working class people.</span> <span id="s96">Amsterdam by the Dutch was known as Mokum, M-O-K-U-M, which was a, I don’t know how but it was a Yiddish word for Amsterdam and it got into the lexicon.</span> <span id="s97">The Dutch refer to Amsterdam often as Mokum.</span> <span id="s98">Not just the Jews use that term.</span> <span id="s99">And the Jews in Holland, I think I’d say you know who came from the East and came from Spain and Holland was very hospitable to them.</span> <span id="s100">My parents family, many of them worked in the diamond cutting and polishing industry which was the main industry for the Jews as well as textiles.</span> <span id="s101">You had different Jewish neighborhoods in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s102">There was one neighborhood called the gold coast which was where the more well-to-do Jewish people would live.</span> <span id="s103">Then there was what was the Yodebrastaat which is the wide Jewish street which is, I think, also the street where Rembrandt had his tourist home right now.</span> <span id="s104">It was a large Jewish community.</span> <span id="s105">It’s the southeast of Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s106">It’s where many of the Dutch Jews lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Do you know where their families lived, your parents’ families?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: No, I know.</span> <span id="s109">Yes my parents’ family lived in the neighborhood of the Yodebrastaat.</span> <span id="s110">We lived right after the war in the Tunsvalstraat right on the Tunsvalkad which was a canal as Amsterdam is crisscrossed by canals.</span> <span id="s111">Is there anything else I could say about my parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Do you know anything about Jewishly like were they religious, were they observant?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: Yes, my parents both went to Hebrew school when they were younger.</span> <span id="s114">We were not a kosher home.</span> <span id="s115">You must understand that the Dutch Jews were mostly working class people and while my parents and their families set a table every Friday night there were no prayers said and I don’t think there were blessings said over the bread or wine with the meal but all the children would be there for that dinner and some with their sweetie pies and after dinner they would all leave for their Friday night gallivanting, you know young people.</span> <span id="s116">There’s not much talk in my family of poverty or anything like that even during the depression.</span> <span id="s117">There were hard times.</span> <span id="s118">There was always food.</span> <span id="s119">My father worked in the food trades, in the restaurant trade and always had food, brought home food.</span> <span id="s120">So there was always that.</span> <span id="s121">And also he was one of the brothers who always seemed to have worked during the hard years.</span> <span id="s122">My grandmothers did not work.</span> <span id="s123">They were grandmothers which was a job in itself.</span> <span id="s124">My mother and father knew each other when they were in their late teens.</span> <span id="s125">And as my mother tells it, she had a crush on my father because he was so quiet and sweet and I guess, polite.</span> <span id="s126">They met each other through my father’s sister Maricha, Marie who perished and had become sweethearts very early on and had been very fond of each other and close to each other.</span> <span id="s127">It was, I guess, in those days that you paired up real early.</span> <span id="s128">But they were engaged for a long time.</span> <span id="s129">They didn’t married until they were thirty and the reason for that is that they wanted to save money for furniture.</span> <span id="s130">And now my mother talks about how she regrets in light of course not knowing about the war that they didn’t get married sooner and have babies sooner.</span> <span id="s131">And I always kind of wondered why they didn’t have more babies and in some ways regret not having children.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Do you know your parents’ dates of birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: Yes, of course.</span> <span id="s134">You know at a certain age if you don’t send them a birthday card you have hell to pay.</span> <span id="s135">My father was born in 1911, May 25th.</span> <span id="s136">My mother was born in 1910, June 14th.</span> <span id="s137">So we’re all summer babies.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: So that was the situation leading up to the war.</span> <span id="s139">Ha your mother been working, did she have a career?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: Yes, she was a seamstress.</span> <span id="s141">She talks about having loved her career as a seamstress.</span> <span id="s142">In her manuscript which she spent seven years writing she talks about the shop she was in.</span> <span id="s143">She talks about the labor struggles.</span> <span id="s144">During this time there were many, many labor struggles.</span> <span id="s145">My parents were as many Dutch Jews were working class people and by and large they voted for the Social Democratic Party which here we would mistakenly call Socialist or Left.</span> <span id="s146">They were a liberal democratic party whose interests represented working class people.</span> <span id="s147">And they also took part of the culture of the Social Democratic Parties and on the first of May, you’d have picnics, you’d have festivals.</span> <span id="s148">You would often have camping trips that these parties of the Left provided for young people which my parents often went to.</span> <span id="s149">And your question before about a religious household, I do not recall ever having heard my parents talk about a religious household although there are some times now when I talk to my mother and she disputes that.</span> <span id="s150">And I think she may dispute it because there is some matter of pride but I don’t think, and she would know better than I what happened in those years, but I never heard talk about her religious upbringing.</span> <span id="s151">I know we never had a kosher home.</span> <span id="s152">The first time I stepped into a shul was when I was Bar Mitzvahed.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s154">So you didn’t go for the High Holidays or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Before we were Bar Mitzvahed my parents pleaded with my brother and I to go to shul for the High Holidays and we didn’t.</span> <span id="s156">And we compromised.</span> <span id="s157">We said well we’ll get dressed and we’ll walk around temple so everyone will see us but we’re not going in because we didn’t know Hebrew and also being refugees and being survivors we felt in a way alienated from the Jewish community about us.</span> <span id="s158">And that is something that is very typical of people with our story.</span> <span id="s159">In some way we were met with a lot of not understanding.</span> <span id="s160">I always have felt very alienated from Judaism.</span> <span id="s161">I knew when I grew up in Brooklyn there were times where I would be beaten up for being Jewish.</span> <span id="s162">Easter would roll around and the Italian kids, boys, would come from Avenue X and we lived on Avenue Z and Avenue Y was a dividing line and you had the Italian people living on Avenue X and the Jewish people living on Avenue Z. And as what was popularly known then Jewish boys did not fight.</span> <span id="s163">They did not fight.</span> <span id="s164">So Easter would come around and I with my friends would be playing outside and Italian boys would come into the neighborhood and they would tell us we killed Christ.</span> <span id="s165">And I didn’t know who this boy Christ was, I had no idea.</span> <span id="s166">And I certainly knew that I and no one had killed anybody recently.</span> <span id="s167">So they would attack us and beat us up.</span> <span id="s168">We didn’t know about fighting back.</span> <span id="s169">So that happened a few times.</span> <span id="s170">And I guess that was one of many punctuation marks in my feeling not Jewish.</span> <span id="s171">And for many years I did not in some way come out as being Jewish.</span> <span id="s172">I did not come forward with it.</span> <span id="s173">I did not cultivate my social relationships based on people being Jewish.</span> <span id="s174">I had friends from all kinds of groups as I do now.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: But meanwhile though your parents had settled in a basically Jewish area?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Well, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s177">We came to America in 1949, my parents, my brother, who was really my step-brother as I’ll go on to tell later, my aunt and uncle and their two daughters.</span> <span id="s178">We lived in Far Rockaway.</span> <span id="s179">First few months we had an attic and we all slept on cots in the attic.</span> <span id="s180">And then at some point we got an apartment in Rockaway.</span> <span id="s181">We got two basement apartments which were about three blocks from the ocean which us kids in the family absolutely loved because it meant our summers we had a lot to do and to play.</span> <span id="s182">But in the spring when the rains came the basement would always be flooded and we’d always have to buy a new rug.</span> <span id="s183">So it was a sort of immigrant story.</span> <span id="s184">And then in 1951 when Beachhaven which was one of the first projects that Fred Trump built (which is the Donald’s father) built in Brooklyn, my parents moved out there.</span> <span id="s185">It was a very big step.</span> <span id="s186">It really was an attempt for my parents to start to build something for us.</span> <span id="s187">At one point they talked about wanting to move to Long Island which was also considered a step up and buy a home there which they never did.</span> <span id="s188">I as of late come to understand that there was a subtext to our life which was around the matter of denial and that had to do with getting on with life and putting all that stuff behind us, just get on with life.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: I hate to stop you but could you tell me what happened to your family during the war?</span> <span id="s190">We started with your birth so there are two more years at least.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: There’s plenty.</span> <span id="s192">So I was born on August second.</span> <span id="s193">This was the time when people were already being deported to Vestaburg which was a transit camp in the north of Holland, in the moors, God forsaken nowhere place.</span> <span id="s194">From Vestaburg every Tuesday the transport went east.</span> <span id="s195">People went either to Auschwitz, to Treblinka, to Sobibor, to Chelmo where most of my grandparents, aunts and uncles perished.</span> <span id="s196">Because our name was Trompettor and as I said not like Cohen or a lot of typical Dutch Jewish names my father who belonged to a butcher’s union which was taken over by the Dutch Fascists, the Jewish names would all be crossed off.</span> <span id="s197">Trompettor was not crossed off which meant we would continue to get their news letter but this time with the National Socialist masthead on it.</span> <span id="s198">So my father would conspicuously leave it on a little side table by the door in case there were raids and people would come in they would see this and think my father was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s199">Upstairs though in the same house lived my mother’s parents.</span> <span id="s200">During this time the Jewish Council in Amsterdam as there were in many countries had a list of all the people who were in Holland who were Jewish and the list was made available to the Germans.</span> <span id="s201">And I know there is much argument about the role of the Jewish Council.</span> <span id="s202">Because my parents were, I guess, working class people and sympathetic to the left of the political spectrum they had a certain kind of savvy about what was happening.</span> <span id="s203">In Holland from ’33 on you had over 25,000 German Jewish refugees so stories got around.</span> <span id="s204">People got a sense of the brutality that was there.</span> <span id="s205">When my father was arrested and beaten up as he tells it, he was of course among other things shocked.</span> <span id="s206">Something like this never happened to him and he felt that with this kind of brutality it was going to get worse and nothing would stop the Germans and that if they were capable of this no one was safe.</span> <span id="s207">And that’s what he felt.</span> <span id="s208">Before that happened there was the curfew, there were people being taken away, there were street fights in Jewish neighborhoods.</span> <span id="s209">Dutch fascists would come into the Jewish neighborhoods, the ice-cream parlors, the tea houses and start fights and there would be these altercations.</span> <span id="s210">But when he was beaten up he understood how bad it was and he decided then he was going to go underground.</span> <span id="s211">He was not going to register.</span> <span id="s212">My mother’s brother, Shok who is the name I was given, Jack, in honor of him, I think he was a very active Socialist and as my mother tells the story right before or after I was born she’s in my parents’ home and my mother’s brother Shok is still living there she enters into his room and sees him with a tallis and he’s praying.</span> <span id="s213">And she is shocked because she’s known him as a what should we call it an agnostic, an atheist.</span> <span id="s214">My mother says what’s going on?</span> <span id="s215">And he says, well he’s praying so his parents won’t be taken away and has decided that he will go and register in their place.</span> <span id="s216">Throughout the early period of the German occupations and the subjugation of the Jewish community there were continual regulations that were tended to deceive people.</span> <span id="s217">One of them was that if the young people in the family would register, the old people would not be taken.</span> <span id="s218">This was of course a way of sabotaging and undermining any form of resistance and many, many people believed it.</span> <span id="s219">You have to understand and appreciate that.</span> <span id="s220">What some people might see as stupidity or cooperation isn’t quite that.</span> <span id="s221">It has to be understood in the context of Holland is a country that’s very much concerned with law, with rules, with order.</span> <span id="s222">I always feel that they’re kind of caught between the anvil of Calvinism and the hammer of Anarchism and the reason for that is because cities like Amsterdam and Rotterdam are international cities and the Dutch have been for a few hundred years an international merchant people.</span> <span id="s223">So not to register was considered an illegal act even though it was clear to many that those who were in power, who made the law, were evil.</span> <span id="s224">But my father decided he was not going to register, he was going to do something else.</span> <span id="s225">That was a very big step.</span> <span id="s226">It was the first step to resistance.</span> <span id="s227">Many people of course had no idea what was going on in the east after the transports.</span> <span id="s228">People really believed they were going to be settled in some farm somewhere to dig potatoes and till the soil.</span> <span id="s229">But because my father had a certain political savvy he knew what German Fascism meant as people did.</span> <span id="s230">So he decided he was not going to register; he was going to go underground.</span> <span id="s231">The problem was what does that mean?</span> <span id="s232">How do you do it?</span> <span id="s233">Who do you make contact with?</span> <span id="s234">Who do you trust?</span> <span id="s235">And it was all luck.</span> <span id="s236">So my mother’s brother Shok decides he’s going to register to save the grandparents.</span> <span id="s237">He registers.</span> <span id="s238">He is sent to Vestaborg.</span> <span id="s239">At some point from Vestaborg he sends my mother a card, my mother and father a card that says don’t bring the red baby wagon which was their code for saying do not come, do not bring Jackie as I was known because even in Vestaborg which was not as horrible as the camps in the east there was constructed to deceive people.</span> <span id="s240">Actually when I say this I am stunned at how remarkable the deception was, to be deceived.</span> <span id="s241">In some way I know this is in hindsight I get very angry at it.</span> <span id="s242">How could people be so stupid?</span> <span id="s243">And on the other hand how can I say that?</span> <span id="s244">And all of it is a, it’s a mix of feelings one has, I have.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: I think you pointed it out when you said how the Dutch people were concerned with order and all that and they say they came in so fast to Holland and people were in shock and they just rounded up and took them out.</span> <span id="s246">I don’t think they had time to really think.</span> <span id="s247">That was my impression.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Yeah, but you know they had people coming in from Germany from 1933 with stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: True.</span> <span id="s250">True.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Hitler and Hitler did not have a reputation other than terrorism, cajoling, bullyism.</span> <span id="s252">He’s the ultimate form of European bullyism.</span> <span id="s253">So my father comes home; I am born.</span> <span id="s254">They decide they’re going to go underground.</span> <span id="s255">And one of the terrible things that also happens is that one considers the older people, the grandparents.</span> <span id="s256">What do they do?</span> <span id="s257">How do they go underground?</span> <span id="s258">And the family is kind of in some way the younger people start to provide for themselves.</span> <span id="s259">This is a question my cousins and I have often wondered about.</span> <span id="s260">What about the grandparents; what do you do?</span> <span id="s261">And I understand it’s a terrible question and it’s one I have asked my mother and never really gotten any kind of a satisfactory answer and I’m a little bit ashamed to even pursue it.</span> <span id="s262">But I wonder about it.</span> <span id="s263">I can tell you one story, terrible story.</span> <span id="s264">My father has the newspaper with the National Socialist masthead left at the table.</span> <span id="s265">There is a raid one day.</span> <span id="s266">The Dutch police, the green police which were the German police come in.</span> <span id="s267">They know the people who live upstairs are Jewish.</span> <span id="s268">They come to take them away.</span> <span id="s269">It turns out to be my mother’s parents and it is my mother’s mother’s, my grandmother’s birthday that this happens.</span> <span id="s270">And my mother of course is beside herself in shock, terrible, terrible.</span> <span id="s271">You can imagine how terrible something like that is.</span> <span id="s272">My father gathers his wits; he goes to the police.</span> <span id="s273">He says, we’ve known our neighbors for a long time could we please say goodbye to them?</span> <span id="s274">The Germans say yes.</span> <span id="s275">So here are my parents saying goodbye.</span> <span id="s276">My father is saying goodbye to his in-laws, my mother is saying goodbye to her parents as if they were just neighbors.</span> <span id="s277">It’s a terrible thing and I often wonder what my mother has done with that pain and that grief.</span> <span id="s278">She has written it all down.</span> <span id="s279">So my mother’s parents are taken away.</span> <span id="s280">I don’t know whether at this point before or after my father’s parents are taken away.</span> <span id="s281">Some of the brothers and sisters have been taken away, some have not.</span> <span id="s282">Those that remain decide to go underground and it means you don’t tell anyone else where you’re going because it’s unsafe.</span> <span id="s283">All you could do is tell your parents goodbye.</span> <span id="s284">When people went underground at the time they had no idea for how long this would be.</span> <span id="s285">No one knew.</span> <span id="s286">Some people thought weeks, months.</span> <span id="s287">No one thought of years.</span> <span id="s288">My parents had saved some money so they had money that they knew they would need to provide for their keep while they were underground.</span> <span id="s289">They made a connection through someone they knew who knew someone who knew someone to two people whose names are Cory and Jan Van Nomberg who are people who I now know as my aunt and uncle who live in Tilburg who we have been very close to since the war; people who I’m very, very fond of.</span> <span id="s290">He was in the Dutch cavalry.</span> <span id="s291">He was a sort of, I wouldn’t say monarchist, but he was a very good Dutch patriot.</span> <span id="s292">They came from Tilburg, a Catholic family.</span> <span id="s293">Holland is kind of divided like that.</span> <span id="s294">The people in the south are Catholic, the people in the north are Protestant.</span> <span id="s295">They came from a good Catholic family but he hated the Germans.</span> <span id="s296">Not that he hated National Socialism but he hated the Germans because they invaded his country.</span> <span id="s297">He wanted to do something.</span> <span id="s298">My parents ended up with them.</span> <span id="s299">At first the story was that my father was on the run; he didn’t want to serve in the army.</span> <span id="s300">I don’t know, what you would call a deserter.</span> <span id="s301">So they were taken in by Cory and Jan based on that.</span> <span id="s302">But there is a sense that Cory and Jan did kind of know that that was not the story, that they might be Jews.</span> <span id="s303">At some point early on in their underground experience it becomes apparent, it’s talked about and Cory and Jan decide well we’ve gone this far with you we’re not going to turn you away.</span> <span id="s304">And my parents spent from November of 1942 till the liberation in May with these people.</span> <span id="s305">I went underground about a week, a few days or a week before they went underground.</span> <span id="s306">I was three months old when I went underground.</span> <span id="s307">You can imagine, if you can imagine what it was like for my mother to give up her child with the hope that she is saving my life with always the knowledge of the possibility I’m being offered up to destruction.</span> <span id="s308">We were one of the lucky families.</span> <span id="s309">We all survived.</span> <span id="s310">My parents survived.</span> <span id="s311">I survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Did they circumsise you?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: I was circumcised.</span> <span id="s314">It’s something I don’t understand why people would take the chance of doing that, would take the chance because when there were raids the Germans would pull down the pants of the men in the street to see if they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s315">Remarkable, remarkable, crude to say the least.</span> <span id="s316">Yeah, but you know I guess you circumcise your child to show your fealty.</span> <span id="s317">It’s a practice that I have real questions about.</span> <span id="s318">I’m afraid that I’ve gotten lost in some -- I’m not in a track.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: You went underground.</span> <span id="s320">You were sent underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: Yes, I was sent underground.</span> <span id="s322">I spent the first night with my mother’s brother’s wife, Ollie, who was a gentile woman, my mother’s brother Morris, his first wife died in childbirth.</span> <span id="s323">He marries Ollie.</span> <span id="s324">Ollie is a gentile woman.</span> <span id="s325">Ollie has me for one or two nights and my parents know nothing of who has me or where I am.</span> <span id="s326">The deal is if the family goes underground it’s best to separate the children because at least that will raise the chances of someone surviving.</span> <span id="s327">So I go with Ollie and eventually I’m passed on to other people.</span> <span id="s328">I spend a short time in a Quaker children’s home, a very short time.</span> <span id="s329">It turns out that when my parents are also underground Cory, of Cory and Jan who are taking care of my parents, Cory goes to check on me to see how I am.</span> <span id="s330">This is done without telling my mother.</span> <span id="s331">My father knows about it, Jan knows about it.</span> <span id="s332">I don’t know why they didn’t tell my mother.</span> <span id="s333">They made some assumptions.</span> <span id="s334">Cory goes to see how I am doing.</span> <span id="s335">She goes to the Quaker home.</span> <span id="s336">She’s there.</span> <span id="s337">She has a bad feeling about the place.</span> <span id="s338">She takes me out of there right away.</span> <span id="s339">She spends a night with me in the woods.</span> <span id="s340">They talk about that there was fighting or shelling somewhere around there but it’s 1942 so I don’t really understand whether there’s resistance activity or what but this is how it’s talked about.</span> <span id="s341">She gets me to another place.</span> <span id="s342">I am finally placed in a place called Hino which is about 35 kilometers from the German border with a very poor Protestant family, people who are in their sixties, the family De Chot.</span> <span id="s343">Cory comes back which she does.</span> <span id="s344">She has the good sense to go to a place that’s sort of like the equivalent of a Fotomat.</span> <span id="s345">She has a picture taken of me that she can bring back and show my mother.</span> <span id="s346">My mother, in this time, doesn’t know why Cory has been gone for so long.</span> <span id="s347">Jan and my father know but they get worried.</span> <span id="s348">She doesn’t come home until very, very late the next day and she lays it out to my mother.</span> <span id="s349">Your boy is safe.</span> <span id="s350">We had to take him out of there.</span> <span id="s351">They find out subsequently it turns out that the next day this place is raided -- that children are taken out of there.</span> <span id="s352">The adults there are arrested.</span> <span id="s353">Remarkable.</span> <span id="s354">So Cory has this sense, has her sixth sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: It’s not all Jewish children there was there or were there many?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: There were many, many Jewish children.</span> <span id="s357">What they would do is they would mix the Jewish children in with the -- it was like a Quaker orphanage -- with other children.</span> <span id="s358">And this was often how it was done when Jewish children were hidden in groups, in France and Belgium and Holland.</span> <span id="s359">This is how it was done.</span> <span id="s360">When the children like myself went underground the parents were told to remember the clothes that the children had on.</span> <span id="s361">The people who received the children like myself were told to save that clothing because it was the only way to identify a child.</span> <span id="s362">So the story goes that my mother had a bathing suit that they cut up.</span> <span id="s363">Because she was a seamstress they made a little pants for me, a little top and a little hat.</span> <span id="s364">This is what I was delivered in eventually to the De Chot family and this is what they kept.</span> <span id="s365">.</span> <span id="s366">So what we are all in hiding, my parents not knowing whether I’m alive or where I am.</span> <span id="s367">My mother tells the story that every night before she went to sleep she would pray for my well -being.</span> <span id="s368">They had cut a lock of hair from my head that she had and she would use this as some kind of reliquary, some kind of talisman pray for my hair, pray for me.</span> <span id="s369">Every night ask my father when was it going to be over was it going to be all right.</span> <span id="s370">And of course what could the poor man do but say yes my dear, of course.</span> <span id="s371">So they were hidden with Cory and Jan from the end of November till May of 1945.</span> <span id="s372">For almost three years I was separated from my parents.</span> <span id="s373">When I first agreed to do this interview, when I was told about it my first response was well you know there are so many people who are older who have more powerful, more horrible stories to tell, they’re important to know.</span> <span id="s374">And then I thought but who will tell the story of people like myself who were at this age if I don’t.</span> <span id="s375">So it was a big step for me to decide to do it because in the community of people who are survivors, people who are camp survivors, people who are underground survivors, there has been a kind of presumptuously established hierarchy of suffering, that those who were in the camps suffered the most and they probably did.</span> <span id="s376">They did indeed.</span> <span id="s377">But it meant that for those of us who didn’t suffer like that we couldn’t really tell our story because it was not as bad because we had that one potato that we should be happy for.</span> <span id="s378">And this has been very problematic.</span> <span id="s379">Because of the conference last May this was a subject that was brought up and talked about.</span> <span id="s380">And even at the conference I had an instant where I was in an elevator and there was an older woman standing there, a short woman, and she had a little identity card which we all had which said our name, what country we were from, where we were hidden and what years.</span> <span id="s381">And she’s squinting up and she is Dutch as I can see and I chat with her and she’s squinting up and looking and says oh you were just a baby.</span> <span id="s382">And I was very angry with her and I thought how can you be so thoughtless at this place.</span> <span id="s383">But it is part of the problem.</span> <span id="s384">It is the problem who were in camps -- although to feel and I can’t be anything but sympathetic with that but it doesn’t allow me to tell my story.</span> <span id="s385">And I think this is an issue that has now been brought forth and dealt with as being one of the issues that we all have, that it’s all authentic.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Certainly, by all means.</span> <span id="s387">Did the Americans liberate your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: The British and Canadians.</span> <span id="s389">In Holland, I was in the north of Holland, my parents were in the south of Holland.</span> <span id="s390">The south of Holland was liberated some time early of ’45 and people at the time didn’t know what was going on in the north but in the north you had what was called the hunger winter because as the Germans were being defeated and withdrawing they took all the foodstuffs they could lay their hands on and the consequence was that something like 15,000 people in northern Holland died of hunger because there wasn’t anything they could put in their stomach, remarkable.</span> <span id="s391">I lived on a farm.</span> <span id="s392">Fortunately there was some food available.</span> <span id="s393">I’m told the story that the people who took care of me would share everything they had with me and it was very, very little.</span> <span id="s394">When I was finally found I looked like a picture of what we see today of starving children.</span> <span id="s395">I had a swelled head, tiny little body, skinny bones.</span> <span id="s396">But I had my share of what other people had.</span> <span id="s397">And I guess for my parents to have seen me eventually like this and to know this made it difficult for them.</span> <span id="s398">It raised the guilt ante for them; the guilt of having given me up even though the intent was to save my life.</span> <span id="s399">There were all kinds of complex inter-family dynamics come out of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: How did they ultimately find you?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: Good story.</span> <span id="s402">So my parents are liberated.</span> <span id="s403">They’re living in Tilburg.</span> <span id="s404">Tilburg turns out to be a sort of central command place for the British and Canadian army as well as the place where all the people who survived the camps come, all the Dutch Jews who come back -- all, the few -- all, whatever twenty of them, come back to Tilburg and there; there’s the Joint Committee of various Jewish organizations from America that help in finding people, in relocating people.</span> <span id="s405">It turns out that my father with the liberation gets a job with the British army as some kind of cook.</span> <span id="s406">He does this temporarily.</span> <span id="s407">They ask him to sign up for a year, whatever.</span> <span id="s408">He says forget it, he’s out of it.</span> <span id="s409">As far as he knows he’s the only male survivor of the family.</span> <span id="s410">He’s going to find out where the children are.</span> <span id="s411">He knows the children are hidden in Holland somewhere.</span> <span id="s412">He’s going to find out where.</span> <span id="s413">So as the story goes, he like Charlie Chaplin has a stick on his shoulder with a bag at the end of it and because there was not yet any real public transportation he hitchhikes on military vehicles -- goes to this village -- finds out there’s a resistance group there.</span> <span id="s414">There were a lot of church people who were instrumental in hiding children; finds this pastor who turns him on to a priest, who turns him on to a mayor.</span> <span id="s415">He finally finds his way to know that there is a young boy who fits my description who’s hidden in Hino in this farm.</span> <span id="s416">He’s hitchhiking.</span> <span id="s417">He appears there.</span> <span id="s418">It’s night, it’s dark, it’s a farmhouse.</span> <span id="s419">He bangs on the door.</span> <span id="s420">People lean out the top window, what’s going on, who is it?</span> <span id="s421">He tells the story.</span> <span id="s422">My name is Gerrit Trompettor.</span> <span id="s423">I’m looking for a young by described so and so.</span> <span id="s424">Would he be here?</span> <span id="s425">And there is some pause and finally they say well yes.</span> <span id="s426">He comes in but they don’t wake me, it’s late at night.</span> <span id="s427">He sleeps in a hayloft or somewhere on the farm.</span> <span id="s428">In the morning I am brought to him, I sit on his lap and I say “peen in ma book, peen in ma book” which is the Dutch rural expression of “pain in ma bouk” which means pain in my stomach.</span> <span id="s429">Gerrit thinks I am talking about a book.</span> <span id="s430">The Dutch word for stomach is “book is “book” The Dutch word for stomach is “bouk”.</span> <span id="s431">Because I’m speaking this flat rural accent he doesn’t understand me.</span> <span id="s432">It turns out I’m talking about pain in my stomach.</span> <span id="s433">I’m hungry or something.</span> <span id="s434">I don’t know at what point he comprehends that he and I are speaking an entirely different language.</span> <span id="s435">But it turns out that he has a talk with the family.</span> <span id="s436">They find out he is my father, I’m his son and he’s come to take me.</span> <span id="s437">And I’m having trouble right now recalling whether he takes me the first day or whether he leaves me there and he goes back and he gets Celene, the mom in this story.</span> <span id="s438">And it’s interesting that I’m having trouble recalling that.</span> <span id="s439">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s440">Anyway I am reunited with my family.</span> <span id="s441">I am undernourished.</span> <span id="s442">I am sickly.</span> <span id="s443">I am brought to a doctor who informs my parents that with food and care in a short while I’ll be back to normal, I’ll be fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: You’ve absolutely no recollection of any of this, is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: No, I also find it very distressing that I have no recollection.</span> <span id="s446">But I’m between the ages of three months and two years.</span> <span id="s447">Now I know there are stories of people who remember some things two, three years.</span> <span id="s448">I have two recollections.</span> <span id="s449">One of them is that I am in a home, I am picked up and very quickly brought to a second floor and I am put in a closet.</span> <span id="s450">In the closet is a hobby- horse.</span> <span id="s451">And I sit on the hobby- horse for a while and I hear voices downstairs and then later I’m brought downstairs again.</span> <span id="s452">I don’t know whether this is a dream or a memory.</span> <span id="s453">That’s all I really remember.</span> <span id="s454">And as I said it distresses me because I really have a need to know and understand more about this period.</span> <span id="s455">In our family as it happened in many families after the war when there were hidden parents and hidden children the main story in the family was that the parents were hidden and survived the war.</span> <span id="s456">And then there happened to be the story that the children were hidden and survived the war.</span> <span id="s457">But we were very young; we had no story to tell.</span> <span id="s458">So our story kind of fell into the background.</span> <span id="s459">And in those years, right after the war and even in the fifties and sixties there wasn’t any understanding or talk or research or literature or anything on what it was like for children who had to be reunited with the parents.</span> <span id="s460">I often talk about that I was adopted by my parents in 1945 because here I am a three year old kid who talks a different language.</span> <span id="s461">It took my parents a while, my parents and I to understand each other.</span> <span id="s462">And here I am thinking, I suppose, that I’ve been taken away from my parents by this new couple who tell me they’re my parents and there’s the program and I have to get with the program.</span> <span id="s463">I have to love them as they love me and it caused a great deal of problems.</span> <span id="s464">It still does.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: You think that was really one of the main tensions?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: Well it has been, I have come to understand it as one of the main tensions.</span> <span id="s467">I have, I realize now, been a depressed man for many, many years.</span> <span id="s468">I have been an angry man as well and unable to commit myself to many things.</span> <span id="s469">And I now understand what all that is about.</span> <span id="s470">I mean there are psychological dimensions to all of this that I don’t even know if they’re important to speak about whether this is pure quote unquote history or -- there are people who to this day suffer because of what happened to them during the war.</span> <span id="s471">There are others like myself who have problems because of what happened right after the war because denial was the order of the day.</span> <span id="s472">And it meant that those of us who are younger could not delve into our story.</span> <span id="s473">I have always when I was a young man living with my parents asked them about the war, terrifically curious, as I am now.</span> <span id="s474">And there was a way of finding my own voice and my own story.</span> <span id="s475">But when it came to asking questions about the people I was with, what happened to them, what was it like, I always came up against some form of denial, always, always.</span> <span id="s476">In 1985, I think it was the year, it was the year before my father died, I was visiting my parents who since 1972 moved back to Holland.</span> <span id="s477">I was determined to find out more about my history and about these people, the De Chot family.</span> <span id="s478">And I told them, I said I’m going to find out about this.</span> <span id="s479">I’d like you to help me.</span> <span id="s480">If you don’t, fine but I’m going to do it anyway.</span> <span id="s481">Well my parents must have conferred that evening and reached a wise decision and said well we’ll go with you.</span> <span id="s482">Let’s make a day of it.</span> <span id="s483">So the next day we drive to this area of Holland and we go to a City Hall of a town nearby to find maps, names of people.</span> <span id="s484">We don’t find much but we drive around and we drive to where my father thinks the farm was.</span> <span id="s485">Well it turns out it’s a major highway right now.</span> <span id="s486">There’s nothing there -- it’s obliterated but we do pass through what’s the other town where my brother/cousin was hidden and he was like fifteen kilometers from me and nobody knew.</span> <span id="s487">But we saw the house that he was hidden in and we recognized it because we had a photo that was made right after the war and it showed the same wrought iron fence, a very beautiful intricate design and it was immediately clear.</span> <span id="s488">My brother who was really my first cousin was taken care of by a woman, Mrs. De Fries, a very fine woman, a religious woman who had a hard time giving him up.</span> <span id="s489">But after the war my parents stayed in close contact with her and in the early fifties she came and spent part of a summer vacation with us.</span> <span id="s490">My parents in some ways were very wise.</span> <span id="s491">They knew that the separation between us and our foster parents would be problematic and in some way no matter what people did out of the best of intentions there would be problems.</span> <span id="s492">And I realize this now.</span> <span id="s493">I see a therapist twice a week which is enormously helpful.</span> <span id="s494">It’s paid for by the Dutch government.</span> <span id="s495">And I talk about all this stuff and I never talked about this before and I’ve come to some understandings and one of the things I’ve come to understand is that we were given up for hiding with the best of intentions -- out of nothing but love and care.</span> <span id="s496">But it still caused us problems.</span> <span id="s497">And it’s I feel a terrible dilemma for my parents that out of the best of intentions we were damned if we did and we were damned if we didn’t and we have this to deal with and it makes me, I was going to use the word angry, the truth is I am outraged and livid that I should now have to deal with this stuff in my lifetime that I’m a man who has a hard time relaxing, who does not feel safe and secure in the world, I’m so angry at that and to be gifted with life but to be born at a terrible time.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Do you want to tell me a little bit about how your cousin came to live with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: My cousin Andy’s parents were Cheel, Macheel and his mother Maricha, Marie.</span> <span id="s500">They went underground but they were caught and they perished in -- I call him my brother Andy, it’s a habit.</span> <span id="s501">My brother’s father which is not my father perished a few weeks before the liberation.</span> <span id="s502">He was shot on one of the marches from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s503">My mother, his mother perished in ’44.</span> <span id="s504">I have an album here, of course you can’t see it on tape, that a distant relative in Holland made for us where it’s a genealogical tracing of the family and in it we have listings of people and under the listing where it says when they died, where they died we have, well here it says Holocaust to say that he perished -- Judah Zomerplak some of my mother’s family.</span> <span id="s505">People perished in Treblinka; they perished in Auschwitz, they perished in Sobibor.</span> <span id="s506">So my brother’s parents perished, his mother in the camp.</span> <span id="s507">The adults at the time they were deciding to go underground made this agreement, that whoever survived would take in the children who, God willing, survived.</span> <span id="s508">It turned out that my brother, Andy was taken in by my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: How did they find him?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: How did they find him?</span> <span id="s511">They found him -- my father found me, my brother, my cousin Sylvia, my cousin Yanaka.</span> <span id="s512">Just by tracing he found us all, quite remarkable.</span> <span id="s513">He found us and I always remember knowing that Andy was my brother.</span> <span id="s514">What did I know from first cousin.</span> <span id="s515">Some time I think when he was ten or eleven years old in America my parents sat us down and told us the story of his parents.</span> <span id="s516">And I remember -- I don’t know how my brother took it in.</span> <span id="s517">I have no idea how he took it in.</span> <span id="s518">I remember going to bed at night and crying and feeling very sorry for Andy.</span> <span id="s519">My father came in the room and said to me, just because he’s your cousin doesn’t mean we love him less than you which I suppose it’s the transverse saying it doesn’t mean we love you less than him.</span> <span id="s520">And at the time I felt very, very sad.</span> <span id="s521">And I always in my heart felt very sad about my brother.</span> <span id="s522">I now have come to understand it was myself I was feeling sad for, that I was feeling sad for not knowing my foster parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: You were the same age basically?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: Yeah we were three months different.</span> <span id="s525">He was three months older.</span> <span id="s526">He died in 1979.</span> <span id="s527">He had a massive heart attack.</span> <span id="s528">He, I feel very strongly, was a man who was plagued by what happened during the war.</span> <span id="s529">When he knew his parents perished and he was adopted and he never, I think metabolized any of that stuff.</span> <span id="s530">Unfortunately after the war the advice that my parents and many people like them was given was one of --oh you’ll love your children, you feed them, you take care and everything will be okay.</span> <span id="s531">No one knew any different.</span> <span id="s532">No one knew that there was a psychological dimension that would come up.</span> <span id="s533">I think my brother stewed on this stuff for a very long time.</span> <span id="s534">He was a ferocious smoker, nervous habit.</span> <span id="s535">He became a puppeteer.</span> <span id="s536">He had a puppet theater and he traveled all over the country and he settled in Tulsa Oklahoma.</span> <span id="s537">He was married for a while.</span> <span id="s538">That didn’t work out.</span> <span id="s539">He was a hard person.</span> <span id="s540">I say hard in terms of texture.</span> <span id="s541">He lived his life very hard and he was very troubled by it all and unfortunately we didn’t have the advantage of having some kind of therapy or having the right kind of attention that we do now and I always feel bad that Andy died prematurely and that the war reached out and took him.</span> <span id="s542">When he died I had the task of calling up my parents late at night who lived in Europe to tell them about it.</span> <span id="s543">And I vowed to myself at that time that I would take care of myself so that I would never have to have someone call my parents up and tell them what happened.</span> <span id="s544">It was a terrible, terrible thing to do.</span> <span id="s545">Every time someone in my family dies, I feel it’s not a matter of people passing on as nature designed it but all the memories of our losses and our feeling betrayed comes back.</span> <span id="s546">It’s not just someone dying, it’s the war again.</span> <span id="s547">And I don’t know how other people like myself experience that.</span> <span id="s548">This is my experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: What did your parents do then immediately after they got the kids together?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: We moved to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s551">My father got work and even when my parents were hidden underground they talked about they decided they were going to go to America and they were going to teach each other English which they did.</span> <span id="s552">They taught each other a bit of English.</span> <span id="s553">Cory and Jan learned a little English.</span> <span id="s554">They were going to America.</span> <span id="s555">My family and Cory and Jan, the people who hid them, stayed very close after the war.</span> <span id="s556">There are always ironies in history and one of the ironies is that, for our family, it’s been a privilege and a delight to have had these new people in our lives, Cory and Jan, who I’ve always called Tanta Cory and Omi Jan aunt and uncle and whom I’m in touch with and very close to.</span> <span id="s557">When I go to Holland I see them.</span> <span id="s558">And when I got married in 1982 they came with my parents here so that was fun.</span> <span id="s559">So we were all very close after the war.</span> <span id="s560">My father went back into the restaurant business.</span> <span id="s561">He worked for a woman whose name was De Haas who had a number of restaurants and he was her main manager.</span> <span id="s562">She was in the camps.</span> <span id="s563">She survived the camps.</span> <span id="s564">She opened up a restaurant again.</span> <span id="s565">It was on the Centeur Bahn in Amsterdam which was a well known shopping street.</span> <span id="s566">The restaurant was a well- known place.</span> <span id="s567">But while he was working there after the war he still had on his mind he was going to America and they did that because we have relatives here.</span> <span id="s568">We had what you would call a matriarch aunt, Rose, Rose Blitz Gossler who in 1945 right after the war came to Holland ro see who was left who she could help.</span> <span id="s569">At the time there was a conversation between her and my father that when he would come to America she would help him set up in the Deli business which never transpired, which became a little chicken bone in the throat for a few years.</span> <span id="s570">So we had family here who sponsored us.</span> <span id="s571">You needed to have a sponsor, someone who could swear that you would not become a ward of the state.</span> <span id="s572">So we sailed here on the New Amsterdam and came here on August 12, 1949 and I remember coming and my Aunt Rose was there to greet us with some other relatives who I don’t recall.</span> <span id="s573">And she mentioned something to me in English that I should run up to this guard, this police officer and say -- and I didn’t know what it was and I went over and blabbed it to him and he smiled and that was it.</span> <span id="s574">So my first words in English were a mystery to me except for the police officer.</span> <span id="s575">My parents very quickly started to make a life for themselves here, determined to put everything behind us.</span> <span id="s576">And, of course, my parents are people who have had a history before the war.</span> <span id="s577">They’ve had a history that they think of fondly and speak of fondly.</span> <span id="s578">So the war was an interruption, a terrible interruption.</span> <span id="s579">For the rest of us who were younger it was our first experience in the world.</span> <span id="s580">We had nothing to go back to, to draw from, to support us.</span> <span id="s581">So it was different for my parents.</span> <span id="s582">They were able to say, let’s build a life.</span> <span id="s583">Those of us who were younger had some real traumatic problems.</span> <span id="s584">I understand that some -- we were in some way victims of child abuse.</span> <span id="s585">We were traumatized children.</span> <span id="s586">I know from my cousin that one of my cousins had a very difficult time in going back with her Mom and Dad.</span> <span id="s587">She wanted to be back with her foster parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: How old was she?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: She is two years older than me so at the time she was five.</span> <span id="s590">And there was an incident where I guess she got to be so whiny and nagging and impossible that her mother filled the suitcase, put it on the front steps and said, go.</span> <span id="s591">Get with the program or go.</span> <span id="s592">And the rest of us got the message; it was a very serious message.</span> <span id="s593">So we all got with the program.</span> <span id="s594">You know it’s a complex thing.</span> <span id="s595">You wished that your parents were smarter, were wiser but they were who they were and they tried their very best.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Did you ever feel estrangement this whole time in a sense?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: No, I never felt estranged from my parents.</span> <span id="s598">The odd thing is my parents did very well by me.</span> <span id="s599">And I think of them very fondly; I miss my father terribly.</span> <span id="s600">I’m sorry my mother’s living in Holland and we can’t be closer.</span> <span id="s601">But I know that I grew up as a very angry person.</span> <span id="s602">Right after the war I was hospitalized.</span> <span id="s603">I was hospitalized.</span> <span id="s604">Let’s see now, three months after the liberation I was hospitalized for three months.</span> <span id="s605">I had I guess what you called chorea or what’s commonly called St. Vitus Dance, I had a nervous disorder.</span> <span id="s606">So clearly I was paying for it.</span> <span id="s607">I remember being very well taken care of in the hospital.</span> <span id="s608">It was a Catholic hospital and I remember the nuns.</span> <span id="s609">I remember like you see on the TV program the nuns with the giant wings on their heads, real nun, old world nun.</span> <span id="s610">I remember being very well taken care of and then when we came to America, a few weeks after we were here my father had a serious stomach operation, ulcer.</span> <span id="s611">A few months again I also had a nervous breakdown.</span> <span id="s612">So there was stuff going on.</span> <span id="s613">There’s the will to survive and get along with it and then there’s the body telling you I can’t take anymore.</span> <span id="s614">There’s the psyche telling you I can’t take anymore.</span> <span id="s615">I need down time; I need time off.</span> <span id="s616">So I remember my parents doing very well by me.</span> <span id="s617">I’m not someone who complains about my parents.</span> <span id="s618">But I also know that I grew up as a very angry young man with a terribly sarcastic sense of humor; always saw the dark side of things first; was very politically active in the sixties in the civil rights and war stuff and even in the seventies.</span> <span id="s619">My anger was coming from my experiences as a child.</span> <span id="s620">I know that when I was born my mother was not able to really take care of me well because she was just a wreck.</span> <span id="s621">People around me were a wreck filled with fear and dread and I must have taken that in as they say with your mother’s milk even though there was no mother’s milk.</span> <span id="s622">I had taken that all in and I experienced myself as a very anxious person.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: Now when you moved to the Brighton Beach area were there primarily other refugees in your neighborhood or was there-------?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: I remember only one family.</span> <span id="s625">It was a Hungarian family with two boys and I heard from my parents that they were in the war too.</span> <span id="s626">But there was never any talk with those families about that.</span> <span id="s627">We played with their children.</span> <span id="s628">But if there were other refugee families I didn’t know about it.</span> <span id="s629">People didn’t talk about it to each other.</span> <span id="s630">You put it behind you.</span> <span id="s631">You deny it; you get on with your life.</span> <span id="s632">And I think now there was also a certain element of shame about it all among other feelings.</span> <span id="s633">It was like people were in the closet with their stuff.</span> <span id="s634">And I grew up in Beach Haven.</span> <span id="s635">I have enjoyable memories of my childhood also being a nervous kid but not a very intense religious quality to our family’s life.</span> <span id="s636">We would have Passover.</span> <span id="s637">We would set a nice table and have a wonderful meal.</span> <span id="s638">There was nothing said.</span> <span id="s639">We would celebrate Christmas.</span> <span id="s640">We had a lot of intermarriage family which you have with Jewish families in Europe, a lot of intermarriage.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: Who did your parents associate with once they came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: They associated with their family.</span> <span id="s643">There was my father’s brother Morritz survived Auschwitz and Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s644">These two brothers took care of each other; they survived.</span> <span id="s645">They paid a terrible price for it.</span> <span id="s646">They died, one of heart, one of cancer.</span> <span id="s647">They associated with family.</span> <span id="s648">They didn’t make friends.</span> <span id="s649">It was something I always found very peculiar.</span> <span id="s650">I suppose in Holland it was that way too.</span> <span id="s651">There was a large family before the war; your family were your friends.</span> <span id="s652">My mother who now lives in Amsterdam in Beth Sholom which is a kind of quasi retirement home has a very nice circle of about four or five women her age who have similar stories who they’re very close with.</span> <span id="s653">It’s very sweet.</span> <span id="s654">After dinner they sit in each other’s small apartments and they’ll watch TV and have coffee and chat.</span> <span id="s655">And then when it’s time to go to bed they’ll kiss each other goodnight and they’ll go to their separate homes, rooms.</span> <span id="s656">And it’s sweet.</span> <span id="s657">It’s not something that she had as a younger woman here.</span> <span id="s658">Her friends were always the other -- sister-in-laws.</span> <span id="s659">She had sister-in-law friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: I think that’s typical of the European rather than------but I was wondering since they came out—</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: My mother did make friends with the women in her shop.</span> <span id="s662">She worked in the garment trade for many years, mostly Italian women.</span> <span id="s663">And she learned to cook very good Italian food from that and she speaks of it very fondly.</span> <span id="s664">She says the post-war years were some of the best years of her life; I saw the boys grow up.</span> <span id="s665">We had a good time.</span> <span id="s666">She remembers it very fondly.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: So you never had any formal Jewish education of any sort?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: No, I was, it’s an interesting story I’m glad you asked.</span> <span id="s669">A few months, about two or three months before it was time to have my brother and I bar mitzvahed we had a local rabbi come to the house and give us rabbi lessons.</span> <span id="s670">And at one point, it was a very rote kind of lesson, we had to “zocher” we had to remember but we didn’t have to understand.</span> <span id="s671">So at one point we said, rabbi what does this mean?</span> <span id="s672">And he said, it doesn’t matter you don’t need to know, just remember.</span> <span id="s673">And I can date my alienation from Judaism from that day, from that moment.</span> <span id="s674">A very unwise thing to say.</span> <span id="s675">There might have been an agenda that was just get the boys to remember it.</span> <span id="s676">Nonetheless it’s not an answer I would give if I were a rabbi that’s for sure.</span> <span id="s677">So I was not a Jewish person until a few years ago when my wife took an interest in Judaism; had us join a local shul because she wisely understood it was part of the process of me being disaffected.</span> <span id="s678">At first we would go to shul just for the high holiday.</span> <span id="s679">I’d sit in the back with my coat and hat on ready to flee at any time feeling very uncomfortable always feeling like I want to cry.</span> <span id="s680">I would go to shul and feel like I want to cry.</span> <span id="s681">And that’s the way I feel right now even saying it, not feeling welcome, not feeling safe.</span> <span id="s682">I understand now it’s not feeling safe.</span> <span id="s683">For us to identify with Judaism was to immediately putting ourselves in touch with everything that was dangerous to us.</span> <span id="s684">And I at some point regretted very much that not only had those bastards taken our families they now had taken our culture.</span> <span id="s685">And I was determined to take that culture back within the context of being a 49 year old man living in Cambridge in the latter half of the twentieth century swept left and right by secular humanism, being a little bit politically leftist and sympathetic and liberal and feeling strongly about certain issues.</span> <span id="s686">Within that context I take back my Jewish culture.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: I think there’s a lot of space for it actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: There is a lot of space for it.</span> <span id="s689">The only problem is we just realized we joined a rather conservative temple where the whole service is like a Polish steeplechase, you know.</span> <span id="s690">I’m still reading the commentary and they’re finished.</span> <span id="s691">So I’m sort of shopping around for a little more contemporary enlightened shul.</span> <span id="s692">Our godson who lives in North Hampton was going to be bar mitzvahed and I was going to be called up to read for the first time and decided well I’d better do this really well not to embarrass him nor myself.</span> <span id="s693">So Lucy and I, my wife Lucy and I a year before started taking Hebrew lessons just so we could read this.</span> <span id="s694">I could read this short little thing and took Hebrew lessons for about two and a half years so I could read Torah and know what was being said.</span> <span id="s695">And that kind of got us started and every Friday night Lucy and I have Shabbat dinner and we do a blessing and when we’re not too exhausted from the end of the week we’ll read something and have found it very important to have something that separates the work week from rest, to have a moment of grace, to allow ourselves some grace even though the next day, Saturday, we’re still doing things we have to do.</span> <span id="s696">There are times where I feel I’d like to go to shul even though I’ll sit there.</span> <span id="s697">I won’t know what’s being talked about but I’ll sit there; I’ll read the commentary.</span> <span id="s698">There’ll be a Kiddush and I enjoy that.</span> <span id="s699">It’s hard to lead a Jewish life because all the issues for me.</span> <span id="s700">I find it very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: When did you get involved with this… you just got involved with the survivor’s group after they had the Children’s Conference?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: Yeah, the Children’s Conference was the week of May 5th 1991 and we knew about it almost a year before and I thought at the time I didn’t want to go to this conference.</span> <span id="s703">I didn’t want to deal with any of this stuff.</span> <span id="s704">And then I had started going to therapy shortly before the conference and talking to my therapist about it to help me to understand that it was probably a good thing to do.</span> <span id="s705">And I talked with my cousins who were determined to go and I said well I’ll come down to New York and meet you.</span> <span id="s706">We can have lunch and see each other but I’m not going to the conference.</span> <span id="s707">So we talked and talked and eventually I understood that it was a good thing for me to do.</span> <span id="s708">I went to the conference and it was terrific.</span> <span id="s709">I also sort of count for my conscious depression to that time and know that my whole life I’ve been depressed.</span> <span id="s710">But it’s all very much open and on the surface right now and I give it a name.</span> <span id="s711">It’s peculiar because there are times when people will see me and they’ll say, hi Jack how are you.</span> <span id="s712">And the question while only a second long feels like a thousand light years which gives me enough time to think do I tell them how I’m really doing, do I be sociable, do I know this person well enough?</span> <span id="s713">Because I don’t feel I’m doing well, you know but understand it’s a social question but now there are people who know my situation.</span> <span id="s714">I was at a dinner a month ago with some old friends and half the people there were therapists.</span> <span id="s715">And at some point this old friend who hadn’t seen me in a while actually a friend of my wife said, so Jack so how are you?</span> <span id="s716">Are you doing any good art work, any art, what’s happening.</span> <span id="s717">I said, well actually I see my therapist twice a week I’m very depressed, the bottom of the art market has fallen and there’s not much happening, and you?</span> <span id="s718">And there’s dead silence and it’s sort of like a Woody Allen scene.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: I guess they didn’t invite you anymore, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: No, they invited my wife back to the chorus.</span> <span id="s721">It’s in Brookline.</span> <span id="s722">There’s a Brookline chorus.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: I was just kidding.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: I know but you know it was important for me to say it, to give an answer not to sidestep it because for people like myself who were younger during the war the matter of having a voice is crucial.</span> <span id="s725">And the matter of being able to feel our experience was authentic is crucial.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: I think the truth of it there are so few children, Jewish children, who survived the war, so few --and then were reunited with their family or something like that.</span> <span id="s727">There are others who were just broken at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: I think that the numbers something like 25,000 people went underground and something like 16,000 perished were betrayed being underground.</span> <span id="s729">The statistics are so telling.</span> <span id="s730">In Holland before the war you had including 25,000 Jewish German refugees you had 140,000 Jews in Holland.</span> <span id="s731">After the war you had something between 15 and 10 or 25,000, terrible attrition rate.</span> <span id="s732">It makes me feel very badly about Europe.</span> <span id="s733">In the 1960’s I traveled a lot to Europe.</span> <span id="s734">I would work here for a while.</span> <span id="s735">I’d save my money.</span> <span id="s736">I’d go live in Europe; I’d bum around.</span> <span id="s737">Those were the years you could do that and see Europe and I was not that aware of my feelings of all of this stuff but as time goes by I find myself very angry about Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: I was going to ask you about your Dutch identity.</span> <span id="s739">What did your parents do when you got here?</span> <span id="s740">Did you sort of sublimate?</span> <span id="s741">Did you speak Dutch at home or have Dutch customs?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: We spoke both at home.</span> <span id="s743">I am very good with languages.</span> <span id="s744">I lost my accent very quickly.</span> <span id="s745">What’s amusing is that in being with this group of hidden children who meets -- we meet once a month -- I am one of the few people who doesn’t have an accent and what I enjoy is being with these people because this is a circle of people I would have been in had things been better, been different.</span> <span id="s746">So it gives me a sense of what it was like for my parents, for my family and I enjoy it.</span> <span id="s747">So we came here and I went to school and I had -- I want to say hello to Mrs. Harris who in the third grade was so wonderful to me.</span> <span id="s748">She helped me to learn English.</span> <span id="s749">We spoke Dutch and English at home but of course we started to speak more English.</span> <span id="s750">And I went back to Holland for the first time in 1965 as did my parents although we went on separate trips -- we met in Holland but we went on our separate trips.</span> <span id="s751">And I ended up living in Holland for a year in 1965 because I wanted to learn Dutch again.</span> <span id="s752">You know I studied French in school and I like languages and I wanted to do that.</span> <span id="s753">But as to the matter of Dutch identity it’s very complex for me because being a European American I like that I have -- whatever it means to be a European Jew I like that because it gives me a certain perspective about what it means to live in America in this time in history.</span> <span id="s754">On the other hand I find some of the presumptuousness and arrogance of the Europeans about America really shallow and I’ve always sort of understood America is the European peasant’s dream come true.</span> <span id="s755">And the only difference between America and Europe is maybe a hundred years.</span> <span id="s756">But the more I’m in touch with what I feel about my experiences the less happy I am with Europe.</span> <span id="s757">I feel we have been wretchedly betrayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: Your parents never gave you that sense.</span> <span id="s759">Do you think they felt that too?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: My parents never -- we never talked about in such a national context of saying Europe betrayed us.</span> <span id="s761">It was Germany, it was Hitler, it was Dutch collaborators.</span> <span id="s762">But you can take any country in Europe and it happened.</span> <span id="s763">What I also find interesting is that what the European Christian community is something that the Europeans have been doing to people of color all over the world for a few hundred years.</span> <span id="s764">What the Germans did in southwest Africa, what the Dutch did in Indonesia and what the Belgians did in the Congo, what the English did and what the French did they did it to everybody else who was different.</span> <span id="s765">And when it happened in their own homeland all of a sudden it became a terrible dark enigma about Hitler and Hitlerism and I really do attribute it -- the little that I know about history -- that it was a European phenomenon and the groundwork was laid by the church, by the Christian church.</span> <span id="s766">And I mean people have to own up to that, they have to own up to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: Can I ask you about your art?</span> <span id="s768">Do you feel that in any way your art manifests some of your ….</span> <span id="s769">.</span> <span id="s770">?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: Well actually it does in so far as that my art has nothing to do with my experience.</span> <span id="s772">My art is a complete denial of my experience and it is such an enigma to me.</span> <span id="s773">My artistic voice does not in any way include my experience and I see that as a function of denial.</span> <span id="s774">It perplexes me.</span> <span id="s775">And sometimes, you know some morning I’ll wake up and say boy I wish I could really express all that stuff in my art.</span> <span id="s776">But then I think of oh well but then I would be so literal, literal or pedantic or rhetorical and I don’t want to be that.</span> <span id="s777">It’s not what I draw on for my art.</span> <span id="s778">My art what I draw on is from my beauty, my love of beauty, the love of what’s beautiful in the world, the love of what’s beautiful between people.</span> <span id="s779">I also think there are aesthetic problems with dealing with horrors of such magnitude and I’m not the person to do it so I leave it alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: Have you looked at any other so-called Holocaust artists?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: Yes, well I have looked -- there’s a book of art from Auschwitz, things that were painted on walls and I’m absolutely struck by how powerful it is.</span> <span id="s782">It’s different than people today who will make art that’s about that.</span> <span id="s783">It does not strike a chord in me.</span> <span id="s784">I also in some way -- Elie Wiesel talks somehow about that you can’t make art out of it, how in some way it’s so inexplicable that all art will fall short and I think even successful Holocaust Shoah art falls short.</span> <span id="s785">To maintain a certain kind of integrity it would have to, it would have to.</span> <span id="s786">And I always felt for myself that art is about redemption and I don’t think……</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: It’s very idealistic.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A; No, it’s not idealistic.</span> <span id="s789">It’s as I think that the way in which the creative process functions in each of us.</span> <span id="s790">You draw on aspirations, you draw on hope, you draw on a sense of all things in their connectedness rather than being dispert.</span> <span id="s791">And you look for the sacred, what’s sacred in life.</span> <span id="s792">This is I think what motivates art and other people of course have another sense of it.</span> <span id="s793">And for now the Shoah is I don’t think there’s a place for redemption right now.</span> <span id="s794">I mean I understand that in our group that we meet once a month we have been talking about among other things about how civilization has a need to deny and has a need to forget.</span> <span id="s795">It’s a shameful period and it needs to forget and it will do this in many ways.</span> <span id="s796">One way will be the most banal expression of people who absolutely deny it happened.</span> <span id="s797">Then there is the matter of having perpetrators and victims be seen as equivocal in some way sort of like the Blitburg visit.</span> <span id="s798">We’re all victims of war.</span> <span id="s799">Well that’s so but that’s beside this point and that over time who knows how the story of this thing will be told.</span> <span id="s800">We can witness the experience of the African Americans in this country, the horror of that and how that’s already been glossed over.</span> <span id="s801">And I think that civilizations have a need to forget their shame and this is why I insist upon telling my story and say yes to being interviewed to anyone who’s willing to listen.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: Can I ask you some more questions maybe about your parents, about their personalities?</span> <span id="s803">If we’re going to include them in our project I would need to….</span> <span id="s804">.</span> <span id="s805">I think I’ll switch the tape though.</span> <span id="s806">We’re on the second tape of the interview with Jack Trompettor.</span> <span id="s807">We’re talking about his parents now.</span> <span id="s808">Which parent would you like to start with?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: Well I can tell you some things about them relative to the war experiences that are interesting in terms of personality.</span> <span id="s810">One is that my mother talks of having found my father so very appealing when they were younger because he was a quiet fellow and she liked that about him.</span> <span id="s811">It turns out that during the war he went through this personality change and he became a gregarious chatty chap.</span> <span id="s812">He’s a man who loved to talk to strangers as I am and he was very sociable, he was fun, he was easy to get along with.</span> <span id="s813">So he went through a real personality change.</span> <span id="s814">My mother is more of a worrier.</span> <span id="s815">She does the worrying for us and it’s sort of an unfair responsibility I think.</span> <span id="s816">It’s enough to be a mother but then to have to do the worrying.</span> <span id="s817">And she -- well it’s hard to really talk about her without defaming her.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: Other people have had this experience too.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s820">Well you know we accept our mothers and fathers as gods and forget that they are beautifully human.</span> <span id="s821">What can I say about my parents?</span> <span id="s822">I don’t really know except that I know in America my father worked very hard.</span> <span id="s823">I’d see him come home and after dinner he’d sit on a stool in front of the TV and within five minutes he was asleep, he was out.</span> <span id="s824">On Sundays he would go with the other men in the family and sometimes some of the boys.</span> <span id="s825">then we would go watch the soccer games.</span> <span id="s826">All the ethnic clubs in New York City played soccer with each other and we’d do that.</span> <span id="s827">And they belonged to the Holland-American sporting club which would have a New Year’s party.</span> <span id="s828">Which would have functions, events.</span> <span id="s829">So they kept within their Dutch circle.</span> <span id="s830">Any friends that they made outside of the family were still Dutchmen.</span> <span id="s831">In some ways I regret that they did not branch out more.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: It sounds to me that like for example your father must have been extremely strong-willed to have made the decision not to register and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: Yes, you know I experienced my father as a very ordinary person and I don’t mean that “ordinaire”.</span> <span id="s834">I mean just -- he was just a person.</span> <span id="s835">But he is very creative in life.</span> <span id="s836">In the short haul he’s very creative.</span> <span id="s837">When a crisis would come up he would be real quick and he would be really on the case and I know when he and my mother went underground my mother did most of the hemming and hawing of course.</span> <span id="s838">I say of course, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s839">And he had to really convince her as well as her brother’s letter that said don’t bring the red baby carriage -- had to convince her they had to do it.</span> <span id="s840">So she would do a lot of hemming and hawing but she’s a very expressive person.</span> <span id="s841">My mother is the one who I’ve done much of my talking with.</span> <span id="s842">We are both connected very emotionally in that way.</span> <span id="s843">It’s been troublesome as well because of that.</span> <span id="s844">My father I’ve experienced a little more distantly.</span> <span id="s845">Guess it’s very typical in that way.</span> <span id="s846">I always experienced them both as being very supportive but there are things I never really got into with my father that I would get into with my mother.</span> <span id="s847">My mother would have wonderful provocative arguments and she was the more expressively emotional one.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: I know its hard having observed your parents, interacting with other people.</span> <span id="s849">Do you know how they were generally thought of?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: My parents in the family have had a good reputation, very good reputation.</span> <span id="s851">When I talk with my cousins and they talked about my parents they always talked about how friendly and sweet and thoughtful they were.</span> <span id="s852">And this is how I’ve experienced them, as a thoughtful people who were very practical at life and also had placed a premium on being a decent person.</span> <span id="s853">There was a clear message about you had to be an ethical person.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: And they behaved that way as well, it seems?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: Oh yeah, oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: Is there anything else maybe that you know about their childhoods or their youth or their …?</span> <span id="s857">You say they were involved in these social democratic -- was that a teenageerhood already or?</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: Yeah, sixteen, seventeen on.</span> <span id="s859">You know you’re in a particular class and your social life at that time was very much involved in political groups, the young people’s socialist league or something like that.</span> <span id="s860">And what it meant was it provided a social life with a kind of minimal political context for young people and sometimes it would serve the purpose of grooming more seriously politically committed people.</span> <span id="s861">But it was also neighborhood stuff, it was neighborhood stuff.</span> <span id="s862">My parents lived with a lot of relatives as did many people then and they enjoyed that .</span> <span id="s863">They did a lot of their playing and socializing with those cousins.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: Did they have any hobbies or music interests or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: Let’s see now, no, I know that during the war my father got involved in marquetry, wood marquetry.</span> <span id="s866">During the thirties in Europe it was very popular.</span> <span id="s867">You’d get marquetry sets.</span> <span id="s868">Like let’s say here its Scrabble or hula-hoop which dates me.</span> <span id="s869">But there it was marquetry and during the war Jan Van Nomberg and my father managed to get hold of these marquetry sets and make these little pictures.</span> <span id="s870">They were copies of famous old masters and my mother has my dad’s.</span> <span id="s871">It’s in my dowry.</span> <span id="s872">I get it when it’s my turn and it’s a replication of a famous Vermeer painting of the house where Vermeer lived and it’s remarkable because the brick is all these small pieces of wood and the mortar in between are all these tiny, tiny little splints of pieces of wood.</span> <span id="s873">They did this during the war when they were underground to keep themselves from going cuckoo.</span> <span id="s874">I don’t know of any other habit, hobbies my father had.</span> <span id="s875">My mother liked to sing when she was younger.</span> <span id="s876">I know I grew up loving opera and I attribute that to her.</span> <span id="s877">These people worked a lot.</span> <span id="s878">The message here was work, work so….</span> <span id="s879">And I am an artist and that’s my work and other people would consider that a hobby so what other people would consider a hobby I took on as a major -- as an occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: Is there anything else that you would like to add about your own experience or that of your family, your relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: Well at the expense of sounding whiny, I would say that my family like many, many people got screwed by Europe and we came here in 1949 and my parents had to start from scratch again and never could quite build it up to where they had in Holland.</span> <span id="s882">They worked very hard in Holland and they did well for themselves.</span> <span id="s883">And I do marvel actually at my parents the ability to go into hiding, provide for themselves and survive.</span> <span id="s884">When I was in my teens and going through my rebellion I pooh-poohed my parents.</span> <span id="s885">What did they know?</span> <span id="s886">I knew much more than they did.</span> <span id="s887">And now, of course, I think what a little snot-nose I was to think that.</span> <span id="s888">They had to live through and make life decisions through something I have not had to and hope to God I and no one else will ever have to make.</span> <span id="s889">And they were ordinary people, simple people and they rose to the occasion and the people that hid them were ordinary human beings and they rose to the occasion.</span> <span id="s890">Those were the heroes.</span> <span id="s891">My parents were the heroes.</span> <span id="s892">The people that hid them were the heroes.</span> <span id="s893">And the stories they tell of what they did during the war to survive is remarkable.</span> <span id="s894">My mother taught Cory how to sew.</span> <span id="s895">What they did -- they would get clothing and they would take it apart and remake things out of it and they would sell or exchange that for foodstuffs.</span> <span id="s896">And when my parents were hidden underground no one on the street in the town, of course, knew they were being hidden.</span> <span id="s897">The parents of Cory knew but not her younger brother.</span> <span id="s898">It was too dangerous to let people know.</span> <span id="s899">And Jan would get food.</span> <span id="s900">He had those wide pants at the time, very wide flair pants, very popular then, like bell-bottoms in some way and they sewed these cloth bags to the inside of their pants that they would fill with foodstuffs and he would bicycle home with them.</span> <span id="s901">They also had to be careful because they couldn’t trade for food that would be evident that there was more than two people in the household eating so it had to be all done in different places and as my mother tells it they were never hungry during the war.</span> <span id="s902">They always had enough foodstuffs.</span> <span id="s903">And she would take great pleasure going down to the cellar and looking at the shelves and seeing what food they were able to store.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: It is interesting.</span> <span id="s906">I know I lived on a farm from 1977 to 1980.</span> <span id="s907">Actually I did farming in New England from 1973 to 1980 when I lived with someone and we raised, we had a milk cow, we raised hogs, we raised chickens, we raised sheep, we raised a lot of our own foodstuffs.</span> <span id="s908">And I would go down to the cellar and I would put up forty quarts of applesauce, sixty quarts of tomatoes, freezer filled with meat, freezer filled with vegetables, cords of wood stacked up -- very New England.</span> <span id="s909">And I would go look at all this and stand there like a proud man with my hand in my suspenders looking at it and not at the time understanding what was going on was some kind of replication of some need that my parents went through.</span> <span id="s910">My parents went back to Holland in 1972 because they wanted to retire and they could do it there rather than here and it was also the year that I went to live in Vermont during the summer and ended up staying there and ended up actually having left New York City and shortly after ended up in a farm situation and I do wonder now how I had replicated my war experiences.</span> <span id="s911">In a way it makes me feel very bad that my agenda was so unconscious that my going into this farm and farming was a matter of going into hiding.</span> <span id="s912">I had a big beard, I had long hair, I looked very different than I do now.</span> <span id="s913">I was in hiding and it makes m feel very badly that I still had to act this out and it happened at the same time as my parents decided to go back to Europe and again it was a kind of a split with my family, a separation.</span> <span id="s914">I understand it now.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: What motivated them to actually -- you said because they could retire there now.</span> <span id="s916">Have you decided to continue this interview after all?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s918">I want to read this little piece, that is what my wife and I translated from my mother’s journal that she spent seven years writing about her and the family’s wartime experience.</span> <span id="s919">And what’s interesting is she has said that in writing this it made her feel much better.</span> <span id="s920">She’s really the only one in her family that even talks about this stuff.</span> <span id="s921">For years my brother and I even after we moved out of our parents’ home when we’d come home to visit would ask them about the war.</span> <span id="s922">And inevitably every time we got together the conversation would come back to that and there were questions.</span> <span id="s923">My brother and I always had to ask questions.</span> <span id="s924">At one point we finally decided let’s get Mom a tape recorder and see if she’d really do this.</span> <span id="s925">And she did.</span> <span id="s926">And she spent seven years writing this stuff down.</span> <span id="s927">And it was done without a typewriter, without a personal computer, just by hand.</span> <span id="s928">And she got so involved with it that when Cory wanted to go out with her shopping or something Celene wouldn’t go.</span> <span id="s929">She really wanted to do this and complete it and as I said she felt in a way that a burden was taken off her chest.</span> <span id="s930">There’s one little piece I want to read that could give you an idea of what it was like at the time that my parents made the decision to go underground and to provide and look for a place for me.</span> <span id="s931">On the fifteenth of November Eddie (which was my mother’s other brother) visited us with great sadness because of what had happened to Father, Mother and our brother Jack.</span> <span id="s932">During this visit he told us he had an underground address for Dad and myself and a separate one for you, Jack.</span> <span id="s933">It’s written for you because this whole manuscript was written for my brother and myself.</span> <span id="s934">So that’s the form it takes.</span> <span id="s935">Very distressed with the idea of parting from our baby, Eddie tried to convince us that your chances, Jack were better without us.</span> <span id="s936">If we were captured he explained at least you might survive.</span> <span id="s937">He also knew it would be easier to find a separate place for a couple without children.</span> <span id="s938">They would not bring to the underground family the additional burden and security risk of children crying or needing medical attention and such.</span> <span id="s939">All night Eddie talked with us.</span> <span id="s940">What an extraordinary demand -- give up our three month old child to perfect strangers and without opportunities to visit.</span> <span id="s941">We had no idea how long such an arrangement would have to last, a month, half a year, longer, who knew.</span> <span id="s942">The next day we talked with my brother Maritz.</span> <span id="s943">In the serious way that’s so typical of him he asked Dad and me to consider the following : imagine the German police catching you, he said, this could happen at any moment.</span> <span id="s944">The baby will fall into their hands.</span> <span id="s945">Wouldn’t you rather have a child with Ollie and me (Ollie was his wife) until Eddie takes them to a hiding place?</span> <span id="s946">Dad and I found a lot of truth in what he said.</span> <span id="s947">Here was a chance so many people wanted but had no opportunity of getting.</span> <span id="s948">How could we pass it up.</span> <span id="s949">We felt that no matter what we did we would be doomed if we didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s950">Already the families of several of our brothers and sisters had been torn apart by arrests and deportations.</span> <span id="s951">A few months ago, Case, the husband of Dad’s sister, Bepe, had been taken to Camp Westerbork leaving Bepe at home alone with their two year- old daughter.</span> <span id="s952">Westerbork was located in Northern Holland and the Jews were sent from there to the different concentration camps, Auschwitz, Sobibor.</span> <span id="s953">Maritz Trompettor, who was my father’s brother, had been in the same camp for half a year by then.</span> <span id="s954">His wife, Femma and their daughters were still at home.</span> <span id="s955">The children’s home in which Femma worked was soon seized by the SS and the Green Police.</span> <span id="s956">They captured the Jewish infants and sent them with their mothers to be gassed or destroyed in one way or another.</span> <span id="s957">But Femma protected herself and her daughters and then found underground addresses for each of them.</span> <span id="s958">This is my Aunt Femma who died a year ago.</span> <span id="s959">She was very active in finding hiding places for children.</span> <span id="s960">She was a very brave and very strong and feisty woman.</span> <span id="s961">The thing is many people were brave and feisty and strong and everything but in some way it was luck.</span> <span id="s962">It was luck that you survived but it didn’t necessarily mean that you were lucky or that being lucky meant you were better than anyone else.</span> <span id="s963">My brother Maritz and his family were still intact and living at the Transvaalstraat.</span> <span id="s964">My mother’s brother Maritz was born in England because his parents took a trip to England and he was born there so he had dual citizenship.</span> <span id="s965">He had British and Dutch citizenship.</span> <span id="s966">He eventually ended up in Bergen-Belsen but Belsen was not an extermination camp and because he was a British citizen they didn’t kill him.</span> <span id="s967">It also allowed for his wife Ollie to bring food packages to him which helped him to survive.</span> <span id="s968">Eddie, another brother, because he was involved with the resistance moved around from one temporary hiding place to another.</span> <span id="s969">He never went permanently underground.</span> <span id="s970">Indeed with his pure blue eyes and curly blond hair he thought he would be taken for a German rather than a Dutch Jew.</span> <span id="s971">Brazen as he was he had been riding trains filled with Germans and these experiences gave him this idea.</span> <span id="s972">Of course he did not know that in time he would be the victim of betrayal.</span> <span id="s973">He was betrayed.</span> <span id="s974">My close friend Marie which is my brother’s/cousin’s mother which is Andy’s mother, another of Dad’s sisters was still at home with her husband, Cheel and their six month old infant Andy.</span> <span id="s975">Like us they lived with all the worries and fears of keeping Andy out of the hands of the pack of thieves.</span> <span id="s976">By now Dad’s other sister, Judith, her husband and their four year old daughter Laney had been underground for three months.</span> <span id="s977">With great difficulty and sadness we struggled over our decision to go into hiding.</span> <span id="s978">There was not even a guarantee that all would go well underground.</span> <span id="s979">Inasmuch as no guarantee was to be found with any choice we made we finally decided to go ahead with Eddie’s plan.</span> <span id="s980">He promised that within a week we would be told all the details.</span> <span id="s981">This was the best of the worst of situations.</span> <span id="s982">Maritz’s wife Ollie also had to agree with the arrangement because she would be also responsible for caring for our son, me.</span> <span id="s983">No one knew for how long.</span> <span id="s984">It could take two days, it could take a month.</span> <span id="s985">But Ollie agreed without talking to us.</span> <span id="s986">It was good enough for her that my brothers wanted it.</span> <span id="s987">We have always been grateful to her.</span> <span id="s988">Ollie died two and a half months ago and I wrote her daughter and her step-daughters a letter saying something like this about what a decent person she was and how we owe our thanks to her and I wrote this letter as -- it was ostensibly a condolence letter but I wanted to say something to her daughters about what a fine person she was.</span> <span id="s989">We cared a great deal for our family.</span> <span id="s990">Sisters, brothers and children were heavy on our hearts and particularly the old people.</span> <span id="s991">What did one do with the old people.</span> <span id="s992">Grandma and Grandfather Trompettor were still living at home.</span> <span id="s993">They were fortunate for the moment because Shuls, one of their sons, one of my father’s brothers, and his family lived nearby allowing them to help his parents through thick and thin.</span> <span id="s994">But with his loving attention to them and his recent service period away from home (he had to serve in the army) he hadn’t been able to find an underground address.</span> <span id="s995">The old people understood that for them life was finished.</span> <span id="s996">One sees this now on the photographs taken of them for their identity papers.</span> <span id="s997">Even if they went underground, which seldom happened, their chance for survival was very slim.</span> <span id="s998">As long as the war continued it became clear to them that they would eventually be left by themselves, most likely never again to be with the people they so dearly loved.</span> <span id="s999">Often enough there was talk of the underground and so with great grief they began to live with it (meaning the children going underground).</span> <span id="s1000">Thus was something we simply could not continue to think about.</span> <span id="s1001">If one became too sensitive and afraid then one might let an opportunity go by.</span> <span id="s1002">We grew resolute.</span> <span id="s1003">We did not tell anyone about our plan other than Father and Mother Trompettor.</span> <span id="s1004">You, Jack and I had recently visited them and I did not expect them to say goodbye to us again.</span> <span id="s1005">From their gestures at our departure I saw that for them it was a real goodbye, not just a good-day until the next time.</span> <span id="s1006">Clearly they suspected something.</span> <span id="s1007">Every evening for years Dad visited them for a few minutes.</span> <span id="s1008">Now he went to tell them of our decision.</span> <span id="s1009">How does one present such a sad prospect.</span> <span id="s1010">Like their other children we too kept the details for ourselves for the sake of security.</span> <span id="s1011">You took nobody into your confidence.</span> <span id="s1012">This was what the bad society had made of us.</span> <span id="s1013">Later as it turned out all those who were still at home except for Uncles Jules eventually went underground but it consoled us little to learn that we were not the only ones who had to leave parents.</span> <span id="s1014">This is a very telling piece which always perplexes me.</span> <span id="s1015">For me the leaving was not so difficult because my parents were not here anymore.</span> <span id="s1016">This is my mother talking because her parents were already taken away.</span> <span id="s1017">What I have left if they were still at home.</span> <span id="s1018">Dad asked himself this question.</span> <span id="s1019">No good answer was found.</span> <span id="s1020">Today, forty years later, I do not think I would have made this choice again.</span> <span id="s1021">The twentieth of November 1942 arrives.</span> <span id="s1022">It is early in the morning and I am home alone when Eddie comes to our apartment.</span> <span id="s1023">We must be ready before eight o’clock that night, he says, to begin with the first part of our journey into hiding.</span> <span id="s1024">As we had originally agreed he himself--------- (let’s see if I can find the other piece of that).</span> <span id="s1025">Eddie himself would bring us.</span> <span id="s1026">Everything was planned that way.</span> <span id="s1027">Jackie, that’s me, would be picked up by my brother Maritz at seven o’clock in the evening and from thereon a place would be found in the children’s house in Neimachen.</span> <span id="s1028">This was just as Eddie said it would happen from the agreed upon plans made earlier on.</span> <span id="s1029">We were expected to pay 300 guilder a month to the children’s house.</span> <span id="s1030">We did just this even though in this time this amount of money was a large amount for working class people.</span> <span id="s1031">It was organized so that we would have a particular amount with us and Eddie would hold on to the rest.</span> <span id="s1032">In case something went wrong with us there would still be enough money for a definite time to pay the kinder house.</span> <span id="s1033">In the beginning we could know if we had enough money or not for the duration of the war.</span> <span id="s1034">We naively thought it would be possible.</span> <span id="s1035">As I have said as soon as I knew the plan that morning Chait ver Kike the neighbor and I delivered our household goods to her apartment with the help of her husband.</span> <span id="s1036">This is a neighbor who was very friendly with my parents who agreed to buy their furniture so my parents could raise money and they knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s1037">When you went underground and you left you couldn’t leave abruptly because then immediately someone would be on your tail so my parents planned this over time so they could slowly leave.</span> <span id="s1038">.</span> <span id="s1039">They would leave someone paying some of their bills and it would be months before it was realized that they were gone.</span> <span id="s1040">And my mother has often talked about how she felt she had to be like a criminal.</span> <span id="s1041">She had to think like a criminal because the law was in the hands of the criminals.</span> <span id="s1042">She as an ordinary person had to think like that to survive.</span> <span id="s1043">Dad was quickly warned at work I do not know by whom.</span> <span id="s1044">At four o’clock he came home which was very unusual for Thursday when he usually came home about eight o’clock or later.</span> <span id="s1045">He just told his boss he had to go away for a little while.</span> <span id="s1046">Because it was so busy on Thursdays this boss told him to be quick and come back as soon as possible but Dad knew better.</span> <span id="s1047">He then went for the last time to his mother and father who were in a dejected mood and not without reason.</span> <span id="s1048">They had just before found out that their daughter Judith, her husband and child, Yope and Laney were betrayed and handed over to the Germans.</span> <span id="s1049">We will never know if the Trompettor grandparents knew that Laney was in fact still with her benefactor having gotten away from her executioners.</span> <span id="s1050">This is my cousin Laney who lives in Holland.</span> <span id="s1051">I’m almost absolutely certain they did not know otherwise we would have heard it from Uncle Jules.</span> <span id="s1052">For Dad at the moment while this was indeed a grim message he tried not to be disheartened.</span> <span id="s1053">On the contrary this news of his sister strengthened him in his resolve to go into hiding.</span> <span id="s1054">In answer to your question about their character.</span> <span id="s1055">You never really know the full depth I suppose of your character until something extraordinarily intervenes and then if you’re lucky you rise to the occasion.</span> <span id="s1056">Dad also told his parents what we were going to do that night but what could these poor people do but accept our leaving them.</span> <span id="s1057">This was the last time that Dad was ever again to be with his parents.</span> <span id="s1058">Here was the new episode between parents and children finished under the saddest of circumstances.</span> <span id="s1059">Still to come were many more moments of separation.</span> <span id="s1060">Dad came home and told me that what he had just learned from his parents about his sister and her family.</span> <span id="s1061">I felt very sad but now realized that we had come this far and we definitely had to continue with our plans, the sooner the better.</span> <span id="s1062">And this of course then is my mother’s moment when she too becomes resolute.</span> <span id="s1063">We ate something and got dressed as if we were going out.</span> <span id="s1064">We put on our best clothing because you never knew.</span> <span id="s1065">Seven o’clock in the evening November 20, 1942 my brother Maritz came to take Jackie away.</span> <span id="s1066">What a moment.</span> <span id="s1067">Would we ever see you again?</span> <span id="s1068">We embraced you; it had to be.</span> <span id="s1069">It was for us to say the least the only chance.</span> <span id="s1070">We had to try but how do you do something like that.</span> <span id="s1071">Who gives you the strength to hand over your three month old child a bundle that you love so much and have learned every gesture in those three months.</span> <span id="s1072">When we gave you to Uncle Maritz Zomerplaag we knew there would be a place prepared for you in the Catholic children’s home.</span> <span id="s1073">Later as it turned out we found out it was a non-denominational.</span> <span id="s1074">It was a Quaker house where the director took in various children but mostly those in Catholic families.</span> <span id="s1075">My brother Eddie found that he made more of an impression on us when he said it was a children’s home.</span> <span id="s1076">I surmised this at the time.</span> <span id="s1077">It did indeed make a better impression on us.</span> <span id="s1078">Eddie said that it would still take a few days before there would be a permanent place for you there.</span> <span id="s1079">Later we learned that those few days turned into a month but it was a good thing that we didn’t know that at the time.</span> <span id="s1080">In those four weeks of waiting you were almost a fatality.</span> <span id="s1081">I will return to this later.</span> <span id="s1082">(This is where I talked about that).</span> <span id="s1083">It’s remarkable to me.</span> <span id="s1084">It helps to explain what I feel about my anxiety and insecurity in the world that as a baby I took in all this near destruction of stuff and from what we know now about children take in the world.</span> <span id="s1085">It was our wish to survive this drama with Jack back with us.</span> <span id="s1086">Therefore it was necessary to arrive at our destination safely.</span> <span id="s1087">This wish was for us so strong and so consumed us that it became for us the strength needed to give you over to fulfill this unbelievable and horribly sad task.</span> <span id="s1088">Without exaggeration from that moment on we thought about you every day.</span> <span id="s1089">I would like to read a little bit more.</span> <span id="s1090">I don’t know if there’s a……</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: We have more tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1093">I read this to give you a sense possibly of what it was like for my parents and for me and what people lived with.</span> <span id="s1094">Now we were again alone without you.</span> <span id="s1095">.</span> <span id="s1096">What torment.</span> <span id="s1097">Do not think that it is easy to write about this now.</span> <span id="s1098">To imagine that so many parents had to go through the same and even worse including Marie Cheel.</span> <span id="s1099">When they had to take you, Andy, with the best of intentions of getting you back.</span> <span id="s1100">Where your parents brought you we did not know.</span> <span id="s1101">This was logical since we were already underground.</span> <span id="s1102">Later I will write about some of the details, our dear departed son.</span> <span id="s1103">My mother finished this -- was writing the story at the time my brother died so it changes-- what do we call that the transitive….</span> <span id="s1104">.</span> <span id="s1105">?</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: The tense.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">A: The tense, the transitive chicken, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q: With regard to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1110">As soon as Maritz took Jackie out of the house we too went on our way to the Umstel train station just as we had planned.</span> <span id="s1111">This took ten minutes.</span> <span id="s1112">We closed the door on the largest part of our household’s possessions and most of our clothing.</span> <span id="s1113">Obviously they must not have had their yellow star on because they could not have been out.</span> <span id="s1114">In the meantime Dad had left a half-year’s rent money behind with our landlord.</span> <span id="s1115">The landlord knew we were going away but not when.</span> <span id="s1116">If this helped us we don’t know.</span> <span id="s1117">It did give us the idea that we would say the lease not be looked at for six months although certainly not out of dispute with the landlord although betrayal or discovery was always naturally a possibility.</span> <span id="s1118">In any case later on we heard of the first raid of our apartment and that it was sealed up by the Germans.</span> <span id="s1119">Thus we were not searched for in the first raid.</span> <span id="s1120">From this we conclude that paying the landlord that way we did serve our purposes well.</span> <span id="s1121">I would like to read about when my father found me.</span> <span id="s1122">I feel I need to have my voice back again.</span> <span id="s1123">That’s the problem with this.</span> <span id="s1124">My brother and I were instrumental in getting my mother to do this and it means a lot to me and I’m very pleased she did it but in reading it, it also pushes my button about what about me -- now.</span> <span id="s1125">Dad felt it was now time for him to begin his own search for you.</span> <span id="s1126">We are reading now about the part where my parents have been liberated and my parents decide to look for the children, to look for whatever children are still alive.</span> <span id="s1127">We had no idea how to do it.</span> <span id="s1128">We had no guidance but our patience was up and we could not wait for information that would inform us about what happened with you and Andy.</span> <span id="s1129">Because of the behavior of your step parents we later understood that they would not take any action making known that during the war-time they had hidden a child.</span> <span id="s1130">Many people like them were attached to the children in their care, very understandable.</span> <span id="s1131">The family De Chot presumed that Dad and I were no longer alive.</span> <span id="s1132">We now know that in our situation regarding you that you would have then been returned to us.</span> <span id="s1133">What happened during the war too is people did get attached to their children and there were many legal cases in Holland after the war where the families who survived had to go to court to get the children back.</span> <span id="s1134">The nature of some of these cases is very telling about Dutch ethics because after the war the way people survived was through the black market.</span> <span id="s1135">There was no doubt about it, that’s how you survived.</span> <span id="s1136">My mother feels embarrassed about it.</span> <span id="s1137">She thinks it’s shameful.</span> <span id="s1138">She prefers I not saying anything about it but the fact is that’s how people survived.</span> <span id="s1139">Gentile families who did not want to return their Jewish children would often use that as an argument why the parents were not responsible parents and could not have the children back and in many cases did not get the children back because of that.</span> <span id="s1140">Many of the people who hid the children also had a religious agenda.</span> <span id="s1141">They felt they needed to convert these children and it wasn’t always a self-serving sentiment.</span> <span id="s1142">It was also the sentiment of how to save the children.</span> <span id="s1143">To convert them would be to save them, so it was mixed.</span> <span id="s1144">The reason there was a high percentage of Dutch Jewish children who were able to go underground was because to save the people of the Book would be considered a mitzvah.</span> <span id="s1145">The Jews were known as the people of the Book and for many of the Protestants in Holland they took their bible literally, it’s interesting.</span> <span id="s1146">With Andy it would have turned out differently because his parents were no longer alive.</span> <span id="s1147">More about that later.</span> <span id="s1148">Dad didn’t want to wait any more while the information just dribbled in and as I said went out on his own.</span> <span id="s1149">After enquiring he found out where to go to the military authorities and get a special pass that allowed him to hitch rides on military transport.</span> <span id="s1150">There was no other transport at the time.</span> <span id="s1151">You didn’t have buses, you didn’t have subways, you didn’t have zip.</span> <span id="s1152">This meant only army vehicles.</span> <span id="s1153">The fact is there simply wasn’t any other transport yet.</span> <span id="s1154">Still this meant quite a bit.</span> <span id="s1155">Again Dad left the house with nothing but a little money for necessities which themselves weren’t easy to buy.</span> <span id="s1156">The military authorities gave Dad very good advice.</span> <span id="s1157">The told him he must begin his search north of the rivers because Holland is in the middle divided by a bunch of rivers.</span> <span id="s1158">Because there was known that in the province Overeisel there were children who had been bought for hiding so the story goes light haired children above the rivers which wasn’t true of you at all.</span> <span id="s1159">What Celene is talking about is that the people who hid children during the war had a policy that dark haired Jewish children would go to the south of Holland where most of the people were Catholic and were darker and the lighter skinned, lighter haired Jewish people would go to the north because there were Protestants who were lighter.</span> <span id="s1160">So Dad began with the purpose in front of his eyes, good or bad from one empty army truck or another finally ending up in the city of Naivadol in Overeisel.</span> <span id="s1161">We had never heard of this place before.</span> <span id="s1162">Once in Naivadol Dad immediately went to City Hall.</span> <span id="s1163">There he spoke to several bureaucrats.</span> <span id="s1164">One of them, Mr. Bucker, sent Dad on the way to Mrs. De Fries Andy’s foster mother on the large street in Naivadol.</span> <span id="s1165">The man knew that there was a young boy that had been hidden.</span> <span id="s1166">When he arrived at Mrs. De Fries’s home Dad was allowed in and saw to his stunned surprise a little boy of whom he though thought this could well be Andy, his nephew.</span> <span id="s1167">He had the family face and the age was also right.</span> <span id="s1168">Dad spoke with Mrs. De Fries.</span> <span id="s1169">He explained his relationship telling her his name which at the moment was unknown to her.</span> <span id="s1170">After a while and for different reasons she understood that Dad was the brother of the mother of this child who she had taken over under her protection and who she was very fond of.</span> <span id="s1171">Dad was very lucky to have found Andy.</span> <span id="s1172">For Mrs. De Fries this was not a happy day.</span> <span id="s1173">Dad could see that it would not be easy to get Andy from her but that’s a tale apart.</span> <span id="s1174">It got to be late in the day and thus Dad was invited to supper and slept there.</span> <span id="s1175">The few hours that were left Dad played with Andy.</span> <span id="s1176">Andy sat on Dad’s lap and began to play with his ear lobe.</span> <span id="s1177">This was a habit that Dad’s younger brother Yope one out of eight brothers and sisters always did as a little kid.</span> <span id="s1178">Mr. Bucker from City Hall also knew to tell Dad that a few kilometers between Naivadol and the town of Chaino stood an old small farm where there was also a young boy brought underground.</span> <span id="s1179">He suggested that Dad should check this farm out because that in any event he left Mrs. De Fries and planned to return for Andy.</span> <span id="s1180">She actually didn’t give Dad any indication that she understood that she had to be separated from Andy at some point in the future.</span> <span id="s1181">Dad departed from Andy with mixed feelings from this complicated situation.</span> <span id="s1182">It was early in the morning when Dad continued his search for you.</span> <span id="s1183">He had to travel the long kilometers on foot.</span> <span id="s1184">He often said to me how he walked and walked and in the evening dead tired arrived somewhere on the side of a road in the village of Chaino.</span> <span id="s1185">He rang the bell of the farm.</span> <span id="s1186">It was already dark and about ten o’clock.</span> <span id="s1187">He waited for someone to answer the door which didn’t happen right away.</span> <span id="s1188">They were people who were used to going to bed early and they were by then fast asleep.</span> <span id="s1189">Dad kept ringing the bell and finally a man stuck his head out of the attic window and asked what was going on.</span> <span id="s1190">In the hope that the sound of a child crying was your crying Dad screwed up his courage to begin a conversation with this man.</span> <span id="s1191">He told the man who he was and why he had come.</span> <span id="s1192">They didn’t plan to open the door right away answering Dad.</span> <span id="s1193">The child’s parents died and that’s why we took him through the intervention of our pastor.</span> <span id="s1194">At this point Dad asked to be let in, in any case.</span> <span id="s1195">He wanted them to know who he was by comparing something he had with him.</span> <span id="s1196">Oh I guess from reading this I see that they brought me to him that evening.</span> <span id="s1197">I thought that he slept over.</span> <span id="s1198">Dad was allowed in and right away showed the man a lamb’s wool baby shirt because a similar one had been left with the baby boy when he was sent underground.</span> <span id="s1199">This was from the lamb’s wool bathing suit that they had made.</span> <span id="s1200">The organization that provided contact with underground hiding places had told the family to save it in case the child had to be brought to another place.</span> <span id="s1201">Luckily in your situation this advice was heeded.</span> <span id="s1202">After comparing the two pieces this was evidence enough that the truth was being spoken here.</span> <span id="s1203">Only then did they bring you forth, a crying young boy of about two years old.</span> <span id="s1204">Dad saw in the blink of an eye that it was his son.</span> <span id="s1205">What a moment it must have been.</span> <span id="s1206">It was and is to value how these people didn’t clam up but in one night were made 100% certain before believing something of the parental bond that was being talked about here.</span> <span id="s1207">This is understandable.</span> <span id="s1208">Here I could write some things but that I won’t and don’t want to.</span> <span id="s1209">I’ll leave that to imagination.</span> <span id="s1210">The truth is I don’t know what she’s talking about here and I’d really be curious.</span> <span id="s1211">What Dad told me about this after he took you in his arms that is not to be described except by Dad himself.</span> <span id="s1212">And so that was the first contact for Dad with the family who played a large role in your and our lives.</span> <span id="s1213">After an emotional discussion Dad was allowed to sleep there overnight.</span> <span id="s1214">You and the family slept upstairs while Dad was given a hay mattress and a small room downstairs.</span> <span id="s1215">From everything that Dad could see these people were very simple farmers, in fact poor people who notwithstanding the poverty knew how to hold themselves together.</span> <span id="s1216">The family consisted of a sixty five year old man who looked like he was eighty.</span> <span id="s1217">His wife who was also in her sixties wore a wig which was very unusual in those years.</span> <span id="s1218">They had an unmarried son who was about twenty eight years old who could be mistaken for forty and an unmarried young daughter.</span> <span id="s1219">When I saw them later I could see that they were a very stiff but decent people.</span> <span id="s1220">When she says stiff she means that they were Dutch Reformed, very conservative.</span> <span id="s1221">The people were as good for you as they could be because with them there was also great hunger which was readily apparent.</span> <span id="s1222">They had one horse and a few chickens left over.</span> <span id="s1223">The woman told Dad that her man still had to work on the land for other farmers.</span> <span id="s1224">For this he would every day get a plate of oatmeal and once in a while an egg.</span> <span id="s1225">You Jack, would sit by him and he would share his oatmeal and egg with you.</span> <span id="s1226">Mrs. De Chot told how she took apart one of her bedspreads and used the thread to make a coverall for you because all of your clothes were too small.</span> <span id="s1227">She also said she cut the tips of your shoes off so that they would still fit.</span> <span id="s1228">(Laughter) Remarkable.</span> <span id="s1229">You know I haven’t read this in a few years.</span> <span id="s1230">This can be seen from a photo that she made of you, her son and herself.</span> <span id="s1231">When I look at the photo and when I had first seen it I had the impression that she had made this coverall for the occasion of the photograph for which she derived great pleasure.</span> <span id="s1232">I’ve never seen this photo.</span> <span id="s1233">Not knowing that she would have to give you up.</span> <span id="s1234">Later at our first meeting she said that she never would have given you up had it not been your real parents who claimed you.</span> <span id="s1235">She had planned to have you baptized but our appearance had prevented this.</span> <span id="s1236">Too bad I would have been covered there too.</span> <span id="s1237">There was no doubt at all that these people were very fond of you and the son played the role of father even more so than the older man.</span> <span id="s1238">This became quite clear later on.</span> <span id="s1239">The family came out of a Reform Protestant background.</span> <span id="s1240">They were very formal and lived just like Mrs. De Fries with her bible on the table.</span> <span id="s1241">Almost everybody in Overeisel lived like this.</span> <span id="s1242">I just want to interrupt this reading by saying something that I have found out in the last half a year that there was in fact a group in Holland, there was a group of young people, 17, 18, 19, 20 who were instrumental in providing hiding places for Jewish children like myself and this group was called the NV which literally translated means the unknown holding company, the anonymous holding company which is a wonderful surrealistic title I think.</span> <span id="s1243">And my cousin Yanika from California has been receiving this information and recently sent me an article about an older man who is very pivotal in this group who was captured and killed and in the article there is a list of children’s names of their name, the date they were born and where they were hidden and my name is in there and I saw it and it was a remarkable experience to get this.</span> <span id="s1244">I called my cousin Yanika and I said to her I got this, this is wonderful.</span> <span id="s1245">And she says to me what did you feel like when you saw your name?</span> <span id="s1246">And I said well the truth is I felt wonderful.</span> <span id="s1247">It confirms all these things and I said and how did you feel and she said well I wept and I wept and I wept.</span> <span id="s1248">She is 57 so she’s older than me and she remembers our grandparents.</span> <span id="s1249">She remembers going out every day when she was hidden underground waiting for her parents to come back so she has that experience.</span> <span id="s1250">But for me it was a remarkable experience to see my name Isaac Trompettor and then Overeisel which is the province where I was and then a question mark next to Overeisel that may mean we don’t know where in Overeisel.</span> <span id="s1251">It was a stunning experience for me to see that and it was all the result of me spending the last years of searching this out.</span> <span id="s1252">I know my parents were very resistant to that for a long time and I feel very vindicated that I pursued this and stayed with it, that I got this.</span> <span id="s1253">It’s very important to me.</span> <span id="s1254">I would emphatically encourage other people who have similar or like stories to do that.</span> <span id="s1255">When you do find out real documented pieces of what you’ve always heard in your family it’s emotionally very fulfilling and powerful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: I imagine.</span> <span id="s1257">Do you want to choose maybe one or two more things to read.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">A?</span> <span id="s1259">Sure.</span> <span id="s1260">I’ll just read this last page.</span> <span id="s1261">In the few days that it was necessary for Dad to stay there, there was so much conversation from which Dad had heard that in the beginning there was also another young boy about twelve years old who they also hid.</span> <span id="s1262">Mrs. De Chot had noticed that when she was away and came home to you, you were crying and the young boy had frightened you and the crying got worse instead of better.</span> <span id="s1263">It turned out that he would light the stove and put me head first into the stove, this boy.</span> <span id="s1264">I’d rather not believe it but it was enough for them to bring this boy somewhere else because they wanted to keep you.</span> <span id="s1265">So I can imagine seeing this other young Jewish kid who was out of his mind and took it out on me.</span> <span id="s1266">He had to go somewhere else and who knows what happened to this boy.</span> <span id="s1267">I think this accounts for some of my having a nervous breakdown after the war, being fricasseed.</span> <span id="s1268">Now it was time for Dad to figure out how to come home.</span> <span id="s1269">He knew that I didn’t know what was going on nor did he have an opportunity to inform me.</span> <span id="s1270">You know there were no phones then that were working.</span> <span id="s1271">The next morning Dad went to the church, spoke with the pastor.</span> <span id="s1272">What Dad told him was sufficient enough for Dad to take you without any official authorization.</span> <span id="s1273">The church had a lot of influence with people.</span> <span id="s1274">You could go to the church and make it clear to them you were the parent and the church would go to the people and talk to them and convince them.</span> <span id="s1275">From there we went to the local military authority who provided him with a transportation pass so that when transport went south both of you could go on it.</span> <span id="s1276">It took four That's_my_Mom.</span> <span id="s1277">jpgThat's_my_Mom.</span> <span id="s1278">jpgdays before an empty truck came your way.</span> <span id="s1279">Those four days were actually very necessary because you two got to know each other.</span> <span id="s1280">The morning when the truck arrived Dad and you left for Tilburg promising the De Chots to keep in touch and he would let them know how you were doing.</span> <span id="s1281">Naturally we kept our word.</span> <span id="s1282">We did.</span> <span id="s1283">We were in touch and visited those people up until we went to America.</span> <span id="s1284">It was also the time at least according to my parents that they got to be very pushy and obnoxious about wanting to convert me.</span> <span id="s1285">I suspect that this was not entirely so and maybe what my parents had to flush out in order to make the necessary separation from these

took, you sat in your wet pants on his lap and he got wet, too.</span> <span id="s1288">You also cried often during the trip.</span> <span id="s1289">How could it be otherwise sitting in the back for hours with the feeling of wet pants, no food or drink, as well as the crowding of many other people around you.</span> <span id="s1290">While you possibly had been so used to the quiet all of a sudden such a huge change.</span> <span id="s1291">I have often thought about this especially if I had been the one to carry you instead of Dad.</span> <span id="s1292">I have also often thought about how I would have felt if I had been the one to see you first at the De Chots.</span> <span id="s1293">To understand that I could see you in front of me to spoil you and take you with me.</span> <span id="s1294">What would that have felt like?</span> <span id="s1295">This will always be a question.</span> <span id="s1296">The other question that should always be a question and unfortunately didn’t get addressed in our family was what was it like for me to be adopted by my parents.</span> <span id="s1297">Powerful stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: Indeed, well I thank you
