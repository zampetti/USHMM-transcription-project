I was born June 27th, 1925, in a small town in northern Germany not far from Hamburg.</span> <span id="s5">And as a small child, when I was a small child, my family moved to Berlin where I grew up and went to school.</span> <span id="s6">My family was, I would call middle class Jewish Orthodox.</span> <span id="s7">My father was an employee for a big concern that did sales and buying for other outfits.</span> <span id="s8">I started school in a German public school, until Hitler came to power.</span> <span id="s9">And during the first year of Hitler's power I changed over to a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s10">Anything else?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">AS: O.K. Do you remember anything specific about the first school that you went to, at the public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">GA: Well, I think I attended two grades, first and second grade, in the public school.</span> <span id="s13">I had a few non-Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s14">I can't say that I met with any antisemitism during that time.</span> <span id="s15">Of course, the minute Hitler came to power, these friendships were ended, and I became an outcast.</span> <span id="s16">The only thing I do remember is that religion being a state mandated subject in public school, I was excluded from religious classes.</span> <span id="s17">But not because I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s18">More because I wasn't a Protestant.</span> <span id="s19">That's about it, anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">AS: O.K., you said your family was Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">GA: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">AS: Did you belong to a synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">GA: Yes, we belonged to a synagogue ever since I can remember.</span> <span id="s24">We went fairly regularly to an Orthodox synagogue, a large congregation.</span> <span id="s25">I even became bar mitzvahed at that synagogue in 1938.</span> <span id="s26">That synagogue was destroyed during the infamous Crystal Night, between the 9th and 10th of November, 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">AS: O.K.</span> <span id="s28">Did your family belong to any other Jewish organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">GA: I think my father belonged to B'nai B'rith lodge in Berlin.</span> <span id="s30">I remember as a child having gone to some of the functions in that lodge for children.</span> <span id="s31">I don't think I was a guest.</span> <span id="s32">I think because my father belonged there.</span> <span id="s33">But I don't remember any other.</span> <span id="s34">My father was not politically active.</span> <span id="s35">I don't even know whether before Hitler he was very active in anything else that didn't pertain to his job.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">AS: O.K.</span> <span id="s37">Did your father or any other men serve in the national army?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">GA: Yes, my father was, like any other good German, a soldier during the First World War.</span> <span id="s39">He was an officer, and had been decorated.</span> <span id="s40">He was wounded during that time.</span> <span id="s41">He had been decorated with the Iron Cross First Class, which helped us until later times.</span> <span id="s42">But I'll come back to that when you ask that particular question.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">AS: O.K.</span> <span id="s44">So your father was in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">GA: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">AS: And it helped you later.</span> <span id="s47">O.K., you said that you didn't really experience any antisemitism before Hitler.</span> <span id="s48">How about anyone else in your family?</span> <span id="s49">Do you remember any stories about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">GA: No, I can't say.</span> <span id="s51">You see, I grew up in Berlin, and Berlin, if you know any thing about it, was actually called "The Red Capital of Germany."</span> <span id="s52">Although the Berliners became very pro-Hitler in later times, but in the beginning they took him with a grain of salt, and were not very enthusiastic about him, especially the working class people.</span> <span id="s53">Actually, I can say that if my parents felt any antisemitism, it never was mentioned in our family.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">AS: O.K, do you remember how you and members of your family reacted to Hitler's appointment as Chancellor, in January, 1933?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">GA: No, I can't really say.</span> <span id="s56">Although I would assume....My father lost his position about three months after Hitler came to power, and he was without any employment for three years.</span> <span id="s57">He was reduced to being a peddler of cigarettes during that time.</span> <span id="s58">And I found out only shortly before my father died that our family was helped by an uncle of mine who was financially well off, something that was never mentioned, and my father probably would have never even admitted to it.</span> <span id="s59">That was one of those things that I remember.</span> <span id="s60">But, I can't find any...there were no discussions or so.</span> <span id="s61">I guess I was too small at that time even to understand the importance of Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">AS: Was there any talk about leaving, in the early years?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">GA: Not in the early years, but I think after 1935, when the Nuremberg Laws came into power, there was a discussion.</span> <span id="s64">My mother was for leaving, and my father was against it.</span> <span id="s65">He, my father was afraid of cutting his roots and starting anew, in a strange land, with a strange language, and having been, for want of a better word, a pencil pusher, he had no other way of earning a living.</span> <span id="s66">And he was afraid to make a new start.</span> <span id="s67">And I remember one phrase that went through conversations, like this, "It couldn't get worse.</span> <span id="s68">It couldn't get worse."</span> <span id="s69">But it did get worse.</span> <span id="s70">[chuckles] Oh, but I know that my mother was always for leaving.</span> <span id="s71">She was always the more adventurous one, anyway.</span> <span id="s72">[chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s73">AS: And you were just basically too young to understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">GA: Well, look I knew in '35 when things already became much tougher for us...</span></p> <p><span id="s75">AS: That was...</span></p> <p><span id="s76">GA: That things were not that, but what really lay ahead of us, none of us really realized, and especially not us, we children.</span> <span id="s77">You know, we, as a child you can't fathom that.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">AS: How did things become tougher in 1935?</span> <span id="s79">That was...</span></p> <p><span id="s80">GA: Well...</span></p> <p><span id="s81">AS: After the Nuremberg Laws.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">GA: The Nuremberg Laws, for instance, I remember that my grandmother died in 1934.</span> <span id="s83">And she had a non-Jewish maid, who came to Berlin and lived with us and worked for us.</span> <span id="s84">And due to the Nuremberg Laws she had to leave our house and just couldn't work for us anymore.</span> <span id="s85">Also, police protection for Jews became unavailable.</span> <span id="s86">We had no protection in front of a court.</span> <span id="s87">The first big signs came out, "Jews Forbidden," or, "Jews Not Wanted."</span> <span id="s88">I think that even they started with restaurants and coffee houses, some movie theaters, had big signs on the doors, "Jews Not Wanted."</span> <span id="s89">We couldn't go into museums.</span> <span id="s90">Public parks had segregated benches even, where Jews sat aside from non-Jews.</span> <span id="s91">Public play grounds for kids were segregated.</span> <span id="s92">And, from '35 on, the noose started to get tighter.</span> <span id="s93">And even we kids felt it, that we get, there was like in a electric current in the air.</span> <span id="s94">And it be came, towns became much more nervous, and the whole situation, it was already, that handwriting was on the wall.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">AS: But you still didn't believe how bad things could actually get.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">GA: Well, no.</span> <span id="s97">Living among so-called civilized people, you would never dream of what would eventually happen.</span> <span id="s98">We knew that a lot of our friends and some of our relatives left Germany, especially the people that were lucky enough to have money somewheres outside of Germany.</span> <span id="s99">So, that was it, and then, but we knew also of antisemitic instances where children were beaten up by other kids, but not by, some of them, what they called the Hitlerjugend.</span> <span id="s100">The Hitler Youth became prevalent.</span> <span id="s101">I know when I came home from school I made sure that I walked on the side of the street where no kids were walking.</span> <span id="s102">And if I saw any kids in the distance I would cross over to the other side to avoid any problems.</span> <span id="s103">Although I never had any problems, but you looked over your shoulder and made sure that nobody followed you, and nobody was, and you didn't dare look at anything or anybody that you weren't supposed to, you know?</span> <span id="s104">Just not to start anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">AS: Did you have any contact with non-Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">GA: Yes.</span> <span id="s107">There were tradespeople that would still, after hours, for instance, we had a, some tradespeople that would give us potatoes or would give us milk or, I remember in the apartment house where we lived was a café and then they also had a, beer.</span> <span id="s108">Some times in the evening I would go down the back steps, and they would give us some beer to take; I mean, for money, yes.</span> <span id="s109">But there were still quite a few that would try to help.</span> <span id="s110">Yeah.</span> <span id="s111">But with kids I didn't have any more.</span> <span id="s112">No more children.</span> <span id="s113">These were all grown-ups.</span> <span id="s114">That was all, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">AS: So they...gave you milk and potatoes.</span> <span id="s116">So, in other words...</span></p> <p><span id="s117">GA: It's not like they...</span></p> <p><span id="s118">AS: You were...</span></p> <p><span id="s119">GA: Gave us food, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">AS: Having trouble getting food already.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">GA: Start, start...</span></p> <p><span id="s122">AS: Already?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">GA: Yeah, of course.</span> <span id="s124">Food and, as a whole became tougher to get in Germany, and Jews were excluded.</span> <span id="s125">Almost every week there was a notice in the paper or somewheres on a house wall, rations so and so, but Jews, maybe the half of it, or they were excluded from this and that.</span> <span id="s126">So, we did find a butcher that had some meat, and for, it was actually barter more than money.</span> <span id="s127">We had household goods that some people wanted, and we would, my mother's good bed linen, for instance, we would take to the butcher and he would give meat [chuckles] for that.</span> <span id="s128">You know?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">AS: O.K., what happened to your family during Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">GA: Well, my father was arrested, and was, it was the first time he spent, I think, two months in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s131">The rest of us were left alone, although we didn't dare go out.</span> <span id="s132">We did hear from neighbors.</span> <span id="s133">We, not far from us was the synagogue, which was set afire.</span> <span id="s134">And, there were still Jewish shops until that time, around the corner from us, which were plundered and destroyed, we heard from the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s135">And the night of the 10th one of our Jewish friends came to stay with us, because the police had looked for him, to arrest him also.</span> <span id="s136">So he tried to evade the police by coming over to our house.</span> <span id="s137">But my father was already arrested at that time.</span> <span id="s138">And we spent two months without a father.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">AS: Where exactly was he sent?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">GA: To a place called Oranienburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">AS: Can you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">GA: Well, the concentration camp is called Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s143">S-A-C-H-S-E-N-H-A-U-S-E-N, and it's, was very close to Berlin.</span> <span id="s144">And, I understand, the only uncle, no, I had two uncles left then in Frankfurt, who were both also, one was in Dachau during that time, and one was in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s145">My mother's family, I think, all the uncles and aunts were alrea-, had already left Germany at that time.</span> <span id="s146">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s147">AS: Did you have any contact with your father at this, while he was in the concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">GA: No.</span> <span id="s149">We only knew where he was because it was known that Jewish prisoners from Berlin came there.</span> <span id="s150">And once in a while, somebody was released, and brought news.</span> <span id="s151">We had a friend of the family, an old man, who used to live in the town where I was born.</span> <span id="s152">And I don't remember anymore how much later after the Crystal Night that there was a knock on the door one evening.</span> <span id="s153">An old man stood there, and my mother opened the door.</span> <span id="s154">And he said, "Don't you know me, Mrs. Adler?"</span> <span id="s155">And my mother said, "No, I don't know you."</span> <span id="s156">And he says, "I am Mr. Baum from [not clear]."</span> <span id="s157">That's the town.</span> <span id="s158">And he was together with my father.</span> <span id="s159">He was released because his family secured an affidavit to America.</span> <span id="s160">He was released with the provision that he would leave Germany within 48 hours.</span> <span id="s161">And, he brought greetings from my father, but he was too scared to tell any details.</span> <span id="s162">And, during that time, it became known, I mean, it was leaked, let's put it this way, that any Jew that secures passage out of Germany would be released.</span> <span id="s163">So my mother ran around trying to get passage, and she finally managed to book passage to Trinidad, which at that time didn't have any immigration requirements.</span> <span id="s164">Nobody knew where Trinidad was.</span> <span id="s165">And, she sent proof of this to the police, secret police, the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s166">And on account of this, my father was released, I think some time in January.</span> <span id="s167">But the whole thing fell through, because Trinidad stopped immigration of Jews.</span> <span id="s168">That was early in '39.</span> <span id="s169">And, luckily, he wasn't re-arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">AS: You said your bar mitzvah was in 1938?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">GA: Yeah, in July.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">AS: July, 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">GA: Yeah.</span> <span id="s174">Things were fairly normal at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">AS: That was, right, that was before...</span></p> <p><span id="s176">GA: But the first...deportations had already started.</span> <span id="s177">But they encompassed Jews of Polish origin and Polish nationality, who were forced to cross the border from Germany back into Poland.</span> <span id="s178">We didn't know anybody among that group, but that was the, actually the first deportation.</span> <span id="s179">And we had no idea that we would come under the same, problem.</span> <span id="s180">I understand also that Jews of some of the districts in southern Germany were arrested and sent to camps in France.</span> <span id="s181">But we didn't know about that yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">AS: What was your bar mitzvah like?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">GA: Well, my bar mitzvah was a highlight of my life until then.</span> <span id="s184">A real normal bar mitzvah, religious ceremony, an open house.</span> <span id="s185">We...you don’t know the, in Germany you didn't know the catered affairs and with the halls and that, like you have it here.</span> <span id="s186">So every family ran their own.</span> <span id="s187">But I know that weeks...my mother baked and cooked and prepared.</span> <span id="s188">And I remember that the whole apartment was, every piece of furniture that could be moved was pushed aside and we had open house afterwards.</span> <span id="s189">And we had part of the family from outside Berlin came to stay.</span> <span id="s190">It was the last time most of the family was together.</span> <span id="s191">It really was something that I will never forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">AS: O.K., do you remember if the German invasion of Poland changed anything in your family's situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">GA: [pause] Let me think back on that. '</span> <span id="s194">30, '38 I was already working.</span> <span id="s195">No, that was '39 that Polish...</span></p> <p><span id="s196">AS: September.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">GA: September.</span> <span id="s198">The Jewish schools in Berlin were closed in '38.</span> <span id="s199">I believe that I still was in Berlin when that happened.</span> <span id="s200">It didn't change anything for the family, except tension grew worse, probably.</span> <span id="s201">The propaganda against Jews increased tremendously from the Crystal Night on, until the End Solution that, I mean, the Jew was blamed for everything and anything.</span> <span id="s202">We were already used to the hour-long speeches by the Nazi bigwigs, blaming Jews for every little ill that befell Germany, and what have you.</span> <span id="s203">So, we probably became more home bound than before.</span> <span id="s204">But I know my father had a job again in 1938-39.</span> <span id="s205">He worked for the Jewish Community Council of Berlin at that time.</span> <span id="s206">But, and both my brother and I didn't go to school, and I imagine a few weeks after the beginning of the war I started to work on what they call Hachsharah (training for aliyah, immigration to Palestine), in, not far from Hamburg.</span> <span id="s207">And I stayed on, we stayed on that, on one place a few weeks then it became, the Germans took it over, took it away, and we were moved to another farm.</span> <span id="s208">And I stayed there two years.</span> <span id="s209">And I finally went back to Berlin with my family in 1941, the fall of 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">AS: Do you remember how your family supported itself the first time your father was initially sent away?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">GA: Well, I guess from, first of all, I imagine that my uncle still sent money.</span> <span id="s212">If, and then, whatever was there, you know?</span> <span id="s213">I had a maiden aunt who had a housekeeper's job in Berlin, who would drop by the house very often, and I know she would bring some food or, and we were never big spenders.</span> <span id="s214">I imagine that there were savings that helped us through the times.</span> <span id="s215">It was a matter of two months.</span> <span id="s216">And on top of this my mother had enough money, apparently, to book passage to Trinidad.</span> <span id="s217">So they must have gone into their savings.</span> <span id="s218">At that time the Germans didn't confiscate the Jewish savings accounts yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">AS: O.K., what exactly was Hachsharah?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">GA: Hachsharah was supposed to be a schooling for settlement in Palestine.</span> <span id="s221">We were supposed to have learned anything that had to do with farming, animal husbandry.</span> <span id="s222">And, except at that time, immigration to Palestine already had ceased.</span> <span id="s223">There were a few illegal transports still being assembled.</span> <span id="s224">But more or less it was a ruse to get away from forced labor.</span> <span id="s225">Except it became then forced labor a little while later, anyway.</span> <span id="s226">But it was a community of young people led by some adults, and we were supposed to learn Hebrew, and, run by the Zionist organizations in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">AS: O.K., so exactly when were you deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">GA: I was deported in 1943, I think it was February of 1943.</span> <span id="s229">At that time, I wasn't employed.</span> <span id="s230">When I came back to Berlin from Hachsharah, I was employed in a factory that made fluorescent lamps and light bulbs, one of the monopolies in Germany.</span> <span id="s231">And in the fall of, I guess it was '42, on a Saturday, all through Berlin, a concerted action.</span> <span id="s232">All Jews were arrested at their work places, and were brought in to large places for, we were brought into a large synagogue.</span> <span id="s233">And for some reason or other, I wasn't sent on transport to the east.</span> <span id="s234">Most of these people were sent on transport.</span> <span id="s235">And I was allowed to return home that night.</span> <span id="s236">After having anxiously awaited there.</span> <span id="s237">And I was, and then in '43, on a Friday night...</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s239">AS: Mr. Gerald Adler, March 21st, 1985.</span> <span id="s240">[tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s241">GA: And now comes in something I told you at the beginning, that my father was a decorated veteran.</span> <span id="s242">That saved us at that particular time from being sent what they called to the East, somewheres into Poland or Lithuania, to Riga.</span> <span id="s243">Instead, our whole family was sent to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s244">While in the, while waiting for the transport to Theresienstadt, I contracted diphtheria and was separated from the family and put into the Jewish hospital.</span> <span id="s245">But somehow or other, my father managed to elicit a promise from the authorities there that I would be sent on to Theresienstadt when I recuperated.</span> <span id="s246">And I was sent to Theresienstadt two months later.</span> <span id="s247">And I stayed in Theresienstadt until August of that same year, and I was sent with a small work party back into Germany to a small town called Wulkow, W-U-L-K-O-W.</span> <span id="s248">And our job was to build a barracks town for higher-ups in the, probably in the Gestapo, as a refuge from the bombing attacks on Berlin.</span> <span id="s249">That project was never finished.</span> <span id="s250">It was still unfinished when the Russians came.</span> <span id="s251">They must have had a field day there!</span> <span id="s252">[chuckles] And then I came back to Theresienstadt in January, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">AS: O.K.</span> <span id="s254">What was your treatment like in the Jewish hospital before Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">GA: Oh, well, it was, let's put it this way, it was cordial.</span> <span id="s256">Food was scarce, but medical attention was good.</span> <span id="s257">I can't, except that we weren't allowed to leave the floor that we were on.</span> <span id="s258">We were behind locked doors.</span> <span id="s259">We, having been a prisoner already, it was like a prison ward.</span> <span id="s260">But I, as far as I remember there was nothing to worry about.</span> <span id="s261">In fact, probably people tried to stay there as long as they could!</span> <span id="s262">[chuckling] But, there was “house cleaning” at that Jewish hospital almost every two weeks.</span> <span id="s263">Whoever could walk or some, and the worst part was always that nurses would disappear, doctors would disappear, patients, and then the heart-rending thing was to see small babies as part of this group that was assembled.</span> <span id="s264">And young nurses, most of them late teenagers or early 20s, having two or three little newborns in their care, to take on to Poland or, wherever.</span> <span id="s265">It was heart-rending.</span> <span id="s266">And families being ripped apart because some members were arrested before, some were left behind, and it was very, very hard at that time already, before we even knew what was going on in the other camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">AS: Who exactly was running the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">GA: [pause] I couldn't say for sure.</span> <span id="s269">I know that the Jewish Community of Berlin, or the Council, Jewish Community Council of Berlin, was still a shadow government for Jews, supervised by the Gestapo and the various instances of the political government.</span> <span id="s270">But, actually they took orders, and then they ran whatever they had to run according to these orders, that the Nazis were never really directly involved.</span> <span id="s271">And you will even hear, except maybe for the large concentration camps, a place like Theresienstadt was run by a Jewish Community Council, under supervision by a group of S.S. officers.</span> <span id="s272">But except for the selection to the, to some of the transports East, the S.S. stayed out of the day-to-day running of the camp.</span> <span id="s273">And so it was with the Jewish institution in Berlin.</span> <span id="s274">Whatever that was done was done by Jews at the orders of the Nazis.</span> <span id="s275">So I imagine that this Jewish hospital was run by a Jewish administration.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">AS: What was your transport like to Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">GA: Well, the funny part was that we were actually transported in regular German passenger cars.</span> <span id="s278">We were part of a train that went south to a town called Dresden.</span> <span id="s279">And there we were uncoupled from the regular train, and, I imagine, I think that we were then just sent into Theresienstadt, just a few cars that had Jews on them.</span> <span id="s280">Don't forget, at that time, when I left, there weren't too many going to Theresienstadt any more.</span> <span id="s281">There weren't that many Jews left in Berlin, and certainly the number of people going to Theresienstadt was small.</span> <span id="s282">So the transports were not large, and they left Berlin every two to three weeks.</span> <span id="s283">They would collect who they could collect, and then send them off as fast as possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">AS: O.K.</span> <span id="s285">You were with your whole family in Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">GA: For the beginning, yeah.</span> <span id="s287">As long as I stayed in Theresienstadt, yes.</span> <span id="s288">And, what I didn't know, my family actually acted as hostages for me while I was sent away from Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s289">They told them that.</span> <span id="s290">They didn't tell us that, because we weren't in a regular concentration camp.</span> <span id="s291">We were, we could have fled.</span> <span id="s292">I mean there were a few chances of escape from that camp which failed, but we could have.</span> <span id="s293">Oh, but they kept our families in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s294">[tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s295">AS: O.K., so after Ther-, so what was Theresienstadt like?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">GA: Theresienstadt was an overcrowded town, surrounded by, I got, I don't know how high, a wall.</span> <span id="s297">It was a fortress, a former fortress.</span> <span id="s298">And wherever you looked, people were sometimes 20 to a room, in a small room.</span> <span id="s299">And houses were, every room in a house was, for instance converted into rooms, with bunk beds.</span> <span id="s300">Attics were used to house people.</span> <span id="s301">We would actually sleep one next to the other.</span> <span id="s302">There was no living space.</span> <span id="s303">If you had any belongings, they were shoved under your bed.</span> <span id="s304">We lived on wooden, it's not even, I couldn't even call it a bed, some contraption that was put together by the carpenters, and everybody had a large bag filled with straw as a mattress.</span> <span id="s305">And you brought your own blankets along.</span> <span id="s306">There were, I don't know if we had sheets, or blanket covers.</span> <span id="s307">If you were lucky, you had a pillow.</span> <span id="s308">But sometimes people used their clothing for pillows, you know?</span> <span id="s309">Then the worst part of Theresienstadt was....</span> <span id="s310">When I came to Theresienstadt it was infested by lice and fleas, something I had never known before in my life.</span> <span id="s311">So, I think that was the biggest problem.</span> <span id="s312">And then, of course, hunger started.</span> <span id="s313">Because while in Berlin, we managed to scrape together some food.</span> <span id="s314">Never very hungry.</span> <span id="s315">I remember the last Passover that we had, my mother was able to get potatoes.</span> <span id="s316">And we had a whole meal with different things made out of potatoes, starting from soup to dessert, that she was wonderful at making things.</span> <span id="s317">Really hungry we were never in Berlin.</span> <span id="s318">But then in Theresienstadt hunger started, because we were rationed like everybody else.</span> <span id="s319">If you were lucky to be hard laborers, your ration was a little bigger.</span> <span id="s320">But if you just performed regular manual labor, and very often meals were cut out.</span> <span id="s321">You would go sometimes a whole day with just a cup of Ersatz [substitute] coffee, from morning till night.</span> <span id="s322">You had a ration of a half a pound of bread for three days, every three days.</span> <span id="s323">We would get a small square of margarine once in a while.</span> <span id="s324">If you were lucky maybe an ounce of sugar.</span> <span id="s325">Very few times they had some tins with liverwurst or something like that.</span> <span id="s326">But we were hungry.</span> <span id="s327">And, when you're hungry, your mentality becomes completely different.</span> <span id="s328">You, all you think about is food.</span> <span id="s329">An interesting thing, and a psychologist probably would be able to tell you more about it.</span> <span id="s330">Everybody in Theresienstadt became a cook.</span> <span id="s331">And they would dream up the most elegant meals.</span> <span id="s332">And one tried to outdo the other in the dreaming up meals.</span> <span id="s333">[chuckles] It became an obsession.</span> <span id="s334">And then, of course, the scrounging for food, you know, through the garbage cans.</span> <span id="s335">Or, if a, let's say if a transport of potatoes would come in, people would try to steal from them, and many people would take their lives in their hands, just to smuggle food from outside.</span> <span id="s336">People that worked outside of Theresienstadt would try to bring stuff in, and it became all a way of life, looking for food.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">AS: What was the daily routine like?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">GA: Well, of course I can give you, can't give you the times any more.</span> <span id="s339">We'd get up very early in the morning.</span> <span id="s340">First thing is try to clean out the fleas from your blankets [chuckles] and, if you had a chance, to wash yourself.</span> <span id="s341">Clean up.</span> <span id="s342">You were already designated to be a certain time in a certain spot to go to work.</span> <span id="s343">If there was any food available, you would stay, stand in line, maybe for a cup of coffee and a slice of bread, if you had it, or just for a cup of coffee.</span> <span id="s344">Many people didn't even bother with the cup of coffee, because there was no nourishment in it.</span> <span id="s345">You would work.</span> <span id="s346">If you worked in Theresienstadt proper, you would break for lunch, I don't remember anymore how long.</span> <span id="s347">Sometimes you would get your warm meal during lunch time.</span> <span id="s348">Most of the times you wouldn't.</span> <span id="s349">We could maybe get a cup of coffee, hot coffee.</span> <span id="s350">If you worked outside of Theresienstadt, you went hungry, and your food was either reserved until you came back at night, or you just forewent the meal.</span> <span id="s351">Then you worked until late in the afternoon or evening.</span> <span id="s352">And before you even washed up, you stood in line for your dinner, if there was dinner that particular day.</span> <span id="s353">You went to your room and tried to clean up or straighten up.</span> <span id="s354">Now, a marvelous thing went on there.</span> <span id="s355">There was still a cultural life in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s356">There were a lot of artists, all kinds.</span> <span id="s357">We had a theater.</span> <span id="s358">We had a orchestra.</span> <span id="s359">We had poets that would read poetry, write and read poetry.</span> <span id="s360">We had other artists.</span> <span id="s361">We had people that would run lectures.</span> <span id="s362">There was a diversification.</span> <span id="s363">We could go places at night, try forget for an hour about your misery, and partake in some cultural program.</span> <span id="s364">A lot of people took advantage of that.</span> <span id="s365">But for the elderly it was a different ball game.</span> <span id="s366">Because of their unproductivity, they were the lowest when it comes to feeding.</span> <span id="s367">So most of them died off from hunger.</span> <span id="s368">And another phenomenon that I came across was that a lot of elderly people saved food, thinking that at a later time their families would join them.</span> <span id="s369">And to save them from starvation, they would save their food and rather go hungry, and feed then the families.</span> <span id="s370">And you had very often people that just died of malnutrition there, the elderly.</span> <span id="s371">Sickness, all kinds of sicknesses that are connected with hunger.</span> <span id="s372">But, and then the, there were the periodic transports out of Theresienstadt that everybody feared, you know?</span> <span id="s373">And that was always hanging like the sword of Damocles over your head.</span> <span id="s374">And then would the order come to get 5,000, 6,000, 10,000 people together, and they would be transported somewheres to the east.</span> <span id="s375">Nobody knew where.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">AS: How many people would you say were in Theresienstadt while you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">GA: When I came to Theresienstadt, I would estimate somewheres around 85 to 90,000 people were there already.</span> <span id="s378">And when I came back the second time, they had cleaned out the ghetto to about 17,000.</span> <span id="s379">Everybody else went, from what we know now, to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s380">But that happened when I was gone, during the time when I was gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">AS: O.K. exactly what kind of work did you do in Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">GA: I was a general worker.</span> <span id="s383">I was one of the carters that were put into all kinds of work, mostly cleaning.</span> <span id="s384">Once in a while I worked on a farm, pushing carts.</span> <span id="s385">Transportation, I was involved for a short time with collecting dead people and taking them to the crematoria.</span> <span id="s386">But mostly was pick and shovel work, and cleaning rooms.</span> <span id="s387">I learned how to sweep streets, and clean, and clean, and clean.</span> <span id="s388">Because when it rained it was one big, big mess in that time.</span> <span id="s389">It wasn't, nothing skilled, nothing skilled.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">AS: How did the members of the Jewish Council act?</span> <span id="s391">Do you remember what they were like?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">GA: I had nothing to do with them.</span> <span id="s393">You went out of their way.</span> <span id="s394">It was the same like the army.</span> <span id="s395">Don't volunteer for anything, and in fact, try to disappear in the crowd.</span> <span id="s396">They say that some members of the Jewish Council were very humane and tried to alleviate the suffering, and others misused their position to the utmost.</span> <span id="s397">I understand that even one top member of the Jewish Council was after the war prosecuted for collaboration with the Germans.</span> <span id="s398">But whether that's true or just hearsay, I don't know for sure.</span> <span id="s399">We had several different councils.</span> <span id="s400">Whenever the S.S., the group that supervised the camp, changed, a different council would be [chuckles] put up.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">AS: What happened to people who tried to escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">GA: Again this is only hearsay.</span> <span id="s403">I understand that there were instances where people that tried to escape were hanged in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s404">But, more often than not, and I had never been a witness from, of that, but more than that, these people were automatically put in a jail, and were automatically on a transport list to the east.</span> <span id="s405">In fact, anybody that had, did anything against the million regulations that covered the camp, the life there, was put on the list.</span> <span id="s406">That was your punishment.</span> <span id="s407">And you knew it.</span> <span id="s408">You knew it.</span> <span id="s409">It was automatic.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">AS: O.K., but you didn't really know exactly where people were being sent when they were put on the list.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">GA: No, that, see, the funny part is, all through these years of camp, until, I would say the, February of 1945 or March, 1945, we had no idea what went on around us, in other camps.</span> <span id="s412">Near Theresienstadt was a small other fortress, which was also a concentration camp, but not only for Jews.</span> <span id="s413">And we heard a lot of horror stories about that.</span> <span id="s414">But, nobody ever came back to tell, until the, towards the end of the war when all those groups from the concentration camps that were overrun by either the, mostly Russians, were evacuated and moved.</span> <span id="s415">And we became suddenly a camp having 60 or 65,000 people again.</span> <span id="s416">And I would say at least 60 percent people from Auschwitz, Gross Rosen, other camps were marched west, away from the Russians.</span> <span id="s417">Then we found out what went on.</span> <span id="s418">We had no idea.</span> <span id="s419">We were told that the people that left Theresienstadt went, were sent to work, to work camps.</span> <span id="s420">And very often if a husband was on the list, the wife would volunteer to go along, a wife's [not clear].</span> <span id="s421">Well...</span></p> <p><span id="s422">AS: So it wasn't actually until 1945 already that you heard...</span></p> <p><span id="s423">GA: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">AS: That Jews were being murdered or gassed?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">GA: We...never heard the word Auschwitz, never heard it.</span> <span id="s426">We knew of other ghettos, because before we left Berlin, for instance, friends of ours disappeared.</span> <span id="s427">And then once in a while we would get a card from a place in Poland called Lodz, which was L'vov, [incorrect: Lodz is in Poland, Lvov in Russia.</span> <span id="s428">Ghetto was in Lodz.]</span> <span id="s429">I think they call it in Polish, which was a large ghetto.</span> <span id="s430">We heard from Riga.</span> <span id="s431">But, these were cards that were already pre-written or pre-printed, and only signed by those who went.</span> <span id="s432">It said, "We are well, and we are working."</span> <span id="s433">And, you know, just to close our eyes to....</span> <span id="s434">We had a friend, a non-German, who served 1938 in the German Army in Poland, and was wounded, came back to Berlin, and told us about horror stories what happened to Jews in Poland.</span> <span id="s435">And nobody believed him.</span> <span id="s436">He was declared crazy, insane, shell-shocked, because the things were so horrible that you couldn't imagine that anybody, any human could do that to another human.</span> <span id="s437">So, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">AS: O.K., you mentioned that there was, there were a lot of artisans in Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">GA: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">AS: Was there any education there for children?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">GA: Yes, but, secretly.</span> <span id="s442">Officially it was forbidden.</span> <span id="s443">There were no schools per se, but children were still educated, secretly.</span> <span id="s444">There are books around now of poems that children wrote from Theresienstadt and I think there's a book of drawings made by children from Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s445">And so kids, unfortunately, kids didn't stay in Theresienstadt too long.</span> <span id="s446">They were so often, off they went east.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">AS: Why, because they weren't useful for working?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">GA: No, I guess the order came up from Berlin, "You got to thin out the population, and we got to get rid of them," you know?</span> <span id="s449">And of course, children, naturally not being productive, were in the transports.</span> <span id="s450">There were a lot of orphans in Theresienstadt, and kids whose parents went east before they did.</span> <span id="s451">And so, I mean, unfortunately, children were not exempt.</span> <span id="s452">And I'm sure that when they came to Auschwitz, they went into the gas immediately, because they were useless.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">AS: Were you ever aware of or in contact with any kind of resistance group?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">GA: No.</span> <span id="s455">No.</span> <span id="s456">We heard a lot of stories about what happened on the front lines, but I think 75% of that was wishful thinking, and 25%....</span> <span id="s457">There were people that had contact with other people on the outside somehow, clandestinely.</span> <span id="s458">There might have been even a radio in Theresienstadt that I don't know of.</span> <span id="s459">But when I was in Wulkow, we had a lot of so-called Aryans, German people, working along with us, or rather supervising us, like electricians, and painters and stuff like this, who would become then chummy with the group that they worked.</span> <span id="s460">They would drop news once in a while, and we would see airplane raids over Berlin, or we would see thousands of airplanes in formation flying past us.</span> <span id="s461">And so you had an idea that the war didn't go too good.</span> <span id="s462">And we knew that whenever the S.S. went crazy, something ha...</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Tape two, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s464">AS: Mr. Gerald Adler, March 21st, 1985.</span> <span id="s465">O.K., so you were telling me about Wulkow.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">GA: Yeah.</span> <span id="s467">All right.</span> <span id="s468">Now, the last thing, I think, I mentioned that the S.S. went crazy whenever there was something going on on the front lines.</span> <span id="s469">And we noticed that towards the end of the war, it happened more often, and more often, we were punished by long working hours, or by having to stand in formation for hours for no reason, and then found out afterwards that something happened.</span> <span id="s470">Somebody was killed of the Nazis, or some town was taken by the Russians, or the Americans had come closer.</span> <span id="s471">Something happened.</span> <span id="s472">But their behavior did not change.</span> <span id="s473">That's the funny part.</span> <span id="s474">You would have thought that maybe they would change, and become a little more humane, and then try to save their hides somewhat like.</span> <span id="s475">No, on the contrary, the closer it came to the end of the war, and they must have known also that the war was lost, the more bestial they became.</span> <span id="s476">And it was like a crazy dog, you know, that instead of getting better, gets worse.</span> <span id="s477">And, with very few exceptions, they were really like animals, behaved like animals.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">AS: Was everyone that was guarding you German?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">GA: I would s-, let's put it this way, the higher-ups in the S.S. were Austrian.</span> <span id="s480">The immediate guards that were stationed around the camp were Germans, until the end of the war, they all of a sudden sent us some Hungarians, some Romanians, mostly men with one leg and one arm, people that were not useful [chuckles] as a, to serve as soldiers anywheres.</span> <span id="s481">We had all kinds of difficulties even with those people, because they were volunteers [unclear].</span> <span id="s482">But, the guards were not bad, because their duty was to keep us from escaping.</span> <span id="s483">But they had really no direct contact with us.</span> <span id="s484">They stood around in the perimeter of the, from the camp, and that was it.</span> <span id="s485">It was the officers that gave commands, and came down into the camp, and did all kinds of little, nasty little things [chuckles].</span></p> <p><span id="s486">AS: Were they ever civil to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">GA: Heh, I remember one time.</span> <span id="s488">It stands out in my mind because it's so grotesque.</span> <span id="s489">I was on a crew, and there was a lot of make-work involved, let's put it this way, because if that project would have been finished, the S.S. would have also been finished, probably sent somewheres to Russia to fight the war.</span> <span id="s490">They knew it, and they made all kinds of little pieces that would keep on going there.</span> <span id="s491">Anyway we were, we had to clean up the countryside there.</span> <span id="s492">Was, we were in the middle of the woods, and one of the tasks of my group was to carry trees and put them all on one pile.</span> <span id="s493">Somehow or other, one of the trees slipped out of our hands and landed on a foot of mine, and I wrenched my foot.</span> <span id="s494">And, one of the lower officers of the S.S. happened to see it, and he took me out of the work party, and he took me home to my barracks, and he gave orders to let me rest in bed until the next day.</span> <span id="s495">And because it was so completely uncharacteristic, it sticks to my mind.</span> <span id="s496">There were some that, while they were not really friendly, they were correct enough in their behavior, you know?</span> <span id="s497">But most of them had pleasure in somehow making life miserable.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">AS: Did you have any contact with your family at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">GA: Yes.</span> <span id="s500">My family was allowed to send me packages once in a while.</span> <span id="s501">But the packages were useless because transportation was bad as it was due to the war.</span> <span id="s502">And, on top of this, the powers that be there made it a habit to let these packages sit for weeks without distributing them.</span> <span id="s503">And most of the packages had some sort of a food item in there —bread or whatever—which was spoiled.</span> <span id="s504">I mean, if you ever want to see green bread, that was green bread.</span> <span id="s505">So, but I knew at least, I saw my father's, saw my mother's handwriting on the package addressed to me.</span> <span id="s506">So I knew they were still alive somehow.</span> <span id="s507">But that was all, no mail.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">AS: O.K.</span> <span id="s509">So you mentioned that you were building barracks there?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">GA: Yeah, it was like a small town with barracks, self-sufficient, had its own generating station.</span> <span id="s511">It was all pre-fabricated.</span> <span id="s512">Actually we, all we had to do is put them together, and then paint them, and put electricity in and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s513">But, I don't know, it really came to nothing.</span> <span id="s514">It sounds ridiculous now.</span> <span id="s515">But I remember a big row that the head of the whole camp there had then, the top Nazi, had with the painters, because a shade of the rooms was lighter or darker than he wanted.</span> <span id="s516">And he made them paint those rooms over and over and over again.</span> <span id="s517">And I don't really even remember whether they ever came out to the shade he wanted.</span> <span id="s518">How often, how often did he find little faults like this.</span> <span id="s519">But like I was saying, it was like to make work, you know?</span> <span id="s520">[chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s521">AS: How many people would you say were at Wulkow?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">GA: In Wulkow we were about 200, maybe 250.</span> <span id="s523">Most of them, most of the older ones were professionals—carpenters, masons, a few engineers, some electricians—and the younger ones were used for manual labor.</span> <span id="s524">And my job—I had actually two jobs—I was permitted to mix mortar.</span> <span id="s525">Now that is a job that you really don't want, because, especially on days when there was no laying of bricks, you'd mix the mortar, and you keep it soft with whatever, with your instrument whatever you have, a tool, all day long, you gotta, it's like stirring a pot, all day long.</span> <span id="s526">Nobody comes and brings anything, takes anything.</span> <span id="s527">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s528">And then, I became an expert on manufacturing barbed wire fences.</span> <span id="s529">The wire came in single strands, and we had to run them between poles and then go up every so many inches apart.</span> <span id="s530">And every piece had to be straight.</span> <span id="s531">And sometimes you worked on the same section for three days, just trying to straighten out so it looked good.</span> <span id="s532">Interesting job, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">AS: O.K., you mentioned that you were from an Orthodox background.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">GA: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">AS: Did, do you think religion helped you get through it at any time?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">GA: [sighs]</span></p> <p><span id="s537">AS: Did you ever pray?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">GA: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">AS: Were there ever...</span></p> <p><span id="s540">GA: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">AS: Any kind of secret prayers?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">GA: Yeah, yeah there were.</span> <span id="s543">Now, I don't tell this to many people.</span> <span id="s544">It probably will go out now into the world.</span> <span id="s545">I believe in the power of prayer, especially ever since that time.</span> <span id="s546">I remember one year in Wulkow.</span> <span id="s547">Of course, we never knew the date of a particular day, because we worked seven days a week.</span> <span id="s548">We knew, if the weather was cold, it was winter, and when it was hot, it was summer.</span> <span id="s549">But we had no idea what month it was.</span> <span id="s550">Anyway, we somehow figured out when September was, or October, I don't remember anymore.</span> <span id="s551">And, there was people there of religious background.</span> <span id="s552">And we got together, and we tried to figure out when Rosh HaShanah was that particular date, year.</span> <span id="s553">And somehow we started watching the moon.</span> <span id="s554">And I still have it, I have a little pocket prayer book, which I was able to conceal in my shoe.</span> <span id="s555">I had it all through the camps with me.</span> <span id="s556">And I said prayers.</span> <span id="s557">And from the time when Rosh HaShanah was, we counted ten days, and we declared that Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s558">Whether it really was or not, it really didn't matter.</span> <span id="s559">We declared it Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s560">And that day I managed to take that prayer book in my shoe out to my work place.</span> <span id="s561">Slipped away in the morning, for ten minutes or so, and I said a few prayers.</span> <span id="s562">That day, out of nastiness, we got a very sumptuous lunch, food that we hadn't seen in years.</span> <span id="s563">And I got my lunch, but I was, didn't eat it, and kept it until the night.</span> <span id="s564">And when we got home, there was a group of S.S. men at the gate where the body searches started.</span> <span id="s565">Anybody that had food on them, they got the food.</span> <span id="s566">But they passed me by.</span> <span id="s567">I had the food in the container hidden under my coat.</span> <span id="s568">I wore a coat, and I had a, carried it, put my hand in my pocket and held on to it.</span> <span id="s569">They did not catch me.</span> <span id="s570">Somehow I got passed by the body search.</span> <span id="s571">I was able to get that food into the camp.</span> <span id="s572">And that night I..</span> <span id="s573">.</span> <span id="s574">After darkness, was the first time in three years that I didn't go to bed hungry because I had lunch, and then I got, I had my ration of dinner, and it so happened that night was a night when we got our bread ration for the next three days.</span> <span id="s575">So I had bread.</span> <span id="s576">And, I did say prayers by heart very often.</span> <span id="s577">I believe part of that is why I escaped death, or even, I believe very strongly in the power of prayer.</span> <span id="s578">But I know other people again who were probably more religious than I, rabbis and teachers and so, who perished.</span> <span id="s579">So who is to say, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">AS: Mmm hmm.</span> <span id="s581">Well, no one can say.</span> <span id="s582">Was there anyone who served sort of as a leader figure for the people either in Theresienstadt or in Wulkow?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">GA: No.</span> <span id="s584">No.</span> <span id="s585">In Theresienstadt you had quite a number of rabbis from all over Germany and Czechoslovakia, I think even some from Austria.</span> <span id="s586">And I would say every square or so had a little prayer group, little congregation, served by a rabbi as long as there were enough rabbis around.</span> <span id="s587">Maybe you could call these leaders.</span> <span id="s588">But you must understand that not all Jews in Theresienstadt were religious.</span> <span id="s589">So I couldn't say really.</span> <span id="s590">The only hope was to stay alive, somehow to get out of this without harm.</span> <span id="s591">And not knowing about the gas chambers made it a little easier, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">AS: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">GA: Now, in Wulkow definitely there was no spiritual leader.</span> <span id="s594">And there were, there was even no...need for one, because we were maybe one step higher than animals.</span> <span id="s595">You know?</span> <span id="s596">You should have seen us, dirty, ragged clothing.</span> <span id="s597">I remember I had a suit.</span> <span id="s598">Remember, we never were issued any clothing.</span> <span id="s599">Whatever we wore, we brought along when we were arrested first.</span> <span id="s600">So I had a suit, and somehow during one winter's evening I got too close to a potbelly stove.</span> <span id="s601">And the suit caught fire, my pant leg, and I burned a big hole just above the knee into the pant leg of the suit.</span> <span id="s602">And I wore that suit until I came back to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s603">And my shoes gave out.</span> <span id="s604">And we had somebody in the camp who would make a outline of your foot on a piece of wood and cut a wooden sole.</span> <span id="s605">And any piece of clothing you had—even a piece of carpet sometimes, if you were lucky to have a bag, a carpet bag—he would make you a shoe out of it, you know?</span> <span id="s606">Things like that.</span> <span id="s607">But you look closer to animals than human beings.</span> <span id="s608">Also mentally, you understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">AS: So do you think you ever questioned the meaning of life at that time?</span> <span id="s610">Or whether or not there was a God?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">GA: No.</span> <span id="s612">No.</span> <span id="s613">Didn't even think of that.</span> <span id="s614">Didn't even think of that.</span> <span id="s615">Meaning of life.</span> <span id="s616">We only knew we wanted to live.</span> <span id="s617">That was the only meaning life had for us.</span> <span id="s618">Revenge came in.</span> <span id="s619">The idea of revenge became, towards the end, when we saw already that was other prisoners being marched into Theresienstadt, and we heard what went on the outside, when I came back to, from Wulkow to Theresienstadt, they pushed us on trains.</span> <span id="s620">We would change trains quite often, because the railroad system through Germany was already very well destroyed.</span> <span id="s621">So to get us back, it took us 13 days.</span> <span id="s622">We traveled through almost all of Germany, on a very circuitous route.</span> <span id="s623">And we saw the destruction of towns and cities.</span> <span id="s624">We knew what's coming up.</span> <span id="s625">And then the idea not only of wanting to live until the end, because we knew the end was close, but the idea of revenge started coming up.</span> <span id="s626">And we made mental notes of names, and who we wanted to pay for what.</span> <span id="s627">Never worked out.</span> <span id="s628">Because those people, Theresienstadt, in, I think it was in April of 1945, was taken over by the Swiss Red Cross.</span> <span id="s629">The Germans made a deal.</span> <span id="s630">And the Nazis disappeared, and the Swiss took over administration.</span> <span id="s631">So, anybody that was connected with the camp, and even in Wulkow—once we were delivered back into Theresienstadt—those Nazis disappeared.</span> <span id="s632">Where to we don't know.</span> <span id="s633">All we could do after the war give the Allied people names.</span> <span id="s634">But we had very often no idea where they came from and what happened to them.</span> <span id="s635">Very often we couldn't even give ages, you know?</span> <span id="s636">So revenge was something very sweet in our minds but it didn't work.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">AS: So exactly when were you liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">GA: The 9th, no, 11th of May, the 11th of May.</span> <span id="s639">We were the last camp—Theresienstadt was the last camp—that was liberated.</span> <span id="s640">The Americans stopped advancing into Czechoslovakia and left it to the Russians.</span> <span id="s641">And the Russians came the night from the 9th, from the 10th to the 11th of May, 1945.</span> <span id="s642">We were waiting and waiting for them, for, for days, because we knew they had taken Prague, and we saw some bombing attacks on some of the surrounding towns that were bombed.</span> <span id="s643">Theresienstadt, we knew they were fighting already.</span> <span id="s644">We could hear it.</span> <span id="s645">But they took their good old time.</span> <span id="s646">That was the end.</span> <span id="s647">Actually the end came when the Swiss took over.</span> <span id="s648">They came with a caravan of ten-wheelers, with food and medication and doctors.</span> <span id="s649">God knows what they expected.</span> <span id="s650">Well, still, it was a ghetto.</span> <span id="s651">It wasn't a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">AS: How long would you say it took for you to recuperate physically?</span> <span id="s653">Where did you recuperate?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">GA: We stayed in Theresienstadt, from the beginning of May, as free people, until, I think our transport left in July, '45, end of July I think it was.</span> <span id="s655">We went back into Germany to the DP camp.</span> <span id="s656">First of all, Theresien-, all the Czechs were repatriated, Hungarians.</span> <span id="s657">For the German Jews, if you wanted to go back to the town where you came from, they didn't put anything into your way, but the idea of DP camps was created a little later.</span> <span id="s658">And my folks had no desire to go back to Berlin.</span> <span id="s659">We wanted to get out of Germany as fast as possible.</span> <span id="s660">We had already contact right after the war with my uncle, who was here in America, through American soldiers that came to Theresienstadt to look for relatives.</span> <span id="s661">And they would take mail along.</span> <span id="s662">He would write.</span> <span id="s663">He would send us small packages through soldiers.</span> <span id="s664">So we knew we would get out of Germany as soon as immigration to America would commence, which was in 1946.</span> <span id="s665">But, recuperate, it came very gradual.</span> <span id="s666">Let's put it this way.</span> <span id="s667">The Russians were very wise.</span> <span id="s668">They didn't overfeed us in the beginning.</span> <span id="s669">They must have had a good experience with concentration camps and prisoner-of-war camps, or whatever.</span> <span id="s670">And they gradually built up the food supply.</span> <span id="s671">Of course, we all of a sudden were fed food that we hadn't seen in years: fresh strawberries, cherries, and fresh vegetables instead of this German Kraut [chuckling] that we would get once in a while, meat, potatoes, you know?</span> <span id="s672">Instead of margarine, butter would come in.</span> <span id="s673">You got fresh milk once in a while.</span> <span id="s674">And then something terrible happened in Theresienstadt: typhoid fever broke out, among the prisoners from Auschwitz and from the others.</span> <span id="s675">And they closed off the ghetto.</span> <span id="s676">And they went from house to house every day, that team of Russian soldiers, with a doctor, combing through.</span> <span id="s677">Anybody who laid in bed and ran a fever was hauled off to a military hospital outside of Theresienstadt, until they had that licked.</span> <span id="s678">And then they put together transports into the different countries.</span> <span id="s679">But by that time Czechoslovakia was already ruled by a Czech government.</span> <span id="s680">It was a Communist country.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">AS: O.K., so when you went back to Theresienstadt from Wulkow...</span></p> <p><span id="s682">GA: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">AS: You were reunited with your family...</span></p> <p><span id="s684">GA: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">AS: There.</span> <span id="s686">What about other family besides your immediate family?</span> <span id="s687">Did you ever hear anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">GA: [sighs] No, except for an uncle and an aunt from my mother's side, who somehow were exchanged during the war out of, I think, Dachau, maybe Dachau, to, for... German prisoners-of-war.</span> <span id="s689">They were sent to Palestine.</span> <span id="s690">Those that were caught in the Nazi net perished.</span> <span id="s691">Nobody, nobody after the war came up any more as a survivor.</span> <span id="s692">As far as we know, we were the only survivors of both my father's family and my mother's family, both large families.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">AS: When did you arrive in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">GA: Oh, that was May the 21st, 1946, I don't forget it, a day hotter than hell, but a glorious day.</span> <span id="s695">We were actually on the second ship to leave Germany, and only because there was no more room on the first one.</span> <span id="s696">My uncle had sent us an affidavit right away, and we were on the first list to leave Deggendorf to go to the American Consulate in Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s697">From there we, as soon as transportation was arranged from one of those returning American boats, we got passage there.</span> <span id="s698">Yeah.</span> <span id="s699">I actually went, we were on the same ship as your great grandmother.</span> <span id="s700">I don't think you ever knew her, did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">AS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">GA: Well, Mrs. Klaus’ mother was an American citizen.</span> <span id="s703">And as an American citizen she had preferential treatment, and she was on the same ship as we were.</span> <span id="s704">I don't remember her name any more even.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Tape two, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s706">AS: In the years immediately following your liberation, did you have any trouble finding a direction or purpose in life?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">GA: No.</span> <span id="s708">[pause] I think being together with the whole family, immediate family, is what helped.</span> <span id="s709">As a matter of fact, number one was to get to America, get out of Germany, let's put it this way.</span> <span id="s710">Number two was to make a living.</span> <span id="s711">Number three was to continue my education.</span> <span id="s712">Because I knew without at least a high school, which I never finished before the war, I wouldn't get anywhere.</span> <span id="s713">So, there was never a question of, that you wouldn't go to work, or you wouldn't go to school, and you wouldn't help out the family.</span> <span id="s714">We all came with five dollars board money which the Joint Distribution people in New York provided for everybody going to America.</span> <span id="s715">We had that in our pocket, and whatever clothes we could get in a few months in the DP camp.</span> <span id="s716">That was it and you had to start life anew.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">AS: O.K.</span> <span id="s718">There are times in life for all of us when we fail to succeed at something.</span> <span id="s719">When this happens in your life, who is to blame?</span> <span id="s720">Do you generally blame yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">GA: Most of the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">AS: Of circumstances?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">GA: No, no.</span> <span id="s724">Mostly myself.</span> <span id="s725">Once in a while I say to myself, "Well, either it wasn't meant to be, or you got there at the wrong time, or too late," but most of the time I say, "Well, with a little more effort on your part and you might have succeeded more."</span> <span id="s726">I don't like to blame anybody else.</span> <span id="s727">Definitely not, other human being.</span> <span id="s728">[chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s729">AS: O.K., do you feel that persons like yourself have a chance of protecting their personal interests when they conflict with those of strong pressure groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">GA: Not as individual.</span> <span id="s731">Unless we can band together, we don't have a Chinaman's chance, because most of us are really not fighters.</span> <span id="s732">I think that's the closest I can come to an answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">AS: O.K. Do you feel that people are free to make their own choices, or are they restricted by those in power?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">GA: [pause] When it comes to everyday living, I guess you're pretty well on your own.</span> <span id="s735">But if it comes to an overall scheme, you're bound by the laws of the land, by how things are run, by the government and economics, and there are a hundred little other influences that either openly or even unbeknownst to you influence the future.</span> <span id="s736">So we are not really a free agent.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">AS: Do you think most people share common ideas about what is right and what is wrong?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">GA: I often doubt it.</span> <span id="s739">[unclear] I find myself, especially in these times now, I find that there are so many ideas of what is right and what is wrong, very often contrary to mine that I sometimes believe either I got left behind by the times, or something else is wrong somewhere.</span> <span id="s740">But as far as morals and so far as ethics is concerned, I very often doubt that there is a unified code of morals and ethics any more, even among religious people.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">AS: Do you think that as a Jew that you're isolated from the rest of society?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">GA: In certain ways, yes.</span> <span id="s743">I still feel like an outsider most of the time.</span> <span id="s744">And, it might be a personal thing with me, I find it hard to make personal contacts and establish relations with non-Jews.</span> <span id="s745">I am liable to see antisemitism where there might not be any, and very often feel rejected even if I shouldn't be.</span> <span id="s746">But it's more gut feeling than rational, and I know it.</span> <span id="s747">But I guess it's part of my experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">AS: Do you think that as a concentration camp survivor you're isolated from other Jews in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">GA: Not the word concentration camp survivor, but I find that even in a congregation like in Vineland, there is the invisible barrier among the American-born, between the American-born and the so-called refugees, no matter from which country they come.</span> <span id="s750">As I grow older, and more of the American people in my age group come into the same situation where their kids leave home, and the congregation returns to younger people, and they become pushed aside a little, I find myself the bond grows a little stronger.</span> <span id="s751">But I found the separation, until not too long ago, rather marked.</span> <span id="s752">But it has nothing to do with being a survivor.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">AS: O.K.</span> <span id="s754">In your mind do people generally care about each other, or are they out for themselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">GA: Where do you get those questions?</span> <span id="s756">You know?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">AS: I know, they're tough.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">GA: God!</span> <span id="s759">You're talking about generally.</span> <span id="s760">I couldn't answer that.</span> <span id="s761">I find people that I associate with, and people I especially call my friends, do care about each other.</span> <span id="s762">But then I, for everyone that cares about me, I can name five that couldn't give a hoot, and maybe I personally wouldn't care about either.</span> <span id="s763">So, you can't generalize that.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">AS: O.K.</span> <span id="s765">Some people say to themselves, "Why bring children into a world that can allow atrocities such as those committed by the Nazis to take place?"</span> <span id="s766">Do you or have you ever felt this way?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">GA: No.</span> <span id="s768">No.</span> <span id="s769">Even the atomic bomb threat hasn't really made me think twice about having a family.</span> <span id="s770">I believe it is incumbent on us, first of all as a Jew, to continue, number two, we cannot really look into the future and see what's gonna happen to our children.</span> <span id="s771">And, number three, I think a lot of it is in God's hands.</span> <span id="s772">No, that hasn't bothered me.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">[Interview stops abruptly.]</span></p></body></html>
