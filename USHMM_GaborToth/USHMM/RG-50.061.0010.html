id="s5">Personal testimony A</span></p> <p><span id="s6">of</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Suzanne Claire Holzer-Wester</span></p> <p><span id="s8">(1921-2013)</span></p> <p><span id="s9">INTRODUCTION/FORWARD: In the late 70's and early 80's, children of Holocaust survivors had grown into young adults.</span> <span id="s10">Organizations of the second generation sprouted worldwide.</span> <span id="s11">One Generation After.</span> <span id="s12">There was such a group in Boston, headed by Ruth Bork.</span> <span id="s13">We met at the Zionist House on Commonwealth Avenue, had a small library of books, and met there once a month on Sunday evenings for an educational/social program.</span> <span id="s14">The activities of OGA included a monthly newsletter, a series of Awareness Groups for the second generation, and creating a questionnaire for interviewing Holocaust survivors.</span> <span id="s15">The goal was to provide a chance for their story to be told and documented.</span> <span id="s16">(Sent to Yad Vashem ?)</span> <span id="s17">.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">I had graduated from Boston University School of Occupational Therapy and decided to remain in the Boston area.</span> <span id="s19">In the years preceding this interview, I joined OGA, became its secretary for a while, helped produce the newsletter and the interview questionnaire, and was a member of Awareness Group.</span> <span id="s20">A group of women, daughters of survivors, shared the experiences of survivor parents and our perceptions as the second generation.</span> <span id="s21">I traveled with my Mother to the World Gathering of Holocaust Survivors in Washington, DC in 1980's.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">In the cold winter of 1981, I traveled home to McKee City, New Jersey, and interviewed our Mother.</span> <span id="s23">We sat around the tape recorder in our warm kitchen.</span> <span id="s24">(There were no video cameras yet!)</span> <span id="s25">.</span> <span id="s26">I faithfully followed the written interview form, and she faithfully allowed herself to share whatever she could.</span> <span id="s27">Our Father Simon Holzer, refused to be interviewed, assumingly a process to painful for him to undertake.</span> <span id="s28">Our Uncle and Aunt, Herman and Eda Holzer agreed to be interviewed, but only about their post-war life.</span> <span id="s29">The little black tapes followed me around for many years, including my Aliya to start my new life in Israel.</span> <span id="s30">At one point, my computer expert Meitar put the tapes on the computer for safe keeping.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">In memory of our Mother's passing this past year on the 20th of January, I have taken upon myself to transcribe this interview and present a copy of the oral interview and a transcribed written copy to her children and their spouses, all her grandchildren and great-grandchildren.</span> <span id="s32">It was her request to pass on this legacy.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">All events are historical and actually occurred.</span> <span id="s34">This attempted exact transcription is not edited.</span> <span id="s35">This is her personal account and testimony of what specifically happened to her and to her family that we need to know and remember.</span> <span id="s36">Much of it is very frighteningly difficult to read.</span> <span id="s37">It is very painful to know that this happened to our Mother in specific, but to the Jewish People and Humanity in general.</span> <span id="s38">Along with the tremendous pain that goes along with reading, we must always remember that she survived, started a new life in America, began a new family and lived a full Jewish life of meaning and faith.</span> <span id="s39">This was passed on to all of us.</span> <span id="s40">She lived a proud Jewish life until the age of almost 92, and died in safety, respect and comfort, surrounded by her Jewish family that she was so proud of.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Please save and care for this treasure, share it with friends and family.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">It is Bubby's/Savta's personal story, but it belongs to all Jews and Mankind everywhere and forever.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">It is for all of us to learn, to remember, to respect, to protect ourselves and to be careful.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Marilyn Cohen-Holzer</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Jerusalem</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Tape#1, side 1)) Today is February 19th, 1981.</span> <span id="s47">My name is Marilyn Lee Holzer.</span> <span id="s48">I am interviewing my Mother, Mrs. Suzanne Claire Holzer, at her home in Pleasantville, New Jersey.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Pre- war conditions Describe those who comprised your household before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">It was my parents, my oldest brother, myself, and I had two younger sisters; We had a business and we all worked You all worked in the same business?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">The 2 oldest children, my brother and myself helped my Father in the business.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">What kind of business was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">We had a shoe factory, and we employed people.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">How many people worked, was it a large?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Maybe about 25-30 people worked there.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">What was your family's social status?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Quite comfortable, considered a higher income bracket.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">What was the level of religious observation in your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">We weren't terribly orthodox; we were keeping a Jewish nationalistic home; What do you mean by nationalistic?</span> <span id="s60">Zionist nationalistic, Or just feelings of Judaism and not Israel, Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Nationalistic, we kept, everyone kept a Jewish Kosher home at those times; there wasn't such a thing not to keep a Kosher home.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Did that mean you kept Shabbos and everyone went to the synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Absolutely, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">What was your level of cultural observation-in terms of the Polish culture or even Jewish culture?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">We all attended Polish schools.</span> <span id="s66">And of course we had a lot of Hebrew training, Hebrew schools and Jewish schools/education.</span> <span id="s67">There weren't any colleges in our town.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Can you give the name of your town and what it was near?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Szydlowiec, near Radom.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">What was your educational background?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">I would have had like, here, it's like finishing high school, on the American level.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">What was the relationship of Jews to the non-Jews in your community?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Not very good one.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Can you describe what kind of relationship it was, did they communicate?</span> <span id="s75">Did you do business together?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">They would come into the town, it was primarily a very Jewish town, all the non-Jews lived surrounding the town, outside.</span> <span id="s77">They would come in for business, to buy and sell, whatever.</span> <span id="s78">and do some work for the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s79">But they were very anti-Semitic.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Like how?</span> <span id="s81">What kind of things did they do that you're calling anti-Semitic?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">They openly come out and talk about it, and beat up Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">In the Jews own town?</span> <span id="s84">On daily business days?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">That's right.</span> <span id="s86">Provocate non-Jews not to buy by Jews, stand by stores and told "don't buy by the Jews", in Polish.</span> <span id="s87">It was going on a lot of anti-Jewish propaganda.</span> <span id="s88">A lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">And of course, in schools, when we went with the mixed, we were non-Jewish girls and Jewish girls in the classes; you could also tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Girls were separated from the boys?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Boys and girls didn't attend school together.</span> <span id="s92">Jews and non-Jews were together.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">The atmosphere was very unpleasant.</span> <span id="s94">You could always feel you were a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Did you have any close girlfriends that weren't Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">No, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Did any of the little Jewish girls have any close friends who weren't Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Not at all.</span> <span id="s99">Such a thing never happened, not in our town.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Did you ever go to the non-Jew's sections of town, to anybody's house?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Was there any assimilation in your town?</span> <span id="s103">Of some Jews that assimilated into the non-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Very few.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">They didn't keep the religious holidays so orthodox, strict like some others would.</span> <span id="s107">Maybe they didn't keep kosher, stuff like that, and was already a big step in that time in a town like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">What was means of support for the family?</span> <span id="s109">Just that business?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">We had a shoe factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Did your Mother work?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">No, my Mother was just a housewife and Mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Did you grow up, was that an urban or rural setting, your town, was it more city-like, or rural-like?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">It was a very small town, it wasn't like a big city, the whole town, had about 15,000 inhabitants, most of the Jewish all inside, and non-Jews were surrounding the outside of the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">They lived in more individual houses, like on the farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">The non-Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">They didn't live in clusters, they live more separately.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Did you encounter any anti-Semitic experiences before the war?</span> <span id="s119">Maybe you can describe more of the ones you were talking about, like in your school or during business?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">We had a lot of non-Jewish people working in our business, for the factory, and they came in every day to the city, 2-3 times a day, from the villages where they lived, to us, to pick up work and drop off products.</span> <span id="s121">Closer towards the war.</span> <span id="s122">Of course when I was little, I wouldn't remember.</span> <span id="s123">In the pre-war years when I grew up, when I was a young teenager, you could already see and feel in the air, that the anti-Semitism was growing very badly.</span> <span id="s124">In what way though?</span> <span id="s125">What do you mean by that?</span> <span id="s126">What got worse?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">They beat up people in the street, like I told you before, and they prevented non-Jews from buying from Jews, hollering in Polish 'dirty Jew'.</span> <span id="s128">Lots of things, how can I describe.</span> <span id="s129">Lots of things took place.</span> <span id="s130">The un-justice between, if someone had a fallout with a non-Jewish person, police, it was always one sided.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">No one would ever go to the police to complain.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">I didn't have any encounters, I was young, can't recall like.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">How old were you right before the war?</span> <span id="s134">This time that you're talking about.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">The last couple of years, I was 17 years old, going on 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">As it became more evident that war was going to happen, was options were open for your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">There were not too many options, being that my parents had lived in France before I was born.</span> <span id="s138">Where I was born in France.</span> <span id="s139">My parents talked a lot about going back to France.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Before the war.</span> <span id="s141">My brother had to join the army before he reached 21.</span> <span id="s142">So he had an option to go do military duty in France, to become a French citizen.</span> <span id="s143">They talked a lot about moving to France, but there weren't really weren't too many alternatives, one would have where to go, where to escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">What was involved in deciding not to go to France?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">It was a big decision, they had 4 children my parents, it was kind of hard to pick up and destroy everything and go to France.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">You had a grandmother, too.</span> <span id="s147">Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">The grandmother was dead already, one grandmother from my Buba Ruchal Leah.</span> <span id="s149">Yes, she was dead already.</span> <span id="s150">On her account my parents returned from France back to Poland.</span> <span id="s151">But she was dead already.</span> <span id="s152">I had just one other living grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">My Mother had 3 sisters, and a brother.</span> <span id="s154">In Poland.</span> <span id="s155">In the same town.</span> <span id="s156">My Father had a sister, it was hard to pick up the pieces and return with a family to France, to Paris.</span> <span id="s157">Then it closed in on the last two years before the war.</span> <span id="s158">My brother had to go and join, they decided he should do his military duty in Poland, so he went.</span> <span id="s159">He was a soldier for two years.</span> <span id="s160">Then he came back, and they started to talk war.</span> <span id="s161">Then they recalled him to the reserves.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">So before the war started, he did his duty and he came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">He came back.</span> <span id="s164">The war broke out in September.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Of what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Of 1939.</span> <span id="s167">And then they recalled him in the beginning of that year, in the military reserves, because war was in the air.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">In the beginning of 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">They recalled him as a reserve soldier.</span> <span id="s170">He never came home after that.</span> <span id="s171">The war broke out, we tried to get him out, without any success.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">You mean you wanted him to leave the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">We wanted him; we tried to get him out.</span> <span id="s174">Because we were afraid there was going to be a war, no way we could get him released from the army.</span> <span id="s175">They started to mobilize.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">He needed to fight in the war.</span> <span id="s177">How was it for Jews in Polish army?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">I can't really tell you about that too much.</span> <span id="s179">Because when my Brother came back he was already… we brought him in bad shape, wounded.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">He was in the actual fighting.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">They let him come home, he was very wounded.</span> <span id="s182">We bought him home from the hospital, he was very sick, he had 9 operations, he was a very sick man, he was only 26 at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">How long did he stay with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">For about a year then came what they made…don't know how to tell you in English, they cleaned out the town, made it "Yudenfrei".</span> <span id="s185">What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">That was in 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">So you lived like this for 2 years?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Right.</span> <span id="s189">For over two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">During the war.</span> <span id="s191">And your Father's business kept on going during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">No, they confiscated all our shoes, leather, merchandise, furs, gold, silver.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Who is they?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">The Germans.</span> <span id="s195">They confiscated everything.</span> <span id="s196">All the furs, we had to give up.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">How did your family survive, with what did they support themselves during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Whatever we had hidden away, we would always change and sell something and live on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">To who did you sell it to?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">To whoever we could, to whoever still had money to spend and buy things.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Was that usually non-Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">No, just to Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Of course, my brother very sick, we brought him home; he was on crutches, it was a sad thing to see a young boy return from the war.</span> <span id="s204">He didn't last too long.</span> <span id="s205">After when it came, they made "Yudenfrei", and they killed him by the train; he couldn't jump into the train, into the wagon.</span> <span id="s206">That was the end of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">What train was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">The train that came to haul the people away, they pushed everyone into the train to go to the chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Even though Germans had already come into your town and this was after 1939 and the war had already started, did the Jewish people still have time to spend time together and socialize?</span> <span id="s210">Observe holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Yes, to a certain extent.</span> <span id="s212">Families were still together, the parents and the children.</span> <span id="s213">We still had a synagogue, temples, and people could still observe their holidays.</span> <span id="s214">They tried to make people believe they aren't as bad as we thought that they are.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">You think they did that on purpose not to make you… Probably.</span> <span id="s216">People still attended synagogue, but not to many functions, get togethers, organizations, meetings cancelled that out.</span> <span id="s217">Evening were curfews.</span> <span id="s218">You could only walk until 6:00.</span> <span id="s219">After 6 you didn't dare go out on the street anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Give me some other examples, how was life different after 1939 than it was before?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Families could still worship, relatives- parents and children were still together, then after a while, they started to go around and pick up the men to take them out for work, for a day's work, to do all kinds...</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Did your Father and brother ever have to…?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">My brother wasn't home, my brother was in Hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">What about your Father?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Sometimes they would catch him, too.</span> <span id="s226">Everybody had to go.</span> <span id="s227">It wasn't that they took you right away to a concentration camp; that was the first two years, everyone still at home; but then the starvation started to come in.</span> <span id="s228">People didn't have money to live on, to buy food.</span> <span id="s229">And everything was sort of on black market.</span> <span id="s230">Who didn't have enough money could not go out and buy and shop like other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Were there still stores open?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">There were still stores.</span> <span id="s233">There didn't come in merchandise like it used to come in before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Were you working?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">No we couldn't work.</span> <span id="s236">But some days they would go and pick up some people to work, to sweep street to make you feel ashamed.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Did you ever have to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A couple of times, to shovel away snow in town where they occupied.</span> <span id="s239">The young men mostly, they would go and pick up on the street and ask them to go do that.</span> <span id="s240">And of course they would shoot people for different incidents, in the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">How were things socially?</span> <span id="s242">You had friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">I had lots of friends; we all had friends, but then everything sort of stopped.</span> <span id="s244">You couldn't get together, with too many people, from other parts of town.</span> <span id="s245">Couldn't come out so far, cause you couldn't go back after 5-6 o'clock, it was a big risk, you risked your life going that late in the night.</span> <span id="s246">There were lots of incidents were people were shot for walking a minute after 6 o'clock in the street, you had to wear a "Yuden band", a white band with a blue star on arm.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">You always had to wear that?</span> <span id="s248">Since when?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Soon after they came in, maybe a half a year after they came in, early 1940's.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">That was in the beginning of 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">They asked everyone to wear the "Yuden band", a white band with a blue star, on the left arm.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">War Conditions-Liquidation of Szydlowiec So you were about 18 when the war started.</span> <span id="s253">How did you first know that the war started?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">They started to bomb.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">In your area?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">The airplanes came and they started bombing, That was the first you knew about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">That's right, people started to run away and hide in cellars, wherever they could.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Was that as big shock?</span> <span id="s259">Did you expect that at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">We knew the last days before the war broke out, everyone would sit glued to the radio, not too many people had radios, we did have a radio.</span> <span id="s261">It was summer time.</span> <span id="s262">All summer was very bad, the news; everybody sat all day by the radio to listen the latest news, what's going on, what this one said, what this one said.</span> <span id="s263">The last few days was very bad.</span> <span id="s264">Very sad.</span> <span id="s265">Then we knew they were marching on Poland.</span> <span id="s266">We knew, everyone knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">How did your family respond to all this?</span> <span id="s268">Were there any options available to do anything else?</span> <span id="s269">Was there anywhere to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">No place to go.</span> <span id="s271">Lots of people, young men ran away to Russia; my Father couldn't go, he didn't want to leave his family.</span> <span id="s272">He was relatively very young.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">He never had to go to the army or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">My Father?</span> <span id="s275">I don’t remember anything about that, because he was in Paris.</span> <span id="s276">Maybe he was before, I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Was your Father a French citizen living in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">No he was Polish living in France a certain number of years.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">So he never had to go to the Polish army when all this war stuff was starting.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">What are your first memories of the war, how do you remember it?</span> <span id="s281">How did things change then?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">It changed in every aspect.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Tell me some… Everyone had to have a lower standard of living.</span> <span id="s284">Things weren't that plentiful.</span> <span id="s285">And of course very frightened and sad, that we never knew what happened to my oldest brother.</span> <span id="s286">We never knew what's going to happen, if we'd see him again, when the war came first, we didn't have him at home, we didn't know how it would be He didn't die till later on, what year was that when he died?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">In 1942.</span> <span id="s288">We never knew if we'll ever see him again.</span> <span id="s289">And then of course, we never knew how it's going to work out, when they'll march in.</span> <span id="s290">It took about 2 days when they came to our town.</span> <span id="s291">2-3 days.</span> <span id="s292">Everyone was hidden in cellars, in bunkers.</span> <span id="s293">And finally people started to go out and show up on the street, people started to get back to normal; life wasn't normal by all means, but we thought maybe it won’t be that bad.</span> <span id="s294">But later on things didn't turn out so good like we thought it might.</span> <span id="s295">And everything started to go worse and worse, every year, till they made the town "Yudenfrei" in 1942.</span> <span id="s296">Everybody had to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">When you said "Yudenfrei", what did that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">The whole town free of Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Where did everyone go?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Lots were killed, and they gathered in center of town, in a market place.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">You and your family and everyone were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">No, I was hidden with my husband, I was married a couple of years before.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">When were you married?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">In 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">You were still able to have a little ceremony?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Very little, just the chuppah in our house, with just the next few relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Your husband never had to go to any kind of an army?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Was that because he was Jewish or to young?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Then he was too young, he didn't do his military duty before, too young.</span> <span id="s311">My brother did before so called up in the reserves.</span> <span id="s312">He was too young to be called up.</span> <span id="s313">So we were hidden that same night.</span> <span id="s314">My mother and two sisters were also hidden, and my Father-they made him put on… he used to be in "Yiddisher Gemeinde"?????</span> <span id="s315">… they asked him to put on, not a uniform, a special hat, so when they would take the people to the camps, to the next camp, there was a camp next to us, Skarzysko, the Hasag, "arbeit lager", that he would go to the camp, that he won't be going with all these people.</span> <span id="s316">So my Mother was hidden, and my brother was taken out to the market place with all the people, and I was hidden with my husband.</span> <span id="s317">My Father was taken to that Skarzysko camp, to another "arbeits lager".</span> <span id="s318">And then after two months, there were still some Jews left hidden in bunkers in that town.</span> <span id="s319">But then they made them all come out and they were all sent away.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">How did they make them come out?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">They had a system to go around, and throw in bombs, with loud speakers and came out and destroyed the homes.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">That's when you had to come out?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">I came out about 2 days later with my husband.</span> <span id="s324">We went to another town where they had… How did you get to another town?</span> <span id="s325">Did you walk?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">We walked part of the way, and part of the way we gave away a man whatever we had on ourselves, all the money, all we could carry in a little bag with us, they took that away, and they gave us a ride into the next town.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">What town was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Yezhnik; Starokovitza that was.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">We stayed for about three days, and from there we disguised ourselves like non-Jews.</span> <span id="s330">We took off bands.</span> <span id="s331">We risked our lives, and we got on the train and went to Krakow, In Krakow we were in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s332">We went into the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">I want to talk to you more about the ghetto, but I want to go back when your family left their home and they went to that market place, your Mother and your sisters… and that was the end of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">You never saw them again?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">No, they were taken away, there was the 'Treblinka" were they took the people to… From your village, the people went to Treblinka?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Yes, from my town, not a little village, From Szydlowiec, and you never heard from them again.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">And my Father died in that Skarzyshko camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">People told you this later?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Yes, Haskele Dreinudle lives in Israel, he told me Father died, he got very swollen from hunger, and he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Your Mother and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Both went.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Two sisters and your Mother.</span> <span id="s343">You know for sure they went to Treblinka?</span> <span id="s344">How do you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">How do I know?</span> <span id="s346">No one came back from there.</span> <span id="s347">There was no other place.</span> <span id="s348">If they would have lived through we would have found each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">You knew that that train was going to…there was a train there in that market place?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Our train station was outside the city, outside the town, and they had to march 4 km,</span></p> <p><span id="s351">About 8 miles Right.</span> <span id="s352">To those trains there.</span> <span id="s353">That was the end of it.</span> <span id="s354">There wasn't a single Jew left in the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">And then they bombed the whole city?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">No, then came the non-Jews, the Pollaks, and took apart buildings, homes were the Jews lived; they were trying to find jewelry, gold and money, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Did you ever run across non-Jews from your school or that did business with your Father?</span> <span id="s358">Did they ever try to help?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Non-Jews?</span> <span id="s360">I came back when I came back after the war, I was liberated and I came back to Poland, I went back to Szydlowiec for a few days, and I went to a non-Jewish family; we had given them things to store away for us, to put away things and we said maybe someone will live through the war you can help us out; we gave furniture, you name it, she took everything, and when I came to her, they had a style then, if a Jew came back and asked for anything they gave him to put away, they cut his throat, and she said to me "No, I can't give you nothing today, you come tomorrow".</span> <span id="s361">There were a few other Jewish people who lived through the war and came back to the town, and they said to me "No, we won't let you go there tomorrow, because you won't come back alive".</span> <span id="s362">And I didn't go back no more.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Before you left with husband did you ever go to any of the non-Jews to ask them for help, the ones that you knew?</span> <span id="s364">Before you went to Krakow with your husband.</span> <span id="s365">Did any of them try to help?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">No, we didn't go to no one, we went away to the Krakow Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">We were hidden.</span> <span id="s368">One night came also around up</span></p> <p><span id="s369">In Krakow?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A few days before my husband took me out and left me by a Rumanian Jewish family.</span> <span id="s371">Rumanian and Hungarian Jews could live free outside the ghetto limits.</span> <span id="s372">So he left me, he had friends Rumanian Jews; he left me there for a few days.</span> <span id="s373">In the meantime came that roundup in the Krakower ghetto, and he was taken away.</span> <span id="s374">They took him also to the chambers then, Mania's daughter was taken then, Gershon Frydman's sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Where did they go?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">To the chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Did you know for sure they were going to the chambers?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">We don't know where they'll go, but later on… Later on you found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Sure, Never heard from him again.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Never, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">You were staying with those friends, and where was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">He was in the Krakower ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Doing what?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Nobody did nothing there, we just tried to sit and wait maybe something will happen.</span> <span id="s385">But then they came and rounded up, and took thousands and thousands of people and the next few days later I..</span> <span id="s386">.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Tape #1, side 2))</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Krakow Ghetto How long were you in the Krakow ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A few days after all this happened, I couldn't stay outside the ghetto anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Romanian Jews were afraid to keep me there.</span> <span id="s391">So I went into the ghetto, too.</span> <span id="s392">There we stayed until the following year, early March.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">So you were able to stay in the ghetto about a year?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Quite a few months, almost a year.</span> <span id="s395">It was very bad there, very bad with food and rations and everything.</span> <span id="s396">Then took us to Plaszow, that camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">That was in 1943?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Yes, 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">When you were in the Krakow ghetto, who ran the Krakow ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Jewish Kapos, under Goeth, the commandeer of the ghetto, Plaszow camp, Goeth was his name, an SS man.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">He was German.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">German, lots of SS men and women, would always take us to work and then back from work to the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">This was in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">This was in Plaszow, I am asking you about the Krakow ghetto, you were there for a few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">I wouldn't really know who was the commandeer of the Krakow ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Did you work while you were in the Krakow Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Yes, in the evening I would go and work in a "Schneider gemeinschaft", and fix uniforms for soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">That's this were you learned how to sew?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">I knew how to sew already, we had a machine at home and I could always use a machine, but this is where I learned a lot, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">And who did you love with?</span> <span id="s411">In the Krakow Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">In the Krakow Ghetto I lived with Rushka Boimans, Koenig's sister, Kshivatch… I showed you the picture yesterday, with her and her husband, and Manya was staying with us for a while, and another few people which I didn't know, were not from our town.</span> <span id="s413">Because in one room had to live a few people.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">When you got to the Krakow Ghetto you found them and lived with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Yeh.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Did you have Medical needs?</span> <span id="s417">Were there doctors to go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">There was a small hospital, like a clinic.</span> <span id="s419">People if they needed medical help, they wen, it wasn't like there were specialists or doctors Did kids go to schools there?</span> <span id="s420">Where there schools there?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">No, Were there little kids in the area?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Sure, Yes, Lots of kids What did they do?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Nothing.</span> <span id="s424">What could they do, the kids, they were starving.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Were people still able to follow any religious practices?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">They did, they did very secretly, in fact by us-I meant to tell you- it got to be so bad, you couldn't go to services.</span> <span id="s427">And they bombed our synagogue, burnt it up, in our town.</span> <span id="s428">Rounding up of all the Jews when I told you it happened, was the day after Yom Kippur.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">In 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">In 1942.</span> <span id="s431">People went very secretly to services in private homes, private rooms, the next night they rounded everybody up.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Was there any political activity going on in the Krakow ghetto?</span> <span id="s433">Did people try to do any…?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">I really wouldn't know.</span> <span id="s435">I didn't know too many people.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Was there any resistance that you knew of?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">No.</span> <span id="s438">None at all, no one did anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Was there any smuggling?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Yes, some people held jobs outside of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s441">So the Germans would escort out a number of people to work, out-side the ghetto, they would buy and sell things.</span> <span id="s442">and smuggle in some things.</span> <span id="s443">But some days they would look through, check them out…</span></p> <p><span id="s444">On their clothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">In their clothing and bodies, the Germans would shoot people and take away what they smuggled in.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Can you describe what a typical day was like in the ghetto, when you woke up in the morning?</span> <span id="s447">Always a hassle to go and get your ration of bread, That's how they gave out food in rations?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">And then the soup.</span> <span id="s449">In the beginning, I didn't have a food card cause I wasn't from Krakow.</span> <span id="s450">It took a while to be able to get some food.</span> <span id="s451">And people would go and try and help themselves, a lot of things were going on.</span> <span id="s452">I didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Like what?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">People tried to organize food.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Who tried to organize?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">People that lived in the ghetto, I didn't really know that many people there, I wasn't from Krakow myself, and there were mostly Krakower people.</span> <span id="s457">It was a hard time for everybody, to go stand in line 2-3 times a day for soup, for the piece of bread.</span> <span id="s458">People that still had some money could still buy, There were there stores there?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">No, what people smuggled in, it wasn't an easy life.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">How long did that last?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Till they liquidated the Krakow ghetto.</span> <span id="s462">Till one day in early March 1943, they liquidated the Krakower ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">March, 1943?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Yes, they took all the kids and they threw them into big dump trucks, little kids.</span> <span id="s465">Including my own.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">How old was your baby?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">My baby was a little over 3 months.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">That baby was born in the Krakow ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Yes, December 6th.</span> <span id="s470">and then they took even older children, took them away, killed them and burned them.</span> <span id="s471">Little kids they threw in, in "kinderheim" they had a special kinderheim for little kids so parents could go to work.</span> <span id="s472">like I could go to work in the evening, but my baby wasn't in the "kinderheim", at the beginning, because Hela, Rusha's sister still stayed there with us, but later on everyone had to go.</span> <span id="s473">But then, they took the kids and threw them on the dump trucks.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Took us to Plaszow to the concentration camp and said they would follow up with the children, but and children never came.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">This was in 1943?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Early1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Concentration Camp-Plaszow So you went from this Krakow Ghetto to this other place, Plaszow.</span> <span id="s478">What was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Plaszow was a railroad station outside Krakow, and they built there not too far from this railroad station, built those camps.</span> <span id="s480">In fact when I came, it was not quite a camp yet.</span> <span id="s481">We helped build all those barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">So Plaszow wasn't anything when you first got there.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">They had already some people there, but then when they liquidated the Krakow Ghetto, we all helped build those barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Where did you live and where did you sleep?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">In barracks.</span> <span id="s486">Very, heavily populated, with a lot of people.</span> <span id="s487">and then they built up more barracks, more barracks, we helped them build, and they brought in other transports of people.</span> <span id="s488">A lot of transports of people from other ghettos and other towns.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">What do you mean by a transport?</span> <span id="s490">That was a train, car?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">They bought in lots of other people by train, but the train didn't come into Plaszow, the train station outside Plaszow, then people had to march on foot.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Like you had to do We marched from the Krakower ghetto… all those people you were together with them, That's right.</span> <span id="s493">We marched into the Plaszow Concentration Camp, from the Krakow Ghetto, it was right outside Krakow.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">And this was in early March 1943.</span> <span id="s495">Can you tell me any incidents that happened during the march or during the transport?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Really can't recall much, which about 2-3 hours was going there.</span> <span id="s497">But then the first few weeks were really bad there.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">What was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">You had to, they took us out every morning to the "apel platz", had to be counted, they used to shoot people and kill, and I worked in the "Schneider "gemeinshaft", like fixing uniforms, In Plaszow.</span> <span id="s500">And we got our daily ration of soup.</span> <span id="s501">Every block got their ration of food.</span> <span id="s502">it was distributed among all the people that lived in our block, all the women.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">It was very hectic, we worked 12 hours /day work.</span> <span id="s504">We had no light; we used to leave in the morning when it was dark and came home in the dark.</span> <span id="s505">Get up 5:00 to go the "apel</span></p> <p><span id="s506">platz".</span></p> <p><span id="s507">You did this 7 days a week?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">7 days a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">When you first got to this place Plaszow, the very first day, did they tell you where to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">They showed you were you had to go to your barrack and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Was there any selections?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">They started to select right away the weak people they took away and we never heard from them.</span> <span id="s513">Very old ones and very young ones.</span> <span id="s514">People tried to hide their children, but eventually they had to come out.</span> <span id="s515">And they selected the weak people, the old and the very young and took them away, we never heard from them again.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">All the people you arrived together with them, stayed with them the whole time you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Most of the time, and then they used to send away different transports to different camps, for different labors, different works.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">You all got separated eventually?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Eventually we all got separated.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">What were some of your initial thoughts and feelings when you first got there during all this?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">What could you think?</span> <span id="s522">You just lived from day to day.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">What did you feel?</span> <span id="s524">What were some of your feelings?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">First of all everything was so fresh, I just had….</span> <span id="s526">lost my parents, my brother, my sisters, and my Husband and the baby and everything.</span> <span id="s527">You just couldn't function, and had thoughts; just were so occupied with the day, from day to day, you couldn't make no plans, and You didn't know what the next hour would bring; you never thought for tomorrow, you never knew what the next hour would be, here you were one minute, and an hour later you were dead.</span> <span id="s528">They would come in and shoot people and pull out people for no reason in the street and gun them down.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">All pretty shocking all the time</span></p> <p><span id="s530">All the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Can you talk a little more what you had to do to help set up the camp Plaszow?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">I didn't help set it up, they just made us work, carry stones, and break stones, I didn't help set it up, I would burn it down, I mean in terms of that, what did they make you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">They made us carry stones, we used to carry big stones like this, bricks, and then some days they would make us sit down with big hammers and break the stones.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">For the whole day?</span> <span id="s535">Now this camp was located outside of Krakow, how big was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">It was very big.</span> <span id="s537">And then they had neighboring that they had another smaller camp for men.</span> <span id="s538">Yulag.</span> <span id="s539">But that was very big, a lot of barracks, a lot of people, and the conditions we lived in there were just awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">What kind of guard system did they have?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">They had the SS, of course they had a lot of… Was there only women in your camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">our camp, no it was separate, it was a lot of men and women, but the men stayed in one part of the camp and the women stayed in another, How about the guards?</span> <span id="s543">Where the guards all men?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">No, there were SS women and SS men.</span> <span id="s545">Of course they organized Jewish police men, they took young men and made a Jewish Kommandant and Jewish policemen, and some were so brutal and used to beat up some people to death.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">The Jewish policemen?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Some of them were very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Were any of the Jewish people women that were doing…?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">No, mostly men.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Were conditions for them a little different?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A little better, but eventually they all had the same end.</span> <span id="s552">Goeth finished them in a worse way.</span> <span id="s553">We were sent away to Auschwitz and other labor camps.</span> <span id="s554">Those people were finished and shot in a very ugly way, there in Plaszow.</span> <span id="s555">Mina, my friend from Sweden, she was one of the last ones to leave Plaszow, as a prisoner, and she saw a lot of what had happened to some of those terrible policemen.</span> <span id="s556">And some of them, believe me, they deserved what they got, what they did to some people.</span> <span id="s557">It's a shame to talk about it, that Jews could do that to Jews, but they thought they could save their own skin.</span> <span id="s558">But they had a worse end.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Were you angry at them?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Of course we didn't like them,</span></p> <p><span id="s561">The Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">We were terribly afraid of them like the SS, they sided with the SS and they thought they would be privileged in many ways, but when the end came, many of us had been sent us away, there was just a remnant of people left to be transported, which Mina was one of them left, a day before they were transported Goeth gave an order to shoot all those policemen.</span> <span id="s563">They were all laid out like herrings beside the barracks, the rest of the people had to go march by and view those corpses, Did you meet Mina there?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">I met Mina two days after we came from the Krakow Ghetto, in Plaszow.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">She saw me walk on the street, and I was crying, and she asked me where I am from and from which barrack, I said I am from –barrack, and she said "so am I", and she asked "where are your things?"</span> <span id="s566">I didn't have anything with me, just what I had on, because I had fled so many times already, so she took me on her bed, and I stayed with her, because she still had a little pollster, she had a blanket and a little pillow.</span> <span id="s567">So I stayed with her.</span> <span id="s568">That's how we got so attached, so friendly, and after the war, I met her again.</span> <span id="s569">She was in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s570">I ran around to ask, call names, to see if someone survived, people who were sick laying down, she looked down the window and recognized me.</span> <span id="s571">Mina was sick, she had typhus.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">In Plaszow camp, what kind of food did you get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Soup and a ration of black bread, and some soup.</span> <span id="s574">One time a day, a piece of potato in it, a couple pieces of barley.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">And there you also worked in the sewing shop fixing uniforms?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Did the inmates get along with each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">In conditions like this people get along worse.</span> <span id="s579">You know why?</span> <span id="s580">Because everybody was in bad shape, everyone had lost someone, everybody was broken hearted, and people for a piece of bread sometimes would fight, for a spoon of soup, But Mina took you into stay with her, sometimes people were… but in different ways, because everybody was in the same boat.</span> <span id="s581">Sometimes people looked out one for another, but they used to fight and argue over the least little thing, it wasn't a least, it was a matter of survival actually.</span> <span id="s582">If someone stole a piece of bread from somebody, she was hungry.</span> <span id="s583">They would steal from one another sometimes, or different incidents took place.</span> <span id="s584">But I would say on the whole, people got along real good because everyone was on the same boat.</span> <span id="s585">In the same situation, everybody had lost everybody, and we all lived the same way, looking forward to the next day to see what would happen.</span> <span id="s586">And everybody tried to be close to someone, cause everyone had lost everybody.</span> <span id="s587">So you just tried to hang on to somebody.</span> <span id="s588">That's how I got so friendly with Mina.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">And what about the people you were in the Krakow Ghetto with, Rusha's sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Rusha's sister and her husband were in another barrack, Husbands and wives were able to stay together?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">No, he was with the men and she was with other women, they worked in different places.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">What do you mean by barrack?</span> <span id="s593">Is that a building where you slept?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A barrack where you sleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">And you worked in the same building where you slept in??</span></p> <p><span id="s596">No, you had to work, to go to march to work.</span> <span id="s597">But Manya, worked in a different place, and Hela worked in a place where they made shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Did you get to see Manya once in a while?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Very seldom, once in a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">How did you know she was in the same… Because some times when we had a break, I would run over to the work shop where she was working, I would run over and see what was she was doing and where she is.</span> <span id="s601">And then when we would come home from work, we would run over to each other's barracks, to see where we are, what we're doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">What kind of clothing were you wearing at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">I just had a coat, did I have a coat?</span> <span id="s604">I don't even remember, and a dress.</span> <span id="s605">Just what I had on, that's it.</span> <span id="s606">We didn't have a wardrobe, where to hang up things.</span> <span id="s607">It was bunk beds, only that little place to lay, that's all.</span> <span id="s608">You didn't have clothes to change, or shoes to change or underwear to change.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Did you ever get to wash?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Yes, we would go down in the middle of the night, 4 o'clock, everybody had to get up, We would get up at 4, 4:30 and run down to the latrines, where we would go to the bathroom, and they had long pipes with water, and we were lucky to get to get to a pipe with water and wash yourself the best you could.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">You slept in your clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">No, we took off coat and the dress, in the winter-time we probably slept with our clothes on, too.</span> <span id="s613">It was cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">It was real cold there in the winter like it is in Boston or NJ?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">That's right, even colder.</span> <span id="s616">snows and what not.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">So you only had your shoes to wear?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Most of the people there were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Where there any non-Jews there?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">There was a non-Jews camp-for Poles that were caught to work, for political reasons.</span> <span id="s623">They were in a different camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Were their conditions the same?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">I couldn't tell you, I was never there.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Did you ever have opportunities to have contact with men that were there, or get to know them?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">We worked with men in the workshops, together; by the machines or tables, but we lived separately, we lived in the women's barracks, and they lived in the men's barracks.</span> <span id="s628">Separate camps.</span> <span id="s629">But there were couples, men could come after work for an hour or so before the curfew to see his wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">They were allowed that freedom to go and see each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Not too often, but sometimes after work, after the "apel" they counted coming back, What do you mean you were counted?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Twice a day we had to go to the "apel platz" to be counted, some people had violations, they hung some people and we had stand and watch it.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Did anyone try to leave from there, to escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A few people tried to escape, but were caught and brought back and were shot.</span> <span id="s635">A few people tried to escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Did anyone try to plan to escape or resist of a lot of people together?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Didn't know if tried to resist.</span> <span id="s638">Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">You didn't know about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Was there any kind of resistance, did people still try and have their prayer, or follow holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Describe some of the punishment that the police used to do to the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Punishments if didn't work right or if you didn't show up to work, there wasn't such a thing that you didn't show up, for every little thing they pulled you out and beat you until half dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Did you ever get beat?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">How did they beat, with their hands or with sticks?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">No with rubber, like a policeman walks around with that rubber thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Was there any cultural activity going on there?</span> <span id="s649">Or political activity?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">I didn't know., no gatherings.</span> <span id="s651">No, how could you?</span> <span id="s652">You were watched day and night.</span> <span id="s653">You couldn't just move around and gather… How long did you stay in this Plaszow ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">We stayed until April, 1944.</span> <span id="s655">I have it written down on a paper.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">So that was over a year you stayed there?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">At least a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Concentration Camp-Auschwitz And then we were sent on a big transport to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s660">We were taken on trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">How did you know that you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">I didn't know, just came and took us, and that was it, and they marched us out to the trains.</span> <span id="s663">Manya, Hela, we tried to stay together, and we were sent to Auschwitz there we lived in the same barrack in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">How long did it take to get to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">I think about 5 days, On a train?</span> <span id="s666">an open or closed train?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A cattle train.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Was there a lot of people on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">An awful lot of people, in every car.</span> <span id="s670">All you had was standing room.</span> <span id="s671">people a lot of them died before we reached Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">You could only stand up for 5 days?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">That's right, and sometimes we would try and hold on one to another.</span> <span id="s674">One would stand and one would try and sit down, and then we changed till we reached Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Did you know you were going to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">We assumed, we didn't know where we were going, but we assumed that we were going to Auschwitz Had you heard that word before?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Oh, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">How did you hear about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">We heard about it; who ever went there never came back.</span> <span id="s680">Because they had sent away lots of people, then they sent ashes back.</span> <span id="s681">Before we were even taken to the camps.</span> <span id="s682">They would round up some people and send them away.</span> <span id="s683">Take them away to Auschwitz, and they would send back ashes to the relatives.</span> <span id="s684">So we knew there was an Auschwitz were they burned people, when people were still in their homes, back home, What do you mean back home, Szydlowiec?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">When people were still home.</span> <span id="s686">Some people were sent to Auschwitz even then.</span> <span id="s687">and sent the ashes, the Germans, some ashes of the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Why would they bother doing that?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Who knows?</span> <span id="s690">It was their mentality, their fine mentality to send the remains of some of the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">You were on this train for 5 days?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">They gave us a ration of bread to last for 5 days to hold us through until we got there to</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Did yours last for the 5 days?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">It had to last.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Were you able to go to the bathroom on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Don't ask what was on that train.</span> <span id="s698">It's just beyond imagination, really, what happens on a train like this, just for fear, people got sick, threw up, got diarrhea, It was awful.</span> <span id="s699">It was awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">It was closed the whole time, That's right … by the time we reached Auschwitz lots of people were dead, and then there they took us… What was it like when you first got off the train there?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">The guards, German SS walked around, they had very big flies, biting, green flies, so they wore nets over their heads, and we all the women were transported into rooms where we had to get completely undressed, and they said "leave your things neatly, your clothes and shoes and whatever you have, so when you'll come out you should be able to find it".</span> <span id="s702">So when we got all undressed they kept us for hours, they had us wait for hours on the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Tape #2, side 1)) So when you got there and you had to take all your clothes off, what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">And they had us wait for hours and hours on the street naked, and those SS men walked around among us, and then they took us in and they separated us.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Who separated ?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">The SS.</span> <span id="s707">They said: Left, right, left, right" you didn't know what left is or right is, so they had one group of people" go in this door, and another group to another door; you didn't know if you were going to come out or not; so were we went in, they let water came down, and we got showered, but before we went to get showered, they had men, men shave us here, and here and here.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Jewish men?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">I don't know if they were Jewish, probably, they were all inmates, also, they made men shave us, and then they got us in to shower and we got water and we came out, but we came out through a different door altogether, we didn't come back to the place where we got undressed, and they gave like a big woman –I was a big girl, they gave me a short little dress with a boy's coat, and they gave me those wooden shoes.</span> <span id="s710">And the other group of people, went in, and instead of water, they got down gas, because you could hear the screams, and the yells, and the hollering and then it quieted down.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">You heard that?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Everyone heard.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">You knew people that went into the other side?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">I knew so many people, all the transports from the places that I got acquainted with, you get to know people and then you didn't see them anymore, and then you assume that this is where they went.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">I just want to ask one question, remember when last year they had the movie, Fanny Fenelow, and the music, was there music when you arrived there?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">That's right, when we arrived… Do you remember her?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">We couldn't see the people, but on days when they burnt a lot, when the ovens were going, they had a lot of orchestras, music playing.</span> <span id="s718">One woman a Hungarian woman she was dressed like a gypsy, in the camp playing, a Jewish woman; and after the war, I went with another girl to Lions Korn House in Marble Arch, which was a very famous place in London.</span> <span id="s719">And I thought I'll die, this woman was standing there and playing, the Hungarian woman, she played the czardas.</span> <span id="s720">She was a very beautiful looking woman, and she played so beautiful the violin and she played the charda,</span></p> <p><span id="s721">The same song?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Different songs, but when she played, I had a feeling I had heard that before, and I look up and there's she's standing with her pitch black hair, wearing also a gypsy outfit, playing.</span> <span id="s723">I thought I'll die.</span> <span id="s724">I felt like fainting.</span> <span id="s725">Can you imagine after the war… Did you speak to her at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">No, I couldn't get myself to go over to her.</span> <span id="s727">But they had people standing playing specially to make music, while they were burning and people were getting gassed and screaming.</span> <span id="s728">Did you watch that movie?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">The song, one of the songs that they were playing, I remembered that you used to sing, do you remember any of the songs?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Maybe if someone started it I would get to me, I couldn't watch it; I didn't want to watch it, they said to boycott it.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">OK, after the shower that you had, what happened the?</span> <span id="s732">That was the first day?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Yeh, that was on the next day.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Where did you sleep on the first day?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">By the time they got us off the train, Marilyn, it didn't go so fast, by the time they organized us in one place and got us to undress, and then they hauled us all into one big barrack, and everyone got shaved off the hair, shaved off like Dad standing and shaving; my head wa… and then they took us into shower, and then we came out and then it was already late in the night, by the time they got us into a barrack and they showed you were your bunk bed is going to be, so Manya and I climbed up to one, and Hela Shgivatch, and the next morning when we got out 5 o'clock in the morning we got out, "appel platz" to be counted, by every barrack they got their people out to be counted.</span> <span id="s736">We got so hysterical when we looked at each other the first time without hair, you know.</span> <span id="s737">When they got us back, it was in the middle of the night, it was dark, nobody could see nobody, there was never light in the barracks, you couldn't undress or dress by light, whatever we had to dress or undress, so you couldn't see what you looked, but when it started to get in the morning a little light, daylight would set in.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">And we looked at each other, there were, people got so hysterical, crying, and laughing and, screaming.</span> <span id="s739">I just cannot describe to you the feeling what is was then, We all looked like you know what, like our father's, you know when a girl's head is shaved off, she looks just like her father, in Manya I saw her Father, Manya saw in me my Father.</span> <span id="s740">It was an awful thing.</span> <span id="s741">An awful feeling, can you imagine you're not a woman anymore; and then they started, they put something in your food, which you don't menstruate.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">How did you know that, did they tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">No we didn't know, but the day I arrived in Auschwitz, till we left all those months, we never menstruated, and about two –three weeks after we left, we started to menstruate.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">So then you knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Yeh.</span> <span id="s746">We knew, they put in something in the food, the soups, in the bread, so people shouldn't menstruate, So you got there in April of 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">I have some papers were I have the dates, What did you do there after the first couple days?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">That was the worst part, we didn't do nothing.</span> <span id="s749">They made you sit from 5 in the morning till 6 in the night outside the barrack, rain or shine or cold or whatever, and it was cold, we didn't have no clothes, we huddled one next to the other standing in the groups.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">You were still wearing that little dress?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Yeh, short little dress, like a mini, must have been the mini times for me then.</span> <span id="s752">and we didn't do nothing, but to have a job there, was a great privilege, if you had a job, they gave you those pashaks with the stripes,</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Striped uniforms?</span></p> <p><span id="s754">uniforms, the striped dress, but who could be so privileged, but a couple of times, they picked out about 20-30 people, I don't remember , to go to another camp, like you saw it on TV.</span> <span id="s755">that camp Birkenau, this is the one I was in, but there were a lot of other camps., there was another camp where the trains arrived, which was called Epkael, and they marched us down to that Epkael train, that we should unload some cars, some trains, and we marched by and we saw those people sitting, leaning towards the trains, they were like corpses already.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">These were people that were coming on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">No, when we went there, they took us to unload like some wood, coal or corpses, whatever they transported in, and were sitting people at the train, at the trains that we passed by on the way, and they were already dead those people, they couldn't walk, couldn't talk, kept on saying we should say "Kaddish" after them , we should remember them.</span> <span id="s758">Those people died within hours, those people, were so thin, mussel men, so thin, living skeletons, like sometimes did you see in Biafra, the children with the big head, thin little hands and thin little legs, big fat stomachs, like you know, like a skeleton that you could take out from a grave… that's what these people looked…Tired of sitting.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">We'll stop and finish tomorrow.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">When you said, you sometimes went to work to take things off the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Not too many times, a few times they took us, What did you have to take off the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">corpses, or wood, and boxes, unload or load on, that was just a few times that they took us.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">How long did you stay at Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">We stayed a nice few months we stayed there, and then they took us they transported us, about 4-5 months,</span></p> <p><span id="s765">at least.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">How did you survive, they had such a bad reputation, just from day to day?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Just from day to day, from hour to hour, believe me, you never knew, and then they, one day, and then, almost every week, 2-3 times a week they made "selectzia".</span></p> <p><span id="s768">What do you mean by that?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">"Seleczia" means a selection of people, they had us all undress and Mengele, you heard about Mengele, the one that is being filmed now, would you believe that he clapped me like this on my back, that bastard.</span> <span id="s770">One day, they assembled us all, naked, and Hela, Rusha's sister, had two other girls at the Plaszow camp, we kept together, Manya and I , and we always tried to keep Manya between Hela and me, Rusha's sister and me, because Manya had scars, from operations, and if he saw a scar, or a pimple on somebody, and you didn't look good anymore, you went here; you didn't know where you were going, but we assumed.</span> <span id="s771">So we tried to keep Manya between us, but he said "March, march", so when I came by he said to me "die vet noch gut arbeit leissen" that I will produce a lot of work yet, so we all went by and we were lucky, we could go and get dressed again.</span> <span id="s772">but then, this, was this in April 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">When you first got there…, In April 44 I first got to Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s774">Then I must have come to Auschwitz in the end of 43, because in April we arrived in Willishtal, I have a paper.</span> <span id="s775">I should have gotten that out, I could the exact dates.ץ You went away from Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s776">They took you away?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">They, they got us again assembled, Did they tell you why?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">No, and they, Before you go on further, is this when things started to change, cause we could stop now.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Do you want to stop now?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">It changed that they transported out us out from Auschwitz to Willistahl Did they tell you where you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">No.</span> <span id="s782">That was a "arbeits" camp, a work camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">This was late in, this was in April 44, Yeh, and there we stayed till.</span> <span id="s784">.</span> <span id="s785">I have to go and get that paper.</span> <span id="s786">I can't recall this… Do you want to stop now?</span> <span id="s787">We can continue tomorrow?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">If we'll have time tomorrow.</span> <span id="s789">Let me think back… We were liberated in Czechoslovakia, in May, 1945, Well was this place in Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">No that was in Germany, Willishtal was in Leipzig, in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">From there they took you to... to Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">In Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Yeh.</span> <span id="s794">In Czechoslovakia we weren't too long, only a few weeks, before the liberation.</span> <span id="s795">Because they were going to gas us in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s796">That was the last stop because all the Allies closed in on them, American and Russia, England, they all closed in on them and that was the last stop they could drop us off; all the railroads were bombed.</span> <span id="s797">They couldn't continue with the trains.</span> <span id="s798">So they finally got us in in there, we were to be gassed there, but they didn't have any time, they had to run away themselves.</span> <span id="s799">They were closed in… I always thought Theresienstadt was a camp, the camp that they kept pretty with artists and music that people would get the impression it was nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">At the beginning, but not towards the end.</span> <span id="s801">The kept "mishlings" kept there, you know what "mishlings" are?</span> <span id="s802">Mishlings are, were German people, intermarried people, Jews , Jewish people who married to non-Jews, they were to the camp, but the children are mishlings, from an intermarried marriage, non-Jewish and Jewish children are called mishlings, so those mishlings were interned in that Theresienstadt camp at beginning.</span> <span id="s803">but later whoever they couldn't take anyplace else anymore, everything was being bombed.</span> <span id="s804">They took us away from our place, starting to get bombed, too.</span> <span id="s805">So they took us out from there, and we were along time on the trains, oh that train long train ride I'll never forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">This is from where?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">This is from Willishtal to Theresienstadt, (stop) The next day, we waited who'll be next.</span> <span id="s808">There is not much more I can tell you like, you got up in the morning, in the early hours of the morning and you had to stand until you were counted, and then they gave you your piece of bread, and then you waited for the noontime soup, and we sat around and waited for who would be called next,</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Called for what?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">For a selection, or something, you never knew if you'll be the next day there.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">(discussions returns to Auschwitz) Where did you get your number on your arm?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">When we arrived in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s813">They gave you this instead a name, was the number on the arm.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">How did they do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">They tattoo it in.</span> <span id="s816">It looks like a pen.</span> <span id="s817">With ink.</span> <span id="s818">They put it in it was very painful, like needles, Do you know what your number is?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">I have it here, 821037, and Manya has the same with 38 (821038 Manya).</span></p> <p><span id="s820">In Auschwitz, was there any attempts of resistance of people trying to leave… Nah, There was no way we could leave or get out of there.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">It was a camp within camp.</span> <span id="s822">Where could you go?</span> <span id="s823">Where could you run?</span> <span id="s824">And even if you ran outside the camp, the Poles would catch you right away and turn you in.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">The Polish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">There was no way of escaping from Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Was anyone allowed to leave the camp to do work outside the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">They had commandos taken out people to work, people who came before us had jobs to go out, they burned people, and cleaned up the ashes, and selected the clothes and the jewelry, shoes, pulled out the gold of the peoples mouth, the teeth, they accumulated all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">What happened to all that stuff?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">They took it away, the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Did you know when there were holidays going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">There were no holidays going on but we sort of tried to keep our memories alive, with keeping track of when it's Rosh Hashana, when it's Yom Kippur, when it's Sukkas; we didn't celebrate, we had no way of celebrating, but everyone tried at least to keep it in mind, How did they do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Just by counting the days and months, and we knew that right around then should be, but for years we didn't know about no holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">How was it when new people came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s835">It was the same procedure.</span> <span id="s836">They were kept under quarantine, different wirings until they got also shaved, taken away everything from them, and situated in barracks.</span> <span id="s837">In fact once they came and said they brought in a transport from France, I could get near those wires, the barbed wires, and I was going around and calling.</span> <span id="s838">Lots of people did that, lots of people had relatives in France.</span> <span id="s839">I called the family "Laks, Laks".</span> <span id="s840">So one woman came and she said, she asked me if I had family there and I said yes, and I told, and she knew the family Laks, and she told me their address where they lived, and I could see that she knew them.</span> <span id="s841">And she told me that that were also deported, but she doesn't know where they are.</span> <span id="s842">But I thought maybe I'll find Clara was in Bergen Belsen, in a different camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Were you in Bergen Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">After the war, but she was in the war at the same time when I was in Auschwitz she was in Bergen Belsen, So when you left Auschwitz, you said you were there from August, 1944 until October 1944 The end of October.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Then how did they tell you were leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">They didn't tell you are leaving, they just assembled us in a big field.</span> <span id="s847">And they called out, they took still young looking women, and we were standing all 5 of us, Manya, myself, Rusha's sister Hela, and 2 other girls we knew from Krakow, friends of theirs.</span> <span id="s848">And we always kept our 5.</span> <span id="s849">When you had to go to an "appel", you had to stand in 5s.</span> <span id="s850">And we stood together, and I was the last one, Manya in front of me and Hela in front of her, so they read our numbers, and an SS woman marked down.</span> <span id="s851">And when it came to Manya it was the last number read, "she's the last one, we don't need no more".</span> <span id="s852">And I was here in the left back bunch of people, and Manya was to go with the transport with them all.</span> <span id="s853">So after a couple of minutes, I sneaked out, I ran up and I pulled Manya by the arm, and I pulled her out to come with me back to her the end of my line.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">You pulled her out of the line, Yes, and then Manya got to be very angry with me and she kept on saying "they'll shoot us yet.</span> <span id="s855">What you did".</span></p> <p><span id="s856">What happened to the other ladies?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">The other ladies still stood in line there, Manya and I ran to the end of the line, and I said to her, "OK Hela and the other two girls will go together and you'll come with me."</span> <span id="s858">the other people , this first transport was taken out of Auschwitz and they were put on a ship.</span> <span id="s859">For three weeks, we didn't know this until the end of the war, we found out, and they were for three weeks on a ship on the Baltic Sea, and eventually they were put up in some kind of a camp, I don't know exactly where that was.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">In which country?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">In Poland, and later on when it came the end of the war, they put them back on the ship, and they traveled with them around for G-d knows how long on the boat, and they had no place where to land, and eventually when the end came near they let the whole ship go under, and they drowned all those people, 1500 people.</span> <span id="s862">Manya and I …</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Rushele's sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Yeh, this was Hela got lost, and Manya and I stayed on in Auschwitz another little while, and then they put on transport to Willishtal.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Now where is that?</span> <span id="s866">In Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Willishtal?</span> <span id="s868">In Germany.</span> <span id="s869">And from there, we stayed, What did you do there?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">We worked in ammunition factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">How did you get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s872">By train.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">In an open train, a closed train?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">For days and days, in a closed train, cattle train, 300 women.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">In one car?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Yes, I don't know if it was one car, but 300 women arrived at that camp.</span> <span id="s877">We worked in an ammunition factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">What was it like when you first got there?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Nazi women "ober off seren" and Ukrainian men, in the black uniforms.</span> <span id="s880">They were hollering, and beating and screaming.</span> <span id="s881">And then put us in barracks.</span> <span id="s882">There were two big barracks for us.</span> <span id="s883">and took us to the ammunition factory, which was within walking distance.</span> <span id="s884">And I, worked at a big machine where I used to file the hand guns, and Manya worked by something else, and we stayed there until April 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Where the conditions, how where they different?</span></p> <p><span id="s886">It was a little bit cleaner conditions, there wasn't so many people, you understand, it was only 300 people.</span> <span id="s887">One woman, I'll never forget, tried to escape from there; she was a German lady,</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Jewish, and she tried to escape, she got out one day, she ran out from work and made believe because she could speak perfect German and she wound up in the woods, and when was missing in the "appel" counting us.</span> <span id="s890">They sent out some Gestapo and dogs they caught up with her, and they bought her back.</span> <span id="s891">Did she get a beating, like you've never seen in your life.</span> <span id="s892">They put her in where the water was running where we'd get washed in that long sink, and they let the water run on her and beat her.</span> <span id="s893">And after the war, she was so black and blue, and after the war we used to talk about it.</span> <span id="s894">She survived, and after the war was a very wealthy lady, she used to come to Manya's house in NY.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">What's her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Henya Jollinger, she got married after the war, again in Berlin, and she lived in the Bronx.</span> <span id="s897">We used to see her very often.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">And there in that Willishtal, we stayed until April 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">What was the food like there?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Also a ration of bread every morning, and soup during the day.</span> <span id="s901">And also she used to beat us, and for every little thing, if you had an inch of</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">The "ober versehren", if you had already an inch of hair growing, for every little thing, she would shave it off again for you.</span> <span id="s904">It was such a setback, to be bareheaded again.</span> <span id="s905">And we tried to make the best of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Was there men there?</span></p> <p><span id="s907">No just 300 women.</span> <span id="s908">One young girl got very sick, and she died just as we were being transported to Theresienstadt, and she never saw the freedom.</span> <span id="s909">We knew she would die, she was such a gorgeous young girl, maybe 19 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">So the 300 women stayed together the whole time?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">299 women, we were transported into Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">How were you transported?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">In the cattle cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">What kind of clothes were you wearing?</span> <span id="s915">This was winter time.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Yeh, don't ask, torn shoes, whatever she could up from other people that were gassed and killed, what they sorted clothes they sent in to distribute among us.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">So what did you have to keep warm?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Nothing, I had a little coat, and a short little dress, I came in what they gave me in Auschwitz, in that.</span> <span id="s919">There in that Willishtal in the middle of the big barrack, there was an iron little stove with a big pipe.</span> <span id="s920">We could once in a while go in and wash in water our dress or water we wore, and stand, it was like a big tall black pipe hold it on the pipe and dry it.</span> <span id="s921">That was the only way of washing or cleaning it.</span> <span id="s922">But there we could wash ourselves.</span> <span id="s923">We had water to get washed every day.</span> <span id="s924">There, relatively for cleaning purposes and to keep yourself clean and washed, this was the best place yet, that Willishtal, cause there weren't so many people.</span> <span id="s925">Only 300 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Why do you think they took you from Auschwitz to this place?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">To work there.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">They needed people to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Yeh, because people died out, but there nearby was another camp from Russian prisoners of war and French prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s930">They also used to be brought in to another section of that factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">This was mostly men Yeh, young soldiers, and my master, the master, means my boss, was an older gray looking man, German?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">German, late to middle 50s, he said to me: he wasn't allowed to talk to me, Hanz was his name, and he kept on teaching me how to use those machines, so they sneaked in a few words, they wanted to know what was going on , and he said to me Where my family is?</span> <span id="s933">Why did I leave my family and go away?</span> <span id="s934">He asked me things that I couldn't really give him no answer, he said where my family leave, and why did I leave my home and family and go away to work and what happened to them?</span> <span id="s935">But we weren't allowed to talk to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Do you think they didn't know?</span> <span id="s937">The German people?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">They knew a lot what was going on.</span> <span id="s939">Because of all the wealth they kept shipping into their country, where did they get all that?</span> <span id="s940">It was all from dead people already, what they robbed all the people, all the countries, and they shipped it all into their own homes.</span> <span id="s941">And from there…</span></p> <p><span id="s942">April 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Tape #2, side 2) ) So in October of 1944 you left Willishtal, how did you leave there?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">I told you, they transported by train, did they give you a reason why?</span> <span id="s945">No, first they came and took us all in a 6 km march to the train, and they gave everybody a ration of bread to take along.</span> <span id="s946">When came there, when we arrived at the railroad, the railroads were bombed, and they couldn't put us on the train.</span> <span id="s947">So we marched back to a nearby camp which was about 2-3 km from us, and we stayed there one night.</span> <span id="s948">It was awful.</span> <span id="s949">People fought because they put in 300 extra people for the night, which made it very bad.</span> <span id="s950">People were fighting, hollering.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Were you still with Manya?</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Yes, I have to tell you such a funny incident: when they gave us the ration of bread to take along on the journey, and we had our ration of bread from the day before.</span> <span id="s953">So we start to get hungry, so I said to Manya, let us eat up the staler bread from yesterday, Manya said "No Hellishi, we'll eat up the fresh bread".</span> <span id="s954">She loves fresh bread.</span> <span id="s955">"For once in my life, let me eat up, and enough, who knows, maybe they're going to take us to the chambers, so somebody else has to eat my bread?</span> <span id="s956">Let me go at least not hungry, to be burned" And we ate up the bread.</span> <span id="s957">And on the way back we ate up all of it.</span> <span id="s958">I said, "let's keep a piece".</span> <span id="s959">And she said "No, let us eat up everything, you don't know what she's going to do with us, where they're going to take us", because they kept on coming from all the places, bombing, the Americans, the Russians, and the French.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Did you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">They kept on bombing our place, she used to close us in our barracks, we would scream and cry and holler, and she wouldn't let us out; bombs were falling all around us.</span> <span id="s962">And it didn't hurt our building, Did other people get killed in Willishtal while the bombs were falling?</span></p> <p><span id="s963">No, not from us.</span> <span id="s964">But some people got a little bit crazy, a few women got out of their mind from fear.</span> <span id="s965">So Manya said let us eat up you don't know where she's going to put us, she's got no place to go with us, so at least let us go not hungry.</span> <span id="s966">So we eat up all the bread, everything and the next day she's marching us back to our camp.</span> <span id="s967">So when we arrive in Willishtal in our camp, she makes us all stand and wait out-side, and she announces that everybody who got bread should bring the bread forward and give the bread back so the women started to hide under the arms, in the pants.</span> <span id="s968">Wherever they could, to hide the piece of bread for later on.</span> <span id="s969">So when they came for her, they tried to feel you and to check you out, and if they found the bread she took it away.</span> <span id="s970">she smacked you, they hit you really bad and shaved off the little bit of hair again that you had.</span> <span id="s971">So when it Manya and me to come there, we didn't have any.</span> <span id="s972">So we walked just by, and Manya said to me: "see, just for once you listened to me".</span> <span id="s973">We were the benefactors today, it's really funny the way I listened and we ate up all the bread.</span> <span id="s974">For once we were really not hungry, we ate up all we had and the others tried to save, they figured maybe she won't find it on me, and when she found it, don't ask what she did to them.</span> <span id="s975">So we really always talk about it, Manya and I, about that incident with the bread on that march.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">We stayed for several another couple of weeks, and it was getting very bad again, and the railroad was fixed, so this is when we marched again to the railroad, she put us on, we went to Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">How long did that ride take?</span></p> <p><span id="s978">It took also a long time, at least 4-5 days, and we had no water, nothing.</span> <span id="s979">So one day, I'll never forget that, we stopped by water, like a river, some kind of a body of water.</span> <span id="s980">So not too many people could get out of the car.</span> <span id="s981">So I went out, the younger women.</span> <span id="s982">Manya couldn't go out, so I went out and few other women and we ran down and we took off what we could take off and wet it.</span> <span id="s983">We wet it and we drank what we could drink, and we brought back soaking wet towels, and kept it in the mouth to refresh yourselves and gave the other people who couldn't get out.</span> <span id="s984">To suck on the wet towels, to have a little bit of moisture.</span> <span id="s985">You know when you're thirsty it's worse than when you're hungry, when you don't have water, you suffer more than from hunger.</span> <span id="s986">Than if you don't have bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">So when eventually when we arrived in Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">What did it look like there?</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Ah, there it looked very good, my G-d it looked much better than all the other places we had been.</span> <span id="s990">There were military barracks that used to be for soldiers, years and years ago, and they kept there the people.</span> <span id="s991">We lived in one room, there were about 10 people we were, also on beds, bunk beds.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">So you got there in October, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">No, in April, to Theresienstadt</span></p> <p><span id="s994">In April, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">No April 45, To Willishtal we came in the end of 1944.</span> <span id="s996">And we stayed there until early 1945, and in 45, like I told you, she tried to transport us and it didn't work out, and eventually when we arrived there, it wasn't too long because… What did you do there?</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Nothing…that was the final place where they were going to gas us.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">They had gas chambers there?</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Yes, they were gassing people there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Even from your 300 women?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">No, not from us.</span> <span id="s1002">But they were gassing people already before there, but this was their sole purpose in dropping us off there, so we should get gassed there.</span> <span id="s1003">But then it was getting too late for them, and the Russians arrived, and they were on the run.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">I'll never forget the day when we were liberated What do you mean when the Russians arrived?</span> <span id="s1005">How did they arrive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">On tanks, on foot.</span> <span id="s1007">The Russians came and liberated us.</span> <span id="s1008">And the Germans ran with the people who started to live around there and even the Czech people that were for the Russians started to run.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">The Russians were coming in and the Germans were running away… and then we all broke out of the barracks and went out to see what's going on .</span> <span id="s1010">and we saw some dead Germans laying on the highway, people took revenge and killed them.</span> <span id="s1011">and some Germans lay dead, around the highways.</span> <span id="s1012">People started to run crazy and the Russians started to give out food, a lot of people started to eat very fast, they were hungry, lots of people got diarrhea, dysentery and died right after the liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Could you speak to the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Manya could speak in Russian.</span> <span id="s1015">We used to go and take food to a friend of my father's son, was also liberated in Czechoslovakia, he was such a tall lovely boy, he was swollen and very ill, and we took over food, because Gershon Frydman was in a children's camp there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">How did you know he was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">I found him one day when I ran out of the camp to go around and call up to windows and to people and to see, if somebody…to call out names.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">In the village?</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">In Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Post-war Conditions You still stayed in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Oh sure, we couldn't go no place, so another couple of girls and myself went out we went to different camps, different barracks, and call up and say is there so and so, and so and so by the name, we tried to call and see if there's some people who survived.</span> <span id="s1022">Relatives friends, a sister, we never knew how bad it was so many people did not survive.</span> <span id="s1023">Mina from Sweden, she came to the window, she sick with the typhus.</span> <span id="s1024">I found on the street walking Gershon Frydman, he was so skinny, thin hands and thin legs, so skinny.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">He's about your age?</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">3 years younger, he was later on with young boys, 15-16, he looked about 15-16 years old when he was 22 and he was in that "kinderheim".</span> <span id="s1027">They got a little better food, so he used to bring and go over to me and Manya some good food and we would take it to my friend's Father's son, was so sick, and to Mina, she as so sick with typhus, and one day we came, the Russians wouldn't let you in so we shouldn't contact sicknesses, so Manya talked to them in Russian and finally they let us in, a couple of times to that Rachmielchik Tannenbaum, was his name, and we came in one day, and was already covered up, he already died in the night.</span> <span id="s1028">And we used to take food often to Mina Weinberg, and then after 2-3 weeks.</span> <span id="s1029">We got on a transport that went back to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">What do you mean by a transport?</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">They tried to arrange for people who want to go back to Germany, to Poland, where ever people came from, so Manya and I and a lot of other people…</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">What about Gershon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Gershon went with the "kinderheim" from Czechoslovakia to England.</span> <span id="s1034">They sent a "kinderheim" transport to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">How did you ever know you'd have contact with him again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Because he went to England and I gave him my aunt's and relative's names.</span> <span id="s1037">You see I remembered the names, and he stayed in Bloomsbury House which was a very rich organization, a Jewish organization Bloomsbury House in London, and they took care on those refugee children.</span> <span id="s1038">And he told them he was looking for relatives, because his Mother was a cousin to my aunt.</span> <span id="s1039">So they gave them the numbers, and they put him contact with my relatives, and he told them that I am alive, that's how I got in contact with them.</span> <span id="s1040">They had a son, he was a major in British army and he was he stationed somewhere in Europe, I am not sure where, either was in Italy or Germany, and he got in touch with me.</span> <span id="s1041">And he sent a girl from the UNWRA that she should give me clothes, but that was already when I was in Bergen Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Manya and Mom went on transport to Poland, to Krakow, and there when we arrived, we just met Nathan, was a young little boy, 15-16, Just walking the streets?</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">No, we, Manya went back to where she lived once and they were living there in one of the rooms.</span> <span id="s1044">And Yoshu went to Theresienstadt he heard some people were in Theresienstadt liberated, and someone told him he thinks Manya Neuwirth was there.</span> <span id="s1045">So he went to Theresienstadt when we arrived in Krakow.</span> <span id="s1046">A few days later he came, and we all lived there together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">So you stayed in Krakow?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">For not to long.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Was it bombed there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">No, Krakow wasn't bombed, we stayed there not too long, maybe 2-3 weeks.</span> <span id="s1051">And then I went to back home to my town</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">To Szydlowiec To Szydlowiec and I told you when I went to this Gentile lady, the one we gave all this stuff.</span> <span id="s1053">My parents gave her all this stuff, and she said maybe some of my children will survive and come back, you give them some, so when I came and opened her door to the other room, there was our bedroom, beddings, and sofa and everything, and our beautiful bed spreads, so I said to her, can you give me something, and she said "no, not today", can you give me some bread and potatoes.</span> <span id="s1054">"No", she said "you come back tomorrow".</span> <span id="s1055">So there were some friends of ours that had also survived the war and they lived in Szydlowiec for the first few weeks, and they said, "we'll chain you to bed, you're not going there tomorrow, because if you go back, they’ll cut your throat.</span> <span id="s1056">That's what they did the Poles, If you came back after the war and you asked for something you had given them to put away, they killed you, they cut the throats of the people.</span> <span id="s1057">So I didn't stay there too long.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Was there an organization that you could go to and leave your name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">No, yes.</span> <span id="s1060">In Krakow they made a Jewish "kuldes gemeindeh", means like a Jewish center, where you could go and put your name on a Board there.</span> <span id="s1061">And if someone came, you always looked up on the board, and I always thought maybe my husband would live through, somebody, my brother I knew won't, but maybe my sisters, if they'll see my name, but nobody came.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">On that board, you could only put your name, you couldn't put where you were going.</span> <span id="s1063">No, you could only put your name.</span> <span id="s1064">But at least if the people knew you lived, there was a chance to find yourself.</span> <span id="s1065">If you were alive, but if the name wasn't there, you had no chance of finding no one.</span> <span id="s1066">From there we went, from Szydlowiec, I ran away, and I went to Lodz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">With some friends,</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Not with Manya.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Manya stayed in Krakow, and I went to Lodz, stayed by Rusha and Hershele, and her cousin was a boy, Natan Starck, he lives in California, and I talked to him when I was to visit you.</span> <span id="s1071">He worked with Russians after the war, he was in some kind of organization with the Russians.</span> <span id="s1072">He had a nice apartment there.</span> <span id="s1073">So You remember Harry Langer in California?</span> <span id="s1074">He gave me the salt and pepper, , his wife and her two sisters, they also survived the war.</span> <span id="s1075">Their father and my father were partners in the shoe business before the war.</span> <span id="s1076">We were very friendly, We all stayed in Natan Starck's apartment, and Rusha and Hershele, I stayed with them till I went away to Bergen Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Why did you decide , Because Bergen Belsen was the British zone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Was Bergen Belsen in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">No, in Germany, the British had settled there.</span> <span id="s1080">So I went there with the mind to find out about my relatives, and in fact I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">In Bergen Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Yes.</span> <span id="s1083">Because my cousin Pat… How did you find out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Cause Gershon got them in touch with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Oh, you mean your relatives in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Gershon Frydman, and my cousin Pat Patashnik found me.</span> <span id="s1087">He sent some people to me and then they sent me papers and I went to England, that's why I didn’t want to go to Israel or America, or Australia, but I wanted to go to England where I have my Father's sister, and I also got in touch with the French cousins through them the English relatives, they wrote the French cousins and they started to write to me, they also wrote to me they wanted me to come to Paris, but they were also in bad shape, they also had come back from the war, from the camps, so I figured I better go to my aunt in England.</span> <span id="s1088">This is where I went.</span> <span id="s1089">And her son sent me papers, that rich cousin Bob.</span> <span id="s1090">So that's that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Were you suffering from any illnesses?</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A Well, I was, in one of the camps, in Willishtal, the woman pulled all my teeth out, because I had toothache for a few weeks, and I was afraid to go in.</span> <span id="s1093">and one time I was very ill with bronchitis and laryngitis, but you were afraid to go and tell.</span> <span id="s1094">And once in Plaszow, I was once very ill and I was in the "krankenstub", sort of a semi-hospital, for about two weeks.</span> <span id="s1095">I had no major illnesses like typhus or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Any emotional illnesses or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Of course, who didn't, emotional everyone had.</span> <span id="s1098">Crying, especially when you saw this one found a husband, this one found a brother, a sister or a father, and I didn't find no body.</span> <span id="s1099">I was just left alone.</span> <span id="s1100">It was a very hard time for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Afterwards were you ever in a DP camp, displaced person?</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">That was Bergen Belsen Was that open you could come and go when you wanted at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">No, not really open, because first of all you had no access of traveling or going, you had to have someone take you; you had to have written papers to go outside the camp.</span> <span id="s1104">but I had no place to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">So you just stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">I just stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">I came there in early 1946, because in August, 1946, I went away to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">In middle of August, 1946, I left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">What did you do there for so many months?</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Nothing, you couldn't do, there was no work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Some people had jobs in kitchens, but you had to have the privilege to be working, go 2-3 times a day to the kitchen to get our bread and soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Who were you with then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">There was Edzia, and her father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">How did you find Edzia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">She was liberated in Bergen Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">So when you got there, you found her there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">I found her and her father, was liberated was liberated in Stenchehov with Yoshue together and he came to Lodz and to Krakow.</span> <span id="s1119">We all went to Bergen Belsen.</span> <span id="s1120">and we stayed lots of people, Rusha was there.</span> <span id="s1121">I stayed with Rusha and Hershele till I went away to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">How did you find out about your Mother and everyone that you didn't find anyone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">From my Father I knew that he died, Haskele was living there, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">I found Haskele in Bergen Belsen, in the same block, he told me told me that my Father died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">He saw it happen?</span> <span id="s1126">How did your Father die?</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">He died from hunger, he was swollen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">And where was he at?</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">in Skarzyko that big "arbeit" camp near Szydlowiec.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">And your Mother and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">They went with the transportation.</span> <span id="s1132">If they didn't come back after a year, you could find nothing out, so it was obvious that they didn't live through.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Were there any organizations that you went to for help in finding people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">You went in every town wherever you were you went to look up on the boards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Was there an organization with a name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">They formed Jewish centers, where people congregated.</span> <span id="s1137">Lodz was one big one, everyone in Poland who lived through knew to come to Krakow or to Lodz the big cities and there you could find out if someone lived through, if you had somebody or some relatives living.</span> <span id="s1138">That's how you found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">So from there in Bergen Belsen in 1946 how, those people in England gave you… My cousins sent me papers, and they gave me, the Joint sent me to England.</span> <span id="s1140">Joint Distribution was a Jewish organization, I stayed with my aunt in Luton Bradford, till the end of the year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Till the end of 1946 This is where I built my courage up.</span> <span id="s1142">The whole thing was, Gershon Boiman from Columbus, Ohio, he got married, and you didn't know Carol's mother, Helenka, gave me a letter to take to England to send off to some relatives.</span> <span id="s1143">She didn't know if they were relatives but they were the same name as her maiden name, she was from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1144">and she found out that those people were also from Warsaw, maybe they are my relatives, so she gave me a letter for those people.</span> <span id="s1145">it was the same name, her name was Volgroff, and she gave me a letter addressed to these people, and I sent this letter off to these people to London, and I lived outside London, so these people called up to my aunt's house and they came out to visit me, one day, one Sunday.</span> <span id="s1146">Then they invited me in to London should come and visit them.</span> <span id="s1147">So one day, on a Sunday I went and bought myself a railroad ticket and I went into London and they met the station, cause I could speak very little English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">I started to learn English.</span> <span id="s1149">I started to learn English already in Bergen Belsen, There were classes to learn English?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">Yes, they gave classes in Hebrew and English, and I went and I took all those.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">When I came there I stayed with them for a couple of days, and they asked me if I like it, if I am happy by my aunt.</span> <span id="s1152">I started to cry.</span> <span id="s1153">So they said OK, tell us what's going on and they had a Warsaw man, a butcher, who bought them to England just before the war came, when they had to leave Germany.</span> <span id="s1154">And he came up and he said would you like to go to work?</span> <span id="s1155">What can you do, so I said I know how to sew.</span> <span id="s1156">And they needed a lot of people for sewing.</span> <span id="s1157">They couldn't find enough people for work.</span> <span id="s1158">So he said I have a couple of friends, customers in the butcher shop who have sewing factories, I 'm going to see what I can do.</span> <span id="s1159">There was a Russian family Shetock, and he called on those people and they said they would take me but I was an alien, and you're not allowed to go to work, and here my relatives bought me that would be their responsibility, so I won't be a burden to the British government.</span> <span id="s1160">It's the same like here, when you sponsor somebody, to bring over to this country, you are their sponsor.</span> <span id="s1161">So this Mr. Shetock was in partnership with another man, Mr. Gross, an American man.</span> <span id="s1162">Not American, English I said.</span> <span id="s1163">He Went to the Home Office in London and made out for me papers so that I can stay permanently in England and that I should have the right to work, and that they will employ me.</span> <span id="s1164">That they are willing to employ me, give me a job.</span> <span id="s1165">And that's how I started.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Were your relatives angry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">When I came to England, people had ration cards.</span> <span id="s1168">You had to buy bread, sugar, potatoes, meat, an egg, cooking fat, everything on rations.</span> <span id="s1169">So when I came, naturally I got a ration card because my cousins bought me over, and they got an extra card for me.</span> <span id="s1170">and I gave my card to my aunt so when she went to the grocery store, she could pick up my rations for very little money, so she had my ration card, and when I was ready, when I went in a few times and met these people and they took care of all the papers for me, and they got me the job and took care in the Home Office, that I should be allowed to work and everything was right.</span> <span id="s1171">So I came back and I said to my aunt, Aunt Idel, I found a job in London and I think I want to go to work and make a living.</span> <span id="s1172">She got very angry at me.</span> <span id="s1173">I'll never forget the words she said to me: "we struggled to bring you over and now you're going to work for other people".</span> <span id="s1174">That was the answer.</span> <span id="s1175">Because I saw no future sitting there and scrubbing floors and washing dishes, and go from her house to her daughter's house, and from her daughter's being sent here and taking care on the laundry and fixing clothes, and babysit.</span> <span id="s1176">I said once "I would like to go and learn English" she said "what do you need to learn English for, I've lived here for 40 years and I don't speak English".</span> <span id="s1177">I said-that's very nice but I was 24 and I wanted to learn English and I knew I was going to live in an English speaking country, so I can't go on like this, so I tried to read the newspapers, but how much can you make sense when you're reading and you don't know too well.</span> <span id="s1178">So she got very angry.</span> <span id="s1179">She got a little nasty.</span> <span id="s1180">I packed up my couple of shmattas that I had, and I asked her for my ration card.</span> <span id="s1181">I figured I am going to live in London with these people, they'll house me, I'll pay them a rent, and I'll go to work.</span> <span id="s1182">So I asked her for my ration card, and I didn't understand, didn't know what it's all about.</span> <span id="s1183">so I took the ration card and I gave it to these people.</span> <span id="s1184">They look in when I come back and they said to me, "HHHella, I'm sorry to tell you, that your rations for the whole month ahead have been collected, taken".</span> <span id="s1185">I couldn't absorb it at first, what she means, so she explained to me, I was so upset, so sad over it, and I felt so ashamed that she was so cheap that she could do that, but these people said to me, never-the-less, don't worry, you're not going to go hungry.</span> <span id="s1186">You're not going to starve.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">So later on I also got registered with this butcher for the rations and downtown, where I worked in a grocery store.</span> <span id="s1188">Mr. Gross's wife, a non- Jewish lady, an English girl, very nice, she was very kind to me and she started to teach me English.</span> <span id="s1189">And you'll be surprised how well I did, and they were so happy and pleased with my sewing, with my work.</span> <span id="s1190">And they were very good to me.</span> <span id="s1191">I could say that.</span> <span id="s1192">Then I used to buy for myself food even on the black market, without the rations.</span> <span id="s1193">I could afford to go buy a piece of salami, and a piece of meat.</span> <span id="s1194">And a piece of butter extra.</span> <span id="s1195">I didn't have to just live....</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Where you still living in that room?</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Later on I moved to Mrs. Ziering, they were friends of these people.</span> <span id="s1198">And they had a big house and I took a furnished room by the Ziering's, this is when I moved.</span> <span id="s1199">I worked already, I had a very good position, a good job downtown in London, in Oxford Street in a sample house in a high class section, where I met Mrs. Brown and her husband, and she brought us, I was very friendly with them, and she invited me very often for supper.</span> <span id="s1200">And then in one place I worked with June's mother, with Grace, I was very friendly with them and they used to invite me often.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Tape 3, side 1, #5)) In 1951, then I started to write with Manya, we wrote all the time, I wrote to Manya.</span> <span id="s1202">In 1951, Manya got Giza and Adolph to send me papers.</span> <span id="s1203">And they asked me to,,, When did Manya come to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">1949.</span> <span id="s1205">And I came in 1951 to America.</span> <span id="s1206">I was just about to go and fill out papers to become a British citizen.</span> <span id="s1207">And I figured, nah, I'm going away.</span> <span id="s1208">Manya insisted very much to my coming, she wanted very much I should come.</span> <span id="s1209">so I figured I've got no one there to keep me, and I figured I have more here in America, relative-wise than there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Your cousins?</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">They never bothered to find out what do I do or where I went, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1212">But I used to write with Klara from Paris.</span> <span id="s1213">And then I came to America.</span> <span id="s1214">And I lived there with Manya for four weeks they didn't let me go to work.</span> <span id="s1215">They were very good to me.</span> <span id="s1216">Then I went and got a very good job.</span> <span id="s1217">Through friends of Manya's in a tailoring factory.</span> <span id="s1218">I took a furnished room, in same house upstairs.</span> <span id="s1219">But I only went up to sleep, I used to eat and cook with them, with Manya, Yoshue and Nathan.</span> <span id="s1220">We did our household together.</span> <span id="s1221">Then I stayed all day down, I only went up to wash, bathe, shower and to sleep upstairs.</span> <span id="s1222">That's how it all came about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">How did the war influence your values?</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">In what respect?</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">I guess about religion.</span> <span id="s1226">Money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Religion-wise, it made my beliefs so much stronger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">They did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1230">Not to be fanatical religious, but for what you stand and what you are.</span> <span id="s1231">It made my beliefs so much stronger.</span> <span id="s1232">Because you lose so much and suffer so much for what you are.</span> <span id="s1233">And that's exactly what we did.</span> <span id="s1234">We were persecuted for what we were, you lost everybody for that matter, so you don't feel you want to abandon and change like some people changed their religion.</span> <span id="s1235">Did you see on television a few weeks ago that a French man became the bishop of Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">What do mean about my morals?</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">Your values of life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">Well in that respect, Marilyn, a person's morals and religious feelings becomes much stronger for what you went through.</span> <span id="s1239">Don't you see?</span> <span id="s1240">For what the price you paid for, for what you lost, and what you believe, and what you were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">But since you lost so much don't you feel bitter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">I feel bitter, I never gave that up I never recovered from that.</span> <span id="s1243">But there is nothing that can be done about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">What kept you going?</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">It's a very hard question to answer, what kept me going.</span> <span id="s1246">When you live through all those horrors and now not to keep on going, so what’s the purpose?</span> <span id="s1247">And after all what you go through, and finally settle down and want to start a new life, and a new home, that was everybody's aim, and everybody's ambition, including my own.</span> <span id="s1248">So you started out fresh after all that.</span> <span id="s1249">I went and I found work, and I started to work, try and settle down and accomplish something in life, be somebody, that was the only way to do it.</span> <span id="s1250">You don't go back.</span> <span id="s1251">You keep on going forward.</span> <span id="s1252">No matter what.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">Did you talk about your experiences with anybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Mostly only with people when we get together, that we have in common a lot.</span> <span id="s1255">You don't talk too much… I never talked to much with British people or even American people; you only talk your experiences… because they are all on the same level with people who went through the similar situations, we have a lot in common and we can understand each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">So you met Dad in New York and got married in America Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">What was your motivation in wanting to have more children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">I wanted to have a new family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">What kind of values did you still try to transmit?</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Having a close relationship with your parents and your children, this is the number thing in a family that should exist.</span> <span id="s1261">To be close, and love and respect for one another; when a situation arises comes on and some difficulties in life, sickness or no matter what, we all stand together, shoulder to shoulder.</span> <span id="s1262">That's what the most important thing and I think I accomplished that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">You think so?</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">I definitely think so.100% nobody has.</span> <span id="s1265">Could say I did.</span> <span id="s1266">That's all right.</span> <span id="s1267">Lots of things to cry for Did you join any survivor's organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">At first there weren't any.</span> <span id="s1269">But there was one, I used to get literature, it was sort of a Polish, I have some literature from New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1272">It's called the Polish "Jewish Combatants" something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">That's the magazine I sent you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">I used to belong with them years ago.</span> <span id="s1275">After the war everybody sort of registered with them…Out here there isn't too much to be active with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Why did you want to join?</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">You always keep abreast with all the news.</span> <span id="s1278">Among people not just myself.</span> <span id="s1279">What's taking place.</span> <span id="s1280">Here in NJ not much, to get news Did you apply for reparations?</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Yes I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Why get reparations?</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">You mean to get compensation money?</span> <span id="s1284">Because they asked you to register, then they sent letters to people like myself that we should fill out,</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Who is they?</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">The West German government after the war, and they wanted to know where we were and what you did and they sent you a certain amount of money for the work you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">For the work you did for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">It was like next to nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">People had the privilege to go to a Dr. and be examined and they gave a diagnosis, what is wrong with a lot of the people; of course I had some damage that they pulled my teeth out when I was so young, and they gave me some compensation money, a few hundred dollars,700 $ for pulling my teeth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">But you still get money from Germany now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Yes, that's a pension, it's called a pension for Life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">For what reason?</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">For the work I did and health damages because they took away the years that I could have gone maybe to school and learned something or do something for myself, they took away best years that a person achieves in their early adulthood.</span> <span id="s1294">Lots of people like myself never had a chance to do anything with ourselves.</span> <span id="s1295">So they are paying a certain amount of compensation money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">And here you spoke mostly Yiddish at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">We raised you and Harry in Yiddish, you could hardly speak English when you first started school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">How come you chose not to speak Polish here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Because I'm very angry at the Polish people.</span> <span id="s1300">I don't see no purpose why their language should be used in my house, or their presence should be alive in my home.</span> <span id="s1301">If I could erase all memories of ever living in Poland or being Polish, I would.</span> <span id="s1302">So why should I have to speak it in my home.</span> <span id="s1303">I'd rather speak English than Polish.</span> <span id="s1304">Lots of people do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">What did you try to communicate to us your children about the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">When you were little not too much.</span> <span id="s1307">What can you explain to little children, when you're2, 3, 4 even 5 years old.</span> <span id="s1308">But when you started to get older and you started to ask me questions, little by little… What kind of questions did we ask?</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Once you came up and saw other kids have a grand mom, and you said "where is my grand mom"?</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">Because at first Uncle Herman and Tanta Eda used to say we'll be the grandmother and grandfather for you and Harry, but you called them aunt and uncle, which is right, they are; then one day you asked "how come I have a grandma and a grandpa".</span> <span id="s1311">This is when I started to explain, little by little, you got a little older, you probably used to see things on television, or read, and this is how, and I used to show you pictures.</span> <span id="s1312">And this is when I started to tell you little by little the story.</span> <span id="s1313">You can't come out and tell children a story what happened in 5-6 years when they are little yet.</span> <span id="s1314">It has to grow on you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Do you think it was important to tell about it or do you think you should have not said anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1317">I thought it was most essential that the children should know</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Why is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">Because they should know what has happened, why you don't have a grandma and a grandpa, and aunts and uncles, and different relatives like other Americans people have, and also important for future, what can happen.</span> <span id="s1320">You should know about it, and if my children and my children's children won't know about it, then the whole thing will be forgotten.</span> <span id="s1321">And it shouldn't, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">How would that make you feel if you noticed it was forgotten?</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">I would be very sad about it.</span> <span id="s1324">If it should be erased.</span> <span id="s1325">Because anything like this can happen anytime happen, anyplace.</span> <span id="s1326">Again.</span> <span id="s1327">It is very sad to think so, but unfortunately it is the truth.</span> <span id="s1328">And the way things go you can tell what's happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Do you think another Holocaust can happen?</span> <span id="s1330">Do you think it's possible?</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">Oh Yeh,</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">Why is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">The way the Neo-Nazis rise, and with the Ku Klux Klan in this country, and altogether the way the situation is in America now, it is very easy to play on the people, the population.</span> <span id="s1334">And they always have to have a scapegoat, if it will be the Jews, the Cubans; it will be the Black people they will always find someone to blame for the situation.</span> <span id="s1335">Isn't that the truth?</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">Let us hope it won't happen.</span> <span id="s1337">I just hope it won't.</span> <span id="s1338">The way things are at the present, it isn't too good.</span> <span id="s1339">The future is very sad looking right now.</span> <span id="s1340">It was very good when I came in 1951, it was very good.</span> <span id="s1341">But Anti-Semitic situations come up in all parts of the world, and America is no exception.</span> <span id="s1342">Now it is very, very much on the rise.</span> <span id="s1343">Lots of other people can feel it the same way in all parts of the country.</span> <span id="s1344">Don't you feel it and see it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">Now you have a question!</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Well I feel it and I read and listen to news the same like everybody else.</span> <span id="s1347">Of course, it hurts very much.</span> <span id="s1348">People like myself to see that something like this could occur again, it's very sad, it's very painful.</span> <span id="s1349">But I tell you one thing; I wouldn't go through it another time, never.</span> <span id="s1350">I would never go through it another time.</span> <span id="s1351">I wouldn't give them a chance to do what they want to do.</span> <span id="s1352">I know what to do myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">What kind of feelings do you have about this country that you live in now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">I think America is a wonderful country.</span> <span id="s1355">It's a beautiful country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">If somebody has the ability and the willingness and the opportunity to work.</span> <span id="s1357">You can be anything in this country; you have the opportunities for all that here.</span> <span id="s1358">More than anyplace in the world.</span> <span id="s1359">Where but America can you come with no money, nothing, and make a home and a business and be counted for an American.</span> <span id="s1360">Where else can you do that?</span> <span id="s1361">It's really the greatest country in the whole world!</span> <span id="s1362">Unfortunately not too many American people can see that.</span> <span id="s1363">they down America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Does that bother you when they do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">It does, it does.</span> <span id="s1366">They don't know the difference, they act like spoiled children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">They never knew what a war is, they never saw fighting, they've never been in no camps or places to suffer, to see, and they think it's coming to them; they think that's how it can be always, but unfortunately it isn't so.</span> <span id="s1368">And they take everything for granted in this country.</span> <span id="s1369">Many a times I told American people all to do to appreciate their own land, their own country is to go outside go out to other countries, to see the way people live, the way people work, what they have from their work, and they'll come running back and kiss the ground.</span> <span id="s1370">Because in other countries average working people don't have all working people have here.</span> <span id="s1371">I am not talking about wealthy business people, working class people own a beautiful home, TVs and cars, push button stoves and push button this and push button that.</span> <span id="s1372">No place in the world has like here with so little.</span> <span id="s1373">And they give you the opportunity to work, pay and enjoy things, the luxury of things.</span> <span id="s1374">In other countries in a lifetime people cannot achieve this.</span> <span id="s1375">What they can achieve here in the very first few years when they start to work and building a home.</span> <span id="s1376">There you grow old and die before you achieve anything.</span> <span id="s1377">In any of the European countries, you don't have to go far and look, I know how it was back home and I know how it is even now.</span> <span id="s1378">With the progressive world people.</span> <span id="s1379">People don't have that much.</span> <span id="s1380">No one that we know.</span> <span id="s1381">Although our home isn't that elaborate, but do any of our relatives in Europe live like we live here, or in Israel.</span> <span id="s1382">And the people work just as hard, maybe even harder than we do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Is there anything else that you would like to add that hasn't been covered by these questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">Not really.</span> <span id="s1385">The only thing I would add is that this a wonderful thing for One Generation After.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">That they created an organizations like this, to keep young people aware what has been and what can be.</span> <span id="s1387">And they should carry on the memory of their grandparents and relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">How did you feel about me asking these questions, Mom?</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">It's a hard thing answer.</span> <span id="s1390">You have to compose yourself a lot.</span> <span id="s1391">You have to… It's hard to go back to those things, although I never even one day in the year or in a week stop thinking about it, it's hard to dig back to all those little details, and then it comes to mind people that never made it.</span> <span id="s1392">Like me even.</span> <span id="s1393">And hope it never happens that my children, any for that matter, none of the people in the whole world never have to go through something like that situation.</span> <span id="s1394">It's not a thing that can be erased from your memory or you heart.</span> <span id="s1395">You have to live with this.</span> <span id="s1396">The rest of your life.</span> <span id="s1397">It's not an easy thing to go through your life when you had parents, sisters, brother, aunts and uncles, and you have no one.</span> <span id="s1398">It's not an easy thing to go through life alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">In what way do you think the Holocaust has affected the course of your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">In what respect do you mean, in the course of my life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">How would things have been different?</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">Well, I would have lived in some town back home in Poland, I would have lived nearer to my parents.</span> <span id="s1403">I would have had the privilege of having parents much longer.</span> <span id="s1404">My parents were very young people.</span> <span id="s1405">My parents never lived the day to be 50.</span> <span id="s1406">And that's awful when I think about it.</span> <span id="s1407">And I'm going to be already 60.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Let me ask you one more question.</span> <span id="s1409">You know the necklace you gave me, with the little diamonds.</span> <span id="s1410">Where did you get it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">I bought this for some ration, crackers in Bergen Belsen, by some people who came in to clean and do work and things.</span> <span id="s1412">German people used to come in because they were poor, they didn't have what to eat; so they used to bring in I gave them rations, crackers and stuff like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Is there anything else you want to add to this, Mom?</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Shall I turn it off?</span> <span id="s1416">Thank-you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">Was it a good interview?</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">I think it went well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">She met me in Plaszow, walking crying on the street, two months, 3-4 months before I had lost my husband and lost my baby, and I came there and I had nothing.</span> <span id="s1420">She saw me walk on the street, cri, and she called me to her bunk bed.</span> <span id="s1421">She and her husband so good to me.</span> <span id="s1422">Used to give me a piece of bread, piece of some soup.</span> <span id="s1423">Her husband used to go out with a commando and go outside Plaszow, in the city.</span> <span id="s1424">And bring home a "bissel" soup or piece of extra bread; they would share that with me.</span> <span id="s1425">They could have sold it for a diamond, for a gold ring, Marilyn, but they would give a little extra food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">Why did they decide to go to Sweden?</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">After the war,…I really don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">Mom, Why was it so important for you to teach us Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">Because I wanted it should be carried on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">Did Dad feel the same way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">Yes, in fact Dad and I would speak Yiddish among ourselves.</span> <span id="s1432">Yes, I speak English but I feel Yiddish should never die in a Jewish home.</span> <span id="s1433">And you should not be ashamed of it.</span> <span id="s1434">Look what we paid for it.</span> <span id="s1435">For what we were born and raised to be.</span> <span id="s1436">Why should we abandon it?</span> <span id="s1437">Why shouldn't we live it as Jews?</span> <span id="s1438">Don't have to be fanatically religious and orthodox and separate yourself from people, you understand?</span> <span id="s1439">But you can be a Jew in so many different ways.</span> <span id="s1440">And a good Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">Did you feel that the people in this community in South Jersey, not the people you knew with your experiences in Europe, but the people from here, felt the same… In many ways, I would say that mostly the Polish Jews, the Polish survivors feel the same way would think so.</span> <span id="s1442">All the people that we know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">Hebrew school and keep the Yiddishe atmosphere at home, all the people around here, You name one that is not.</span> <span id="s1444">Right?</span> <span id="s1445">The Gelmans, the Lifshins, the Zyndorfs, the Ehrlichs, although their children many of them went different ways, they chose different paths, they chose different ways to live their lives, but never the less their parents gave them the right approach to it.</span> <span id="s1446">Don't you think so?</span> <span id="s1447">You know, you know it, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">(Marilyn, Mach es aus un lome machen essen) Mom, from where do you know that song?</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">….</span>
