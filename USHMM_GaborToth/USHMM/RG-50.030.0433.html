that were running away and it was, I consider it was a business.</span> <span id="s101">So we pay and then we, we went over and then we went to a town in the south of France on the Spanish border called __________, where we stayed there until the German invaded the, the free zone, when the Americans landed in North Africa.</span> <span id="s102">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: What was, what was, for you as a child at the time, all of this moving around, what was that like for you?</span> <span id="s104">I mean, how did that...</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: The life was, was, I was________________in the back of my mind that maybe I was not going to stay there a very long time, then we move again.</span> <span id="s106">Of course when we were in free zone, it was better off because actually we were French and the Vichy(ph) government was arresting the foreigners to, to, they give them to the Germans, which I learned after the war.</span> <span id="s107">And in Lucien(ph), I had some teachers who tried to teach __________ mostly socialist people, socialist member or, but there were also anti-Semitism, you know, whatever the kids heard at home, bringing back to school and saying stories about Jews and so forth.</span> <span id="s108">For awhile we live in a hotel and after that we rented a place.</span> <span id="s109">I had my Bar Mitzvah there and I was introduced to Jewish history by a woman named Mila(ph) Raseen(ph) who became a very well known Jewish resistance member.</span> <span id="s110">She died under torture in __________ and __________, passing children to Switzerland she was caught.</span> <span id="s111">Mila(ph) Raseen(ph).</span> <span id="s112">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Do you remember feeling a lot of fear and anger or, how would you describe and what did you talk about with your family, about what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: Well, during that year, until the German came in the free zone, I wouldn't say we felt completely safe, but the Germans were not there, so we, we thought, __________ we could survive the war there.</span> <span id="s115">But the Vichy(ph) government was anti-Semitic because you know they, they put, in effect, regulation that the German did ask them for.</span> <span id="s116">We try, for awhile we wanted to go to Spain.</span> <span id="s117">Since we were __________ we heard that the Spanish, the Jews from Spanish origin, if they cross over to Spain they would not be taken back to the French, but we didn't pursue that because there were too many children, we had to go over the mountains, so we didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: How many were you altogether in your family at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Well, that time there when we left, when we left________________there, when the German arrived, we were, we were nine children, yeah, nine children.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: And your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Each of, each of my uncles my uncles had, let's see, two, eight children, eight children, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: So eight children and then your mother and your two uncles and their wives?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: My mother, my two uncles and my and my aunt, yeah and my grandfather.</span> <span id="s124">My grandfather, yeah.</span> <span id="s125">Later on I'll give you, I'll give you an event that took place when the Gestapo arrested us and there was a deal.</span> <span id="s126">Part of the deal was that either myself or my grandfather would have to go with them.</span> <span id="s127">Where to be, go, go back with the Germans, to be shipped to Dollsee(ph).</span> <span id="s128">But that was the choice that was given and from what I'm told, they thought that since I was younger than my grandfather, I had a better chance to survive and I've been a little upset by this during my life because I think it was unjust.</span> <span id="s129">But that's history, you can't tell.</span> <span id="s130">I came back alive, but he would not have come back alive.</span> <span id="s131">But I came back alive, deeply marked.</span> <span id="s132">If I would not have been deported, I would have been a different man.</span> <span id="s133">I think I've marked, I have been marked much more because I went there very young.</span> <span id="s134">Some adults, maybe had their character formed already and it was not as, as strong effect on them as it was on me.</span> <span id="s135">Then when the German came, in November 1942,________________week later, the whole zone along the Spanish border was declared a forbidden zone, especially for the Jews and we left.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: So you left Lucien(ph) at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: Yeah and we heard about the Italians protecting the Jews and so we went, we crossed France all over and we went to Nice.</span> <span id="s138">We went to Nice and there were the Italians and it was another atmosphere.</span> <span id="s139">We stayed in a hotel there for awhile and then we move in ___________, which was also in Italian zone, up in the mountains.</span> <span id="s140">The northern Alps, northern Alps.</span> <span id="s141">Oh, it was also __________, so we found an hotel to stay at and we went in a house.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Let me ask you, this may seem a strange question, but do you remember any happy times with your family during all of this travel, with all of these children and...</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: Well, the happy times were the time I was in Lucien and I had my Bar Mitzvah and I had that women Raseen(ph), Mila(ph) Raseen(ph) and teaching us Zionism and Jewish history and putting actually strength in our young minds.</span> <span id="s144">And I had friends, I had many, I had many Jewish friends, because we were many Jews that were there, running away and Lucien was also a nice place, it was the mountain we went.</span> <span id="s145">We went on hikes, there was snow in the winter, we... But I remember an event that never left me, it must have been the summer 1942 when we went out of sports, playing soccer and when we finished and it was outside town a little bit, was a, a __________, a few guys, a few children that wanted to see how I was circumcised, had heard that in church or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s146">And________________and they wanted to see, how does it look to have your male part circumcised and they took me by the arm, __________ on the ground and so forth, took off my pants.</span> <span id="s147">And this I will never forget and never forgive them.</span> <span id="s148">It was part of the anti-Semite atmosphere.</span> <span id="s149">I wouldn't say that everybody was antagonistic toward the Jews, but many were and there was also the religious influence and the religious schools, Catholic schools and so forth, it was really a hotbed of anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s150">On the other hand you have the, the secular school and the teachers, which other time, mostly came from the Socialism, Socialist background.</span> <span id="s151">I wish they were more sympathetic to the Jews, but not as bad as people reared in the religion, religious, in the Catholic religion and so forth.</span> <span id="s152">A lot of people say that the French, you had the big round up in Paris on the 16th of July, where there was a change of mind________________for.</span> <span id="s153">Well, maybe, but as far as I'm concerned, that, the change of sentiment didn't come from the, from the, that __________.</span> <span id="s154">It really switched around six months later, first when the German lost the battle of __________ and went into retreat in Africa and then, couple months later, Stalingrad, that was the turn and in many people's mind, there was this possibility that Germany will lose the war.</span> <span id="s155">So that's what I feel.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: So tell me you're, you're in the Italian zone.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: At this point, in __________?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: First we arrive in Nice, we stayed about a month in Nice and then we went to ____.</span> <span id="s160">I went back to school, in the school there.</span> <span id="s161">In __________ the atmosphere was different because the people over there hated the Italians very much, you know, despised the Italians.</span> <span id="s162">Actually, I'd become friendly with the Italian soldiers, I remember they used to have a picnic on the, on the grass in a little meadow when I was coming back from school and time they called me up and they were listening to the radio, English radio, BBC and they would give it to me and talk to me and friendly attitude.</span> <span id="s163">And we knew that________________the French to arrest anybody and... But the atmosphere was different that the people of Savoire(ph) were more, I would call today rightist or, and they hated the Italians.</span> <span id="s164">So much that I'm sure that when the German came, they were glad that the German took over from the Italian.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: What was, before we get to this, to the part when the Gestapo came...</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: What was every day life like for you, where were you in school, in a public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Yes, public school, of course, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: And were there a lot, were there many restrictions imposed on you and your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: No, not restriction, no, no, not at that time.</span> <span id="s171">Of course in that zone we didn't have to wear the stars.</span> <span id="s172">We didn't have to wear the stars but our name was following us of course.</span> <span id="s173">And, and you know, we were coming in the middle of the school year and you know, all that was noticed and so forth.</span> <span id="s174">I don't have any good memories there from my teachers or school.</span> <span id="s175">No, no I don't recall any people that left a print on my remembrance of this time in __________.</span> <span id="s176">Now, later on we knew that we were turned in by the, by the French people, Frenchmen.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: So tell me what happened after ____.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Well, after __________, that's where I was picked up and sent to Drancy and eventually to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: So tell me about what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Well it was one of my uncle, my uncles had decided that it was time to move out of Savoire(ph), because in Savoire(ph) you had a lot of, the resistance was starting, there were attacks on Germans and the militia, the French militia.</span> <span id="s181">There was important resistance activity, it was starting.</span> <span id="s182">And a lot of German troops, also, a lot of German troops and police and so forth.</span> <span id="s183">And one of them went to________________and __________, the center of France and he found a place where, it seemed to be quiet and so forth, so we were supposed to move there.</span> <span id="s184">So he came back to, he left his children over there with his wife and he came back to fetch us to bring to ____.</span> <span id="s185">And then he went to see a garage and that garage happened to be the landlord that we were staying and he said that we have to, we need a car to take us, take us to the station with the luggages and so forth and that guy turn us in.</span> <span id="s186">And then when the Gestapo came, he was with them.</span> <span id="s187">And it was the 23rd of December, 1943, just a couple of days before ____, Christmas, a holiday, a very important holiday for the Germans, you know.</span> <span id="s188">I imagine maybe they were lenient because it was __________.</span> <span id="s189">They didn't want to take the children and have that party, you know, I guess they had the French girls in the, in the hotel with them, I mean that's where, they were stationed in the hotel.</span> <span id="s190">Anyway, they took only four of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: So who did they take?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: They take myself, my mother, my aunt and my two uncles.</span> <span id="s193">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: I'm sorry, I'm confused, when you told, you said before that there was a deal that was made about your grandfather, that was a different time?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s196">No, no, that was at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s198">So it could have been your grandfather, but they decided you, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s200">The Germans probably told them, well we have to bring five people, so you four and four others and either one of these two, you choose.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Who made the decision?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Well actually it was, I think it was a decision between a member of the family, or... I'm told there wasn't, there was some discussion and so forth.</span> <span id="s203">The real truth is only, is only known to God.</span> <span id="s204">But after the war I remember that my mother

the truth.</span> <span id="s212">And I carry that with me __________.</span> <span id="s213">I talked to the people that were there already.</span> <span id="s214">So I had a good hunch, a good

<span id="s276">And was just a waiting period.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: So it was known, was it known that this was simply a waiting period before you went away?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Oh yes, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: And the gendarme didn't try to hide that from you?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: Well the gendarme actually were outside,

there was, there were the gendarmes.</span> <span id="s282">It was buses with a platform an outside platform on the back and there was a gendarme on each platform.</span> <span id="s283">And now through, I think, you know, later on, I think there were a possibility to escape, when the bus was taking us from Drancy to, to the railway station in________________to get load up on the train, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Why do you think that there was an opportunity...</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: Well because there was only one gendarme on the platform, the men could have attacked and get ____, but of course you had to leave the women and the children, but there could have been a mass escape.</span> <span id="s286">A lot of thing could have happen.</span> <span id="s287">Now they, there was, you know, the determined people, there were some determined people, for instance, in November, 1943, or October 1943, two months before I arrived, some people tried to escape, they built a tunnel.</span> <span id="s288">And the tunnel was discovered only a couple of yards before it was finished.</span> <span id="s289">And so the Germans arrested these people and they were shipped on a convoy and they escaped.</span> <span id="s290">They were determined and they escaped.</span> <span id="s291">They, they, they jumped through the window and they survived the war.</span> <span id="s292">There were a few escapes.</span> <span id="s293">I mean you have it in the Klassfeld(ph) book.</span> <span id="s294">So people that were determined, they, they had a better chance, but you have to leave the women and the children behind and the old people.</span> <span id="s295">That was a choice.</span> <span id="s296">That was a choice.</span> <span id="s297">Now when the, the bus took me to a railroad station in________________on the main street of Drancy and there was my, on the right side was a street where my grandfather, my grandmother lived.</span> <span id="s298">I don't know if they were there then, but I remember the good times I had there and when I saw it, passing by and I was very sad thinking maybe I'll never see them

Germany, Glaivitz(ph) was the name and, that I recall, that's why I, I knew in what direction we were going, straight to Poland.</span> <span id="s339">And then we were in Auschwitz and we stayed a few hours there, the train waiting and then they opened the train and everybody out.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: You waited for a few hours, just at the train station, inside the train

id="s413">My number was ___________ 172825 and I remember that, that number through________________life and remember it in German.</span> <span id="s414">Because when they were calling your number you better, you better, have to be in position to understand German, your number in German, otherwise you can be in trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: Did you know any German before you got there?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: No.</span> <span id="s417">I didn't know German and I didn't know Yiddish, but I learned it over there, the hard way.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Must have

you pick up.</span> <span id="s421">You pick up and the first thing to pick up, you had to pick up was your number.</span> <span id="s422">Actually when I left camp, liberation, I understood the, not all German, but l would say I, I could manage.</span> <span id="s423">But still, I mean, I didn't speak German.</span> <span id="s424">If you spoke Yiddish or German, there was not a better chance to survive, but __________.</span> <span id="s425">Then after that we were assigned to different commandos, for different barracks and I wasn't lucky, I was put in the commando, cable lane commando, the toughest one because it was outside, we were working outside, pulling cables and trenches and people were dropping like flies and it was cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: What were you

<span id="s442">And then that was already March, April, very tough commandos and I got sick and went to the hospital, I had a pleurisia(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Pleurisia(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s445">A doctor from Strasbourg(ph) saved me, Professor Weiss(ph), he pumped the water out with a syringe.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Was there a __________?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: For the whole camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: Twice a day.</span> <span id="s450">The whole camp, that was a miserable time, outside, waiting and waiting in the cold, before going to work and then there were the selections.</span> <span id="s451">Now the selection, that was the worst.</span> <span id="s452">The worst event in camp life, when the, everybody was consigned into the barracks in the evening and everybody had to go in front of an SS, naked and then he decided if we were too weaks and so forth.</span> <span id="s453">That was the end, you didn't go to work the next day, but you would go in a truck and the truck would take you to Birkenau, to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s454">That was, I saw some act of heroism, also some people going instead of another, to pass in front of the SS and giving a phony number, they risk their lives to save other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: When did the selections happen, were they on a regular basis?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: No.</span> <span id="s457">I can say they happened when they were French defeats, when there were defeats, for instance, when they won the landing in Normandy and no, there was no pattern, it could be every two weeks, every three weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: But sometimes it was a punishment?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: Well, yeah.</span> <span id="s460">And increase also when the Hungarian start to came in, because they came in very __________ the Hungarians starting in March, March, April, '44 and they had to make room in the camp.</span> <span id="s461">They even put up two tents, two big tent in the camp to put in the Hungarians.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: In Auschwitz III?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Auschwitz III, yeah.</span> <span id="s464">And when the Hungarians came, they became the big majority in the camp and Hungarian replaced Yiddish as the tongue of the prisoners.</span> <span id="s465">So I got sick, my uncle helped me and passed me some food because they started, let's say what we could call a business.</span> <span id="s466">They were, they would come________________working inside with Poles people, Polish and, and they were gold trading taking place in the camp, you know, where you would buy the gold teeth from the bridges and so forth, the gold teeth for bread and cigarettes and you take it to the, to the factory we were working in Igafarben(ph) factory in Buna.</span> <span id="s467">And you would sell it to the Poles, they would give you some, some bread or some stuff like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: How did they get the gold teeth?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: Pull it.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: But how did they get it, they, were they, they weren't pulling the teeth, your uncles?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Yes, with a, with a, with a, with a piece of metal you

working any more, on November, so forth.</span> <span id="s519">So life drifted in the camp.</span> <span id="s520">I forgot to say that in August we had a big bombardment for, by the U.S. Air Force on the Auschwitz camp, on the Igerfarben(ph).</span> <span id="s521">And later on I found out that during this bombardment or reconnaissance flight, the Americans took the pictures of the Auschwitz

progressing, progressing, progressing, they were 200 miles from here, then they were 250 miles, 150 miles, then 100 miles.</span> <span id="s538">And then we had a strong feeling that they were very close, toward the end of December.</span> <span id="s539">Because you know, things were relaxed, there were no more selection, the SS were, were not as aggressive as they used to and then came January 1945, when really the rumor mill started to run.</span> <span id="s540">We were going to be surrounded, we were going to be, they're going to have Russian paratroopers come in over.</span> <span id="s541">And then one day nobody went to work, __________ and then we went to work again and then after that nobody went to work again and then panic started in the camp.</span> <span id="s542">When I say panic, that is the kitchen was, there were, there were, all the________________were running to the kitchen, trying to empty the kitchen, take all the food there.</span> <span id="s543">All of a sudden lack, lack of control, lack of discipline, you know, people running around, that was new to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: At this point, after you'd been confined to the camp, were you then going out again for work in the farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: No, I never went back.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: You never went out again?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: No,

Bloom(ph), that was the Socialist that put in the Socialist measure in France, 40 week, vacation and so forth, so Bloom(ph), you have to pay for what Bloom(ph) did to France and so forth.</span> <span id="s558">The British, British prisoner of war, yes, I met a New Zealander and was friendly to me, was a very religious man, reading, I know he was a Bible reader and tell me.</span> <span id="s559">He was friendly to me.</span> <span id="s560">A couple of Australians, too, but Australians were more cold.</span> <span id="s561">And________________out after the war when I went to Australian New Zealand, I would like to get in touch with some of these guys that were in Monowitz in the camp, but I didn't succeed.</span> <span id="s562">I would like to do it one day, to really find out all these British or what they saw in us and what they, what they knew and so forth, but from what I read and from what I gathered, nobody has, has tried to investigate that.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: Did you have any idea about your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Met some Poles too, but the Poles is... My mother?</span> <span id="s565">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: And your aunt?</span> <span id="s567">Nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: No, I don't know what happened to them.</span> <span id="s569">Was figuring she, she probably died.</span> <span id="s570">Maybe she was thinking the same thing of me.</span> <span id="s571">She was thinking the same thing of me.</span> <span id="s572">And then one day, it was afternoon, everybody outside and the rumors started, we are going on the road, we are evacuating the camp.</span> <span id="s573">We are evacuating the camp.</span> <span id="s574">And then we started, you know, to walk out in columns.</span> <span id="s575">So we walk out in columns and out on the road, was very cold, snow, ice and a big anxiety and the big anxiety was to, to know where we were going, because we thought they were going to take us to Auschwitz or to someplace and kill us all.</span> <span id="s576">So as we walked, we saw a sign on the road, you know, road signs, Iselau(ph), Blivitz(ph), Auschwitz and then, at a time when we took a corner and it was not, it was the road to Blivitz(ph) instead of Auschwitz and we felt a little relieved but then we entered the, the Polish country, I mean flat.</span> <span id="s577">Very few trees to stop the wind and the wind was blowing and then we heard the Russian planes over and some bombing by the Russian planes and I said, well maybe they, they going to catch up with us, but, they didn't.</span> <span id="s578">They didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: How long did you walk?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: We walked all night, all night and about six o'clock we reached into a place, into a barn, they put us in a barn.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: How many of

id="s583">Q: So this was that, when they evacuated the whole camp, it wasn't just, it wasn't just Auschwitz III, it was everyone?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: No, but I think maybe some, some people left before, I think we left on the 16th of January.</span> <span id="s585">The 16th of January.</span> <span id="s586">One thing I forgot to tell you is in the camp it was, the hanging, there were some hangings, you know, people trying to escape and so forth and when they got caught, ____, they hanged them in front of us and we have to march in front of them.</span> <span id="s587">The __________ and I remember once I was on a, on a hanging details and you know, getting off the guy from the rope and taking him to the crematorium to be burned and I remember SS taking picture, one of them, later on I, I met in Buchenwald, three months later, after they all had lost weight, they were really skinny, I mean, they were, they had lost weight in three months, in their retreat.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: You took this person off of the gallows?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: Yeah, ____, the gallows, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: By

they, actually I took the corpse and I dump it in the place and I know there was a chimney there and I think it was done there, yeah.</span> <span id="s602">Cannot be for sure if they took the corpse back to Auschwitz, but I doubt it.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: But you took it somewhere in, so you didn't, people didn't go, or I shouldn't say that, did people go from Auschwitz III to Auschwitz II or were you almost confined to Auschwitz III?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: Well sometimes there were some people transferred you know.</span> <span id="s605">On an individual basis or small groups, or small groups.</span> <span id="s606">Depending sometimes, maybe the factory needs some specialists or so forth, so they would go from one camp to the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: Mm-hm, but for the most part were you confined to Auschwitz III?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s609">I was in Auschwitz III all the time I was in the Auschwitz __________.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s611">So you walked all night?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s613">And we stayed in that barn, in a place called Nicholai(ph), which was just over the ex-German border,________________German border and I remember there was some straw, there was a barn and we slept there and in the morning went back on road and one thing I have to tell you that during all the night that we walk and the next morning and so forth, there were convoys of trucks and horse driven cars going westward with people running away from the, running away from the Russians and we saw that the, they were really in bad shape.</span> <span id="s614">Loaded with furniture and all that.</span> <span id="s615">Later on I heard that some guys had hidden under the straw and they waited for the Russian and they didn't take the trip to Germany, to Buchenwald __________.</span> <span id="s616">Then walked again, all day.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Did you have any food?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Well just the food they gave us when we left Auschwitz III, Monowitz, Buna.</span> <span id="s619">We walked another day and we arriving in a camp, Blivitz(ph).</span> <span id="s620">And there, we entered in that camp, it was overcrowded, people coming from all over, you know, from all the Auschwitz area and it was so crowded that there was no room in the barracks, some people have to stay outside, stay, sleep outside instead of trying to go into the barrack to get a little warmer.</span> <span id="s621">And there I saw some women too, some women prisoner.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: Were there any women on the march, before that?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: Not with us, no, but I saw some women in that camp, in Blivitz(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Where had they come from, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: __________ Auschwitz place, I don't know where from.</span> <span id="s626">I don't know where from and, but it was so crowded and, I heard some shooting too, shooting, shooting.</span> <span id="s627">I'll have to tell you also that old people that didn't walk on the march, they fell behind on the column and got shot and pushed over in, in the ditch.</span> <span id="s628">And if they were only wounded, you know, the cold would kill them in a few hours, because once you don't move and you stay there wounded, you had no chance to survive and there wouldn't be any Poles to come to help you, that I know of.</span> <span id="s629">So________________and the next day, they took us on another ramp, along the railroad track.</span> <span id="s630">We waited there awhile, a few hours, then a train came, roofless, you know, __________ type of railroad cars, open.</span> <span id="s631">They loaded us on there.</span> <span id="s632">We were so many there that you couldn't sit down, you had to stay stand up, so tight.</span> <span id="s633">Because if you, if you didn't stay stand up, you would be walked over.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: Did you have any idea where your uncles were at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: No.</span> <span id="s637">And were you with any of your friends who you________________in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: Yes, I stick with a friend, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s639">But I was on my own, practically, I was on my own.</span> <span id="s640">And then they gave us a piece of bread and piece of, of________________salami,________________salami,________________on the train.</span> <span id="s641">And the train took off and the snow starting to come down and the cold and, and then people start to be weak enough and come down and, and some other would lay down on them and was miserable time.</span> <span id="s642">That ride took about eight days, I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Eight days?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: Yeah, I think so.</span> <span id="s645">Eight days.</span> <span id="s646">We went through Czechoslovakia and for the first time I had, I saw some help from the outside.</span> <span id="s647">The Czech peoples, they were on the bridges, going over the railroad track.</span> <span id="s648">Standing on the bridges and they were throwing us food from the bridge.</span> <span id="s649">I remember I grabbed a piece, a piece of bread there, helped me to survive until our arrival in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s650">And the train finally arrived in Buchenwald, I mean probably the Vimar(ph) station.</span> <span id="s651">Was frozen.</span> <span id="s652">I remember we're covered of snow, ice and we were eating snow at the end, there was nothing more to eat.</span> <span id="s653">There were not many people alive still in the wagon when we arrived.</span> <span id="s654">And we got off the wagon and it was a certain height from the floor of the wagon to the ground and some people were too weak and when they get off the wagon, they would come hit the floor and they couldn't get up any more, they broke their foot or their legs or, but they didn't get up.</span> <span id="s655">Then we had to walk up a slope to get into the camp of Buchenwald, it was located on a hill in that forest, the________________forest.</span> <span id="s656">And we walk up there and we get into the camp, also very crowded, many people.</span> <span id="s657">There were no room for us in the barracks, so I fell on the ground, I remember it was snowing and I fell asleep there and I woke up in the morning and I was so cold, so frozen and I couldn't get up.</span> <span id="s658">I thought it was the end there.</span> <span id="s659">I started to cry and a friend helped me get back on my feet.</span> <span id="s660">That's how I survived this time.</span> <span id="s661">And that Buchenwald was a different atmosphere __________.</span> <span id="s662">It was not 98 percent or 99 percent Jewish, I mean in Buchenwald you had many non-Jews, mostly non-Jews originally and the camps and the groups were divided by nationality.</span> <span id="s663">You had the very important Russian groups, prisoner of war.</span> <span id="s664">Ukrainian Germans, Communists.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Political prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: Political prisoners, yeah.</span> <span id="s667">So I stayed there a month and then I went, I was sent on an outside commando in Olsen(ph), near Hanover(ph), so back on the train, to a little camp up on a hill, to work on a forest, in very bad condition.</span> <span id="s668">Nothing to eat, lice, hard work in the forest, no food.</span> <span id="s669">People dying from hunger, from disease.</span> <span id="s670">And then one day we heard the guns.</span> <span id="s671">Gunshells, coming closer and the rumor was that was the British army coming, not far away.</span> <span id="s672">And then, hearing that, we knew that we had to go on the road again, pretty soon.</span> <span id="s673">Which happened, of course.</span> <span id="s674">They took us out of ____, we were alive still, back to where I was stationed.</span> <span id="s675">A German civilian, seeing us going through the village and so forth, yelling names at us and so forth and back to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s676">Probably, middle of March or so.</span> <span id="s677">March 1945, middle of March.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: Can you say generally how the conditions in Buchenwald compared to those in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: Yes, well, more __________ was in the sense that there were no selections.</span> <span id="s680">I don't know.</span> <span id="s681">There were no mass gas, gas chamber over there.</span> <span id="s682">People would die of sickness and bad treatments and so forth.</span> <span id="s683">There were crematoriums, crematoriums working close to around the clock, burning their regular, the dead, the corpse that, but when I was there it was not the camp for the Jews, it was not for extermination like it was in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: Did you see your uncles there?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: What happened to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: Well they went a different way, they went to Flossenbürg, found out after the war, Flossenbürg and the one who survived ended up in Dachau.</span> <span id="s688">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: So you went back to Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s691">There I met many Communists, French Communists and the Communists were separated from the others and the, it was a very tight group.</span> <span id="s692">And in Buchenwald, overcrowded, nothing to eat, people fighting between each other to steal what, a piece of bread that one could have and so forth.</span> <span id="s693">Ukrainians were especially cruel and I remember the Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s694">And then we heard gunshells again.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: What, do you remember about what month this was, when do you think this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: When do you think this was, about what month?</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: March, middle of March, middle of March, yeah.</span> <span id="s699">There was, it was getting it a little warmer, spring was coming and then, as usual, an evacuation of the prisoners started again, so people were put in the __________ and pushed outside to start walking again on the road and fortunately I, I didn't make that one.</span> <span id="s700">And, I think a day or two before the Americans came in, we, the SS abandoned the camp or left only a few people and that's when the Russians attacked the camp, the main entrance and a few SS were captured and that's what, that was when I, I saw all these________________that were________________and scream at me and we caught a few of them and the Russian killed one of them that I knew particular.</span> <span id="s701">That's where I found all these pictures that I gave you today.</span> <span id="s702">I was at the next morning, I think I saw the, the first American soldier, there were two of them walking down the alley.</span> <span id="s703">And then, the next day we went up in the __________ and there was________________nationality, we were singing the Internationale, Communist song.</span> <span id="s704">We were told that we were free men again, that we were going to go back home pretty soon.</span> <span id="s705">And then the next day, German civilians came to the camp to see the

a draft, that I'm leaving here, the U.S. Holocaust Museum and then a second draft, then a third draft, which I brought with my children to Yad Vashem(ph) in Israel and Jerusalem, I gave to Yad Vashem(ph) the final draft, it is stored over there and my children were with me when I give it to them, so I'm leaving a little bit of my testimony behind and I hope it will transmit la memoire, a memory.</span> <span id="s814">I did the best I can and I just wish that many of the survivors are still alive, make the effort to come here and to spend a few hours before they disappear, into
