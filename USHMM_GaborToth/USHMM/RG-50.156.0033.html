Anti-Defamation League of Minnesota and the Dakotas HOLOCAUST ORAL HISTORY TAPING PROJECT</span></p> <p><span id="s4">Q: In Saint Louis Park, it is December 26, 1984.</span> <span id="s5">I’m Stuart Markoff, and I’m here to interview Mr. Loewenson in connection with the Holocaust Oral History Project with the Jewish Community Relations Council of Minnesota.</span> <span id="s6">Mr. Loewenson, why don’t you tell is your name and your place of birth and the year of your birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s7">A: James Loewenson -- or Loewensohn.</span> <span id="s8">I dropped the “h” when I came to this country -- exactly 31 years ago.</span> <span id="s9">I was born in 1908 in a little town in the province Posen of Germany that after the First War became Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">Q: Were your parents also born in the same town?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s12">Several generations.</span> <span id="s13">They were born and all were jewelers.</span> <span id="s14">The oldest son -- not me -- the oldest son of this family was a jeweler</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: So your father was a jeweler also.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: My father was a jeweler.</span> <span id="s17">Very well known.</span> <span id="s18">And he was elected alderman.</span> <span id="s19">The family was very well known.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: Jacob Loewensohn.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: And your mother’s name?</span> <span id="s23">Do you remember her maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: Rosendorf.</span> <span id="s25">Gertrude Rosendorf.</span> <span id="s26">From a little town nearby there.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Do you happen to remember your grandparents on either side of the family?</span> <span id="s28">Like your father’s parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: I don’t remember my father’s parents.</span> <span id="s30">I know only they were very religious, and when my father was 14, he took over the jewelry store -- and his father spent all day in the synagogue -- in a shul.</span> <span id="s31">My father was not religious.</span> <span id="s32">He always knew and said he was Jewish, went to the synagogue on the High Holidays like everybody else, but he was rather a little bit socialist, I think.</span> <span id="s33">He was not a big talker.</span> <span id="s34">He didn’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s35">And he was pretty old when he married -- I think 50.</span> <span id="s36">I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s37">He was born in 1866, all in this little town.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: And what about your mother.</span> <span id="s39">Was her family also from the same town?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: No, they were from a little town somewhere else.</span> <span id="s41">Maybe 100 miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: But also within the German-speaking area?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s44">In a German town called Usch.</span> <span id="s45">Not very well known.</span> <span id="s46">And I knew my mother’s father very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: What was his name?</span> <span id="s48">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Rosendorf.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: But his first name.</span> <span id="s51">do you remember his Jewish…?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Gustav Rosendorf.</span> <span id="s53">His Jewish name, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: How about your own Hebrew name?</span> <span id="s55">Did you know if you had a Hebrew name?</span> <span id="s56">Or were you given a Hebrew name?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: I suppose, but I don’t know.</span> <span id="s58">Jacob….</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: And your mother -- would you call her a religious woman in the sense of synagogue going…?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: Not at all.</span> <span id="s61">But after the war, when all these towns and provinces became Polish…</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: This is after the First World War.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: After the First World War.</span> <span id="s64">Many or all Jews left and went to the real Germany, because they were all assimilated Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Your family stayed?</span> <span id="s66">Or did they go also?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: No, my father went in 1920, I think, or ’21.</span> <span id="s68">He left.</span> <span id="s69">And I remember how we went to the station in a wagon and went to Berlin -- in Germany.</span> <span id="s70">And my mother’s family, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: They all came.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Her father and their two sons -- my mother’s brothers.</span> <span id="s73">They went to Germany and that’s why I saw them and knew them.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: So you lived in Berlin then.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: After 1920 about?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: ’20 or ’21.</span> <span id="s78">Till Hitler came.</span> <span id="s79">And then something very tragic happened.</span> <span id="s80">My father was a jeweler again -- of a little store in the center of Berlin -- and the Nazis bothered him.</span> <span id="s81">He had to come every day, I think, to a station where they called him dirty Jew.</span> <span id="s82">I don’t know the real reason.</span> <span id="s83">Maybe they wanted me.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Before you moved to Berlin, you were pretty young.</span> <span id="s85">Do you remember anything when you were growing up in your city?</span> <span id="s86">Did you meet mostly other Jewish people or mostly non-Jewish, German…</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Jewish people.</span> <span id="s88">I know as little children, we played in the garden of a lodge where my father belonged.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Like a Masonic Lodge?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Yeah, but I know the names still exist here.</span> <span id="s91">It’s a Jewish lodge I think.</span> <span id="s92">I forgot the name, but I saw the name; it still exists here, too.</span> <span id="s93">And there this lodge had a house and a garden, and there the children played.</span> <span id="s94">They were all Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: How about any Jewish education when you were growing up?</span> <span id="s96">Do you remember if you got anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: I was Bar Mitzvah and like all Jewish kids, a year before that I had to learn Hebrew.</span> <span id="s98">I can read.</span> <span id="s99">I don’t know what I read, but I can still read Hebrew, only I don’t speak it.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: How about brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s101">Did you have brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Yeah, I was the second of three boys just a year and a year and a half apart.</span> <span id="s103">And my older brother still lives in Argentina.</span> <span id="s104">He is a jeweler, the oldest.</span> <span id="s105">And the younger one, he died.</span> <span id="s106">He had, when he was about 18, 19, around 1934, a stomach operation and died in Germany.</span> <span id="s107">My father, he didn’t like to go on living like this, being called by the Nazis all the time.</span> <span id="s108">He killed himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Did he say anything to you, the children, or that you remember about this experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: He made a will and he wrote in the will we should liquidate everything and go outside Germany and start a new life.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Do you remember reading this, or hearing this told to you from the will?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: We are reading or hearing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Did your family have a discussion about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s115">My brother who worked before my father’s death in this store, after he learned the materials, the profession, he worked with my father.</span> <span id="s116">So he took over.</span> <span id="s117">He liquidated everything.</span> <span id="s118">I was the only one who left pretty early.</span> <span id="s119">My father died in July, 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: So that was very shortly after the Nazis came to power!</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Yeah, they came to power in…</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: …’32.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: In January or March.</span> <span id="s124">They came to power legally.</span> <span id="s125">And around Christmas of the same year, ’33, I left.</span> <span id="s126">My brother’s passport was…I didn’t dare ask for mine.</span> <span id="s127">I went to Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Oh, that’s when you went to Czechoslovakia!</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: And we didn’t need a visa.</span> <span id="s130">A German didn’t need a visa.</span> <span id="s131">So that’s where I went.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Now you went alone, not with other members of the family; like your mother stayed in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: My mother stayed and the two boys stayed.</span> <span id="s134">He was still living.</span> <span id="s135">But I went with an uncle of mine who went for vacation with his family to Prague.</span> <span id="s136">But he didn’t run away like I did.</span> <span id="s137">He went back after two weeks, but I went with them.</span> <span id="s138">I didn’t need it.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: What was your experience?</span> <span id="s140">Did anything lead up…did your father, when he grew up in the city near Posen…did we establish what city, by the way…</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: No, I didn’t say the name.</span> <span id="s142">It was a little town of about, then, 20,000 people, mostly Polish.</span> <span id="s143">And the German part were the Jews.</span> <span id="s144">The so-called “better”, the merchants.</span> <span id="s145">Gott, all this was in Jewish hands, mostly.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Did they speak Polish as well as German?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: No, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: In your home, also, mostly just German.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: Right.</span> <span id="s150">Never Polish and never Yiddish.</span> <span id="s151">German.</span> <span id="s152">And there the whole family -- my father was, I think, the tenth or eleventh of twelve children.</span> <span id="s153">And they all lived in that town for a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: But did you hear any stories before this tragedy in Berlin?</span> <span id="s155">Did you hear any stories or experience yourself what you could call anti-Semitic incidents?</span> <span id="s156">Or were you fairly free from hearing about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: I can say that here, because I was very Leftist.</span> <span id="s158">I belonged to a union, as a boy in Hohensalza, this little town near Posen.</span> <span id="s159">It’s a German name.</span> <span id="s160">The Polish name is Ino Wroclaw.</span> <span id="s161">That means New Breslau.</span> <span id="s162">There I belonged as a boy starting this, maybe ten years, what was called in Germany the Youth Movement.</span> <span id="s163">Jugend Bewegung.</span> <span id="s164">That was all over Germany after the First War.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: I know.</span> <span id="s166">It was a very, very big and important.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: One student, a little bit older than I was, he started it.</span> <span id="s168">And he was a friend for many, many years.</span> <span id="s169">He lived in the town, too.</span> <span id="s170">So every Sunday we went out in the woods and other towns singing.</span> <span id="s171">And after this, too, I belonged to another group of this Youth Movement, and we became pretty soon interested in politics.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Now this wasn’t just Jewish people in the Movement.</span> <span id="s173">This was all kinds of people?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: No, I belonged to a Jewish part of the General, called Kamaraden.</span> <span id="s175">Very, very old.</span> <span id="s176">I have books.</span> <span id="s177">In all towns of Germany existed groups of this German-Jewish Youth called Kamaraden, not Zionist.</span> <span id="s178">Not at all.</span> <span id="s179">We were Germans and Jews.</span> <span id="s180">And so I thought the Nazis were after me.</span> <span id="s181">I had reason to believe it.</span> <span id="s182">I didn’t live in my parents’ home.</span> <span id="s183">I had a room with some workers in the workers’ neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: And this was in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: In Berlin, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: When did you leave your parents’ home, actually?</span> <span id="s187">Somewhere in the 20’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: 28, 29, when I became an apprentice in a library.</span> <span id="s189">And one day, maybe in May, June, I don’t know when, I saw trucks with Nazis piling up there in the street where I lived.</span> <span id="s190">They came to my house.</span> <span id="s191">I saw them from the window.</span> <span id="s192">And they took people out --not Jews -- but they were after Communists, I think.</span> <span id="s193">They didn’t find me.</span> <span id="s194">But I saw them going up on the roof and taking these people out.</span> <span id="s195">I thought I’m in danger.</span> <span id="s196">My father wanted us to move, leave Germany anyhow, so we decided I will leave right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Was it at this time your father was not experiencing the harassment yet?</span> <span id="s198">For himself and the jewelry store?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: That already had started.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: He killed himself for some reason.</span> <span id="s202">He didn’t say why.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: But he left you, he told you in his will to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: He says he wants us to liquidate the store, leave Germany -- all the family -- and start a new life.</span> <span id="s205">So I went to Prague, starting a new life, and got a job as an editor…a business.</span> <span id="s206">Very, very well known.</span> <span id="s207">Malik Verlag.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Sure, very well known.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: And they ended very tragically – at least the movement’s founder, Vedont Herzfelder.</span> <span id="s210">He was a Communist.</span> <span id="s211">And he was called to Russia.</span> <span id="s212">He went by himself.</span> <span id="s213">Never came back.</span> <span id="s214">I didn’t stay so long, because I went there with a false passport.</span> <span id="s215">My brother’s.</span> <span id="s216">I didn’t know that that was such a crime.</span> <span id="s217">I thought I was a free man in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s218">But when you take a room somewhere, you have to go to the police and declare where you are.</span> <span id="s219">When you move you have to go to the police again.</span> <span id="s220">So they found out.</span> <span id="s221">Christmas my mother came visiting me in Prague, and brought me my passport .</span> <span id="s222">Then I used my passport.</span> <span id="s223">The police found out.</span> <span id="s224">And I had to come to the main headquarters of the police.</span> <span id="s225">And they yelled at me first in Czechoslovakian -- I didn’t understand -- then in German.</span> <span id="s226">They spoke perfectly German.</span> <span id="s227">And then put me in prison -- because I tried to “cheat.”</span> <span id="s228">And this Herzfelder from Malik Verlag, he took a lawyer and brought me out, but I had to leave the country.</span> <span id="s229">They gave me one week.</span> <span id="s230">I was very sorry because I loved it in Prague.</span> <span id="s231">Beautiful city.</span> <span id="s232">And so I had to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A; To Zurich, where else?</span> <span id="s235">That was nearest.</span> <span id="s236">I couldn’t go to Austria, that was German.</span> <span id="s237">I didn’t want anything German anymore.</span> <span id="s238">I went to Zurich.</span> <span id="s239">But they didn’t like Jews without money.</span> <span id="s240">Rich Jews, maybe.</span> <span id="s241">But they didn’t like Jews.</span> <span id="s242">They were afraid of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: You felt this very strongly from the Swiss authorities and just ordinary people?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s245">They told me after two months, three months -- they told me right away, “you can’t stay here.”</span> <span id="s246">I couldn’t stay.</span> <span id="s247">A man came, after two months, I think…that was the beginning of ’34, maybe April.</span> <span id="s248">They brought me to Basel, to the French border, and then we walked around the cemetery at the end of Basel of Switzerland, and they told me, “Right now there’s no French police there.”</span> <span id="s249">They knew that, the Swiss police.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: So you literally walked into France.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: They told me, “Go this way to the next town and there you can take the train to Paris.</span> <span id="s252">You are free but don’t come back.</span> <span id="s253">We don’t want you.”</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: But you did have at this point some sort of passport then?</span> <span id="s255">What documents did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A; I had my passport, but no visa for France.</span> <span id="s257">Only the French were the most human.</span> <span id="s258">They accepted every foreigner.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: What was happening to your mother during this period?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: They were still there.</span> <span id="s261">My mother didn’t leave Germany.</span> <span id="s262">My brother -- the younger brother died -- and the older brother left, in 1938, ’37, for South America.</span> <span id="s263">He couldn’t get a visa for another European country.</span> <span id="s264">See all Jews who wanted to emigrate had to go to South America.</span> <span id="s265">England didn’t take any, nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: So he left before the infamous Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s268">I don’t know when that was.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: That was, I think, ’38 already.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: He left in ’38.</span> <span id="s271">So it was maybe shortly before, or shortly after.</span> <span id="s272">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s273">He left.</span> <span id="s274">He was married.</span> <span id="s275">He was traveling a lot.</span> <span id="s276">He went to Israel before and got married there.</span> <span id="s277">In ’38 he left for Bolivia.</span> <span id="s278">Stayed about 10 years there.</span> <span id="s279">And then had trouble with the police and went to Argentina where he stayed all the time.</span> <span id="s280">My mother never left.</span> <span id="s281">She said she wants to stay with the tombs, graves.</span> <span id="s282">Where my father was buried and our youngest brother.</span> <span id="s283">She stayed.</span> <span id="s284">We couldn’t find a visa, anyway, for her.</span> <span id="s285">She didn’t get any.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: There was an effort to find one for her.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: We tried to get her out against her will.</span> <span id="s288">She didn’t want to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: When was that effort made?</span> <span id="s290">How late do you think that last effort was to get a visa for her?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: All the time from ’38 ‘til ’42.</span> <span id="s292">And in July, ’42, she was deported.</span> <span id="s293">We got a postcard -- that was all she could write -- that she has to leave, and so she will not see us again.</span> <span id="s294">And we never could find out where -- we think the whole train was gassed.</span> <span id="s295">The whole train.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Everybody they took out from Berlin at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: We think so.</span> <span id="s298">She never landed in any camp.</span> <span id="s299">In any of these Polish deportation camps.</span> <span id="s300">We tried for months, or years…</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: So the postcard was sent by the Red Cross?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: Yeah, or to the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s303">I suppose everybody got one postcard?</span> <span id="s304">But in any case, we heard that.</span> <span id="s305">I don’t know who.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: And by this time, where were you in 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: In ’42 I was in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: So then you had come into France, you had taken the train already directly to Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A; I went directly to Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: How did you survive then in Paris?</span> <span id="s311">Were there any communities to help you?</span> <span id="s312">Or any Jewish agencies?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s314">There were committees.</span> <span id="s315">I heard right away on the station, the day I came in, when I get out of the train, there is a Jewish man who somehow he “smelled” that I was a foreigner who didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s316">He talked to me.</span> <span id="s317">He took a taxi and showed me Paris.</span> <span id="s318">And I’m sure he gave me something to eat.</span> <span id="s319">And he gave me an address of a committee -- I would have found it anyway -- that was on the main street in Paris, Champs Elysees.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Do you remember the name at all of the agency?</span> <span id="s321">Did it have a name in French or German or…</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s323">In French.</span> <span id="s324">And this committee that was really marvelous, they trained people.</span> <span id="s325">Most were German Jews who were intellectuals or students.</span> <span id="s326">They had no profession.</span> <span id="s327">There they trained them for two things; woodwork or metalwork ,so that we could get a job.</span> <span id="s328">I learned metalwork.</span> <span id="s329">For one year they sent me, this committee, to the south of France, near Lyon, a little town where they had professional schools like here, like Dunwoody.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: Trade schools, we call them.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: Yah, trade schools.</span> <span id="s332">I knew a little French from school -- most of the Jews I met there, maybe 10, 15 boys like me -- they didn’t speak French.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: How old were you at this time then, when we’re getting into France?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: I was over 20.</span> <span id="s335">And stayed there in this little town for a year, and then the same committee found me a job, and everybody else, at the railroad.</span> <span id="s336">That was state-owned, the railroad.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Working as a metalworker?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s339">I got a normal salary, and what I did was repairing engines --locomotives.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Now were you still, in Vichy, France at this point in 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: No, but at the beginning of the war, I lived in Paris and worked ‘til the end, but at the beginning of the war, they didn’t keep me.</span> <span id="s342">They couldn’t have foreigners, and I didn’t want to become French.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: So this area in Lyon was free, still Free France?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s345">I was in Paris now.</span> <span id="s346">School was over.</span> <span id="s347">I worked at the railroad near Paris, but at the beginning of the war, all foreigners had to come to the police.</span> <span id="s348">And Germans, and Poles, Jewish, and non-Jewish, they put in a camp in a Stadium, a sports arena, outside of Paris.</span> <span id="s349">Not covered.</span> <span id="s350">Near Colombes.</span> <span id="s351">Near Paris.</span> <span id="s352">So I talk now about 1938.</span> <span id="s353">The war was declared, but no shots were fired for a full year.</span> <span id="s354">The French called it the “drole de guerre,’ that’s funny that you know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: It’s a famous episode.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: So I had to go there.</span> <span id="s357">We had to come with a blanket, with food for three days.</span> <span id="s358">That’s what the French said.</span> <span id="s359">So I went there too.</span> <span id="s360">And from there we were sent, all thousands and thousands -- and we stayed overnight in Grenoble.</span> <span id="s361">I remember I took a book of Dostoyevsky -- in French -- with me to have something to read.</span> <span id="s362">I forgot the name now of the book.</span> <span id="s363">And at the entrance to Colombes, I have to show the food and the blanket.</span> <span id="s364">And the French officer saw the book.</span> <span id="s365">He took it and turned around and said to another Frenchman, “ Ah, look here.</span> <span id="s366">Look what I found.”</span> <span id="s367">He says, ‘ Bastard!”</span> <span id="s368">And put it in his pocket.</span> <span id="s369">Doesn’t say, “Can I take it?</span> <span id="s370">Will you give it to me?’</span> <span id="s371">He just stole it from me!</span> <span id="s372">I had no rights!</span> <span id="s373">So we stayed there a few days in this open camp, and then we’re sent to the center of France -- a beautiful part of the country -- two camps.</span> <span id="s374">And they were good camps.</span> <span id="s375">Not like the German.</span> <span id="s376">Plenty to eat.</span> <span id="s377">Always wine.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Do you remember the names of the camps at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: Not right now.</span> <span id="s380">But we were known for some reason in the unions.</span> <span id="s381">And I had a girlfriend.</span> <span id="s382">The women were not arrested like we.</span> <span id="s383">Only men, foreigners, had to come.</span> <span id="s384">Women could stay for the moment.</span> <span id="s385">Later on, they, too.</span> <span id="s386">And she knew somebody from the union high up, or worked for them.</span> <span id="s387">One day A French officer came from the Army in uniform and took me out.</span> <span id="s388">Brought me back in Paris and I was a free man again.</span> <span id="s389">But it was a funny situation.</span> <span id="s390">You couldn’t have any lights shining outside the windows.</span> <span id="s391">And I worked again, “Poule de France National” – for the national defense.</span> <span id="s392">But we had no orders.</span> <span id="s393">There were hundreds of French workers standing in front of machines.</span> <span id="s394">We had to make these gears for planes.</span> <span id="s395">But we had no orders.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: It was that chaotic.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A; Yah.</span> <span id="s398">Terrible.</span> <span id="s399">So we had to work 10 hours, with a good salary, and I was a free man, but nothing to do.</span> <span id="s400">So we played cards.</span> <span id="s401">I think I worked nights.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Was this very scary for you at this period?</span> <span id="s403">Were you frightened with what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: Not really frightened, but you never knew how it will end.</span> <span id="s405">German planes, but no bombs, over Paris.</span> <span id="s406">War and no war.</span> <span id="s407">Nobody had confidence in France anyhow.</span> <span id="s408">In any case, when the real war began, when the German armies started moving -- and nothing stopped them -- all foreigners had to come again to another place.</span> <span id="s409">This time we were sent down to the south of France.</span> <span id="s410">I don’t remember the name.</span> <span id="s411">Near Bordeaux.</span> <span id="s412">Not real south, but southeast.</span> <span id="s413">A camp.</span> <span id="s414">And guarded -- in the train, full of foreigners, arrested -- was guarded by black men -- giants -- and for them, they would have liked to kill us.</span> <span id="s415">They looked at us as enemies!</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Were these hired by the French?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: Yeah, they were part of the French Army from the colonies.</span> <span id="s418">But in any case, we came there.</span> <span id="s419">When the Germans overran France, they opened the camps -- the French.</span> <span id="s420">They told us, “ We can’t protect you.</span> <span id="s421">We know you don’t want to meet the Germans.”</span> <span id="s422">And Petain, to show the world that there is a free, independent France, left a little part near Toulouse, near the Swiss border, that was called Free France.</span> <span id="s423">They told us, “ Go there.</span> <span id="s424">There you are free.’</span> <span id="s425">And they gave us even, a paper; “ He is a friend of France.</span> <span id="s426">Help him.”</span> <span id="s427">Something like that.</span> <span id="s428">So I went there, alone.</span> <span id="s429">Tried to get hired.</span> <span id="s430">I went in the direction of Montauban.</span> <span id="s431">And that’s where I stayed a year-and-a-half, two years…</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Montauban is where?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: It’s near Toulouse.</span> <span id="s434">An old town.</span> <span id="s435">Not too little.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Were there other Jewish people there with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: There were hundreds and hundreds of foreigners.</span> <span id="s438">Because now, at this time, the Germans occupied France.</span> <span id="s439">The women were arrested too -- or shortly before.</span> <span id="s440">And they were all sent to this Free France -- to Montauban.</span> <span id="s441">Somehow the men knew that the women were there, so everybody went in the direction of Montauban.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Was your girlfriend there at this time?</span> <span id="s443">She was Jewish, I presume?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s445">She was not any more my girlfriend.</span> <span id="s446">I married her in the camp.</span> <span id="s447">I didn’t want to be all alone in Paris so she came.</span> <span id="s448">I got the permission to have the marriage there.</span> <span id="s449">The camp commandant married us.</span> <span id="s450">Then she went back to Paris.</span> <span id="s451">Later she came to me in Montauban.</span> <span id="s452">So we stayed there.</span> <span id="s453">I was pretty lucky.</span> <span id="s454">I had a room in the house of the Mayor.</span> <span id="s455">Now he had nothing to do with me.</span> <span id="s456">But one day after a year there.</span> <span id="s457">One day he sent his maid to tell me, “ Tomorrow morning at six, all refugees will be arrested and put in a camp on order of the German authority.’</span> <span id="s458">There was no German army in Montauban, but there were still some Germans in “civil” -- not in uniform -- who told the French authorities what to do.</span> <span id="s459">So I knew next morning there would be a round-up -- that all foreigners will be arrested again, the rest of the foreigners that were still free.</span> <span id="s460">So we gave everything away, what we had…</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: How did you know these things in advance?</span> <span id="s462">I mean were the notices put up in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: The Mayor of Montauban sent me a message to tell me next morning at six, all foreigners will be arrested again --or have to come to the police.</span> <span id="s464">Something like that.</span> <span id="s465">Because I gave his little boys German lessons.</span> <span id="s466">So he was kind of interested in me.</span> <span id="s467">I never talked to him.</span> <span id="s468">I don’t remember his name, but he sent me the message, indirectly, I should take care of myself.</span> <span id="s469">Nobody else.</span> <span id="s470">So we warned a lot of friends we had -- one who is still here before we left, did everything to help me come over to this country.</span> <span id="s471">In any case, I left, took the train to Toulouse in the direction of Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: About what time are we talking?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: 1942.</span> <span id="s474">I think September.</span> <span id="s475">Still beautiful.</span> <span id="s476">I had no coat, but we went to the mountains, direction of Switzerland, just the two of us, over, high up -- the lowest point on the map I found, the 2,000 meter, that’s not too hard on us.</span> <span id="s477">It was night when we came to the border -- the highest point.</span> <span id="s478">I saw a light -- a little lower -- the Swiss guards.</span> <span id="s479">And I yelled, “Hey!”</span> <span id="s480">I thought the moment I’m in Switzerland, I will be free.</span> <span id="s481">But they couldn’t find us.</span> <span id="s482">So we descended.</span> <span id="s483">It was six, already light, then, on the Swiss side.</span> <span id="s484">And there in a village I saw a Swiss gendarme, a Swiss man talking to a farmer’s wife.</span> <span id="s485">So I waved at him.</span> <span id="s486">I thought I’m free.</span> <span id="s487">He bent down, took his gun and said, “Hey!</span> <span id="s488">Wait!”</span> <span id="s489">He arrested us.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: How many were there in your party?</span> <span id="s491">When you descended?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: Just two.</span> <span id="s493">My wife and I.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: So this was quite a shock, I imagine, when this guard would suddenly…</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s496">After two days -- we couldn’t stay -- he brought us again to the French border and said, “ Go to France.</span> <span id="s497">I don’t care what you do.</span> <span id="s498">Don’t come back.”</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: Did he give any reason for his action?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: “We don’t want you.</span> <span id="s501">We keep only old men, old people, and very young children.</span> <span id="s502">But not you.</span> <span id="s503">This boat is full,” he said.</span> <span id="s504">“The boat is full,’ I heard that several times.</span> <span id="s505">And so we went down to one of the little French towns near there near the lake.</span> <span id="s506">Stayed for two days with groups of hundreds and hundreds of foreigners who whispered!</span> <span id="s507">Didn’t dare to talk.</span> <span id="s508">Nobody knew what to do.</span> <span id="s509">And one day a Frenchman, many did that -- tried to bring, for money, people over to Switzerland -- I gave him my wedding ring.</span> <span id="s510">So we went over the lake, after two, three weeks, maybe, staying in Evian, one of these little spas, and we came, after, over the lake, Lake Le Man -- I don’t know the English name.</span> <span id="s511">The biggest lake.</span> <span id="s512">We came on the other side.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: You took the boat across, in other words?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s515">There were maybe 10 people on the boat, and the baby was crying, and the mother almost killed her baby, because she was so afraid that they will hear us come -- it was very early.</span> <span id="s516">But now some miracle happened.</span> <span id="s517">When we came on the other side, the Swiss army was there.</span> <span id="s518">An officer yelled at us, “Why do you come bothering us!</span> <span id="s519">We don’t want you!</span> <span id="s520">Why aren’t you fighting the Russians like the other Germans do?’</span> <span id="s521">But they had to keep us.</span> <span id="s522">The Swiss churches forced their government to open the border to all refugees, only nobody in France knew it!</span> <span id="s523">Nobody knew it!</span> <span id="s524">But for two months, the borders were open.</span> <span id="s525">They kept everybody who showed up!</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: What a terrible irony that nobody knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: Nobody knew -- or very few!</span> <span id="s528">There was no communication between refugees in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s529">For two months the borders were opened.</span> <span id="s530">They kept everybody.</span> <span id="s531">Put us in working camps.</span> <span id="s532">Women one side.</span> <span id="s533">My wife was expecting, so she came to Geneva in a home in a “kampenhof” and she died there.</span> <span id="s534">They made several transfusions, but at the delivery she died.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: How terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s537">Maybe these weeks were too much for her.</span> <span id="s538">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s539">The baby, too, died, maybe a week after.</span> <span id="s540">I remember only from the camp where I was, one day I got the note, “You come to…”</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: Do you remember where this was exactly?</span> <span id="s542">The name of the place in Switzerland?</span> <span id="s543">The camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: The camp.</span> <span id="s545">I know where it was, near the lake in the French part.</span> <span id="s546">But then after my wife died, I went there to see her, but she was dead already.</span> <span id="s547">Then I think I went back.</span> <span id="s548">I was half out of my mind.</span> <span id="s549">The police were very nice to me.</span> <span id="s550">They transferred me to a camp -- now I know the name; Biermanstorff, near Zurich -- on a little hill overlooking Zurich.</span> <span id="s551">They said, he’s German, so let him be in the German part, I suppose.</span> <span id="s552">I didn’t really care.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: They didn’t know or consider you Jewish, you think, at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s555">They knew.</span> <span id="s556">Refugee Jewish.</span> <span id="s557">They knew I refused to be considered German.</span> <span id="s558">So they called that “Jewish refugee of German origin.’</span> <span id="s559">That was the official denomination.</span> <span id="s560">So I was there in a camp near Zurich.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Was your passport stamped with anything … any kind of special symbol or anything that would show that you were a Jewish refugee?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: No.</span> <span id="s563">In the beginning, the Germans didn’t do that.</span> <span id="s564">Later on the passport had the stamp, “Jewish.”</span> <span id="s565">But I left too early.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: I’m thinking more of the Swiss…put anything on the passport.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s568">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s569">And I don’t think I used my passport.</span> <span id="s570">I used a French identity card.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: So you had a new identity when you made the crossing?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: Yeah, I didn’t have a passport.</span> <span id="s573">I didn’t use a German passport.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: So do you recall what French name then you may have used?</span> <span id="s575">Was it your own name on this Carte Identite?</span> <span id="s576">Or was it a new name?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s578">My own name .</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Mr. Loewenson, we were talking about -- on the other side of the tape --your coming to Switzerland, and you remained there as the war was coming to an end, but before that happened, you were telling me that you had moved to Zurich from the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: From a camp to another camp near Zurich.</span> <span id="s581">And there I met the Swiss people who tried to make life for these refugees a little bit easier with the nice music or with speeches.</span> <span id="s582">Somehow I got a job offer.</span> <span id="s583">I could become an apprentice in a book bindery in Zurich.</span> <span id="s584">And the police authorities gave me the permission to leave the camp, because somebody guaranteed for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q; Now this bindery was from a famous German?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: Yeah, a bookbinder named Behr, who was very well known.</span> <span id="s587">He was a teacher in art schools -- bookbinding teacher -- he was known in all of Europe.</span> <span id="s588">He had a bookbinding atelier in Zurich , and he agreed to take me as an apprentice.</span> <span id="s589">No salary or very little, I think, just pennies.</span> <span id="s590">But I didn’t have to stay in the camp and could learn another trade.</span> <span id="s591">So I stayed there for a year, maybe, until I wanted to marry again --a young girl I met there -- but the Swiss authorities didn’t give her the permission to marry a foreigner who had no nationality.</span> <span id="s592">I refused to be declared a German again after all these things that had happened to me.</span> <span id="s593">So we decided we’d go back to France where I liked to be anyhow, and like many Swiss, they are happy if they can leave Switzerland and live in a bigger country.</span> <span id="s594">So we went back outside of Paris, a street called Bonliere.</span> <span id="s595">A friend of mine who lived in Switzerland, an older man, gave me permission to use his apartment.</span> <span id="s596">It was very hard to find apartments in Paris.</span> <span id="s597">So we installed ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: Now this was about what time?</span> <span id="s599">What year?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: This was 1944 or ’45.</span> <span id="s601">The war was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: That’s right, Paris was liberated by September, I guess, of ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: So maybe it was ’45.</span> <span id="s604">I don’t know exactly.</span> <span id="s605">But I couldn’t have come back when Germany…</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: That is why I was asking.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A; Yah.</span> <span id="s608">So, I found a job in Paris in a factory somewhere.</span> <span id="s609">A job.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q; In all this time, did you ever hear stories about what was going on in Poland?</span> <span id="s611">In other words, did any word reach the Jewish people or the Jewish communities of what was going on elsewhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: I don’t think that I knew it.</span> <span id="s613">I knew that my mother was deported, but I had no idea what happened to her.</span> <span id="s614">I don’t think, at this time, that we knew.</span> <span id="s615">The general public knew.</span> <span id="s616">I met a man in Zurich -- a journalist named Savolovitz -- who was one of the first Jews outside Germany to hear about the killing of millions of Jews.</span> <span id="s617">He got the first reports.</span> <span id="s618">I don’t know if you remember the name.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: I think I’ve heard of it, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: Dr. Savolovitz edited a Jewish paper -- not a daily, maybe.</span> <span id="s621">He headed some information office in Zurich -- a Jewish one.</span> <span id="s622">His name was mentioned several times that he was the first who was contacted by a German industrialist who, on the outside was Nazi, but really, he wanted England and all counties to know what happened to the Jews --and he contacted Rabbi Wise.</span> <span id="s623">But that is not for me to say, all these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: But you did meet this man.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: I knew him because my mother-in-law worked for him.</span> <span id="s626">My future wife’s mother worked in this agency.</span> <span id="s627">I forgot the name.</span> <span id="s628">We were in Paris now, after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: So, in other words, you heard some information of what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: No, not at all.</span> <span id="s631">Not in Switzerland, and not in France.</span> <span id="s632">I didn’t know these things.</span> <span id="s633">And I think the majority of people didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: So you found all this out after the war, as everybody else found out about it, in America and elsewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: So in Paris then, how long did you stay?</span> <span id="s637">How long were you in France before you came?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: I stayed in France ‘til the end of 1953.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: Were there children now?</span> <span id="s640">You were married again?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: Yeah, we were married.</span> <span id="s642">That’s why we went back to France.</span> <span id="s643">So that we could marry.</span> <span id="s644">A boy of mine was born in 1947 in Paris.</span> <span id="s645">One day we got a visit from a friend of mine from Minneapolis who came to Europe and visited us -- a friend from the youth movement in Germany.</span> <span id="s646">She could leave France shortly before -- it opened after the German invasion -- for the United States.</span> <span id="s647">She became a professor of social work here at the University later.</span> <span id="s648">She studied first.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: Who is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Gisela Konopka.</span> <span id="s651">Very well known here.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: Yes, she’s very, very well known.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: She came visiting us in France -- in Paris -- and for some reason declared, “James, you can’t live like this!</span> <span id="s654">You have to come to America!”</span> <span id="s655">I thought I lived like a king1 I had my own apartment -- not every Frenchman had it -- but she thought it would be good if I come here.</span> <span id="s656">She found a relative of mine I didn’t know, an aunt of mine, who gave us the papers.</span> <span id="s657">You needed certain papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: Sponsors.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: Responsibility.</span> <span id="s660">A Mrs. Hirschfield, here in Minneapolis, who agreed to send us the papers.</span> <span id="s661">And so, end of 1953, we could come to this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: Then you came directly here then, as soon as you arrived in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: Yeah, we stayed maybe four or five days in New York, in the black part of New York -- we had a friend whom we knew in Paris, a black girl who studied in France -- and then right away we came here, and stayed first at the house of Konopka -- a few weeks, two, three weeks -- and then entered an apartment.</span> <span id="s664">I got a job pretty soon.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Are the children now living in Minneapolis?</span> <span id="s666">Or have they grown up and left?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Yeah, we are very lucky.</span> <span id="s668">I have two boys, one boy born in France, one boy born here in Minneapolis, and they’re both here.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: Now what about their Jewish education?</span> <span id="s670">Did you keep your family sort of very secular in orientation when they were growing up?</span> <span id="s671">Or did you change?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: No, I’m not a believer.</span> <span id="s673">For some reason, I didn’t want to lie to them.</span> <span id="s674">They knew.</span> <span id="s675">We talked about it.</span> <span id="s676">It was necessary that we are Jewish, and they, the two boys, are Jewish, but I couldn’t give them any belief.</span> <span id="s677">So both went to religious schools, but that is all.</span> <span id="s678">The younger boy, he had some trouble when he was very little.</span> <span id="s679">He didn’t want to stay in the Sunday school.</span> <span id="s680">I had to stand outside the door of the classroom where through a window he could see me, or I had to put my hands up that I’m still there.</span> <span id="s681">And he didn’t want to go to the real school.</span> <span id="s682">So I thought it’s more important that he goes to the regular school, and I didn’t fight too much for Sunday school.</span> <span id="s683">But now he is interested in Jewish things.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: Does he know the story?</span> <span id="s685">Did you tell him when he was growing up, or when they were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: He knows very little.</span> <span id="s687">And he was bothering me, the younger one -- and the older one, too -- for three, four, five years to write these things I’m telling you.</span> <span id="s688">Now for some reason, lethargy or old age or laziness, I…</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: No, it’s not a pleasant subject to try to deal with.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: I have the book where I should write this.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: I’m interested in -- I think anyone who’s involved with this project is interested in -- knowing if you have any feelings about the Holocaust itself -- as you learned about it, and your own connection with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: I can’t.</span> <span id="s693">I can’t read about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: You don’t read books now about it, or films…</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: I can’t read about it.</span> <span id="s696">I don’t want to hear about it.</span> <span id="s697">I would break down and cry.</span> <span id="s698">I remember one day --I belong to a group of senior citizens here -- they are all over, all these groups -- and one day a man who’s now at the University here, I don’t know if his name is Fisch or Frisch, who was in a camp, who went to a camp in Poland, and he is teaching now, something here.</span> <span id="s699">He came to this senior citizens group and talked about how they were.</span> <span id="s700">I just had to put down my…</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: So you feel, I guess, fairly lucky, I suppose, all things considered.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: I am lucky!</span> <span id="s703">But I just don’t have the strength to hear about these things.</span> <span id="s704">I have books about it.</span> <span id="s705">I can’t read them.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Do you have any strong feelings about your upbringing -- you were living in a German-speaking culture, and your native language was German -- do you feel anything today about Germany or about any reflections about human nature?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: Oh, yeah, but I can’t hate the Germans like many German Jews do.</span> <span id="s708">I consider them victims of Hitler too, like I was.</span> <span id="s709">I don’t want to go back.</span> <span id="s710">I went back once to France, to Switzerland, to England.</span> <span id="s711">I didn’t touch German ground again.</span> <span id="s712">I don’t want to.</span> <span id="s713">But I can’t say I hate them.</span> <span id="s714">I like the German language, I like to speak and read German.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: I see that you’re reading now a book of poems by a German-writing, Jewish-born poet, Paul Salon, who you said was Romanian?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: He was born in Romania, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q; And are his poems -- now I have not read him -- on what you would call Jewish-related themes?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: Yeah, they are all, I think, somehow connected to the extermination camps and the Jewish race.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: And he, himself, is a survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: Yah, his parents were arrested, sent to the camps, and killed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: You told me before we started this interview that you had met Madame Trocme.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: Whose famous book had been published about her experiences by Philip Hallie.</span> <span id="s724">Called, Lest Innocent Blood Be Shed.</span> <span id="s725">And you know her daughter, as well, in Minneapolis, Mrs. Blackburn.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: Yah, yah.</span> <span id="s727">She became a friend, both the old lady and the daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: You said you were her chauffeur for awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: She called me, “Mon Chauffeur and Very Good Friend.”</span> <span id="s730">We write to each other.</span> <span id="s731">She writes me.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: Well if there’s anything you want to add, I think we’ve covered what we have to cover as far as your stories.</span> <span id="s733">I have a letter from Mr. Loewenson that was printed in the Star and Tribune “Neighbors’ column on Saturday, November 6, 1982.</span> <span id="s734">It combines materials from some other letters that Mr. Loewenson had written to some of his friends, and I’ll just read the letter.</span> <span id="s735">It’s titled “In the midst of terror, there was humaneness,” by James Loewenson: “Forty years ago, I lived in Montauban, the old French town where hundreds of refugees from many European countries found months, even years, of safety from German persecution during World War II.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Many could and, in time, did leave for the United States, more were finally arrested and sent to Germany and Poland, and some escaped.</span> <span id="s737">In the summer of 1942, we heard the news that a new raffle was imminent to bring the remainder of the refugees into concentration camps.</span> <span id="s738">That night I took off in (the) direction of Switzerland.</span> <span id="s739">It was then that I witnessed something exceptional and beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Forty or 50 kilometers before the Swiss border, I took a bus going in that direction.</span> <span id="s741">The bus was filled mostly with Jews from Poland, who had lived in France or Belgium for years and were trying now -- like me -- to escape from the Nazis and their death camps.</span> <span id="s742">They didn’t speak; they only whispered.</span> <span id="s743">And after a while, the bus was stopped, in the middle of nowhere: control by the French police, the “gendarmes.”</span> <span id="s744">One of them came aboard the bus, saluted, and said what you have heard so often in those days of wartime France: “Vos papiers, s’il vous plait” (Your papers please!)</span> <span id="s745">Then he went from one to the other of these terrified people, who didn’t look like Frenchmen, who couldn’t speak French, who didn’t speak at all, who didn’t dare breathe.</span> <span id="s746">He took their brand-new, forged identification papers, looked at them and gave them back, saying each time, “Merci!”</span> <span id="s747">and saluting.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">When he was finally finished with the last passenger, he turned around, saluted all of us again, left the bus and waved the driver on.</span> <span id="s749">Everybody was crying, even the driver.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">This unknown policeman, who had orders to check the bus for Jews and to arrest them, but who let them go free in plain view of his colleagues, who risked not only his job, but his liberty and his life, who rather was human than an ally of Hitler Germany -- he was the greatest hero I have ever known.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Vive la France!</span></p> <p><span id="s752">The article ends, “James Loewenson lives in south Minneapolis.</span> <span id="s753">Portions of this article were written several years ago as a personal letter to a friend .</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Mr. Loewenson, you also mentioned the role of Mr. Nudell when you came to Minneapolis in helping you find some job?</span> <span id="s755">Why don’t we have that on the record by way of conclusion for the interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: Maybe two, three days after our arrival here in Minneapolis, I had to look for a job.</span> <span id="s757">Somebody sent me to the Jewish Family and Children’s Service where Mr. Nudell listened to me, tried to find out what I knew, but I couldn’t speak English.</span> <span id="s758">I didn’t see what I could do.</span> <span id="s759">But he took the phone after seeing me for ten minutes, and after he was through talking to somebody, he gave me the address where I had to go the next morning.</span> <span id="s760">And I had a job.</span> <span id="s761">It was Napo Industries in Hopkins.</span> <span id="s762">I had a job even without knowing the language, and I was very impressed by this.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: I imagine you were!</span> <span id="s764">We would all be happy if we could get action that quick!</span> <span id="s765">Well, I appreciate it very much for your time that we went over this.</span> <span id="s766">And I know it’s not easy for you.</span> <span id="s767">If there’s anything else you wanted to say, you’re welcome to add.</span> <span id="s768">It’s your privilege.</span> <span id="s769">No?</span> <span id="s770">We’re concluded!</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: Alright.</span> <span id="s773">This concludes Mr. James Loewenson’s interview in relation to the Oral History Project of the Jewish Community Relations Council.</span></p>
