to Belgium when I was six months old.</span> <span id="s21">He had a fur store.</span> <span id="s22">And he kept that store until the end when he was deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: Why did your family move to Belgium, when they told you the story, why did they choose to move?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: My family moved, my uncles, my aunts, the whole family moved from Poland to Belgium.</span> <span id="s25">They wanted to be together and as, I have four uncles and they all moved, as well as my grandfather, so my parents decided to move, too.</span> <span id="s26">The only reason.</span> <span id="s27">They all went and we lived in Antwerp, Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: __________.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Antwerp?</span> <span id="s30">Antwerp is a big town, I really don't know how many people, it's a Flemish town, Brussels is French and Antwerp is Flemish.</span> <span id="s31">But, went to school there and I was supposed to college, but couldn't make it because the war and everything interrupted, but I studied by the nuns after that.</span> <span id="s32">But, my parents were taken away, my brother and I were left alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Let's go back a little bit, how, do you know the year that you moved to Antwerp?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: No, '27, around 1927.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: So, what language was spoken at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: At home we spoke a lot of Yiddish and later on we spoke mostly French, but in the beginning, mostly Yiddish.</span> <span id="s37">Because in Antwerp, they spoke Flemish and my brother, my parents and I spoke French.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: What about, you know, the family life and religion, did you observe Friday, tell us a little bit about that, what was the family life like in terms of worshiping and __________?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: We, my parents were religious, they __________ Shabbis(ph), like they say.</span> <span id="s40">Kept the Shabbis and we kept a kosher home and that's what I do now because I was brought up like that.</span> <span id="s41">But still, my father was not over-religious, but when I broke my leg that was two months before the Germans invaded Belgium, he would go to my grandmother, three, four, five miles and ask if he can take me to the hospital for my leg.</span> <span id="s42">My grandfather would say, yes, she's a girl, when she wants to marry, she'll have one leg shorter than the other one, you better take her to the hospital because my father wouldn't ride on the Shabbis, so he would go to my grandfather and ask what should he do.</span> <span id="s43">And a girlfriend of mine, a school friend who saved my life and that I'm in touch with her and I keep her up now, she came and signed all my, what you put on, the cast, she made designs and that, and even that the Germans took away, I never had it, the cast.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: So your father went to your grandfather and said, "What should I do, should I break the Sabbath or should I observe it?"</span> <span id="s45">Breaking it meant getting care for you, what did he decide?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: My grandfather decide he should break it because otherwise I'll have one leg, God forbid, shorter than the other and that's very important at that time.</span> <span id="s47">Because if they don't do it immediately, it's very dangerous, so we did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Talk a little bit about maybe some of the holidays or did you, did you

every day, but we didn't live in a Jewish neighborhood, we lived far away from the Jewish neighborhood and even then, we kept the Shabbat(ph).</span> <span id="s53">It's, the whole family, more or less, kept the Shabbat and were religious to a certain point, not that they had their head covered or what, but you can say orthodox.</span> <span id="s54">They were orthodox, you can say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: What was your favorite holiday?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: The Hanukkah and we got gifts, that's when we got gifts and that was a very good holiday, I liked it.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: __________.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: At that time, they didn't give gifts, they gave some change, some money, some candies.</span> <span id="s59">Some candies, some money, not much, but we weren't so demanding like they youth of today, so whatever we got, we were happy.</span> <span id="s60">Everyone in the family gave the children from the other one, gifts, that mean Hanukkah money, they called it.</span> <span id="s61">And that's what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Do you remember with your other friends, being aware of being Jewish, when you were real little, before any of the war started?</span> <span id="s63">Or did it just, was it more that you were just another kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s65">No, no.</span> <span id="s66">I had a lot of friends who were Jewish, I had that friend who I told you that saved my life, that was not Jewish, but she learned Jewish and during the war she

she said, "I did it for love.</span> <span id="s68">I didn't do it for, by interest".</span> <span id="s69">That's what she says to now.</span> <span id="s70">We wanted her to come to Israel, __________ to America because she's a painter, she __________.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: __________.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: That's all, she doesn't want to come here.</span> <span

remember.</span> <span id="s80">When it went near the deportation and people were a little afraid to go out, she would make our own __________ from scratch.</span> <span id="s81">But she didn't mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Think back, when do you remember first starting to think, things are not normal any more.</span> <span id="s83">You said when it got closer to deportation, what

and then the German took her away and made __________.</span> <span id="s85">And before the deportation, they took away...</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: That story went too fast, what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: A friend of mine stood in line to get some bread at the time.</span> <span id="s88">And the German took her away, that worked on me, or it hit me very strongly because it was a very close school friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: __________.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s91">No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: How did you hear about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Her sister told me that she went along for the bread, they took her away and they never heard about her.</span> <span id="s94">She was then 11.</span> <span id="s95">She stood in line to get the bread for the family.</span> <span id="s96">And then two days later, my two cousins, one 17, one 20, were taken away on a train and they, in the middle of the highway, when the train went, not a highway, when the train went, one jumped out.</span> <span id="s97">And they found out and they shoot after him and they killed him on the spot.</span> <span id="s98">He was 17, my first cousin.</span> <span id="s99">And his brother jumped, they never found him, they don't know, until now, where, what, when, happened to him.</span> <span id="s100">Never came back anyway.</span> <span id="s101">So, must have been killed or what, we never knew.</span> <span id="s102">But this one, they shoot after him and they saw him jumping from the train.</span> <span id="s103">He was 17, at that time 17 was young.</span> <span id="s104">Nowaday, the people, but then 17 was young, it was another generation, if you want.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: How old were you when you first started to notice that things were different?</span> <span id="s106">Was it when the Germans invaded or was it a little before did you start noticing?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: I started before because my mother used to tell us that it was very hard times in Poland and so on and about the family of hers in Poland, so I started to understand.</span> <span id="s108">But til it happened, we didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: What, how old were you when the Germans invaded?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: Oh, 10.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Do you remember that __________.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s113">We went, all the Jews, most of the Jews in Antwerp, went, their packages and they went walking and riding to the French from there.</span> <span id="s114">But we didn't make it and we wanted to go over to France, we thought would save us.</span> <span id="s115">And after a few days, they said that the German are not so bad and all the Jews went back to Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Your family actually __________.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: My family packed, my family, my uncles, my aunts, we all packed up and went to the French border.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Do you remember those discussions among your parents about what to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: No, they said that it seems the German are not so bad, so why shouldn't we go back and be in our house?</span> <span id="s120">Because we just took a few things and left, that's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: It was hard to believe that it was that dangerous?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s123">Right,

when you got back?</span> <span id="s127">How were things different?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: When we got back it was okay, I remember the child, there was a man that the wife worked for my father in the furs, and he was jealous that a lot of Jews went away to France, Spain, to save themselves, not to stay.</span> <span id="s129">And most of my family left, only not my uncle.</span> <span id="s130">One uncle.</span> <span id="s131">My father didn't want to leave my grandfather, so we didn't go away.</span> <span id="s132">But that man would, create, what's the English, squeeze...</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Squeal?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Squeal, he would squeal on Jews and at the end he finished in a camp anyway, but he squeals a lot on Jews.</span> <span id="s135">Not on my father, my family, because his wife used to work for us.</span> <span id="s136">So, he came to my father, he say, "I won't squeal on you".</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: What did your neighborhood look like?</span> <span id="s138">Did it look different?</span> <span id="s139">Did, how was it different?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: The neighborhood was not Jewish, there was only a man on the fourth floor, it was four floor __________, and he was __________ American and he told my parents to go away from the house.</span> <span id="s141">That was after two months, I left the house to be hidden.</span> <span id="s142">And that woman had two daughters who were, excuse me, whores.</span> <span id="s143">And she came down and she said to my father, "Look, I owe you.</span> <span id="s144">I'm __________, it's nothing or nothing, I don't have the money to pay you and I squealed.</span> <span id="s145">And I'm sorry I squealed, so I want you to go away because Jews there, at 8:00 they're going to come to take you".</span> <span id="s146">So my father say, "You, my friend, my wife just made you a cake, I don't believe it.</span> <span id="s147">I don't believe it".</span> <span id="s148">And, believe it or not, 8:00 Tuesday they came and my brother, who didn't want to leave the house, that the neighbor wanted to take him in and put him under the bed, and he didn't want, so he closed himself in the toilet, and they broke the toilet, they took him along.</span> <span id="s149">But she was sorry, so after the war she met me and she was sorry that she squealed, it was too late.</span> <span id="s150">And she was sorry, she came and told them.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Cray(ph).</span> <span id="s153">Mrs. Cray.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: She was German?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s156">She was Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Let's go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s158">Why, what was going on that made your parents concerned enough to send you away?</span> <span id="s159">What were you hearing?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: I was a very nervous child at the time.</span> <span id="s161">And my brother didn't want to leave and as my friend said, "I have an aunt who lives out of town and she will take care and why don't you let her there?"</span> <span id="s162">So they decided, and I'll never forget, I went by train, my father took me by the, to the train, and in Belgium, in Antwerp, if a German walked in the street and you were Jew, you should walk in the middle of the street, not on the sidewalk where the German.</span> <span id="s163">My father must have been excited that he leaves me, who knows if he'll see me again, he didn't know, it would be so bad, we walked on the street, a German came, stopped and gave him two beatings on the face.</span> <span id="s164">And I had a very big respect for my father and I started to cry and shout because who would slap my father?</span> <span id="s165">I never saw it, I never heard of it __________.</span> <span id="s166">That's it.</span> <span id="s167">He had a store first, but he went with me to the station to take the train I should go to the people who were hidden, hiding me.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: __________.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Nothing, you wouldn't dare to say something because my best friend that I tell you, her mother had a store and one day I met, there were German coming into her and what kind of friendship she had with him.</span> <span id="s170">And he liked me because he had a child the same age as mine and he liked me very much, he wanted only to give me a kiss or a hug and I didn't want.</span> <span id="s171">So, one day I wore my David Star and I went in the street with my mother and I walked across the street, I saw the German.</span> <span id="s172">He didn't know I'm Jewish.</span> <span id="s173">So I run in the first store, my mother didn't understand the reason.</span> <span id="s174">So the second day he came to my friend's mother and he said, "I could have given any amount of money that I saw that little Anny, but it was a Jewish girl, it's not Anny, but she just look like her".</span> <span id="s175">He saw me but he, he couldn't believe it was me because I'm not Jewish, he didn't understand.</span> <span id="s176">I didn't know what he would have done if he would know, but he was sure it was me.</span> <span id="s177">And it was me.</span> <span id="s178">But I disappeared, I was very fast, I disappeared when I saw his face.</span> <span id="s179">All that I had in mind is go, go.</span> <span id="s180">That's what I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: So you're describing already some new rules.</span> <span id="s182">You had to wear a star.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: Of David.</span> <span id="s185">If you saw a German coming, you had to get out of the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: What were some of the other rules?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: The rules that children couldn't go in the regular school.</span> <span id="s189">Children couldn't go in the library.</span> <span id="s190">Couldn't go to any doctor they wanted, only to certain doctors.</span> <span id="s191">There was a lot of things you couldn't do, a lot of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: And how did your parents explain it to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: They sat down and they told us that because we Jewish, they look, not Jews like we, Jews that are the third generation they check.</span> <span id="s194">And they explained to us and that's it.</span> <span id="s195">And I always said I could write a book, lot of stories because I went through, during the hiding, a lot that I didn't even say my tape.</span> <span id="s196">And that's it.</span> <span id="s197">And now I don't get a penny from the Germans, I don't get a penny.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: __________ explore that, not right now, but when we do the whole __________.</span> <span id="s199">So how soon after the Germans, do you remember hearing that the Germans had invaded?</span> <span id="s200">Do you remember that moment?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s202">Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: That was the 10 of May, 1940, they invaded Belgium.</span> <span id="s205">And as I told you before, the Belgian Jews didn't know how bad it is, we ran away.</span> <span id="s206">And then when we came back, they said that the Jews from Belgium, born in Belgium, would not be taken away, the Queen announced.</span> <span id="s207">And my aunt was born in Belgium and she didn't hide or nothing.</span> <span id="s208">But my uncle was sitting there and he lived three days, everything closed, they took them away and he was left because he was hiding.</span> <span id="s209">Had a child one and a half and six years old.</span> <span id="s210">Then after three days when he came down, they were gone.</span> <span id="s211">And he was closed in the apartment, in the house, it was a house.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: But, so, the scenario is this, that the Germans invaded, many, many Jews left.</span> <span id="s213">After a few days they came back and they found these new rules.</span> <span id="s214">How long did you live like that before your parents decided it was not safe?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Two years.</span> <span id="s216">Two years.</span> <span id="s217">It started and started and people would go away and go away, and my parents wouldn't leave my grandfather and that's the reason we stayed and that's the reason they were taken away.</span> <span id="s218">And my grandfather was taken away and then he was 78.</span> <span id="s219">My grandmother was taken to a hospital where she lived during the war.</span> <span id="s220">But my father was a very good son, as you can understand.</span> <span id="s221">From all the five sons, he was the only one who didn't want to leave.</span> <span id="s222">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Did that cause arguments between your mother and your father?</span> <span id="s224">Did your mother want to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: I don't think so because she let him decide and she did what he wanted.</span> <span id="s226">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: Did you ever talk about it with your older brother, you and your brother might be sitting together?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: Maybe not much, he took me much younger than I was and felt he's older, he shouldn't tell me, he shouldn't talk about it.</span> <span id="s229">But, that's all what I remember, maybe yes, but I don't __________ spoke a lot.</span> <span id="s230">We didn't talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Did your father ever try to explain it to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: No, he explained to me that I'll be a short while by these people, then they'll come and pick me up to be home.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: So, let's talk about this.</span> <span id="s234">Was there any one thing that made your parents decide that you should go into hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Yes, they said that a lot of my friends were taken away.</span> <span id="s236">My best friend, she was a little older, she said, "Oh, I am so happy to go away, I'll be able to put blue on my eyes and lipstick".</span> <span id="s237">And she didn't know where and what she's going.</span> <span id="s238">And my parents said we want you to be somewhere we know where you are.</span> <span id="s239">We don't want you to go with her or what.</span> <span id="s240">Because I wanted to go with that friend because we were very close, a Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s241">She never came back.</span> <span id="s242">She never came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: So a lot of families were beginning to send their children away?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: But there wasn't, I mean, one thing?</span> <span id="s246">One day this happened and the next day you went into hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s248">No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: Tell us about your friend, Raphael, who became, you assumed her identity.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Just tell us, imagine that we don't know anything about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: She was very good, she was an only daughter, she liked me and when I was hiding, she went to my aunt, that I told you was Belgian, she went to bring her food.</span> <span id="s253">She went to my grandfather, she went to my parents while they were staying in Belgium, and she was extremely good.</span> <span id="s254">She would put on a Star of David and go in the Jewish neighborhood, she had black hair so she looked Jewish, so everybody took her for a Jew, but she could have been arrested and taken away because she wore the David Star and the David Star here.</span> <span id="s255">So, but she said in her mind, "I want to help".</span> <span id="s256">She really was helping and doing most she could.</span> <span id="s257">Raphael __________.</span> <span id="s258">There's a little French there.</span> <span id="s259">And that's it.</span> <span id="s260">So my uncle, when he was taken away, lived with nuns in a convent where there was 50, 40 nuns, nobody knew he is a man, nobody knew he is Jewish, only the Mother Superior, the Superior Mother.</span> <span id="s261">The Mother in charge from the whole nuns there.</span> <span id="s262">She knew that he's a man and he's Jewish.</span> <span id="s263">But the nuns didn't know and as he had black hair and a beard, he shaved four to five times a day, he wore the clothes as a nun.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: He was a nun, he pretended to be a woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Yeah, as a woman and a nun.</span> <span id="s266">So four or five times a day he would shave and eat only kosher.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Israel Livingston.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: How did he get into the monastery?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: The woman who used to work for him, the maid, the housekeeper, she knew that monastery, she talked to them and when he was closed in the house, she went through the roof and went into the house and put him on clothes from her husband who died.</span> <span id="s271">Gave him the identity card of her husband that didn't look at all like him.</span> <span id="s272">And she took him by train to the monastery in Brussels.</span> <span id="s273">So she put her life at stake, too.</span> <span id="s274">And they went to Brussels and the Mother Superior knew about him and that's it.</span> <span id="s275">And he stayed there a year.</span> <span id="s276">A full year in the monastery.</span> <span id="s277">Dressed and lived like a nun, five times a day he shaved.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: And he did this after the Nazis had searched the home and taken his wife and children away?</span> <span id="s279">So he knew he was in danger?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: No, he didn't know that same night, that Friday night, they were religious people, they didn't know they coming for him.</span> <span id="s281">They thought they coming for them, not for him, they coming for him, not for them.</span> <span id="s282">So they said all the time, stay where you are, like hysteric.</span> <span id="s283">He was upstairs on the third floor.</span> <span id="s284">They were downstairs.</span> <span id="s285">When they opened the door, they thought somebody squealed on him and they looking for him.</span> <span id="s286">Like they looked for me a few times when I was hidden.</span> <span id="s287">But it was not true.</span> <span id="s288">They looked for them and not for him, they didn't know he is in the building.</span> <span id="s289">So they took away all the family.</span> <span id="s290">And when they saw good furniture or good things, they would close from outside to inside the house, nobody should go in.</span> <span id="s291">So they seal the house til they take out a family.</span> <span id="s292">So they sealed it and he was inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Let's go back to, do you remember your mother talking to you before, the day before you went away or the night?</span> <span id="s294">What did she say?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: She would say, "Look, we have to send you away.</span> <span id="s296">It's for your own good, we hope to be together soon".</span> <span id="s297">So we thought so.</span> <span id="s298">And after the war, we prepared 12 bedrooms, full bedrooms, and nobody came back.</span> <span id="s299">Twenty-eight from the family were taken.</span> <span id="s300">Close, you know, father's family, close, aunts and uncles and cousins.</span> <span id="s301">Very close, 28, were taken away.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: What did you take with you when you went into hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Maybe three dresses, two dresses, because I used to go to church every Sunday, they made me go.</span> <span id="s304">Because the people in the neighborhood, they __________ I'm a niece from out of town.</span> <span id="s305">And that dress I would wear Sunday, then nothing, a skirt and a top, maybe.</span> <span id="s306">Nothing special.</span> <span id="s307">My socks were all hard from mending, not like now, they mended the socks.</span> <span id="s308">I would need the socks, wear them.</span> <span id="s309">And they got money for me every month.</span> <span id="s310">And once my parents were taken, they were worried.</span> <span id="s311">The money will stop.</span> <span id="s312">I don't think they would give me up or what, they wanted to adopt me after the war because they had a sick girl, retarded, they wanted to adopt me and my uncle didn't want me to become Catholic.</span> <span id="s313">And they had respect for me, there was never pork in the house while I lived there.</span> <span id="s314">But, they were very strict to me, very strict.</span> <span id="s315">If I break an egg, I wouldn't get an egg for three days.</span> <span id="s316">And the food was not too much.</span> <span id="s317">When I had once an accident, they wouldn't call a doctor because they were afraid.</span> <span id="s318">So, it was not easy when you're very spoiled from home, because I was very spoiled as an only daughter.</span> <span id="s319">And that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Did you take anything from home like a doll or photographs?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: No, only the diary, only the diary, no jewelry.</span> <span id="s322">Only the diary, and now I'm more in touch than all these years was a cousin of mine that went last week to the Holocaust Museum and I got a ticket and she...</span></p> <p><span id="s323">[end of side A of tape one of three]</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: You were talking about your cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: And now we got in touch very much and we're very close again.</span> <span id="s326">We were very close as children.</span> <span id="s327">And she started to call here and I came now and I said, "I want to give you that page from the diary, if I find my diary".</span> <span id="s328">Then I started to looking.</span> <span id="s329">One day I'll give it to you, make you a copy.</span> <span id="s330">But she painted me a sheep and she say, "Our love is forever".</span> <span id="s331">It was the last thing I saw her for many, many years, maybe 30, 40 years I didn't see, didn't hear.</span> <span id="s332">Now she lives in Houston, Texas.</span> <span id="s333">But in the war, no, she was in Ecuador, she wasn't in Belgium.</span> <span id="s334">She didn't go through anything.</span> <span id="s335">And when we met a week ago or two, she didn't believe that I don't get money from the Nazi war because we went through so much, we said, "Ours was our daughters".</span> <span id="s336">And I told them, I don't know if I said it in my tape, I don't think, how they look to me and so on during the war, they were sitting and crying.</span> <span id="s337">But I went through __________ losing my husband that I can't cry.</span> <span id="s338">It's not good, it's healthier when you cry.</span> <span id="s339">But I cried a lot after the war and then later I can't.</span> <span id="s340">It's inside, you see, some people cry fast, but I can't.</span> <span id="s341">I just can't cry so fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: Who gave you the diary?</span> <span id="s343">It was your already?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: I kept it all the time in the war.</span> <span id="s345">And then when I moved from Israel here to get married, I got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: No, but I mean, how, when did you start it?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: I started in Belgium, my parents gave it to me, like diary with a little mirror.</span> <span id="s348">And I started to write, to give it to my friends, and they all signed, most are not there.</span> <span id="s349">You know, children.</span> <span id="s350">And then, at the end, in the diary, if you see, it's written about my parents, my cousin who was taken away and how I feel and how I, and it was very sensitive.</span> <span id="s351">But then when I made the tea, I say, "If you want I give you that copy".</span> <span id="s352">So they say, "No, I want the original".</span> <span id="s353">So I gave the original.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Describe arriving at your new home, where was it and how, what kind of room did you have when you were in hiding?</span> <span id="s355">When you were sent away to a family of your best friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: It was a bad feeling.</span> <span id="s357">It was a feeling like lost because I always had my parents near me and I was spoiled and loved and cherished.</span> <span id="s358">But they tried to be very nice, the man was very, very intelligent and he wanted me only to study, study, gave me private lesson in German.</span> <span id="s359">And then he put me by the nuns to study, studied English and French literature.</span> <span id="s360">He wanted me only to study.</span> <span id="s361">And by the way, last week I wrote a letter to Ellie(ph) Vazel(ph) about somebody and I wrote about me and he wanted me only to study and know more because he knew a lot.</span> <span id="s362">And they had a retarded child, as I told you and the marriage was not very successful.</span> <span id="s363">And I was very naive because when the army came, the English army, we had an Englishman living there, started a little, started with his wife, but I didn't know because they brought me up, I was at the age 15, 16, like a little girl of seven, eight.</span> <span id="s364">He wanted me only to study, only to study.</span> <span id="s365">And I must be thankful to him, the languages, what I know now, is all thanks to him because he insisted I should study.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: What were their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Collette and Henri, French names.</span> <span id="s368">And the family name was very French, Gramoulet(ph).</span> <span id="s369">Big, __________, like in Holland and Belgium, __________.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: __________</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: Yeah, Gramoulet, big windmill, translate word by word, but that's a name, a family name.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: So did you speak French with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Yeah, only French.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: What did the house look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: Oh, they had a beautiful home.</span> <span id="s376">Beautiful garden.</span> <span id="s377">But a lot of shooting during the war because it was near a train station and they said to the neighbors that I was a little sick and I cannot stay in a big city, so they, it was around 50 miles from Brussels.</span> <span id="s378">They, I cannot stay in the city with my parents, I have to have fresh air of the suburbs, that's the reason they took me.</span> <span id="s379">And they want me to stay with them.</span> <span id="s380">But I had a lot of, lot of accidents.</span> <span id="s381">That being the first and the worst accident was that I went to a man who gave me an identity card.</span> <span id="s382">You need cards for food and identity.</span> <span id="s383">And I saw that big truck with people from the German and I couldn't hide and I couldn't run away.</span> <span id="s384">But inside the truck was a boy who knew me from Belgium, from Antwerp.</span> <span id="s385">And his parents wanted him to stay, __________ they didn't know him and they didn't want, so he said to somebody in the wagon that I am Jewish, not Catholic.</span> <span id="s386">So they looked at me, but I had disappeared.</span> <span id="s387">I wasn't there, so the German looked for me after that in every house they came, there was maybe in the street, five like houses, villas they called it.</span> <span id="s388">And they looked but they couldn't find me because it took five minutes to stretch between the tennis, you and I play tennis, there is the, you know, what's in between us, the net, that's between us, goes like that, so when you turn it that was like steps and I took it up on the attic, I took it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Wait.</span> <span id="s390">You crawled up a net?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: No, the net, we used to take the net and put it here and that is the attic, I would go up.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: You would make sort of a stairs.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s394">I would go up the kind of stairs, take up the net, close the door and that was the attic, you could not put a ladder, you could not put a chair and go up, you couldn't reach, only with that net.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: You sort of climbed up a rope net?</span> <span id="s396">__________</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: You did it.</span> <span id="s398">And closed the door.</span> <span id="s399">I was small, but stayed there three hours.</span> <span id="s400">When I came back, I was half fainted because it was a chimney, like a chimney, you know, for the coal and so I was half fainted when they took me out from there.</span> <span id="s401">They looked three-quarter of an hour in the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: And what did that sound like when they were looking for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: At the same moment it was like, just I'm going to faint, that I felt like I'm going any minute to faint because it was hot from the coal and it was hot from that going up in a rush.</span> <span id="s404">It's not that you take it easy, you go slowly, I had to make it in two minutes, go up, take the net, close the door from inside, it was all, and don't forget, I was very childish.</span> <span id="s405">It's not that you're grown up and you know what you do, why, what, when.</span> <span id="s406">But at the same moment you do it because you feel you want to live.</span> <span id="s407">You want to stay alive.</span> <span id="s408">And the second day...</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Let's stay with this just for a second, though.</span> <span id="s410">So are you standing up...</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: No, laying, laying.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Laying down.</span> <span id="s413">And what can you hear?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: I can hear not good because the door is closed, but I can hear a little.</span> <span id="s415">A little.</span> <span id="s416">Like screaming saying, "To hell with it, where is she?</span> <span id="s417">Isn't she here?"</span> <span id="s418">"No".</span> <span id="s419">But I have a feeling she's here.</span> <span id="s420">"Is she here?"</span> <span id="s421">"No".</span> <span id="s422">And it would go on and go on for half an hour.</span> <span id="s423">And you would stand just here and I am just on top of you.</span> <span id="s424">So any minute I thought you'll find out, but you had no way.</span> <span id="s425">If you're smaller, you had no way to come up, because it was too narrow and too small and you couldn't come up.</span> <span id="s426">And then the second day from that, they didn't give up on me.</span> <span id="s427">They say they know that they have a Jewess at __________.</span> <span id="s428">So it went so fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: So the Germans said that they were sure...</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Sure there was some __________ hiding a Jew.</span> <span id="s431">So they came unexpected, I didn't have the time to go up, so they put me in the garden and then like buried me.</span> <span id="s432">They put earth on me and I was there.</span> <span id="s433">The same time, the next day.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Oh, the next day.</span> <span id="s435">Who took you in the garden?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: My aunt, my aunt.</span> <span id="s437">They digged a hole, they put me in, they covered the hole and they were looking in the garden, but there was no sign, there was nothing, you understand?</span> <span id="s438">Because there was no sign that there was somebody, there was plants and there was potatoes or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Did you resist being buried?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: I don't know, I remember that I was sick for two days after that, I was staying in bed and I was crying all the time.</span> <span id="s441">Because I didn't know why they did it to me.</span> <span id="s442">She say, "It's for your own good".</span> <span id="s443">She was very, very nice, very stingy, I remember, but very nice.</span> <span id="s444">Very warm person, but stingy, very stingy.</span> <span id="s445">That was all in one week.</span> <span id="s446">The attic, __________, and the third day, it was not finished.</span> <span id="s447">I was supposed to go to the man who gave me the identity card.</span> <span id="s448">And it was not like from here to the corner, it was not far and he had to change something on my identity card, it was in Raphael's name.</span> <span id="s449">So he, he saw I am young and he take advantage, he say, "I insist, you should tell me that's your real name".</span> <span id="s450">It's not my real name.</span> <span id="s451">I say, "It's my real name".</span> <span id="s452">__________ I wasn't so stupid.</span> <span id="s453">And he insisted, I wouldn't tell.</span> <span id="s454">So then he say, you know, "Leave me your identity card here.</span> <span id="s455">Next Monday, I'll give it to you".</span> <span id="s456">And I had a feeling, sixth sense, not to give him, I say, "I'll give it to you Sunday".</span> <span id="s457">I came home and I cried, I say, "He wanted that card".</span> <span id="s458">She says, "You didn't give it to him?"</span> <span id="s459">I say, "No, I had a feeling not to".</span> <span id="s460">She say, "My child, do whatever you feel".</span> <span id="s461">The next morning she came to me and she hugged me, she say, "You know, they killed him".</span> <span id="s462">He was on his way somewhere and he had identity cards, 25 or 30, and all these people were taken away.</span> <span id="s463">You didn't know if he worked for the Germans and for the American, for both.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: __________ double?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Double.</span> <span id="s466">So they never knew who killed him.</span> <span id="s467">But the people were all taken away.</span> <span id="s468">She was very, very happy that I didn't give him the card because there was the address and the name and the age, everything on the identity card.</span> <span id="s469">So she was very happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: I want to go back to, I mean, how little were you?</span> <span id="s471">How quickly could you dig a hole for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: I didn't dig it.</span> <span id="s473">They digged it maybe two or three days in advance in case they needed it.</span> <span id="s474">They prepared.</span> <span id="s475">I didn't dig it.</span> <span id="s476">Not I knew, not I would.</span> <span id="s477">No, I didn't dig that hole.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: Did you close your eyes?</span> <span id="s479">Did they put a blanket over you?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: Nothing, nothing.</span> <span id="s481">Just plain, yeah.</span> <span id="s482">Just alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: And how long were you underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Maybe half an hour she told me.</span> <span id="s485">But it was like a year.</span> <span id="s486">But it was only a half a year, a half an hour, that's all.</span> <span id="s487">No, and I could never have a doctor like one time I made soap and I burned all my hands, here I have signs and they would not call a doctor.</span> <span id="s488">All that boiling water and soap, we didn't have soap, so we made soap ourselves, they couldn't call the doctor because they were afraid.</span> <span id="s489">The only thing is, I went Sunday to church and that's all.</span> <span id="s490">For now.</span> <span id="s491">She used to say, "You pray for your God.</span> <span id="s492">I know you don't pray, but you pray for your God".</span> <span id="s493">I say, "Not supposed to pray for your God in a church".</span> <span id="s494">I said, "You have to go to a synagogue, you cannot pray in a church".</span> <span id="s495">She say, "You can".</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Do you think that's true?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: I don't think you can pray in a church for a synagogue, I don't think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Who, when you say like after you were buried alive, that you cried for two days, who comforted you?</span> <span id="s499">Or did anyone touch you or __________.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: They comforted me, but not like a mother.</span> <span id="s501">Not like a mother.</span> <span id="s502">I don't know how you feel with your mother, but it was missing because it was not the comfort of a mother.</span> <span id="s503">But they tried to calm me down, make me calm.</span> <span id="s504">But, it was not too strong, the comfort.</span> <span id="s505">Maybe at that time, at that moment, going through what I went through, I was a little hard and I overcome this.</span> <span id="s506">You understand?</span> <span id="s507">But, you know.</span> <span id="s508">That's what I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: When you were in the hole, with the dirt on top of you, could you hear the Germans looking for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: No, but I felt like, go, a certain moment, it was like they go on top of me, but otherwise, I don't know where they are.</span> <span id="s511">But when they walk near me, it felt like you walk on my head.</span> <span id="s512">But that's all, but I didn't react.</span> <span id="s513">Maybe I was too weak or maybe I was mixed up or maybe I was anxious and nervous from what's happening.</span> <span id="s514">They would say in advance, I would say, "I don't accept, I won't do it".</span> <span id="s515">And then I did it because they wanted me to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: They had warned you that that might happen, and you said, "I don't want to be buried?"</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: No, they say, we might have to do that.</span> <span id="s518">I say, "I would prefer to go up in the attic".</span> <span id="s519">She said to wait and see what situation will be.</span> <span id="s520">Then the situation didn't come to go to the attic and they had no other way than to do that.</span> <span id="s521">Because if they don't save me, they would be taken away to one because all the __________ of the family, we gave somebody, and the son squealed on the father, they took away his father and all the silver of the family.</span> <span id="s522">So I told her to __________, I read it in the paper what, so she said, "You see, God forbid if they take you, they take us away, too because we wanted to save you.</span> <span id="s523">So we also in danger as much as you are".</span> <span id="s524">She explained to me, she says, "So, you have to do what we tell you to do because we just in danger like you are".</span> <span id="s525">So I decided to do what she tells me.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: What did you call her?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: Aunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: What was a regular day like?</span> <span id="s529">Did you think every day, maybe the Germans will come looking for me?</span> <span id="s530">Maybe just describe a regular day.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: I got up in the morning and I was, I was in a very bad mood because I didn't know what the day is going to bring and they had a, like a maid who would take care of the daughter and they would let me help her.</span> <span id="s532">And they would teach me how to take the dust, not like that, like that.</span> <span id="s533">How to clean house.</span> <span id="s534">All that what my mother never asked from me.</span> <span id="s535">She said, "One day you'll be on your own.</span> <span id="s536">If you're rich, you'll have a maid.</span> <span id="s537">If you don't know what to do with yourself, you won't be able to tell her how to do it.</span> <span id="s538">So I want you to know, I want you to do it.</span> <span id="s539">And then you can give orders to somebody else.</span> <span id="s540">But first, you have to teach yourself to do it.</span> <span id="s541">You have to decide your own, because you never know, maybe you have no parents one day".</span> <span id="s542">She knew that it might happen.</span> <span id="s543">She wanted to prepare me mentally, as well as her husband who, I told you, was very intelligent and was very realistic and he thought it might happen that she will be alone left, so let's prepare her.</span> <span id="s544">But, I didn't want to think about it.</span> <span id="s545">Sometimes you know it's going to happen, but you don't want, you don't want to think it's going to happen, you don't want to accept it.</span> <span id="s546">But that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: How long did you live in hiding with these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: I lived two years.</span> <span id="s549">They wanted, also, after the war, not to give me back, they wanted to adopt me when my uncle came and stayed.</span> <span id="s550">But the aunt was not pleasant because she left her husband and went away with the Englishman and for a long time the husband thought that I had something to do, that I helped her out.</span> <span id="s551">And I didn't know, I was very naive.</span> <span id="s552">They used to go everything, Monday, to Brussels, and they took me along, we went to movie, we went shopping, after the war, the wife of my uncle, my aunt.</span> <span id="s553">And then one day I became sick, they went by themselves, they never took me again.</span> <span id="s554">They liked to be by themself.</span> <span id="s555">I didn't know why, they had an affair, I didn't know what's an affair.</span> <span id="s556">I didn't know what's an affair.</span> <span id="s557">So he was a little angry at the end, he say, "I give so much of myself to that girl and she didn't be thankful to me".</span> <span id="s558">So my uncle said, "She was naive, it's not that she was mean or what.</span> <span id="s559">She didn't understand".</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: Your uncle thought that somehow you had a role in his wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: The uncle, the non-Jew.</span> <span id="s562">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: The pretend uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: The pretend uncle thought I have a role by helping them to get together while I didn't understand and I didn't want to say that on the tape, I'll tell you later, I didn't understand.</span> <span id="s565">That I'm helping or not, I didn't grasp, I wasn't like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: Were you able to hear anything about your parents during, when you first moved in with these people who hid you?</span> <span id="s567">Did you keep in touch at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: A week or two, that's all.</span> <span id="s569">A week or two.</span> <span id="s570">Two weeks, that's all, not more.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: So how did they keep in touch?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: The people who lived next door to us would call him at work, my uncle, my pretend uncle, but then they stopped calling.</span> <span id="s573">And when they were taken away, and the money finished, every three months they paid for me, they paid money, they should keep me.</span> <span id="s574">So she used to say to me, "How will we get the money?"</span> <span id="s575">Because they also took me a lot because of the money they needed, naturally.</span> <span id="s576">So the man, the owner from the apartment, non-Jew, used to send the money every three months like before.</span> <span id="s577">His own money.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: A friend of your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: No, the owner of the apartment where we lived, my parents, he sent his own money because he said later, he was afraid maybe I'll give me up or what and he send the money every three months.</span> <span id="s580">And we in touch with his son, he's dead.</span> <span id="s581">His son is in touch and he would say the nicest thing in every letter for Christmas and New Year that he writes me, "My father didn't save you to go to a country where there is war all the time.</span> <span id="s582">My father didn't save you".</span> <span id="s583">Every year he writes me the same sentence.</span> <span id="s584">A nice man, he's around my age and he's nice.</span> <span id="s585">We used to play when we were young and he's very nice, he writes me very nice letters.</span> <span id="s586">And such kind of people I like get in touch and like to be in touch.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: So how long was it after you went into hiding that your parents were deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: Half a year, four months.</span> <span id="s589">Four months.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: How did you hear about that?</span> <span id="s591">Who told you?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: A long time after that they told me.</span> <span id="s593">They didn't tell me that when it was fresh, months after that, they didn't want me to know, they didn't know what reaction I will have and they didn't know.</span> <span id="s594">They didn't tell me that when it was fresh.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: When they did tell you the story, who told you?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: My aunt, my aunt.</span> <span id="s597">It was Raphael, yeah, Raphael told her a few days after because she didn't live far away, but she told me.</span> <span id="s598">She first prepared me a little and she say, you know, "They're deporting a lot of Jews from Antwerp", and they would never had been deported so fast if not that woman because in the street where we lived, was two Jews, a man and a family and we, like I told you, it was not a Jewish neighborhood.</span> <span id="s599">But if not that woman, maybe they will stay til after the war or maybe a few months, but it was not a Jewish neighborhood and all the people knew each other and they would never squeal like she did.</span> <span id="s600">She really squealed on them.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: How do you know what happened, how did you get the details?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Somebody after the war told my uncle that they were taken to Auschwitz and that's it.</span> <span id="s603">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: But the story that you tell, for instance, about your brother hiding, how did you...</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: There was that woman on the third floor, was like, how do you say, easy, easy going, and after the war went to her office and suddenly I feel a woman giving me a slap on the face and shouting and __________ and everybody turns around.</span> <span id="s606">She didn't know that I'm alive and that I was hidden and she, when the German came, wanted to take, like I told you, my brother, hid him under her bed, didn't want.</span> <span id="s607">So she knew and she saw when they were taken away, she told me everything then.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: She hit you?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: She got so excited, nervous, she didn't know that I was alive and at the same moment, she remembered that she wanted to save my brother and he didn't want to stay with her, so she was so, I don't know how to say in English, she was very, she was out of herself seeing me in there, it was not that she hit me from anger or what, she was so, she couldn't believe that it's me in the stair.</span> <span id="s610">If I, it would be 20, 30 years you can change, but that was three, four years, so I didn't change so much in the four years, that she didn't recognize me.</span> <span id="s611">And I was with my uncle, my uncle didn't understand, too, and then she excused herself, we went to drink a cup of coffee and she explained.</span> <span id="s612">And she told us that and then at night, the same night, I was very hysterical.</span> <span id="s613">And what my uncle did to calm me down, but I was very, I knew they not coming back, but the way she told us in there, it was reopen the wound they call it.</span> <span id="s614">It was like reopening a wound.</span> <span id="s615">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: But also maybe helping to close it, possibly.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: You were getting some information that you didn't necessarily have.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: It was bad information and you wanted to know, so it's both together, you understand?</span> <span id="s620">It was information, good and not good.</span> <span id="s621">It can be sad, if it's good or not good.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: When were you told that your parents were deported?</span> <span id="s623">How old were you, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: Around 16, 16.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: After about a year or two?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s627">No, when I was, a month or two after they were deported.</span> <span id="s628">When I heard they wouldn't come back, we used to have 13 bedrooms and then every two days my uncle would sell another bedroom because he saw there is nothing, nobody coming back.</span> <span id="s629">And we had saved a few apartments from the family, we had a big house with a lot of bedrooms.</span> <span id="s630">So every night I would come back, there would be another bedroom for me.</span> <span id="s631">See and it was very demoralizing, very.</span> <span id="s632">And then my uncle took his package and went to South America.</span> <span id="s633">And I stayed in Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: Who told you that they had been deported?</span> <span id="s635">I mean, where were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: I was with my uncle and it was...</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: Pretend uncle?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s639">It was my real uncle, after the war and they, I don't remember, it was some friends of my uncle that they heard from somebody else that was in the camp with my parents.</span> <span id="s640">And they saved themself.</span> <span id="s641">There was a few, very few, people that came back from Auschwitz, not many.</span> <span id="s642">Maybe if my brother wouldn't have gone in the line for my father, because they took younger people separate, he would have lived, but he wanted only to be with my father, he was very close to my father.</span> <span id="s643">And he was young, they would have kept him, they would put him to work or, but he didn't want.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: He was like your father who stayed with his father.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s646">Maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: I just want to get this clear, though.</span> <span id="s648">When were you, you weren't told right away that they were deported, who told you that and were you still, you must have still been in hiding?</span> <span id="s649">That they had left your home.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Oh, that was months after, two months after I was hiding.</span> <span id="s651">My pretend aunt.</span> <span id="s652">Yeah.</span> <span id="s653">The man, who later on paid for me, must have called or written to her about that.</span> <span id="s654">And if I didn't get any mail, I never looked at the mail, understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: What did it mean, did you know then that they had been sent to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s657">I knew they were deported, but at that time we didn't know what and when or Auschwitz, no, we didn't know.</span> <span id="s658">Didn't know.</span> <span id="s659">Some of the people who went to Auschwitz, I read a lot about it, didn't know.</span> <span id="s660">They didn't know.</span> <span id="s661">But, like again, I tell you, if they would have, if they would take me, they would take my pretend aunt and uncle because there were a lot of people that happened to them.</span> <span id="s662">And some Jews squealed on other Jews, like that boy who wanted to squeal on me.</span> <span id="s663">He said, "Why should I go, why shouldn't she come?"</span> <span id="s664">I don't know what an interest, I wouldn't do it because why should I take you?</span> <span id="s665">It's enough I, but people are selfish so they want you to be in the same situation...</span></p> <p><span id="s666">End of Tape 1.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: This is an interview with Anny Kast, K-A-S-T, conducted by Katie Davis on August 5 in Silver Spring, Maryland.</span> <span id="s669">This is tape number two, side A. Did, was your friend, Raphael, whose papers you had, you were pretending to be Raphael, was she ever able to come visit you during that time that you were in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: I think she was there once, that's all.</span> <span id="s671">Yeah.</span> <span id="s672">Because they tried not to have people over, they say they brought over their niece, me, and they didn't want.</span> <span id="s673">Because she was also a child, she can say something that she shouldn't or what.</span> <span id="s674">Neighbors and it was not, not recommended.</span> <span id="s675">Probably that's what the aunt said, I will have to ask when I see her, God will, how many times or if she came.</span> <span id="s676">But I don't think more than once, if I remember well, but I'll have to ask her.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: Did you ever feel sometimes, you're a young girl, did they actually call you Raphael?</span> <span id="s678">Did they say, Raphael, when they called you?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: No, when there was no one strange, they wouldn't call me, my name is Anny, they wouldn't call me Anny, they would call me a short cute name, Annime(ph), that's my Anny, but if you would be there or a stranger, they would call me, Jeanine(ph).</span> <span id="s680">She changed my name from Raphael, Jeanine to Raphael.</span> <span id="s681">My name, at home and at school was Jeanine, it was a French name.</span> <span id="s682">And then she changed it when she went to France and she wants only to be called Raphael.</span> <span id="s683">Must be that her real name now is officially Raphael, because when I send her a check I write Raphael, too.</span> <span id="s684">So it must be.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: So was there ever a time when you felt like telling people, I'm Anny Kast, I'm not, was there ever just a rebellious...</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: Anny Rubenstock(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: Anny Rubenstock.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: No, never talked.</span> <span id="s689">No, you see, that man wanted to know, I never told, because she told me, "Never tell anyone.</span> <span id="s690">You are Jeanine __________, and that's it.</span> <span id="s691">Nobody ever has to know that".</span> <span id="s692">She never, she didn't let me and I didn't do it.</span> <span id="s693">And I went to the nuns for the English lesson or what, sometimes they would say, "Jeanine".</span> <span id="s694">I would look, I wouldn't know, you know?</span> <span id="s695">It reminds me they wanted to take me in Israel to the __________ and spy.</span> <span id="s696">After the war when I came to Israel because I know language and I went through so much.</span> <span id="s697">So one of my friends spoke to somebody about spies, so that man came and he asked me, would I be interested to be in a, would I be interested to be in another country and work for Israel?</span> <span id="s698">I say, "Yes".</span> <span id="s699">They went through with all the, now I don't like to go to a doctor, I went to doctors for months, I went to psychiatrists, I went to everything.</span> <span id="s700">But when did I fall through?</span> <span id="s701">When they say if I knew to hold a gun, I say, "No".</span> <span id="s702">I say __________.</span> <span id="s703">But they would go and find out who are my friends, what's my family, they went in the background.</span> <span id="s704">But then when the called the hospital, they called my name, I don't remember what it was, I jumped up, I forgot it's my, because I didn't go to my name.</span> <span id="s705">They didn't want me to know.</span> <span id="s706">It reminds me when they said, "Jeanine" in school, I looked like, it's not me.</span> <span id="s707">And the teacher says, "Jeanine".</span> <span id="s708">And oh yeah, it's me.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: You had a photograph with you.</span> <span id="s710">You did have a photograph __________ didn't you?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: At that time, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: Who gave it to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: I don't remember.</span> <span id="s714">I don't have one picture from my brother, not one.</span> <span id="s715">I don't have it.</span> <span id="s716">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: Do you still have the photograph of your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s719">I have of my parents __________, my mother, she was a beautiful woman, that's my mother.</span> <span id="s720">It's beautiful, no?</span> <span id="s721">Yeah.</span> <span id="s722">They say she dressed beautiful and she was a beautiful woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: This is in the 20's maybe?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: Probably.</span> <span id="s725">But look at the clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: Gorgeous.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: The long clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: Yeah, it's very long.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: Yeah, that's what they wore then.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: Do you think your father made that coat?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: No.</span> <span id="s733">Do you remember, what did you, what was your idea of what was happening to people when they were deported?</span> <span id="s734">Did you have any sense of what was really going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: Nobody had a sense.</span> <span id="s736">At that time, nobody had a sense, nobody knew.</span> <span id="s737">They didn't talk about it so much, they didn't know that, we knew it's not good, it's not a good sign because I was reading.</span> <span id="s738">I will tell you an example, my aunt, __________, her mother was English, Polish and her step-father was English, she was 82 years, very religious man, she was 45.</span> <span id="s739">She married him for his money.</span> <span id="s740">Really.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: __________.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: My aunt's mother, my aunt, real aunt.</span> <span id="s743">My father's brother's wife.</span> <span id="s744">And the man was 82, extremely religious, the woman had only one daughter, my aunt, and wanted to leave when she would die, everything her daughter.</span> <span id="s745">So she married that man to be rich.</span> <span id="s746">And I was sitting by my aunt, make believe, and I had a paper, the Belgium, __________ was a German, went in the house where she lived, cut her tongue and made him a cripple, and they both died.</span> <span id="s747">I read it in the paper, my aunt never would have known.</span> <span id="s748">I gave her the paper years later.</span> <span id="s749">So, __________, got the money and she married that man at age 43, 82.</span> <span id="s750">I remember as a child, he had a white beard, he was a very old man.</span> <span id="s751">You know, when you are 15, 14, 13, and a man of 82, an antique, but it was also a for her, she was 42 years, she married a man of 84.</span> <span id="s752">Just for the money and then he died, she died, she never got the money.</span> <span id="s753">She had to stay with a man so old.</span> <span id="s754">So, and then, you know, a man 82 was old, now it's not the same, but then, especially a religious and the beard and the...</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: Do you remember beginning to hear or think maybe the Germans are going to be defeated?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: We heard about it and they bombarded a lot of the time, the little town where we were near the train and they bombarded, we were all the time hiding out in the cellar.</span> <span id="s757">And during the bombardments, the end of the war, and we say maybe the problems will be solved.</span> <span id="s758">We didn't know, you know, maybe the people will come back.</span> <span id="s759">Maybe, the problems will be solved, let's put it this way.</span> <span id="s760">But, we didn't know what to expect.</span> <span id="s761">No, you didn't know.</span> <span id="s762">You didn't know what's going to be and what's going to happen.</span> <span id="s763">Not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: Tell us about when things changed, when the Germans were defeated.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: When they were defeated, so my make believe aunt went with me to the nuns and told them that I was Jewish, but I liked their behavior and that I studied well and they helped me a lot in life and I went then and I bought a big plant, flowers for the Mother Superior, who was very nice to me.</span> <span id="s766">We were happy.</span> <span id="s767">Because they never knew, she never told them.</span> <span id="s768">It was nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q; What did they say?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: They were stunned at first, they looked and they didn't really believe that they did such a thing because they knew as well as she, if I would have been taken, the same would happen to her.</span> <span id="s771">She, they knew it and she knew it all along.</span> <span id="s772">But she has to hide me but she has to hide that she has me in her house.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: How long did she wait before the Germans were defeated to do that?</span> <span id="s774">Did she feel confident right afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: I think she waited about a week or what, something, to tell them.</span> <span id="s776">And to tell them this whole story and my parents were taken away and we don't know what happened, what will happen with me because we didn't hear yet from my uncle that he was alive and she said to the nuns, "I'll be coming", because she wants to adopt me.</span> <span id="s777">You understand that that's a decision that she and her husband made, but nothing came out.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: Do you remember, was there like a very distinctive memory from liberation, of Allied troops?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A; Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: Tell us about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: It was something very, very pleasant, the whole town and everybody.</span> <span id="s782">Especially, I was extremely, extremely happy and jovial, how do you say, because I knew maybe I will see my parents soon and my brother, my family, so it was my wish.</span> <span id="s783">Everybody had another wish, to see their beloved or what, but I, I just thought about that, that soon, __________ to me I will go to my parents, that they will be better than her.</span> <span id="s784">You understand?</span> <span id="s785">But it took time.</span> <span id="s786">Then after a few weeks, my uncle came and, well, he came from the nuns and he had taken his house back.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: Who had been in the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: Nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: They had taken out a lot, the German furniture, good things, antiquities, but otherwise they left the house and it was not __________, but it was a terrible feeling to go in the house because I remember like now, there was a long hall and there was a little shoe of the little girl they took away, a year and a half, it was on the floor, that she lost.</span> <span id="s791">__________ So, a million and a half children they killed, what do you want.</span> <span id="s792">A million and a half.</span> <span id="s793">That's a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q; So you went in the house with him and there were some of these items from, it was like going into a time capsule?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: It was terrible.</span> <span id="s796">An example, the pot was on the gas for a year and a half.</span> <span id="s797">Because it was Friday night and they made food, it stays overnight, cooking __________, you know what it is because they wouldn't cook on Saturday.</span> <span id="s798">And that pot was on the, you know, it's like you leave now all dead and I come back and see four empty glasses while nobody lived here.</span> <span id="s799">Who were the four people?</span> <span id="s800">Who drank from that.</span> <span id="s801">So it's a very, very unpleasant feeling.</span> <span id="s802">So then, when I met people, they didn't go through nothing, they stayed with their husband and children and they saved themself, they're getting money from Germany and how much you want.</span> <span id="s803">So it hurt me.</span> <span id="s804">Because I say, even if I wouldn't need the money I'll give it to Raphael, but it should come to me more than to you that you had your family, you stayed all over the war with your family.</span> <span id="s805">That's a big plus.</span> <span id="s806">Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: Do you, what was it like when you first saw your uncle?</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: It was a good feeling, good feeling.</span> <span id="s809">But, I still, at that time, I suffered a lot from my eyes, I cried a lot, I cried day and night.</span> <span id="s810">And I came to my uncle and I say, "I want to see you, but I want to see my parents".</span> <span id="s811">The he took me to see my grandmother who spent all the war in the hospital, I told you and came out.</span> <span id="s812">She was the first funeral, Jewish funeral in Antwerp when she died.</span> <span id="s813">But before she died and I used to come to her, she was a little mixed up, but still she would say, "Why doesn't your father come to see his mother, why do you come to see me?"</span> <span id="s814">Understand?</span> <span id="s815">She didn't grasp the situation.</span> <span id="s816">I didn't know then.</span> <span id="s817">But she was the first funeral, my uncle was very upset.</span> <span id="s818">So, he said, "If you don't stop crying, I'll put you in with your grandmother because you have to stop crying".</span> <span id="s819">But some people can cry when they're told enough.</span> <span id="s820">It's a thing that's inside.</span> <span id="s821">Or you cry or you don't cry, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: It sounds like you did cry.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: Oh, a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: You cried.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: Cried a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: Cried yourself out.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s828">Now, when my husband died, I cried a little bit, I can't cry and that's bad.</span> <span id="s829">I envy these people who crying, crying, crying, for no reason.</span> <span id="s830">And when you __________, you cry, it's good.</span> <span id="s831">It's very healthy they told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: So what did your uncle say?</span> <span id="s833">I mean, obviously, what did you uncle say about your parents?</span> <span id="s834">And then what might happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: He didn't know at the time.</span> <span id="s836">He didn't know.</span> <span id="s837">He only said, "Let's hope they come back".</span> <span id="s838">At that time, there was still a lot of hope.</span> <span id="s839">You understand?</span> <span id="s840">Everybody hoped it will go okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: So you didn't go, did you ever go to your family apartment?</span> <span id="s842">You were in your uncle's house, but did you ever go to the apartment where you lived with your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: I went to these people who paid for me and I was very nice to them.</span> <span id="s844">What a gift.</span> <span id="s845">And my uncle paid them back for all these years that they paid, you know, they were very nice.</span> <span id="s846">I went to say hello to them.</span> <span id="s847">But it was a half a year after I stayed with my uncle.</span> <span id="s848">And all my friends started to go out, have a good time and I never had a good time.</span> <span id="s849">Because I worked.</span> <span id="s850">My uncle opened a store in Belgium and I used to sell the American, the English, [phone ringing, pause in tape].</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: So it was just your uncle and you?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s853">No, it was, after that, came a nephew from his wife, from Treblinka.</span> <span id="s854">And he was Polish and didn't know Belgium, but he heard somebody is __________ and he stayed with us.</span> <span id="s855">And my uncle when to South America, he wanted everything, everything.</span> <span id="s856">He came back from Treblinka where he saved himself.</span> <span id="s857">And that's it.</span> <span id="s858">He came like from nowhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: Did he talk about what it was like in Treblinka?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: I don't remember because he used to talk very badly Jewish, a lot of lot of Polish and I didn't know a word of Polish.</span> <span id="s861">But he spoke very little.</span> <span id="s862">When he came, he weigh maybe, he was maybe like that.</span> <span id="s863">So later he gained weight and he became more person.</span> <span id="s864">But when he came he was very depressed and my uncle helped him a lot.</span> <span id="s865">But otherwise, it was the two of us, that's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: How, tell us again how you finally really heard about your parents.</span> <span id="s867">When that was and how you heard what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: I tell you, I heard that they were taken away a few weeks after I was hidden.</span> <span id="s869">And then only after the war, a month or two, maybe later, they started to __________ us that people were killed and gassed and so on.</span> <span id="s870">Before that, people didn't know, we didn't know what happened.</span> <span id="s871">Then we were, started to understand and to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: What were your thoughts when you first heard this story?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: My thought was that it happened, but not maybe to them.</span> <span id="s874">At that point, and __________ very selfish, but I thought, no, it didn't happen to them.</span> <span id="s875">It happened, but not to them.</span> <span id="s876">See, you don't realize that it can happen to your own, too.</span> <span id="s877">You think it's only to, that's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: And who was it who told you, who was there in Auschwitz with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: A friend of my uncle came back who saved himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: Tell us who he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: I didn't know the man, it's a man who knew my uncle and who came back and who said that he had been with my parents and my brother, and he knows they gone.</span> <span id="s882">He knows.</span> <span id="s883">How the man saved himself or what, I don't remember, I can't tell you.</span> <span id="s884">But he saved himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: And did he tell the story of how...</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: My uncle never told me.</span> <span id="s887">Maybe he didn't want to hurt me or maybe he didn't want me to know or anyway, in short, he never told me specifically what, when and how.</span> <span id="s888">He didn't.</span> <span id="s889">I think he didn't want it.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: You think he knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: I think he knew.</span> <span id="s892">More than he told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: Did you want to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: Yeah, I asked a few times and I insisted a few times, and he would change the subject and tell me, "One day soon I'll tell you more if I know.</span> <span id="s895">If I meet a man".</span> <span id="s896">But I didn't ask, I know my uncle, he asked, but he didn't want to, didn't want me to ask, you understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: This was your father's brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: Brother, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: Did he know how his wife and children __________.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s901">Also, somebody told him and how they, it was his father, his wife, his two children and his parents-in-law.</span> <span id="s902">They had another daughter who was pregnant seven months who went to France, they went to the France that was not occupied and they paid a fortune and they was taken there with somebody, but they were shot while crossing the border.</span> <span id="s903">With the money they paid and everything and she pregnant, walking hours at night, they were shot.</span> <span id="s904">And she was young surely, 26, 25, I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: How did you feel towards, did you ever see anybody who had collaborated with the Nazis?</span> <span id="s906">For instance, the family that squealed, as you say, squealed on your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: No.</span> <span id="s908">We didn't...</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: __________</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: I never saw them, I never saw them.</span> <span id="s911">And then when I came after the war, that woman and that man that were with the American who saved himself and worked underground, they say they had moved shortly after my parents were taken away.</span> <span id="s912">Maybe they were afraid, I don't know, she moved.</span> <span id="s913">She was there living with two or three daughters, I don't remember, but she was, I'm going to smoke a cigarette.</span> <span id="s914">Do you mind?</span> <span id="s915">Five minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: Did you, were you ever able to go back into your house, the house you grew up in with your parents, and get anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s918">They had some things, but people they never gave back.</span> <span id="s919">And the strangers that I came to wouldn't let me in.</span> <span id="s920">No.</span> <span id="s921">And meet my sister-in-law, Patty.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: Hi.</span> <span id="s923">So you went to the house where you grew up and who was living there?</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: Strangers, people.</span> <span id="s925">That I never met, they didn't know me and wouldn't let me in.</span> <span id="s926">The owner of the house, I stayed a while with him, he say he can't ask them, if they don't want.</span> <span id="s927">So I went.</span> <span id="s928">But I went to this neighbor, who wanted to save my brother, and she accepted me really, the one who wanted to slap my face.</span> <span id="s929">She was very nice.</span> <span id="s930">She didn't slap my face because she was mean or what, it was a kind of excitement and surprise to see me.</span> <span id="s931">You know?</span> <span id="s932">If you think that person is no more and suddenly you find out the person is there, it's a very big, it was something she'll never forget as long as she lives.</span> <span id="s933">She was an old woman then, she must be dead, but she was very, and then it's her nature, she was very excitable in general, I remember as a child, so when she saw me and that uncle of mine, she, she got so hysterical, I'll never forget as long as I live how hysterical.</span> <span id="s934">From happiness.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: Tell us what it was like to see your best friend, Raphael __________, who you, whose identity you assumed.</span> <span id="s936">What was it like to see her for the first time?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: It was, it's a pity you don't know French, otherwise I would send you copies, she wrote me like, now that my husband died, and she writes to me very often.</span> <span id="s938">The way she writes, she writes very well.</span> <span id="s939">She has nobody, no sister, no brother, no nothing.</span> <span id="s940">And she's very, very, very warm and close to me.</span> <span id="s941">She, for days and days, she wouldn't leave me.</span> <span id="s942">She'd come to my uncle every day in the morning and stay til at night because she was so happy to see me and be with me and that.</span> <span id="s943">And she loved Israel.</span> <span id="s944">We went to the Hilton in Jerusalem and my husband wanted to stay overnight.</span> <span id="s945">She wants to go to a kibbutz.</span> <span id="s946">She doesn't want to stay.</span> <span id="s947">Very simple, but very nice, very nice.</span> <span id="s948">And she happened to be a very intelligent girl that her life changed now, but she was over-excited so in 1960 my aunt __________ went to Nice in France and she took care of her house, because with a lake and a swimming pool and everything in Nice.</span> <span id="s949">And I lived in Israel and she wanted me to come.</span> <span id="s950">She told the man, "In case you want me to take care of the house, there is condition that I have to bring her over, I want to see her for six weeks".</span> <span id="s951">So I went there, everybody in Israel thought, she must be rich, she goes to Nice for vacation for six weeks.</span> <span id="s952">It was a luxury then.</span> <span id="s953">Now, everybody travels, but then it was a luxury.</span> <span id="s954">And she invited Raphael, too, for six weeks.</span> <span id="s955">But she wouldn't take a cent from me, you know, she loves me.</span> <span id="s956">But she would take from my niece.</span> <span id="s957">So I remember, I paid for the niece.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: What did you talk about when she, when you first saw her after being in hiding and she was spending so much time __________.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: I was telling her, I was telling her what I went through and that her aunt was very nice to me.</span> <span id="s960">She was very, very, very stingy, very demanding I should learn and study and do and kept me busy all the time.</span> <span id="s961">And she said, "I know, that's the reason I never wanted to live with her".</span> <span id="s962">But, thank God, she say, she did something for you.</span> <span id="s963">And she was happy and she's happy til now when I write her a letter.</span> <span id="s964">And when I was sick and my husband died, she would call me from France and Israel twice a week and she really can't afford it.</span> <span id="s965">So, and she came to Israel, she took out a hundred dollar bill and she said to my husband, "Can you change it in Israeli money?"</span> <span id="s966">He said, "What do you need money for?</span> <span id="s967">Anny pays for you".</span> <span id="s968">"No, no, no.</span> <span id="s969">I want to get her a gift".</span> <span id="s970">He says, "She doesn't need it".</span> <span id="s971">So we gave her cash when she left, a few hundred dollars, she wouldn't take, she says she wants a check.</span> <span id="s972">She's so primitive, a check she won't lose, the money she'll lose, maybe you want to buy something.</span> <span id="s973">She's very, but she's not demanding, oh, she's so nice.</span> <span id="s974">She's very artistic.</span> <span id="s975">She wrote to Belgium to a friend of hers who paints, to paint me a scarf, hand paint on silk.</span> <span id="s976">She would send it from Belgium to France, from France she would send it to me.</span> <span id="s977">Very artistic.</span> <span id="s978">And I say, "What do you want?"</span> <span id="s979">She wants a Star of David.</span> <span id="s980">So I send her with somebody, a Star of David with a gold chain.</span> <span id="s981">So when she came to Israel, she say, "Can I have a silver David Star?"</span> <span id="s982">"Why?"</span> <span id="s983">"One for the weekend and one for the week".</span> <span id="s984">So, but she is a very good, very warm person, very warm person.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: Did you stay in touch with your pretend aunt and uncle?</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: I told you.</span> <span id="s987">After the war, she left him for the Englishman.</span> <span id="s988">And he was a little angry thinking that I had something to do.</span> <span id="s989">When my uncle called him and wrote to him a few times because he wanted him to be on good, on good terms with me, but it was hard to make him believe that I didn't know.</span> <span id="s990">He told him, she was innocent, she was very naive and so on.</span> <span id="s991">And he wouldn't accept it, wouldn't accept it because he was a very, very cultivated, serious man, while that Englishman was very primitive.</span> <span id="s992">And that's the end.</span> <span id="s993">And it's a pity he didn't believe my uncle or me that I had nothing to do with that.</span> <span id="s994">And that's it.</span> <span id="s995">And she used to write to me after the war and she used to be in touch with me, wanting to know what I do and so on, but that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">[end of side 1 of tape 2]</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: What was life like, you're in Antwerp now, right?</span> <span id="s998">Was it hard to get food after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: No, not so bad.</span> <span id="s1000">Not so bad.</span> <span id="s1001">It was hard after my uncle left, I was left alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: Tell us about that, why...</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: My uncle left to South America and...</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: When did he leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: In 1947, six, after the war.</span> <span id="s1006">Went to his brother's.</span> <span id="s1007">And he married, children.</span> <span id="s1008">And I say I want to stay in Belgium because I want to go first to Israel to meet my family I don't know and then come to South America.</span> <span id="s1009">And meantime, I stayed in Belgium, 18, 19, wanted to say in Belgium.</span> <span id="s1010">But, my dream was all these years, to go to Switzerland to study international translation, instantanic(ph).</span> <span id="s1011">I couldn't afford and I was too proud to ask my uncle.</span> <span id="s1012">And I'm sorry to now because they say if I would have asked, they would have helped and I would have a good thing to go on in the world.</span> <span id="s1013">I could use it anywhere I want.</span> <span id="s1014">But I didn't do it.</span> <span id="s1015">So, in Belgium, I really didn't have a job for work and there was that store where they sold blankets and suits from the military, the American, it was very heavy beds, hard job.</span> <span id="s1016">I went in and I said the man I want to work.</span> <span id="s1017">He say, "You so little, what will you do here".</span> <span id="s1018">But it happened to be the father of my friend, I told you before that said, "Come with me, we'll put lipstick, we'll go out".</span> <span id="s1019">And he had remarried and __________ child, but he knew I was his daughter's friend, so he gave me the job.</span> <span id="s1020">And he kept me, I didn't work too hard, just make believe I work to give me salary because I was so good with his daughter that died.</span> <span id="s1021">She was a beauty, she was a beauty.</span> <span id="s1022">Her name was Betty, I remember.</span> <span id="s1023">Beautiful girl.</span> <span id="s1024">And then I went to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: You say you went, but how did you get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: Oh, I didn't get a ticket because my uncle from South America paid and went to Israel to visit my uncle, I had an uncle, brother of my mother and two sisters.</span> <span id="s1027">Went to visit them and then I stayed there, and that's a mistake I did in my life.</span> <span id="s1028">Because I didn't want to stay with them and I started, like I worked for nine years in a French library, only French.</span> <span id="s1029">So, my uncle wanted me to go and study Hebrew, but I saw they don't have money and they need my help, so I went and I worked, 10 years.</span> <span id="s1030">Then we opened another store, in a library, in a lending library in Haifa, and I became the manager, was the only one, only French.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: What kind of store?</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: French books, study, studying books, novels, magazines, only French.</span> <span id="s1033">And then I became the manager.</span> <span id="s1034">And I used to go to South America and come back and go to South America and come back.</span> <span id="s1035">And then I had a bad marriage of three years, four years.</span> <span id="s1036">And no children or what.</span> <span id="s1037">And then my family wanted me to stay in Uruguay.</span> <span id="s1038">But I said a condition is if I can work and keep up and just come for the weekend to you.</span> <span id="s1039">No, they want me to stay with them and not work.</span> <span id="s1040">So I took my package, I went back to Israel.</span> <span id="s1041">And I found out that working in the lending library and that was too many hours from eight in the morning to seven at night.</span> <span id="s1042">So I wanted to get shift work.</span> <span id="s1043">So I worked in Israel for five years and I enjoyed it very much, in the censor, you know what censor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: A censor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: A censor, in international calls, so I used to work with five, six countries at once, they were so happy with me.</span> <span id="s1046">And I loved the job.</span> <span id="s1047">And that was another job I work at from two to nine, from three to ten, not all day long.</span> <span id="s1048">You know.</span> <span id="s1049">And that's it.</span> <span id="s1050">And then I met my husband here in Israel.</span> <span id="s1051">And he was a professor in Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: Isaac.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: Kast.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: Kast.</span> <span id="s1056">And he want, he didn't want, they wanted him to work in the Library of Congress, he didn't want, he finished English and French, Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1057">He wanted on to teach Hebrew, so he went to a private here in Washington, Yashiva(ph) Hebrew Academy, if you've heard.</span> <span id="s1058">And he worked there.</span> <span id="s1059">And when I came here to live, lived 27 years here, so when I came to live here, he didn't want me to work.</span> <span id="s1060">But I didn't want to stay home 24 hours with no children, so I started to work, manager of a thrift store Haddasah(ph).</span> <span id="s1061">And I used to send $100,000 a year for Haddasah Jerusalem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: Haddasah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: Haddasah Hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: Oh, okay, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: But I worked as a volunteer and we made money, $100,000 a year, after all the expense.</span> <span id="s1066">And I worked there a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: Where was this thrift shop?</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: In Silver Spring, it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: It's still there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: Still there.</span> <span id="s1071">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: Let me go back to, how did your mother's family get to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: They went as young girls, shortly after my mother went to Belgium with my father.</span> <span id="s1074">They got married, had family.</span> <span id="s1075">My uncle was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: They were in Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: In Palestine.</span> <span id="s1078">My uncle was the only son and there were five daughters.</span> <span id="s1079">And then at the end, before he died, that was __________ sad, had a big job in the government.</span> <span id="s1080">And he had his family and they had a family and that's where they lived.</span> <span id="s1081">They used to write to my mother and my father, please come here, we'll send you the paper.</span> <span id="s1082">So my uncle at that time worked on a train, I remember, he was the conductor.</span> <span id="s1083">So my mother told me, "When you go to Israel, you'll go on the train, your uncle will be the conductor".</span> <span id="s1084">And we not ready for such a life.</span> <span id="s1085">They begged them to come.</span> <span id="s1086">If they would have come, they would have been saved, but they didn't want.</span> <span id="s1087">They had pity that they had such a hard life because then in Palestine you know it was all primitive, it was very hard.</span> <span id="s1088">Not like now, it's luxury.</span> <span id="s1089">So, that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Q: What, I mean what were your feelings when you went to Israel?</span> <span id="s1091">Did you, did you go after it had been declared a state?</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">A: Yeah, I went after it was a state.</span> <span id="s1095">I liked it very much, I liked my family.</span> <span id="s1096">But I found it a hard life to live, it was hard.</span> <span id="s1097">It was very, very primitive at that time.</span> <span id="s1098">But, I felt good with my family and in the country.</span> <span id="s1099">I just did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: What did you speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: I couldn't talk to them.</span> <span id="s1102">My cousin didn't know any Yiddish, he knew Hebrew, and I didn't know it.</span> <span id="s1103">Didn't know any English.</span> <span id="s1104">So, we spoke broken Yiddish, my uncle and me.</span> <span id="s1105">But then, with the time, I learned the language from the street like they say.</span> <span id="s1106">And then I went to a boarding school for six months and I learned Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1107">And my Spanish, French is better than my Hebrew, but it's okay.</span> <span id="s1108">I know how to talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: Did they, did they remind you of your mother?</span> <span id="s1110">Did they seem like her, their mannerisms?</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: Yeah, yeah, no, no, they looked a little like my mother, they would always ask me questions and so on.</span> <span id="s1112">But, they were not, they had another kind of life than we had in Belgium.</span> <span id="s1113">And then I went to, nearly every year and a half or six months, to South America to my family.</span> <span id="s1114">Because they wanted me to be there.</span> <span id="s1115">And __________ the uncle who was with me, lives in Israel, and my three other uncles live in South America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: Your uncle...</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: The, yeah, he lives in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: He's still alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1120">He's old, he's losing his strength.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: What is his name again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: Israel(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Q: He must be a fascinating man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1125">He's very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Q: This was your mother's brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">A: No, my father's brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: Your father's brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1131">I just had a question, I have so many questions.</span> <span id="s1132">Where do you feel home is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: I'll tell you the truth, I feel good here with the children of my sister-in-law, but I feel better in Israel because I have a lot of friends now and I have my family, mostly, feel better, just that life is a little harder.</span> <span id="s1134">Even now, with all the comfort that you have, you have a lot of comfort like before, used to work without air condition and it was hotter than here.</span> <span id="s1135">But now, everything is beautiful now and it's good.</span> <span id="s1136">And people say, "You're not afraid?"</span> <span id="s1137">And I'll tell you on that answer, you never know where to be afraid because I had a very good friend, by the way, who lived in Israel and her son finished college here.</span> <span id="s1138">And he came back to Israel and they didn't want him to go to the army because maybe he'll be killed or what, God forbid.</span> <span id="s1139">So they moved to New York and in a few, many years ago, there was something near the, near the, some people went in in the lunch room and they killed some people.</span> <span id="s1140">And if you will remember a few years ago, and he was one of them.</span> <span id="s1141">His wife was pregnant eight months.</span> <span id="s1142">So he was killed.</span> <span id="s1143">Maybe he would have made the army and not be killed.</span> <span id="s1144">So you cannot be afraid because it won't help you.</span> <span id="s1145">And you can't live in a country, every minute you be afraid or you'll get crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: Were you afraid a lot when you were in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">A: I was all the time tense, as young as I was.</span> <span id="s1148">And maybe for that I'm still a little nervous, but I don't show it.</span> <span id="s1149">Because now my sister-in-law is not so well, but why should I shout or be angry on her or what, I'm not that type.</span> <span id="s1150">I was not brought up like that.</span> <span id="s1151">But inside maybe I'm nervous because I went through a lot and it hurt me a lot when I didn't get more, or how much did I get?</span> <span id="s1152">Four or five thousand dollars, that's all from the German.</span> <span id="s1153">While all these friends that I know, are getting monthly good incomes.</span> <span id="s1154">One of my friends went and she said that she's not, her mind is not good.</span> <span id="s1155">She's a year younger than I.</span> <span id="s1156">So they made her a, an exam.</span> <span id="s1157">She said stupid things, she's very smart.</span> <span id="s1158">And now she gets eight or nine hundred dollars a month on Germany because she's incapable.</span> <span id="s1159">That's what they say.</span> <span id="s1160">She's much more capable than I will ever be, but she succeeded by lying and I'm not the type who will lie.</span> <span id="s1161">I'm not going to lie for money.</span> <span id="s1162">I'm not going to lie for money.</span> <span id="s1163">But I went through, like you heard, a lot.</span> <span id="s1164">And people who went much less through, that I know, and they are alone, they say, you should get more than I, or you should get, but, you should get.</span> <span id="s1165">You understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q: Tell us, when you applied for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A; I applied and I got, oh, three thousand or four thousand dollar.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: __________.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: In 1952, 53, and then they gave me the three thousand dollars, I shouldn't have taken it, but nothing to do.</span> <span id="s1170">And then they refuse and they, now I know the reason.</span> <span id="s1171">My uncle went through a lot, he lost a wife and two children, but I had a lawyer in Belgium, he was no good.</span> <span id="s1172">That's the mistake.</span> <span id="s1173">If you would go, it was then, you know, agencies took care of all that, and they would help you and do it.</span> <span id="s1174">I didn't go, I went to a lawyer who took a lot of money in advance, who didn't go anything.</span> <span id="s1175">Maybe he got six thousand, he gave me three thousand or four thousand.</span> <span id="s1176">But all these friends of mine, I don't know if they got a sum, but they got, they get every month now.</span> <span id="s1177">And they really don't believe, I wouldn't lie, if I would get, I would say, why, why the lying?</span> <span id="s1178">Some people like to lie, I don't like to lie.</span> <span id="s1179">If I don't get, I don't get.</span> <span id="s1180">I'm not going to say I don't get when I get.</span> <span id="s1181">Or I get when I don't get.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: Could you appeal it, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: I think it's too late.</span> <span id="s1184">I think it's too late.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q: Have you ever been to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">A: I've never gone.</span> <span id="s1187">You?</span> <span id="s1188">No, I would never go.</span> <span id="s1189">No interest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: What about going to a place like Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: I'll tell you the true, I don't, I went through now a lot, too, last year with my husband being very sick and all the family wanted me to put him away __________ and I didn't, I took care.</span> <span id="s1192">So maybe another year or what, you know, will be more relaxed, maybe I'll do it.</span> <span id="s1193">Because my cousin wanted very bad to go, the one from Israel, to the place where I was born and where our grandmother was living, but I wasn't ready to go with her because he was sick.</span> <span id="s1194">Now maybe, I'll take a rest a year, if I'm capable to concentrate and relax, maybe I would do it.</span> <span id="s1195">But not now for the moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: When did your husband die?</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: January, so it's still fresh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: It's still very fresh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: __________.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1202">Still fresh, so, I was all by myself and it's not easy.</span> <span id="s1203">So, that's what it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: How old was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: Was not young, was 78, but _________, very intelligent man, but very sick.</span> <span id="s1206">So, he just suffered the last two months, few months.</span> <span id="s1207">So nothing could be done, so it's a pity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: Did you, did you purposely not have children or was that a decision you made together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: No.</span> <span id="s1210">It didn't come out, I'll tell you why I think.</span> <span id="s1211">Because when we married, his mother became old, she stayed with her daughters, we used to go there all the time and all the time and years went by and you know, sometimes years go so fast that you don't know.</span> <span id="s1212">You turn around and you're middle aged, you're old, no?</span> <span id="s1213">It's like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: So you've always been with people who are always very, taking care of their families?</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q: __________ your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">A: Yeah, and then also, then also I used to be very friendly with somebody, she had four children and I was there and I took care most of the time of the children and now I don't know if they'll recognize me.</span> <span id="s1218">That's it.</span> <span id="s1219">Some stay friends with you, but some, ignore you, let's put it this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: What was it like when you got, to go back a little bit now, to Israel, this idea that you had to hide being Jewish and you could, for so long, and they got, created terrible danger for people you loved, to be in a country where you could be completely open and proud of being Jewish.</span> <span id="s1221">What was that like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">A: When?</span> <span id="s1223">When I came to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: When you first went to Israel and you could, you could be really relaxed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">A: Yeah, I enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s1226">I enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s1227">But I had a hard time because used to live in the suburbs and go, and go to Tel Aviv and stay from eight in the morning in that heat til seven at night.</span> <span id="s1228">Not be able to refresh or what.</span> <span id="s1229">And from one to four, the stores would be closed, so I just walked around, I didn't have what to do.</span> <span id="s1230">So it was very hard, you understand?</span> <span id="s1231">So I couldn't enjoy life enough because I had a hard time.</span> <span id="s1232">And I wasn't so close to my family there because I didn't know them so long as my other family that I grew up with them.</span> <span id="s1233">So it was very hard.</span> <span id="s1234">But I came over that, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: Tell us a little bit about life in Uruguay, which is where your uncle lived.</span> <span id="s1236">Who was there and what was __________.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: He had two brothers, he had two brothers and they had families.</span> <span id="s1238">And then he got married, he had his own family.</span> <span id="s1239">And when the children became bigger, he was afraid they'll marry, intermarriage, so he moved everything to Israel.</span> <span id="s1240">They should get married with Jewish girls, that's what they did.</span> <span id="s1241">Because, you know, so much intermarriage, I don't have to tell you, no?</span> <span id="s1242">So, and he's very religious, so, very religious.</span> <span id="s1243">So.</span> <span id="s1244">Lived a Jewish life and always very nice.</span> <span id="s1245">The women have it very easy, a maid costs you thirty or forty dollars a year, a month, so you can afford two maids.</span> <span id="s1246">And life is easy, but it's still not like in Israel, it's still, it's still different.</span> <span id="s1247">Like here, it's very nice, but here without a car, without, it's very hard, I don't have to tell you.</span> <span id="s1248">Where do you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">Q: Downtown Washington D.C.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A: So it's not easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: When were you ever able to say to yourself finally, my brother and my mother and father aren't coming back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: That was a few good months after the war.</span> <span id="s1253">A few good months after the war.</span> <span id="s1254">When I saw the reality that the people who came, came already, and other ones won't come.</span> <span id="s1255">And they began to talk and to show and then we saw that you have to accept the truth.</span> <span id="s1256">And the reality.</span> <span id="s1257">It was not easy in the beginning because you used to see, to go, then they didn't go like now to Auschwitz to look and that.</span> <span id="s1258">People didn't go like now to go, but we all the time asked, asked, we heard that somebody came back and we went and maybe he was seeing them and that, that must be the way my uncle found that man who saw my parents.</span> <span id="s1259">That he found out that that man was in Auschwitz and saved himself and maybe it was the same time, and he learned that it was the same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: What did these people look like to you, I mean they were presumably coming back very thin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: Very thin, very nervous, very depressed.</span> <span id="s1262">But, they began to live and they, that's it.</span> <span id="s1263">But in the beginning they were very skinny and very down, mentally and physically, both.</span> <span id="s1264">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: I know that at that time they had newsreels of the camps and some photographs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: Do you remember ever seeing that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: No.</span> <span id="s1269">I never saw that __________.</span> <span id="s1270">They were all so like the museum, they have a place in Brussels now, I would like to go and see that, if God willed, if I had the occasion, they have a very, very big place, so much taller than me, and it's written all the Jews from Antwerp and Brussels who killed where, at Auschwitz or Bergen-Belsen or, where they were killed.</span> <span id="s1271">What date exactly and what time, what, and I wanted very badly to go.</span> <span id="s1272">Somebody told me who saw it and my parents were in that list.</span> <span id="s1273">Somebody told me they didn't see the list.</span> <span id="s1274">So I wanted to go by myself once.</span> <span id="s1275">I want to see, one day I'll go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: Do you remember when you first saw photographs of Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: It wears very much on me, very, made me very depressed.</span> <span id="s1278">I started to take an anti-depressant and it didn't help me because I was depressed mentally very much.</span> <span id="s1279">And then I see it won't help you, being depressed.</span> <span id="s1280">Talked to myself.</span> <span id="s1281">But it didn't help, it didn't help the pills, not talking, it was depressing because some people can see movies and so on and read, they don't mind.</span> <span id="s1282">But it's, it's a character.</span> <span id="s1283">Because I say I would never over live it, and some people say I don't know how I over lived it and they came out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: When was it?</span> <span id="s1285">When was it that you first saw pictures?</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: All the pictures I saw '47 and before, and '46, '47.</span> <span id="s1287">So, that's what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: Did you ever, with your uncle, do any sort of service of sit shiva?</span> <span id="s1289">I mean...</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A: No, I keep a date that the rabbi gave me, a rabbi in Israel gave me a date and I keep that day, give a, I give a donation to Schul(ph) that day and we say kaddish(ph) and that's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: So you did mark a day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: And if you went to that museum, you might find out an actual day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">A: That's it, then I might find exactly the day, maybe or approximative.</span> <span id="s1295">And I would like to go there, but no chance for the last few years because of my husband's illness, but one day I'll go.</span> <span id="s1296">It doesn't do me too good, in '65 I was in Belgium and I went through, went from the house where we lived to where the school was and that.</span> <span id="s1297">The street didn't change, only the stores and the people change.</span> <span id="s1298">And it did me very bad.</span> <span id="s1299">Stayed three days and I run away.</span> <span id="s1300">Three days or two days, it was too much.</span> <span id="s1301">And I think it was too much because I was alone.</span> <span id="s1302">I was not with a friend or, I wouldn't do that by myself any more.</span> <span id="s1303">I would only go with somebody or that I care for or, just somebody, not to go by myself, I wouldn't do it.</span> <span id="s1304">Also you know, the nights to stay there in a hotel alone and remember the streets and that.</span> <span id="s1305">No, no.</span> <span id="s1306">I wouldn't go back by myself, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: You uncle's still alive, I mean, do you ever think about pressing him for details?</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">A: He had a stroke three years ago and his mind is good and that, I don't think he feels like talking about it.</span> <span id="s1309">I don't think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">Q: Do you think he'd ever do an oral history interview?</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">A: Doubt it, I doubt it.</span> <span id="s1312">He's saw my tape when I showed it in Israel and it made him very, don't know, he didn't feel depressed really, feel dead because in my tape I say my uncle went to Uruguay and left me alone.</span> <span id="s1313">So it was not a good feeling for people who heard and it was said in the room.</span> <span id="s1314">You understand?</span> <span id="s1315">And I couldn't, I couldn't change the tape, the tape was there, the truth was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: Did you feel like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: That he left you alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: Yeah, I felt lost a little because I was young and all my friends had parents and I was no parents, nobody, like left alone.</span> <span id="s1320">So it hit me a little, you know.</span> <span id="s1321">Not much, but a little.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Q: How long did you stay alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">A: In Belgium, maybe eight, nine, ten months.</span> <span id="s1324">It was too long.</span> <span id="s1325">It's the way you feel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">End of Tape 2.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">Q: This is an interview with Anny Kast, K-A-S-T.</span> <span id="s1329">Conducted by Katie Davis on August 5 in Silver Spring, Maryland.</span> <span id="s1330">This is tape number three, side A. I'm curious about how you think your experience hiding and your losses, 28 people, how that affected your approach to life?</span> <span id="s1331">Maybe your philosophy or your interactions with people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">A: The feeling, to tell you the true, I had is that people are alone, like me now, should take care of themself, but I'm the person that I like to give and not wait to receive.</span> <span id="s1333">I like to give from myself, to be good to people, to help people.</span> <span id="s1334">If it's mentally or physically or materially, I like to give, I'm not demanding and I'm not the snob that says I have or don't have.</span> <span id="s1335">I'm not the type to complain.</span> <span id="s1336">I had many years that I didn't have and I never complained.</span> <span id="s1337">And people never knew if I have or not because I made an impression I have a lot and I liked it because I don't want pity.</span> <span id="s1338">I had enough pity during my first years, I don't want pity.</span> <span id="s1339">That means even if I didn't have, whenever somebody came, I had cake and coffee and fruit and everything.</span> <span id="s1340">The people came shouldn't know the way I feel.</span> <span id="s1341">I didn't want them to know.</span> <span id="s1342">And I'm now like that, too.</span> <span id="s1343">Even people in Israel, especially, are very curious.</span> <span id="s1344">They ask you such private questions that I can't accept.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">Q: About?</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">A: I don't want to say mind your own business, that's rude, but people there ask you, what's your income, where do you live, what do you have?</span> <span id="s1347">I never would think to ask somebody, even somebody I'm very close, it's not my business.</span> <span id="s1348">And I never, and I had no father, no mother, nothing for many years, I would never be jealous, and that's a character.</span> <span id="s1349">Or envious, that's the same as jealousy, that you have that dress that cost five hundred dollars or three hundred dollars and I can't afford it, or what.</span> <span id="s1350">Because if I'll be jealous, it won't help me get that dress because I can't afford it if I don't have that three, five hundred dollars.</span> <span id="s1351">And it won't make me happier if I'll have that dress.</span> <span id="s1352">And if I didn't pay for the dress, it would make me worse because why should I go with a dress that I owe the money and I don't know from where I will take the money.</span> <span id="s1353">And I never had an envy or jealous character.</span> <span id="s1354">They always ask me, are you not jealous, this cousin has this, has this, has this.</span> <span id="s1355">Sometimes I say, poor me, I have no children and it's a pity.</span> <span id="s1356">But then I see the problems my friend have with their children, I say I'm very happy I don't have, what do I need this problems for, I have enough of my own.</span> <span id="s1357">So, it won't help to be jealous.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">Q: Were you ever envious, though, that other people had their whole families and maybe they didn't know what they have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">A: No, but I would be angry and am, not envious exactly, of children my age when I was left alone, they don't appreciate their parents.</span> <span id="s1360">That, yes.</span> <span id="s1361">Because I say, they don't know what they have, they should appreciate what they have, they have parents, they have grandparents, they have aunts and uncles and cousins and they, such a big family, they don't know what they have.</span> <span id="s1362">Some know, but not all.</span> <span id="s1363">Not all the people know.</span> <span id="s1364">But it won't help me.</span> <span id="s1365">But I never was, thank God, envious or jealous, never, never.</span> <span id="s1366">I hope I will never be.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">Q: How do you explain that you didn't become a really, really bitter person who just saw darkness everywhere, you know, that you lost so much and other people who lost what you lost, their entire family...</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">A: They're more bitter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">Q: And jealous, envious.</span> <span id="s1370">But how, where did that come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">A: I think that has to do with upbringing and the character of a person.</span> <span id="s1372">My mother used always to say when you're grown up and you have your own house, if people come, never put three cookies on the table, put always five.</span> <span id="s1373">Maybe somebody wants another cookie.</span> <span id="s1374">Never say, why don't I have that kitchen set, never say.</span> <span id="s1375">You'll have it.</span> <span id="s1376">If you don't have it, it won't help you.</span> <span id="s1377">She told me, I think, as much as I didn't see her long, not to be jealous and envious.</span> <span id="s1378">Because she wasn't.</span> <span id="s1379">I remember my aunts had so, so much jewelry and so much she didn't have.</span> <span id="s1380">She never envious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">Q: What do you remember most about your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">A: I remember she was a very good person, very good mother.</span> <span id="s1383">She wanted me to learn ballet, what I wanted, dancing, ballet.</span> <span id="s1384">And I went for three years and then my grandfather was so religious, he says, "She cannot dance with her legs nude".</span> <span id="s1385">So my mother stopped my ballet.</span> <span id="s1386">But she was a very good person, very good person.</span> <span id="s1387">Never demanding, she had a hard life, she didn't have the luxury we have to put the dishes and put the dishes out.</span> <span id="s1388">You know?</span> <span id="s1389">She had a hard life, she didn't have such a big apartment.</span> <span id="s1390">I don't know if she had maids or not, I don't remember, but I know she didn't have a washer or a dryer or something like that, that I'm sure.</span> <span id="s1391">And also the climate was not like here, so, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1392">We were always clean, I don't know when she washed, when she used to take us from school and bring us from school and help us with the lesson what she could and give me private teacher when I needed, when I was a little worse in some studies or somethings.</span> <span id="s1393">No, it was, no.</span> <span id="s1394">But to tell the true, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1395">She, I think she taught me not to be jealous.</span> <span id="s1396">And I don't want to be jealous, I'm happy.</span> <span id="s1397">My sister-in-law says a lot of times, "When will you change?"</span> <span id="s1398">She doesn't want me to be mean to her, to her I should be good, to other people I should be mean.</span> <span id="s1399">She's also, she's very jealous if I'm nice with somebody.</span> <span id="s1400">She wants to be the first.</span> <span id="s1401">It's a character.</span> <span id="s1402">It's like you want everything for yourself and I tell her, "You are addicted to me".</span> <span id="s1403">She say, "Yes".</span> <span id="s1404">It's a feeling that a person has.</span> <span id="s1405">I'm not possessive, I don't want a person to be only mine, she can be everyone's person.</span> <span id="s1406">But why be possessive?</span> <span id="s1407">Will it help?</span> <span id="s1408">No.</span> <span id="s1409">It won't help none to be possessive.</span> <span id="s1410">So what can I help?</span> <span id="s1411">I don't want to be possessive and I'll never be.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">Q: Well, when you think of your parents, your mother and your father, what, is there one memory that is sort of like, if you're falling asleep and you want to think of them, is there, what's the moment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">A: The moment is that, they started to make a more living and live a little easier when they were taken away.</span> <span id="s1414">And what I remember, as a small child, they had it hard, very hard.</span> <span id="s1415">And then it started to be a little better and everything broke.</span> <span id="s1416">And they were not rich or well off or what, but they made a nice living, they had two children and that's it.</span> <span id="s1417">But it started to be a easier life than in the beginning, I remember.</span> <span id="s1418">She had to go and come and help my father and help in the store and cook and have all the problems.</span> <span id="s1419">You know, mending socks and fixing that, now all that we don't do.</span> <span id="s1420">We don't have that life.</span> <span id="s1421">And she had a hard life, very hard life.</span> <span id="s1422">And not convenient apartment.</span> <span id="s1423">I remember when I was a very small child, we didn't even have a bathroom, we didn't.</span> <span id="s1424">Now each child needs his own bathroom.</span> <span id="s1425">No, it's true.</span> <span id="s1426">We didn't have at all.</span> <span id="s1427">We __________.</span> <span id="s1428">And then there was more comfort and then when you can enjoy, you come into 40, then it was middle age, you don't, they take it away from you.</span> <span id="s1429">That's a pity.</span> <span id="s1430">They could have enjoyed a little, life, a few good years.</span> <span id="s1431">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">Q: Do you have nightmares ever?</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: Not especially.</span> <span id="s1434">But sometimes I would see them and then get up in the morning in a very, not good mood to see somebody.</span> <span id="s1435">Not in a good mood.</span> <span id="s1436">But it doesn't help.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">Q: Because you saw them the night before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">A: Yeah, saw them at night, not the night before.</span> <span id="s1439">I saw them, it was like hours and it's maybe 10 minutes, but it seems like hours, you see, and then you close again your eyes, you see again.</span> <span id="s1440">I don't know if you had that.</span> <span id="s1441">You see somebody and then you want to forget what you saw, and you close your eyes again, you see it again.</span> <span id="s1442">It must be strong in your mind that you see it again and again.</span> <span id="s1443">But, that's it.</span> <span id="s1444">That's enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">Q: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Conclusion of interview.</span></p></body></html>
