things.</span> <span id="s59">And it was a very busy street.</span> <span id="s60">The reason I tell you this because when the Nazis came to Vienna, when they marched in, all the soldiers they marched on the street and they came to our store, a few of the German soldiers came to our store and they wanted to buy razor blades and they looked at my sister, they looked at me and they said “are you Jewish?”</span> <span id="s61">and we said yes.</span> <span id="s62">And they screamed at us “don’t you know we aren’t allowed to buy by Jews” and they walked out.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: Without buying?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Oh, yes, without buying anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Did they take?</span> <span id="s66">Did they take anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: No, they didn’t take.</span> <span id="s68">But it was my first encounter with the Nazis passing me and soon afterwards the people were standing outside our store and they wrote down in big yellow letters “Jude” and they wouldn’t let anybody come in our store.</span> <span id="s69">They blockaded it.</span> <span id="s70">And a few months later, the SS men came in our store and we had to walk out he said and we were not allowed to take the cash or anything from our store.</span> <span id="s71">My sister and I were there and we had to just walk out and leave everything behind.</span> <span id="s72">We had no more rights because we were Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: So this was a few months after the______________?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: Yes, a few months after.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: And you lost the store?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Oh, yes, we lost the store and everything.</span> <span id="s77">We never saw it anymore.</span> <span id="s78">We couldn’t take a_____________ out or anything,, the cash register, nothing.</span> <span id="s79">We just had to walk out.</span> <span id="s80">It was one of our first experiences.</span> <span id="s81">We didn’t know how bad it was going to be but everybody tried to escape.</span> <span id="s82">Only Jewish people went to escape elsewhere.</span> <span id="s83">And everybody tried another way.</span> <span id="s84">And my brother gave me advice and told me, why don’t you look in the phone book and write to some people and they will sponsor us because no country would let you in anymore.</span> <span id="s85">We could leave Vienna if anybody would let you in but no country wanted to leave the refugees in.</span> <span id="s86">So we took a English phone book and I wrote five names from the alphabet.</span> <span id="s87">The first five names.</span> <span id="s88">I wrote to Abbot was his name Abbot and four more names and my sister wrote to a few B’s and her name was Bell.</span> <span id="s89">And a few weeks later, I got an answer from a man named Abbot and my sister from the name Benn and he said he would sponsor us and be able to help a human life.</span> <span id="s90">And he wrote all the documents and this is the way I came to England.</span> <span id="s91">And he was a complete stranger.</span> <span id="s92">It was in 1939.</span> <span id="s93">And when I came to England, he was a furrier and right in the heart of Oldgate he was situated.</span> <span id="s94">And I went to thank him and we were not allowed to take any money, of course, only 30 shillings we were allowed to take from Vienna and we were not supposed to_______________ in England because he guaranteed for us but he asked me and asked_____________ of course, because no money or nothing, and asked, can you keep a needle in your hand.</span> <span id="s95">And are you good at sewing and I say of course.</span> <span id="s96">So he gave me a job off the books.</span> <span id="s97">He paid me in cash and I was sewing and I was happy and I had a job there in his factory.</span> <span id="s98">I was sewing lining in fur coats and he was very nice.</span> <span id="s99">He save my life.</span> <span id="s100">And my sister.</span> <span id="s101">She was married at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: In Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: In Austria.</span> <span id="s104">And she went, her sponsor was a judge in Scotland.</span> <span id="s105">His name was Bell.</span> <span id="s106">He was not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Was your sponsor Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: My sponsor was Jewish, yes.</span> <span id="s109">He was not Jewish, he was a judge.</span> <span id="s110">And he was very well off and they were so good to my sister and her husband.</span> <span id="s111">They had a beautiful house there in Scotland and with butlers and they treated them wonderful.</span> <span id="s112">But after a few months, the war broke out in the meantime, my sister and her husband went to London.</span> <span id="s113">And after the war, it was easier.</span> <span id="s114">You got a permit.</span> <span id="s115">My brother in law got a job with___________ something, officer, he was a lawyer in Vienna and when the Nazis came to Vienna, he had a car and in the first week they took away his car.</span> <span id="s116">And they took away everything from the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: Were you interned in England, when the war broke out?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s119">They didn’t intern us, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: So you got a work permit and you were able to work legally, after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: During the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: After the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: In London, it was very bad when the war broke out.</span> <span id="s124">Bombs were falling and everybody was running to the shelters.</span> <span id="s125">And everybody tried to save your life.</span> <span id="s126">And the district where my job was where Mr. Abbot was, it was all bombed with incendiary bombs and overnight and over weekends, everything was on fire, it was right in the heart of London.</span> <span id="s127">And I went to the country to escape, you know.</span> <span id="s128">I was working in a factory and was sewing goggles for the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: You spent the entire war in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: In England.</span> <span id="s131">I lived in England for 13 years.</span> <span id="s132">My sister too.</span> <span id="s133">I was married in England, my daughter was born but my husband died when she was a baby.</span> <span id="s134">I took her to the nursery and everything.</span> <span id="s135">I got another job in London.</span> <span id="s136">This was already after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: You married an Englishman?</span> <span id="s138">Lipton?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s140">My brother was still in Vienna.</span> <span id="s141">He was three years …</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: I was going to ask about your brother.</span> <span id="s143">You had a sponsor from Abbot, your sister was sponsored by Bell, what was your brother, did he try to?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: No, the Austrian quota, everybody was trying to come to America.</span> <span id="s145">But the Austrian quota was very small and when all this happened with the Jews in Austria, everybody wanted to go to America but it was too late to be registered because the quota was so small but my brother was lucky.</span> <span id="s146">He stayed in Vienna two years after Hitler occupied Vienna and in the meantime his quota was ready to go to America and on the last boat what came from Austria to America he was on it and he came to America.</span> <span id="s147">When we were living in England, my sister and I, my brother wrote to us, of course, he said what are you doing in England.</span> <span id="s148">America is the best country in the world so you better come to America.</span> <span id="s149">It was in 1952.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: When you finally came to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: When I finally came to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Now, during the war, you were not able to correspond with your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: Not during the war, no.</span> <span id="s154">But after.</span> <span id="s155">And we lost all contact, of course, with my mother and father in Vienna.</span> <span id="s156">And my brother, when he left Vienna, he saw my parents, he saw them there and my mother’s brother lived with them, one of her brother’s lived with them that I told you before.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: So your mother’s brother lived with your mother and father?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: But I still don’t know what happened to him.</span> <span id="s159">So far, the Red Cross couldn’t find out what happened to him.</span> <span id="s160">I wrote, you know, all those forms for them to --his name was Adolph Gabler.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: When did your brother leave Austria, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: He left just when the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: 1939?</span> <span id="s164">Or?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: I think 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Or the United States entered the war in 1941.</span> <span id="s167">England entered the war in September of 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: It must have been.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: It was after you settled in England.</span> <span id="s170">Did you have the work permit when your brother left Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: I know he left on the last boat that went to America.</span> <span id="s172">So it must have been -- Hitler was at war with England and America was in 1941, so it must have been in 1940 before the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: What was it like in Vienna, when you grew up in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Before the war?</span> <span id="s175">Oh, it was beautiful there, before the war.</span> <span id="s176">But the people got anti-Semitic, all this stuff, anti-Semitic, there, but you didn’t feel it.</span> <span id="s177">They didn’t let you know.</span> <span id="s178">But as soon as the Germans came, they had an easy field there.</span> <span id="s179">The Austrian people welcomed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Did you have any memories of going to school in Vienna?</span> <span id="s181">What kind of school did you attend?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s183">I went to a commercial school for four years.</span> <span id="s184">_____________.</span> <span id="s185">I had

hardly speak anywhere.</span> <span id="s195">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s196">It was the biggest handicap when you don’t speak the language.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Did you have any bad experiences in school, were there any anti-Semitic incidents?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: No, no, it was before Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: So before Hitler came in, did you have

problems before the time of Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Before the time of Hitler, no, not before the time.</span> <span id="s204">The only thing I remember is when you were Jewish, even before Hitler, you couldn’t get a high job like a judge or a professor in the university.</span> <span id="s205">They didn’t give those high jobs to Jews, you know big jobs for the government.</span> <span id="s206">This was even before Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Now regarding your religious life.</span> <span id="s208">How would you describe your family’s religious activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: My parents were orthodox Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Both?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: Both parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: From Poland and from Eisenstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s214">You know kosher.</span> <span id="s215">And my brother when he came to America, he was also very religious.</span> <span id="s216">He married a woman, she was so religious, he wouldn’t pick up the phone on Saturday.</span> <span id="s217">But we were not religious in England, me and my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: But your parents and your brother were religious?</span> <span id="s219">And the languages that you spoke.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: German.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: German, until you went to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: Yes, but I spoke very little.</span> <span id="s223">In school I didn’t learn too much.</span></p> <p><span

these years, either with your friends or your sister or your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: I remember before Hitler when I was a young girl, there was Shushnick and Dorfus, I remember the night when Dorfus was killed and they were shooting in the streets and it was like a civil war, but it didn’t last too long and then Shushnick came and in a few years, Hitler came, right?</span> <span id="s228">And the _________ and I remember in the most households when Hitler came, they came to the door (they know exactly where to find the Jewish people, by their name and everything, the Austrians) and they came to the door, they took all the men away to the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s229">And some of them came back and some of them went to Dachau concentration camp and some of them never came back.</span> <span id="s230">This was in the very beginning when Hitler came.</span> <span id="s231">And I remember we used to live in an apartment in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: Do you remember the street that you lived in, what section?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: Yes, sure.</span> <span id="s234">Haborstrasser.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Haborstrasser?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Haborstrasser.</span> <span id="s237">It was in the second_______________, the Leiperstadt, the most Jewish people lived there.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: This was a Jewish neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Jewish neighborhood.</span> <span id="s240">Haborstrasser, that’s where my mother used to live and we used to live when we were children.</span> <span id="s241">And when the Nazis came and they knocked at our door and it was an apartment building and they wanted to take my brother and my father.</span> <span id="s242">And we didn’t open the door and a neighbor from the same floor, she came out, she was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s243">And she said “what do you want from those people, they’re not at home.</span> <span id="s244">And they are very nice Jewish people, what do you want from them.</span> <span id="s245">Leave them alone”.</span> <span id="s246">A neighbor said that.</span> <span id="s247">And they walked away.</span> <span id="s248">But it was first week when the Nazis occupied.</span> <span id="s249">But they, of course, didn’t leave the Jewish people alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Did you know anybody personally that was taken away by the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s252">My cousins.</span> <span id="s253">They took my cousins away.</span> <span id="s254">They took them first to Dachau.</span> <span id="s255">But, they let them go.</span> <span id="s256">In the beginning they let some of them go, but later on it was worse.</span> <span id="s257">They wouldn’t let any Jewish people survive.</span> <span id="s258">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s259">But the worst part was you had no rights anymore.</span> <span id="s260">You couldn’t go anywhere to complain.</span> <span id="s261">You couldn’t go to the police or to anywhere.</span> <span id="s262">They took all your rights away and there was not place you could go to fight for your rights.</span> <span id="s263">This is the worst thing of all.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: When you went to England, what kind of passport did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: I had a German passport and it was written as Margaret Sarah.</span> <span id="s266">All the Jewish women they called Sarah.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: What did they call the men?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: So you had a German passport.</span> <span id="s270">You were no longer Austrian but German.</span> <span id="s271">Did you have a “J” on your passport?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s273">The “Jude” was the main thing.</span> <span id="s274">It was the worst crime you could have had, to be a Jude, a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: What did your mother and father think of the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: Oh, terrible.</span> <span id="s277">You know, when they came for us and they had been singing in the street, “Juden brut offen messer”, terrible always against the Jews singing those words and my mother and my father were shaking, you know, they couldn’t believe it, suddenly we were such enemies without any reason.</span> <span id="s278">It was terrible the propaganda.</span> <span id="s279">Hitler, the speeches, I thought screaming like a mad man.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Do you remember your parents talking about the Nazis before they came in, when they were in power in Germany in 1933?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s282">They said it’s terrible.</span> <span id="s283">But as terrible as it was, they didn’t realize that that mad man would take the Jews and kill them like that.</span> <span id="s284">Nobody realized what really could happen because that never happened before in our time, if you remember.</span> <span id="s285">So nobody knew he was sending them to the gas chambers when we were living there.</span> <span id="s286">He kept it a secret too.</span> <span id="s287">I don’t know if you ever saw in the movies, when he takes all those Jewish people and puts them in those trains and the women, they were so vain, they wanted to look nice, they took the suitcase and everything, they didn’t know where they were going.</span> <span id="s288">You saw the movies.</span> <span id="s289">And as soon as they went, as soon as the trains arrived in the concentration camps, they took their luggage away and they were sorted out who was going to live a little longer and who was going to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s290">As soon as the train arrived.</span> <span id="s291">You saw the movies, those things.</span> <span id="s292">Terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Now your parents, in Vienna.</span> <span id="s294">Your father continued to run the store after the Anschluss?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s296">they took away our store.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: I remember, you explained that.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: Oh, no, it was the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: How long after did that

all the rights that the other people had.</span> <span id="s533">You could go to the police, you could go anywhere.</span> <span id="s534">But as soon as Hitler came, all this disappeared.</span> <span id="s535">But to most of the people, I think it was welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: What did your parents think of Dolfuss?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: Dolfuss was all right to

terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Did you know any refugees from Germany who came to Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: No.</span> <span id="s549">But I remember when Hitler came to Germany, a lot of German Jews, he let them go and they even could take their money with them.</span> <span id="s550">They went to Israel, a lot of them and a lot of them went to South America.</span> <span id="s551">At first he wasn’t that bad.</span> <span id="s552">He let them go with their money.</span> <span id="s553">But a few years later, he got worse and worse.</span> <span id="s554">He got

<span id="s566">And he had an easy field because Germany was so bad there and people couldn’t find any work so he blamed everything on the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: How was the economy in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: Not very good.</span> <span id="s569">The people were not rich in Vienna, the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s570">Very few of them.</span> <span id="s571">We all could make a living but nothing like in America, it was much easier.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: How was your father’s business before the Nazis came?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: It was

was worthless.</span> <span id="s579">One day you could buy a house and the next day for the same money you could buy a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s580">If you didn’t have a house or property, you better beg of it one day.</span> <span id="s581">Overnight it happened.</span> <span id="s582">It was after the First World War when I was a small child.</span> <span id="s583">The money was
