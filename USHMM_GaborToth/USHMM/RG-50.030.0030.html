because there, in a small town, little children went to learn Jewish history early in the morning.</span> <span id="s37">Then we went to school.</span> <span id="s38">And then, as a only daughter between the four boys, it was somehow different.</span> <span id="s39">I had my...my group of children; but sometimes we played, boys and girls, together.</span> <span id="s40">But mostly I had my own crowd of...either at, at school or after school.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: Tell me about your childhood and growing up.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: My childhood was a very nice childhood, because my father was um--like I told you that--Jewish history teacher.</span> <span id="s43">And every night, I couldn't get asleep.</span> <span id="s44">You know, like you tell stories for children?</span> <span id="s45">He told me always the stories about the history, because he was studying in Frankfurt-am-Main; and he knew and visited all the places that the Jewish history was around.</span> <span id="s46">And so he told me the travels and all the stories what happened; and that was very interesting.</span> <span id="s47">And so, before I go to sleep, I crawled in his bed and he told me those stories; and then I fell to sleep.</span> <span id="s48">And they had to carry me out from bed.</span> <span id="s49">And um as a matter of fact...because this time wasn't a kindergarten when I was a little girl.</span> <span id="s50">So I always went with my father to the school; and I was listening to the stories.</span> <span id="s51">And the children, you know, they was spoiling me rotten.</span> <span id="s52">(Laughter) And um when I grew tired, so my father asked one of the children to take me home.</span> <span id="s53">Because I was just a child.</span> <span id="s54">I was a very bad eater.</span> <span id="s55">I was very skinny; but I already, as a young child, always worried about the poor.</span> <span id="s56">And I came home to my mother, and I said, "You know, Mom, I saw...I been at my neighbor's pla...our neighbor's place.</span> <span id="s57">And they are so poor.</span> <span id="s58">They haven't got anything.</span> <span id="s59">And it's Shabbat coming, and they haven't got meat and fat and sugar and coffee and tea.</span> <span id="s60">So I am not going to eat, but please give them."</span> <span id="s61">My mother said to my father, "We have so much trouble for her to put a spoon of food in her mouth, (laughter) and she says she's not going to eat!"</span> <span id="s62">So I managed that this way, already as a young child, that we went to the families.</span> <span id="s63">I was talking with the lady of the house while my mother put it in the pots the food; because they was very proud to accept it.</span> <span id="s64">And that was the start of my childhood, and that's how I grew up helping people and helping the neighbors.</span> <span id="s65">And I always said I will be a doctor, because this is also helping the chil...the people.</span> <span id="s66">And later in my life, um there came from Poland some Hebrew teachers.</span> <span id="s67">And they came to the place where we girls was playing.</span> <span id="s68">And he introduced us a Hebrew songs and dances.</span> <span id="s69">And that's what happened, that they put us first in this way.</span> <span id="s70">That in...we just played around in the place where one of the children lived; but later he transferred us--like Jewish scouts--in a place which they called U[Ma'adon (ph)]U, which means U[louder (ph)]U. And there I started to get to know with the history and what they want to try to make: that they should be in a Jewish state, we should have a home our own.</span> <span id="s71">And so it started my youth.</span> <span id="s72">And I was very much involved; and...because if they...in a certain organization, they found out somebody's willing and able, naturally they use.</span> <span id="s73">And I didn't mind it.</span> <span id="s74">I was sent out to start a new organization of Jewish scouts.</span> <span id="s75">And as a young girl, I had the idea that's the only way how you can start an organization, gather them under a flag.</span> <span id="s76">So I was very capable.</span> <span id="s77">I must say, today I don't even know how I did it.</span> <span id="s78">But I approach the all the right sources.</span> <span id="s79">I approached the teacher who was a sewing teacher, and I asked her if she would sew the emblem of, the scout's emblem, on the flag.</span> <span id="s80">I approached a man who was selling material if he would donate that for us.</span> <span id="s81">Which he did.</span> <span id="s82">Then I had the idea that, you know, to have golden nails with their names, which they donate.</span> <span id="s83">And...and the man who did it, he was doing it for...like for charity; but the one who had the nail written in the pole, he had to pay for it.</span> <span id="s84">So...and also I arranged a very nice evening with children--dancing and songs and a theater.</span> <span id="s85">And so a lot of money came together.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: And this was all for the Zionist Organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Yeah, all for the Keren Kayemeth [and Keren] Hayesod.TPPT And you know what?</span> <span id="s88">I tell myself I been very smart, because the collection of the money--I started with the generals.</span> <span id="s89">There was three military generals.</span> <span id="s90">And I approached the one with the list if he was willing to support the nail of...the golden nail; and voluntarily how much he was willing to give.</span> <span id="s91">And every general was very generous.</span> <span id="s92">Then I approach the others.</span> <span id="s93">But on the top of the list was a huge amount, so nobody was... You know how it goes.</span> <span id="s94">And so things like that, I did already.</span> <span id="s95">They always send me to another place to organize a evening like for Keren Kayemeth.</span> <span id="s96">So I did all those things before I started; and I postponed my finishing my studying as a kindergarten teacher, because I thought it's very important.</span> <span id="s97">Somebody should do it.</span> <span id="s98">And then I finished there; because, in our town, wasn't able...I wasn't able to study for kindergarten teacher because there wasn't school.</span> <span id="s99">So I did it privately, by myself.</span> <span id="s100">I went practicing to another town, where it was a kindergarten.</span> <span id="s101">And then I did my...finished my study by myself, and I did the exams in Bratislava.</span> <span id="s102">This was the special town in Slovakia.</span> <span id="s103">And so I became a kindergarten teacher.</span> <span id="s104">But even as a young girl, during the holiday... I really don't know how, how...where did I get all those ideas?</span> <span id="s105">I said to my--I had a girlfriend.</span> <span id="s106">I said, "Look at the children running around, and there is not a kindergarten.</span> <span id="s107">At least during the holiday, let's open a kindergarten."</span> <span id="s108">And I approached there, there was a..</span> <span id="s109">.</span> <span id="s110">we called her "Gleich Mamma.</span> <span id="s111">"TPPT That was her name; and she was in everything.</span> <span id="s112">And we said, "What would you say...the children is running around the streets, and if we would open a kindergarten?"</span> <span id="s113">She said, "I am totally behind you children.</span> <span id="s114">I arrange everything."</span> <span id="s115">And she did.</span> <span id="s116">Because when she went, two o'clock from home she went... You know, her social life was...she went through the city, everywhere she had somebody.</span> <span id="s117">She talked with somebody.</span> <span id="s118">If we ask her husband, "Where is Gleich Mamma?"</span> <span id="s119">And he said, "Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s120">Now it's six o'clock.</span> <span id="s121">Two o'clock, she was there.</span> <span id="s122">Three o'clock, she was there.</span> <span id="s123">Three o'clock...now, it's six o'clock.</span> <span id="s124">She will be in the shop there and there."</span> <span id="s125">(Laughter) He knew exactly her timetable.</span> <span id="s126">And she arranged everything.</span> <span id="s127">So during the school holiday, we gathered forty children.</span> <span id="s128">And there was a man who wanted to get married.</span> <span id="s129">And he had built a house, but he married in two months later.</span> <span id="s130">So she arranged he should let the house for us.</span> <span id="s131">And sand pits, and somebody made us the furniture.</span> <span id="s132">And we two young children...I was, I has then my birthday in August, and the school holiday in our place is June and July, August.</span> <span id="s133">So I was doing it before I was even fifteen.TPPT</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: As you got older, obviously things began to change.</span> <span id="s135">Um...what happened um...as indeed things changed, and the war drew closer?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: When the real war came closer, I still...I had my kindergarten.</span> <span id="s137">It's true that all the doctors and the lawyers, they were stripped from their um possibility to work.</span> <span id="s138">Because it's already started the war.</span> <span id="s139">And um...but I didn't have even to wear a..</span> <span id="s140">.</span> <span id="s141">a yellow star; because my school belonged, the Kinderheim [NB: children's home] belonged to the inspectorate of the other schools.</span> <span id="s142">So I, I..</span> <span id="s143">.</span> <span id="s144">well, they didn't...they wasn't so strict on me.</span> <span id="s145">So I didn't feel much in our town of the persecution, so far as that they lost all their jobs--the lawyers and everyone.</span> <span id="s146">And they started to take away the businesses, and they put Arierstäters (ph)] in.</span> <span id="s147">That means somebody had their eye on that job, and he was member of that...was a Hlinka guard--similar like SS, or something--and so they took away the business from the Jewish men.</span> <span id="s148">And in came, without any um restitution or something for the...for the Jewish man, and he [NB: the Jew] had to go out and he [NB: the Aryan] came in.</span> <span id="s149">So that was bad for them.</span> <span id="s150">And um...and for me, it was... I don't know if we have time for it, but there was a shoemaker who lived in our vicinity, what he had a shop on the way where I went to the kindergarten.</span> <span id="s151">And I made all my shoes there.</span> <span id="s152">He made me beautiful boots.</span> <span id="s153">And, really, top job.</span> <span id="s154">But what I didn't know, that he fell in love with me.</span> <span id="s155">A father with a few children who lived in our neighborhood!</span> <span id="s156">And um every time I went to the kindergarten, he came out from the shop and he said, "How are you" and "Good morning."</span> <span id="s157">And I thought it's just neighborly.</span> <span id="s158">One day, he came to the kindergarten; and he said, "I want to protect you.</span> <span id="s159">In this way: that I will make one child, whichever child that is, is your child.</span> <span id="s160">Because first now they are taking the young girls.</span> <span id="s161">And as you have a child, I can make that you are exempted from this um transport."</span> <span id="s162">And I said, "But why are you doing it?</span> <span id="s163">I haven't gotten a child."</span> <span id="s164">"Can't you understand?"</span> <span id="s165">I said, "No."</span> <span id="s166">"I am in love with you.</span> <span id="s167">I want to protect you."</span> <span id="s168">I said, "And later, when the children will have to go?"</span> <span id="s169">"Don't worry.</span> <span id="s170">I will protect you always."</span> <span id="s171">And I said, "You mean, I should be your mistress?"</span> <span id="s172">He said, "Do I have to make it clear for you?"</span> <span id="s173">So...because I, I couldn't believe my eyes.</span> <span id="s174">But that's what he wanted.</span> <span id="s175">Naturally, I didn't want it.</span> <span id="s176">I told my mother; I said, "Isn't that funny?</span> <span id="s177">He's our neighbor, and he's my bootmaker.</span> <span id="s178">And he gives me such proposition!"</span> <span id="s179">So I..</span> <span id="s180">.</span> <span id="s181">"What did you say?"</span> <span id="s182">"I said, 'Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s183">You are really very nice.</span> <span id="s184">You mean it well.</span> <span id="s185">But,' I said, 'I couldn't.</span> <span id="s186">You have a wife and children.</span> <span id="s187">How could you ask for me that?'"</span> <span id="s188">The same night, they came for me.</span> <span id="s189">The same night they came for me; because he was so angry.</span> <span id="s190">Because he was waiting that I will naturally say yes.</span> <span id="s191">But I didn't know...um, I wouldn't even... I can't believe even when I would know where I am going I would agree to it.</span> <span id="s192">But this time, they said to us...which they deceived us, and there was nobody to say something differently.</span> <span id="s193">They said we are going to work in the Bata factory.</span> <span id="s194">So I said to myself, "What's so wrong to go to factory?</span> <span id="s195">So we will go to Bata factory."</span> <span id="s196">That's what I thought.</span> <span id="s197">Nobody ever said that there is danger.</span> <span id="s198">And then it came that um they gather us, they gathered us like at night.</span> <span id="s199">But me, I was so sure that they will...I will be excepted...exempted as a kindergarten teacher.</span> <span id="s200">So I wasn't worrying about myself.</span> <span id="s201">I worried about others; especially, there was fathers whose daughter was hiding somewhere and they took the fathers instead.</span> <span id="s202">So I worried about the old fathers; and um run around and gave them help.</span> <span id="s203">And I did get excepted um papers.</span> <span id="s204">But what happened, there is always somebody greedy.</span> <span id="s205">They knew I have the papers.</span> <span id="s206">And one woman, a teacher, she bought my papers.</span> <span id="s207">She paid twenty thousand crowns, Czech crowns,TPPT for the papers.</span> <span id="s208">And when my father...</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: To whom?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: In the inspectorate was a..</span> <span id="s211">.</span> <span id="s212">a man who was doing the papers.</span> <span id="s213">She paid him twenty thousand; so she got my papers.</span> <span id="s214">And my father found out and he went to the inspectorate...because he was also in...like teacher, you know.</span> <span id="s215">So they say, "My dear man," he says, "the times are changing.</span> <span id="s216">If you bring me twenty thousand crowns, I take it away from her, even if she paid it already.</span> <span id="s217">And I give it back to your daughter."</span> <span id="s218">But my father didn't have the twenty thousand crowns.</span> <span id="s219">He was crying like a baby, saying it to somebody who after the war told me... He was crying, "They tear the nicest flower out of my garden, but I can't do anything.</span> <span id="s220">I haven't got the money."</span> <span id="s221">Anyway, when we came on the train...so from our hometown, we went on normal trains.</span> <span id="s222">And we came there, and the girls was dressed like peasants woman.</span> <span id="s223">You know, because they lived in little villages.</span> <span id="s224">And I had my beautiful wardrobe.</span> <span id="s225">So I opened my suitcase and I dressed them all up.</span> <span id="s226">And there was a policeman--what they called them gendarme, a gendarmerie, because they was Czech.</span> <span id="s227">They... they had the quarters in the same street that we lived on the corner.</span> <span id="s228">So they saw me passing by, and they was always very friendly.</span> <span id="s229">And he thought...said, "I never happened to see something, that somebody should give away all the clothes!"</span> <span id="s230">I had only what I had on me.</span> <span id="s231">The dress, the coat and a muff, and a bag.</span> <span id="s232">All the rest I gave out.</span> <span id="s233">I dressed up all the girls, because... He said, "Why are you doing that?"</span> <span id="s234">"Because," I said, "we are going to Bata factory.</span> <span id="s235">I want the girls to be representing nice."</span> <span id="s236">"How could you be so naïve?"</span> <span id="s237">I was...nobody taught us any other way.</span> <span id="s238">And he wanted to help me; so he took me...he said, "I am taking you to say once more to say goodbye to your parents."</span> <span id="s239">And he took me there, and I said goodbye.</span> <span id="s240">And I said to him, "How about if I would now run away?"</span> <span id="s241">And he said, "Try."</span> <span id="s242">I didn't.</span> <span id="s243">I didn't, because I didn't know what, how...how will I..</span> <span id="s244">.</span> <span id="s245">If...if not today, they will take me tomorrow; so something, I thought...

That's how it started.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: Excuse me...you had arrived in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: In Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s345">In Auschwitz there was red barracks.</span> <span id="s346">And it was a little bit normal, because that was um beds--not bunks.</span> <span id="s347">And the next day, they took us; and we been standing in the freezing cold.</span> <span id="s348">And some girls collapsed.</span> <span id="s349">I was saying, when they asked us "Los!</span> <span id="s350">Los!</span> <span id="s351">Los!"</span> <span id="s352">--I said, "Girls, let's run.</span> <span id="s353">Let's run and let's be obedient.</span> <span id="s354">Maybe that will help us."</span> <span id="s355">So what happened, I was the first in the room; but when the girls collapsed...so I asked somebody to help me to put them somewhere 'til they recovered from collapsing from cold and from...from stress.</span> <span id="s356">So that's why my number is not 2000, but 2,318; because so many times I run with the girls to help.</span> <span id="s357">I was really physically very healthy, sport-minded.</span> <span id="s358">And ate the right foods--a lot of fruit from the trees what we had in the garden.</span> <span id="s359">I ate for months--I don't know what it is, it's something which you can't understand.</span> <span id="s360">I ate only the fruit for months.</span> <span id="s361">And my mother... I came back from kindergarten, and I just said, "Hello."</span> <span id="s362">And I run on the trees.</span> <span id="s363">And she came out and she said, "My goodness me.</span> <span id="s364">If somebody will see a kindergarten teacher..." I pushed my shoes down and sometimes the skirt, and off I went to the tree.</span> <span id="s365">And there I had my lunch, my breakfast, my dinner.</span> <span id="s366">And my mother said, "I'm cooking the beautiful soup."</span> <span id="s367">And I said, "No, that's what I feel I need."</span> <span id="s368">I didn't understand how important was that.</span> <span id="s369">It was like...I don't know why I did it.</span> <span id="s370">But that's what I did all the...all the time just eating fruit.</span> <span id="s371">Fruit in season.</span> <span id="s372">And we had all the fruit for all the season in our garden.</span> <span id="s373">I remember once I climbed on the cherry tree, on the high branches up.</span> <span id="s374">And, you know, it was the branches went swaying here and there.</span> <span id="s375">And Mother...my mother says, "Please come down.</span> <span id="s376">The branches will fell."</span> <span id="s377">I said, "Oh, no.</span> <span id="s378">They are strong branches.</span> <span id="s379">And...and here are the cherries the sweetest, the healthiest."</span> <span id="s380">She said, "Please come down."</span> <span id="s381">So alright.</span> <span id="s382">I ...I had my lunch.</span> <span id="s383">Now I came down.</span> <span id="s384">"But have something to eat."</span> <span id="s385">I said, "No, this is my food."</span> <span id="s386">And, anyway... So the next what was they...like I told you before, they undressed all what we had um...they put us...like I am saying there in the article.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Tell us on tape.</span> <span id="s388">I want...tell us exactly how they treated you.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s390">They undressed everything what we had.</span> <span id="s391">Now they let us stand there naked.</span> <span id="s392">Then they shaved our head with blunt scissors, so our head was all bruised--at least mine.</span> <span id="s393">And then the man, laughing man, stood me on the chair and shaved everywhere what was hair.</span> <span id="s394">And then, they call it "disinfection."</span> <span id="s395">They put us in big bins; and it was murky water.</span> <span id="s396">Ten at a time.</span> <span id="s397">And we had to go in, and with our heads in.</span> <span id="s398">And then naked, wet, we stood in that freezing cold wintry day 'til we got the remnants of Russian prisoner of wars uniforms, which was cotton top and cotton pants.</span> <span id="s399">And mine didn't have a button on top and a button on the pants.</span> <span id="s400">So I had to hold on to...not to lose it.</span> <span id="s401">And then we got wooden clogs, which we never was use to it.</span> <span id="s402">And so ...and naked and barefooted... And then that's how it was.</span> <span id="s403">The start.</span> <span id="s404">We...we thought looking one each other, we didn't recognize.</span> <span id="s405">We thought they are crazy.</span> <span id="s406">But we didn't see that ourself--we looked like crazy, too.</span> <span id="s407">Anyway, we went to the barracks.</span> <span id="s408">And in our room, there was about six hundred girls; and some of the girls under shock.</span> <span id="s409">What happened, they went crazy.</span> <span id="s410">Or, what you call it?</span> <span id="s411">Under the shock.</span> <span id="s412">And very soon, in the first day, we found out--because there is always that certain communication and certain gossip going around--that those who are crazy, they get a phenol injection.</span> <span id="s413">You know what's a phenol?</span> <span id="s414">Straight away, a phenol injection.</span> <span id="s415">And there was four girls.</span> <span id="s416">And I..</span> <span id="s417">.</span> <span id="s418">I knew how to...I had experience; because I work ...worked like a um assistant to a very famous doctor, and so I knew how to handle um oh crazy.</span> <span id="s419">But they weren't crazy.</span> <span id="s420">They was under the shock.</span> <span id="s421">So I slept in one bed with four of those, which was really meant for two.</span> <span id="s422">But I slept with them.</span> <span id="s423">And my influence on them was so good they recovered in a few days.</span> <span id="s424">Others who didn't do that, they was dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: I'd like to stop the tape a moment.</span> <span id="s426">I'd like to take a break.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION - PAUSE IN TAPE</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: We'll pick up with more stories of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s429">OK.</span> <span id="s430">We are in Auschwitz, in the barracks at Auschwitz...</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: In a barrack in Auschwitz, and this... And there was, like I mentioned, about six hundred girls; and there was in charge a German um woman who was a politisch [NB: political prisoner].</span> <span id="s432">And he was there...she was there as a punishment, because in P_aszów she had helped prisoners.</span> <span id="s433">Her husband was a famous doctor, but even so it didn't help.</span> <span id="s434">They brought her to Auschwitz and they shaved her hair the same way like us.</span> <span id="s435">But she was not well.</span> <span id="s436">Her legs were swollen.</span> <span id="s437">I don't know from what...what sickness it makes it.</span> <span id="s438">And so she asked the girls who would help her.</span> <span id="s439">So I volunteered that I will.</span> <span id="s440">And the first... first day, because we needed to bring tea to the um for the people.</span> <span id="s441">So we went there.</span> <span id="s442">But the German prisoners, like I told you, they were prostitutes, thieves and murderers.</span> <span id="s443">And the rumors went that we are prostitutes too, and we are competition to them.</span> <span id="s444">So when I came to the girls there for the drinks, so she says, "We don't need any competition.</span> <span id="s445">And anyway, you wouldn't be able to carry the...the kettles."</span> <span id="s446">And I said, "In case we are able to carry the kettles, would you not make any difficulties for us?"</span> <span id="s447">And...but she said, they said, "OK, we wouldn't.</span> <span id="s448">But you won't!"</span> <span id="s449">So I said, "Could you..." And I pointed to one of the girls. "</span> <span id="s450">...be a partner to me, and we are carrying together?"</span> <span id="s451">And usually they carry it four girls--two and two--because it's heavy.</span> <span id="s452">And I said, "But I would like to carry it with you by yourself."</span> <span id="s453">So she said, "Alright."</span> <span id="s454">So... and I grabbed the kettle, because I told you I was strong.</span> <span id="s455">And later, when we went out of their view, so I said, "And now you run, because I'm going to run."</span> <span id="s456">And so I was running.</span> <span id="s457">And it was a huge distance from where that food was given to the place where we been.</span> <span id="s458">Because we was in Barrack 9.</span> <span id="s459">That was...two more barracks was there, 10 and 11.</span> <span id="s460">And 11, it was the bunker where they killed politisch prisoners or whatever.</span> <span id="s461">So and then she... she amazed, she was amazed.</span> <span id="s462">She said, "I thought that you are all spoiled nobodies!"</span> <span id="s463">And I said, "No, we are not.</span> <span id="s464">We are decent human beings.</span> <span id="s465">And please, in the future, let us have that food.</span> <span id="s466">Because whichever wrong that food is, what we need something."</span> <span id="s467">So I got the respect from her.</span> <span id="s468">And she wanted to be...she was lesbian, which I didn't know.</span> <span id="s469">So she came and she wanted to make friends with me.</span> <span id="s470">But in our town, in our country, we didn't know about what it means.</span> <span id="s471">But she started to pet me.</span> <span id="s472">So I said, "Oh, you... Don't be angry, but I don't understand this thing."</span> <span id="s473">And I said, "I appreciate if you leave me alone."</span> <span id="s474">And she was decent enough.</span> <span id="s475">She said, "Would you like something?</span> <span id="s476">Would you like I bring you, I take you somewhere?"</span> <span id="s477">And she really did.</span> <span id="s478">And she said, "What would you like?"</span> <span id="s479">And there was food, all the food what people was bringing.</span> <span id="s480">And I said, "A little bit of a salt."</span> <span id="s481">Salt, because we missed salt.</span> <span id="s482">So she said, "Don't be so silly!</span> <span id="s483">Here, you have a piece of speck [NB: bacon], too."</span> <span id="s484">And she gave me.</span> <span id="s485">And so I shared that with all the others.</span> <span id="s486">But, you know, we were sucking on that skin so much that I broke my tooth on it.</span> <span id="s487">(Laughter) You know, because we been so hungry that that have it... So anyway, this was the first thing.</span> <span id="s488">In the morning, two o'clock, they woke us up with screams and with the sticks hitting us: "Raus!</span> <span id="s489">Raus!</span> <span id="s490">Raus!"</span> <span id="s491">Because it was the counting.</span> <span id="s492">And because they was so primitive, and so was the SS woman who came there too, thousand... They were so primitive, they couldn't make the counting.</span> <span id="s493">So we had to get up two o'clock at night in that freezing cold, bad climate.</span> <span id="s494">It was like a punishment from God, this climate there in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s495">Lot of people, they...they fell because they couldn't stand the cold, standing on one spot.</span> <span id="s496">I was telling the girls to turn around--you know, like round, around, around.</span> <span id="s497">I..</span> <span id="s498">.</span> <span id="s499">those... that mean movement on one spot, because you couldn't...you couldn't go out of the place.</span> <span id="s500">That's how it started.</span> <span id="s501">And then in the barrack, they started to say that they need people for different work.</span> <span id="s502">Like in the kitchen and in the sewing rooms and different department.</span> <span id="s503">And the girls volunteered then.</span> <span id="s504">And you know, everybody wanted a inside job, naturally.</span> <span id="s505">And I was with that crazy woman, looking after them; and this um woman, the German woman, she said, "Why don't you go also look for something?</span> <span id="s506">You are sitting with those four crazy women.</span> <span id="s507">And look after yourself."</span> <span id="s508">And I said, "What I am...I don't want to be any time here.</span> <span id="s509">And otherwise, I want to go and work in outside and prepare myself.</span> <span id="s510">Because I believe once it will be a place for Jews to go, and I want to prepare myself."</span> <span id="s511">Morning came, and the Kommandos was standing.</span> <span id="s512">And I was volunteering to go...like working in the fields.</span> <span id="s513">But she knew better than I; so she slapped my face and pulled me in...</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Which "she"?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: Hmmm?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: Who is this "she" that slapped you?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: That...that German woman who was in charge of our room, which she was from politisch reason there.</span> <span id="s518">So she knew about it, so she pulled me in.</span> <span id="s519">And she said, "You are going to work inside and help me and scrub the floor."</span> <span id="s520">I says, "With what?</span> <span id="s521">You haven't got anything."</span> <span id="s522">She said, "With your nails.</span> <span id="s523">But here you will stay."</span> <span id="s524">So I..</span> <span id="s525">.</span> <span id="s526">I took water and I scrubbed the wat...the dirt with my nails.</span> <span id="s527">But I thought, "I am crazy.</span> <span id="s528">I'm going rather outside on the fresh air."</span> <span id="s529">Next day, the same thing.</span> <span id="s530">I did it three times.</span> <span id="s531">The third time she said, "What you think you are going to?</span> <span id="s532">You are going to work for the fields to prepare yourself?</span> <span id="s533">How long will you last?</span> <span id="s534">They will beat you there.</span> <span id="s535">They will, you know, run you there.</span> <span id="s536">And you won't last three days there.</span> <span id="s537">And I need you there; because look my feet!</span> <span id="s538">I need somebody who will help me."</span> <span id="s539">So, and she said, "Otherwise, tell me what you are from profession that you don't want to go to the kitchen, or...." I said, "I don't want to tell."</span> <span id="s540">She said, "Tell me."</span> <span id="s541">"I'm a kindergarten teacher."</span> <span id="s542">So she said, "I am a teacher, so I understand what you mean you don't want your profession.</span> <span id="s543">But come and help me."</span> <span id="s544">So let's go start my...my first career.</span> <span id="s545">She said, "Help me, because I am unable to do that."</span> <span id="s546">So I was going to carry the food, the bread, the evening meal.</span> <span id="s547">And we always had to volun...ask for volunteers; because us was a small number and for six hundred people to bring bread and this, that was a hard task.</span> <span id="s548">Because came tired from it.</span> <span id="s549">But we had to have the food, but straight away I used that that I am home for something good; because you can do good even where is impossible.</span> <span id="s550">So I approached the girls who are um working in so-called "Revier"--like hospital.</span> <span id="s551">I said, "Steal wherever you... whatever you could and bring it home to me, because I know what to use it for."</span> <span id="s552">And to those girls who are working in the sewing room, "Bring all the rags what you can.</span> <span id="s553">Steal it.</span> <span id="s554">Put it in the pants and bring it home."</span> <span id="s555">So they brought it home.</span> <span id="s556">And when the girls came home, I saw what it is.</span> <span id="s557">Now I understood why she didn't want to, because she...they had terrible experiences right away.</span> <span id="s558">So I bandaged them.</span> <span id="s559">So I gave them some medication what it was.</span> <span id="s560">And I was even, when I gave the food out, I didn't sit down to eat the food; because I was...I saw so many I had to help.</span> <span id="s561">And there was a interesting thing.</span> <span id="s562">There was a girl who was watching me doing that.</span> <span id="s563">And she said, "My name is U[Bluma (ph)]U." She lives in Israel.</span> <span id="s564">"I am a daughter...and I am a daughter of a rabbi from Bratislava," where my husband was born.</span> <span id="s565">"And, you see, I think that God send me watch over you while you are helping others.</span> <span id="s566">And now you are coming and you are sitting down, and you have that little food.</span> <span id="s567">Otherwise you won't have strength to do what you are doing."</span> <span id="s568">And that's what she did.</span> <span id="s569">Every night, she said, "Enough is enough.</span> <span id="s570">Now you are going to sit down and have your meal."</span> <span id="s571">So that's where it started, that togetherness to help each other in the girls where the misery was.</span> <span id="s572">And the sadisms of the woman who took the girls out in kommando, and often they did hurt unnecessary.</span> <span id="s573">Like...you know, the demolition all the...or they didn't want that the civil population should know, being so close, and see Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s574">So they...they demolished some villages and they transferred them somewhere else.</span> <span id="s575">But there was ruins.</span> <span id="s576">So they took some woman and watched that; they let some woman go down and some woman on top.</span> <span id="s577">And they had them to demolish and throw the bricks down.</span> <span id="s578">And down the girls was working.</span> <span id="s579">And if they didn't want to, they beat them.</span> <span id="s580">"Throw that bricks down!"</span> <span id="s581">And they threw the bricks on their own friends; and often they came half dead, or dead already.</span> <span id="s582">Or they carried rocks from one place to the other.</span> <span id="s583">"Los!</span> <span id="s584">Los!"</span> <span id="s585">So this...this was the start.</span> <span id="s586">And the girls became sick, and the girl became weak.</span> <span id="s587">And some were...some run to the electrical um... We, we had an electrical fence which was with um electricity.</span> <span id="s588">So if you touch it, you been dead.</span> <span id="s589">But some girls, they said, "I rather that.</span> <span id="s590">I can't take it anymore.</span> <span id="s591">And I can't see any end to it."</span> <span id="s592">Because except that the work, there was other things that you wouldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s593">There was fleas, artificial-like breeded to that they should jump only on places like eyes, ears, nose and mouth.</span> <span id="s594">You you couldn't help it.</span> <span id="s595">There was hundreds jumping on you.</span> <span id="s596">Then there was lice.</span> <span id="s597">Everywhere lice, crawling all over you.</span> <span id="s598">And then was lice who was crawling under your skin.</span> <span id="s599">And all that, plus the beatings and the starving and the brutality.</span> <span id="s600">So a lot of girls choose another death.</span> <span id="s601">But we lasted there in this camp Auschwitz about...I would say, beginning of August.</span> <span id="s602">I can't tell you exact days that I come.</span> <span id="s603">And then because...you know, days and weeks we didn't know.</span> <span id="s604">We didn't have that somebody says, "It's Monday" or "Tuesday" or... We didn't know.</span> <span id="s605">The days were just passing without us knowing.</span> <span id="s606">And so they took us um on walking to Birkenau from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s607">If Auschwitz was Hell, Birkenau was thought on the biggest Satan what can exist.</span> <span id="s608">There was um barracks from clay, which meant before it was for horses.</span> <span id="s609">And the place for one horse suddenly became a lodging for thirty woman.</span> <span id="s610">Because they put two planks across, and some woman was lying down.</span> <span id="s611">Ten down, ten in the middle, and ten on the top.</span> <span id="s612">And they couldn't even move.</span> <span id="s613">They could just lie like sardines, covered up with one blanket.</span> <span id="s614">And this is not enough.</span> <span id="s615">But the whole camp was with holes, because they supposed to bring canalization there.</span> <span id="s616">But they didn't wait 'til they have the canalization, or they have water or they have anything.</span> <span id="s617">They brought us there in this stage.</span> <span id="s618">First of all, a lot of lice and this place.</span> <span id="s619">And it was muddy.</span> <span id="s620">And it was... You had that one... They... One thing, they took away the Russian uniforms and they gave us one dress.</span> <span id="s621">But nothing under it.</span> <span id="s622">'Nother scarf, and the same wooden clogs.</span> <span id="s623">And they...in that you had to exist in rain, in shine.</span> <span id="s624">So the rain...imagine what it does--the rain and the shine--what it is to a little rag.</span> <span id="s625">It's felling to pieces.</span> <span id="s626">And some girls was falling in that...in those holes.</span> <span id="s627">And if you fall in this hole and you been weak, you couldn't walk out of it.</span> <span id="s628">That was the end of her.</span> <span id="s629">And except that it was, when it was raining it was muddy.</span> <span id="s630">And it was muddy; and so the girls had the wooden clogs.</span> <span id="s631">And when they walked in it and lost the clogs, they couldn't even take it out anymore; because it was "Los!</span> <span id="s632">Los!"</span> <span id="s633">So they run...so they run barefoot in the cold, in the rain.</span> <span id="s634">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s635">And also, there was only one place where the water was.</span> <span id="s636">It was one well.</span> <span id="s637">When you took the water out in a..</span> <span id="s638">.</span> <span id="s639">like a basket.</span> <span id="s640">You had to wind it up.</span> <span id="s641">But imagine, one for so many thousands.</span> <span id="s642">And the people came home thirsty.</span> <span id="s643">So one over the other.</span> <span id="s644">And lot of girls, they fell in and that was the finish.</span> <span id="s645">And then you couldn't drink that water because it was like that.</span> <span id="s646">And later they made like the water in the back of the barrack.</span> <span id="s647">But it was always a restriction of the water.</span> <span id="s648">Soon you arrived there, they closed up the water.</span> <span id="s649">It was all sadistically, brutality.</span> <span id="s650">You know, just make us like really swines.</span> <span id="s651">Because you couldn't wash yourself.</span> <span id="s652">You couldn't go properly to the toilet.</span> <span id="s653">There was just a hole, and over the hole a piece of plank.</span> <span id="s654">And you was sitting on the plank and there was... So, and a lot of people, one push the other.</span> <span id="s655">And if you fell in, that was the finish.</span> <span id="s656">And things like that, for you to see and to...to...to be able to...to...to go on with the life, it's unbelievable.</span> <span id="s657">Unbelievable.</span> <span id="s658">So...and on the other side, like I said, people fell in those--"graven," you call it.</span> <span id="s659">Like, you know, they dig ditches for the...the pipes what they wanted to put in.</span> <span id="s660">But they wasn't in hurry to put in.</span> <span id="s661">And often, they made...they call it "Blocksperre" [NB: "block closing"].</span> <span id="s662">There was a siren and everybody had to run to the barrack.</span> <span id="s663">And say the girl was just on the toilet.</span> <span id="s664">And she wanted to run, but there was that ditch.</span> <span id="s665">They fell in.</span> <span id="s666">And when the siren was over, and whoever was found in those ditches, they took them straight away on the trucks to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s667">Often, I did that I saw some friend of mine...they, they just fell in.</span> <span id="s668">So I run out to pull them out and push them back to... Because I thought [to] myself, "Every day when you are alive, maybe...maybe there will be a chance that something will happen and prolong the life.</span> <span id="s669">Maybe some miracle will happen and the war will come to the end, and then they will recuperate."</span> <span id="s670">By one of these such occasions when I did it, and the whistle came up and I was there with the girls.</span> <span id="s671">So, naturally, I also went on the truck with all others to be taken to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s672">And, you know, fate... This woman who many months ago had experiences carrying the water with me and I didn't want to be her lesbian friend...but she was just having a Kommando taken out to work and she was the kapo of this kommando.</span> <span id="s673">And she saw me on that truck and she knew.</span> <span id="s674">So she came up and she gave me one big slap; and she pulled me down from the truck.</span> <span id="s675">And to the SS who was guarding, he [NB: she] said, "I couldn't walk out with the Kommando because she is missing!"</span> <span id="s676">And she was, you know, pretending to scream at me.</span> <span id="s677">And when I came and she said, "And now, run!</span> <span id="s678">Run for your life."</span> <span id="s679">And that's... and it saved me.</span> <span id="s680">Anyway, and then...</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s682">At this point we're going to pause and change tapes.</span> <span id="s683">This is a good place to change tapes.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">UTAPE #2U</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s687">There was a story you wanted to tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: There is...there is a short story I want to tell you.</span> <span id="s689">When I was a young girl...and because being a only daughter, my father took me to a famous rabbi, who came to the city, to be blessed.</span> <span id="s690">When he blessed and put his hands over my head, he says "This girl has a special mission in her life.</span> <span id="s691">She is chosen, and she is going to save hundreds and hundreds of Jewish sisters and brothers.</span> <span id="s692">And that's what her life will be."</span> <span id="s693">My father came home, told my mother.</span> <span id="s694">They said, "What?</span> <span id="s695">Seven year old girl, what he is talking about?"</span> <span id="s696">Um, but naturally I didn't know about it.</span> <span id="s697">Only before I went away, so my mother told me.</span> <span id="s698">Imagine, when you've been...the rabbi told that I don't know why he was telling it.</span> <span id="s699">And um my sister said, "Probably that's what you are doing for Zionism.</span> <span id="s700">That's what it is."</span> <span id="s701">But when I was in camp, I felt something that's... Often I opened my mouth, and I say things and I do things, like...it's not me.</span> <span id="s702">Like...I don't believe in...in...in unnatural or something.</span> <span id="s703">But it was like that.</span> <span id="s704">Because I undertook to save um my friends, and...and implanted in them to do that, too.</span> <span id="s705">So I thought, "Is it me doing that, or is something in me what is doing it?"</span> <span id="s706">So I just show you one sample.</span> <span id="s707">You see, because the girls was wearing one dress and it was in rain or in shine, so they used the blanket what they have to cover up.</span> <span id="s708">And they tore it up to put it around their chest or wherever.</span> <span id="s709">So they took all the girls who been in charge to a room they called sauna, where they usually had once in a while um shower.</span> <span id="s710">And they put a big table there.</span> <span id="s711">And all the commanders of the camp from all over were sitting there.</span> <span id="s712">And they invited all... Invited!</span> <span id="s713">(Laughter) I am talking invited!</span> <span id="s714">All the...all the woman in charge there, even the charge--it wasn't that we wanted to be in charge.</span> <span id="s715">They pressed us in the charge.</span> <span id="s716">And they...they said, "You know what the women are doing?</span> <span id="s717">They are sabotage!</span> <span id="s718">And you... They are tearing the... the German property.</span> <span id="s719">And you are there not to prevent them.</span> <span id="s720">So you know what the punishment is for that?</span> <span id="s721">The punishment for that you are going to go, all of you, to the gas chambers."</span> <span id="s722">Suddenly, something pushed me.</span> <span id="s723">And I stopped...I made a step forwards, announce my number--because that was...we been only number--and I said to him, to the commanders, I said, "I'm not wondering that they are doing that, because every human being 'til he's alive is trying to make his miserable life a little bit less miserable.</span> <span id="s724">If you...if you would be in the same position, you would be doing the same thing.</span> <span id="s725">And if you would give us new clothing after such a long time which they are wearing that one um dress--which from rain and shine it's going to pieces--you would do the same thing."</span> <span id="s726">So, he started to scream at me.</span> <span id="s727">He said, "You are a..</span> <span id="s728">.</span> <span id="s729">a U[chuke (ph)]U, a nasty U[chuke (ph)]U.</span> <span id="s730">How dare you talking to me like that!?"</span> <span id="s731">And that is expression "frech," which I can't um translate.</span> <span id="s732">It's...you know, who has a big mouth [Ger: "insolent, sassy, cheeky"].</span> <span id="s733">They call it "frech."</span> <span id="s734">So, and he screamed at me.</span> <span id="s735">So I thought...and the girls in the back, they pulled me back.</span> <span id="s736">"Magda, don't do it.</span> <span id="s737">Don't do it."</span> <span id="s738">But I..</span> <span id="s739">.</span> <span id="s740">and, and I tell myself and...and I said what I wanted to say.</span> <span id="s741">And to my surprise, one of the biggest sadists--which I didn't know he is such a sadist, I..</span> <span id="s742">.</span> <span id="s743">I found it out much later--he got up, and he said, "Listen.</span> <span id="s744">She's not only a like big-mouth U[chuke (ph)]U.</span> <span id="s745">She has something in her head.</span> <span id="s746">She's right.</span> <span id="s747">We have to give them new clothing."</span> <span id="s748">Next day...and they discharged us, and the whole camp got new dresses.</span> <span id="s749">So, I not only saved us three hundred, but saved the camp.</span> <span id="s750">Because they got a little bit warmer and...dresses.</span> <span id="s751">And this is what we did, what we helped each other.</span> <span id="s752">There is another case.</span> <span id="s753">One day, I was watching that the SS man came to select the girls--"left" and "right."</span> <span id="s754">And who was "left," she had to go to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s755">And there was present a girl...with the SS man was a um girl present which was Report Schreiberin.</span> <span id="s756">She was the one who wrote the reports.</span> <span id="s757">And she had to make the...all the numbers who will go to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s758">I was passing by; and I observed that she's writing something.</span> <span id="s759">And then she looks left and right.</span> <span id="s760">And she doesn't see any SS man; and she sends the girls back to the barrack.</span> <span id="s761">And so she saved about three hundred girls from immediate death.</span> <span id="s762">How long they will be alive, this nobody could guarantee.</span> <span id="s763">But she did it.</span> <span id="s764">And I saw many times she did it.</span> <span id="s765">And I had...didn't have even the opportunity to ask how you do it.</span> <span id="s766">But I met her after forty-five years, two years ago, in Prague.</span> <span id="s767">I went to visit her.</span> <span id="s768">And she told...and I ask her, "Tell me, U[Gatka (ph)]U, how did you do it?</span> <span id="s769">I watched you writing, and then you send them back."</span> <span id="s770">She said, "Listen.</span> <span id="s771">We had to do something, because this was no...no end what they did to us.</span> <span id="s772">So I took from the U[cart-a-take (ph)]U the dead numbers, of the dead.</span> <span id="s773">And I pretend that I am writing.</span> <span id="s774">And nobody saw.</span> <span id="s775">And I send them, because the SS didn't check it later."</span> <span id="s776">Because anyway so many other was going; so they didn't check if those three hundreds are in it or not.</span> <span id="s777">And that's what she did many times.</span> <span id="s778">There was another um how the girls, they had only one way to help each other or to survive.</span> <span id="s779">By own help; we didn't have anybody to help us.</span> <span id="s780">We been helpless young girls to thrown in such unbelievable situation, which I don't know Dante couldn't um couldn't find out such situation what we been in.</span> <span id="s781">Sick and fighting with every minute.</span> <span id="s782">Because one minute you been alive, the next minute you been dead.</span> <span id="s783">So one more occasion, I tell you: that I was working in a charge, like um a little helper there.</span> <span id="s784">And we had to put the whole barrack on, because a doctor--by the name U[King (ph)]U, and she...her name is Anna, she lives in Australia--and um they had to select the woman out.</span> <span id="s785">But she gave me a hint, while he was turned around, that "I am going to talk to him, and you girls try to pull the girls in.</span> <span id="s786">They should run in the barrack."</span> <span id="s787">So she turned facing him from the front, and she started to talk to him.</span> <span id="s788">She was very...a very clever representative woman.</span> <span id="s789">And she was telling him all different stories; and while the stories she was telling him, I was telling the girls to run, run, run, run back to the barrack.</span> <span id="s790">One--which is remarkable and I never forget, because I didn't overhear all what she was telling him because I was concentrating more girls to go in--so she said, "You know..." And she named the...the... how far he was Oberscharsturmführer, or whatever.</span> <span id="s791">You know, he was in... How many...he had on.</span> <span id="s792">And she said, "You know who is ...who is responsible for all the war?"</span> <span id="s793">And he was surprised, and said, "Who?"</span> <span id="s794">And she said, "The bicyclists and the Jews."</span> <span id="s795">And he said, "But why the bicyclists?"</span> <span id="s796">And she said, "Why the Jews?"</span> <span id="s797">You know, and he was laughing, "Ha, ha, ha."</span> <span id="s798">You know, it's a big joke.</span> <span id="s799">And meantime, the selection was over and the camp was saved.</span> <span id="s800">You see, that's how we could do.</span> <span id="s801">There was no other way.</span> <span id="s802">Just by tricking and being courageous.</span> <span id="s803">And our motto was: "We are just going once through the chimney, sooner or later.</span> <span id="s804">But 'til we arrive, we have to help each other."</span> <span id="s805">And that's how we helped each other.</span> <span id="s806">And often there was cases, like ... Like I told you, people were sick, you tried to help them.</span> <span id="s807">You had tried to steal some medicine and give them.</span> <span id="s808">But then I myself fell into it; because being always in touch with those sick people, I also got typhoid.</span> <span id="s809">High fever.</span> <span id="s810">My tongue was like the... Did you ever see a chicken stomach from inside, when you open it, how rough it is?</span> <span id="s811">So rough was my tongue.</span> <span id="s812">I had high temperature.</span> <span id="s813">I couldn't eat.</span> <span id="s814">And my stomach, I had to run.</span> <span id="s815">And no medicaments.</span> <span id="s816">The only thing what I wanted is tomato.</span> <span id="s817">Where to got tomato?</span> <span id="s818">But then a group of girls was working for the Germans--they call it Rajsko,TPPT in a garden.</span> <span id="s819">And endangering her life, she brought a tomato in under her dress.</span> <span id="s820">Because we been so flat anyway.</span> <span id="s821">So you didn't... And she brought a tomato, and with that I rubbed my tongue.</span> <span id="s822">And then what I was asking, it was lemonade.</span> <span id="s823">Where to get lemonade?</span> <span id="s824">But one girl was working in the SS canteen, for the SS.</span> <span id="s825">She was... And so the girls told her, "Can you steal a bottle?"</span> <span id="s826">She said, "I can't, but I will.</span> <span id="s827">If they catch me, I know I'll go to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s828">But maybe, if I'm lucky, I..</span> <span id="s829">.</span> <span id="s830">I save her."</span> <span id="s831">So she did.</span> <span id="s832">And she managed to steal a bottle, and she brought it and I was drinking that.</span> <span id="s833">Another girl, she said, "I can't give her any medication.</span> <span id="s834">But I can steal some tablets to strengthen her heart.</span> <span id="s835">That's all what I can give."</span> <span id="s836">So that's what was.</span> <span id="s837">And the other thing was because I became blind, and I became bli...deaf and I couldn't walk.</span> <span id="s838">So how can I..</span> <span id="s839">.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q: (Cough)</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: How can I op...</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: (Coughing)</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: And how can I existed?</span> <span id="s844">So one of the girls told to the other girl, "Can you, after work, do a night duty?</span> <span id="s845">And so Magda could rest under the name that she is doing night duty.</span> <span id="s846">I'm going to steal potatoes.</span> <span id="s847">And when you come home, I will cook potatoes so you can strengthen up.</span> <span id="s848">And so Magda will be lying as she is on night duty."</span> <span id="s849">And as high temperature I had, she was telling me that hundred times: "You are on night duty, you are on night duty, you are on night duty.</span> <span id="s850">And when the SS man comes and he probably will see you in bed like the others, then you tell...you can jump out from bed if he wants you to."</span> <span id="s851">And there was a special SS man, who was the biggest sadist what you can imagine.</span> <span id="s852">And he just couldn't see some nice girls and they didn't...he didn't want them to survive.</span> <span id="s853">And by off chance, all the girls caught typhoid.</span> <span id="s854">And the girls was lying, because they couldn't get up.</span> <span id="s855">And he came and they was on bed.</span> <span id="s856">But we didn't expect him to come, because he had no reason to come there.</span> <span id="s857">Because there was SS man in charge of our barrack.</span> <span id="s858">So he came.</span> <span id="s859">And all the girls--young girls, beautiful--yesterday they was healthy, but today they caught the typhoid and high temperatures.</span> <span id="s860">So they was in bed.</span> <span id="s861">They all went to gas chambers.</span> <span id="s862">When he came to me, so I..</span> <span id="s863">.</span> <span id="s864">You know, the sur...surviving is such a power that I said, in very quick German, that "I am on night duty, but if you want I jump out from bed..." So he said, "Shut up!</span> <span id="s865">Hold your tongue!</span> <span id="s866">You bloody Jewess!"</span> <span id="s867">But that saved my life.</span> <span id="s868">Saved my life.</span> <span id="s869">But I still couldn't walk, and I couldn't hear.</span> <span id="s870">So when the counting was, so they just dropped.</span> <span id="s871">Like, like a sa... like a doll, because I was limp.</span> <span id="s872">But um...and in this time, charge, you know, of barracks was a German woman, a prisoner.</span> <span id="s873">And she said, "I can't cover up for her.</span> <span id="s874">I must send her into the gas chambers like these others.</span> <span id="s875">She can't work.</span> <span id="s876">She's no good for nothing."</span> <span id="s877">But one of the girls says, "Listen, I tell you what.</span> <span id="s878">I can sew.</span> <span id="s879">If you bring me needle, thread and material, I will sew you beautiful dresses, whatever.</span> <span id="s880">Just give her a chance to...to...to be ali...to get better.</span> <span id="s881">And she will get better."</span> <span id="s882">So she said, "Alright.</span> <span id="s883">But you look after her.</span> <span id="s884">It's your responsibility.</span> <span id="s885">If some SS man comes and sees her and he says, 'To the gas chambers!</span> <span id="s886">,' off she goes."</span> <span id="s887">So she said, "I will take that chance."</span> <span id="s888">So she sewed her, and she let me stay.</span> <span id="s889">And so it was one more day and one more day.</span> <span id="s890">But what happened, there one day they decided that new arrivals are coming and they need the space.</span> <span id="s891">So they told us we have to go out from the camp.</span> <span id="s892">And there was a big empty paddock with nothing on, just snow and freezing.</span> <span id="s893">And there we had to stay all day.</span> <span id="s894">I couldn't walk.</span> <span id="s895">So two girls from each side, they took me here by my hand and they carried me.</span> <span id="s896">And my head, legs was dangling; and they carried me and they pinched me that when SS man came I shouldn't say something.</span> <span id="s897">Because I didn't see.</span> <span id="s898">I didn't hear.</span> <span id="s899">I just could talk.</span> <span id="s900">So they pinched me so I knew I should be quiet.</span> <span id="s901">And so they carried me like that outside; and one of the girls...and this is how we helped each other.</span> <span id="s902">She managed to get a bottle somewhere and she put tea in the bottle; and in that um what we got the food, it was a round dish.</span> <span id="s903">She put the bottle in the dish, and she put it here.</span> <span id="s904">As I said, we been so flat so it didn't made any difference.</span> <span id="s905">Can you imagine that I was so flat I didn't have anything?</span> <span id="s906">Nothing, just bones.</span> <span id="s907">Nothing, just bones.</span> <span id="s908">Nothing...breast, no.</span> <span id="s909">Anyway, so they took me there.</span> <span id="s910">And there was a rock.</span> <span id="s911">They put me on the rock.</span> <span id="s912">And from time to time, they gave me a sip of water I shouldn't freeze to death [on the] rock.</span> <span id="s913">And then they carried me a little bit around, and put me on the rock again.</span> <span id="s914">Now what happened: on the way back, they...a lot of girls froze to death there.</span> <span id="s915">And they was dead or half-dead.</span> <span id="s916">And the rest, when we came in, they selected seventy percent out of the girls--good or bad--to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s917">Lucky, the girls from both sides which carried me, they been in better shape so they didn't saw me in between.</span> <span id="s918">Which saved me.</span> <span id="s919">And now we knew why they did it, because new arrivals from all different part of the world came.</span> <span id="s920">From Belgium, from France, from Holland.</span> <span id="s921">And so they needed the space.</span> <span id="s922">That's how they made the space.</span> <span id="s923">First they tortured them to death, and then they send them to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s924">And um that was our existence.</span> <span id="s925">That was our existence.</span> <span id="s926">And I, by off chance, I had...I was in charge from time to time in all nationalities I had.</span> <span id="s927">Jewish and non-Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: Explain what were you in charge of.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: First I was the... How you say?</span> <span id="s930">A vice...like a vice, vice president you have.</span> <span id="s931">So it was a block oldest [NB: Blockältester], and I was either the...like the vice um oldest or I was just um helping to bring the food, and block...</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: An assistant block...Blockältester.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s934">That was for a while I was doing that.</span> <span id="s935">And funny thing, the way I tried to handle people... One of the girls who didn't know, she said, "Magda, you handle always people like... like they would be in the kindergarten.</span> <span id="s936">Like you would be a kindergarten teacher."</span> <span id="s937">I didn't tell anybody I am.</span> <span id="s938">But I tried to help them.</span> <span id="s939">I tried to talk to them, and encourage them.</span> <span id="s940">When what happened one day, you know, they selected people and they didn't send them straight away to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s941">They collected them in one of the barracks, which was Number 25.</span> <span id="s942">And when it was full--and also outside the barrack, because it was a big fence built around them.</span> <span id="s943">Because from beginning, it wasn't a fence and some girls they run through the fence.</span> <span id="s944">Even it was um like nails on the top, but somehow they run through.</span> <span id="s945">Because they wasn't really so bad, so they run through.</span> <span id="s946">So they made a fence all over.</span> <span id="s947">So now they let also on the floor sitting those girls awaiting 'til the trucks will come.</span> <span id="s948">And it was hot and no water, and their face was swollen up.</span> <span id="s949">And it was just...their their eyes was....it was just two spots and a nose.</span> <span id="s950">And it is... it is... I tell you, the heart was breaking.</span> <span id="s951">And I was...I, I saw it.</span> <span id="s952">So I volunteered.</span> <span id="s953">I said, "Let me go in."</span> <span id="s954">I asked.</span> <span id="s955">"I am going to to give them water."</span> <span id="s956">They said, "Are you crazy?</span> <span id="s957">If SS man sees you, you go!"</span> <span id="s958">"So I go with them.</span> <span id="s959">But I can't see those people suffer before the last minutes, being so swollen and and dying for a..</span> <span id="s960">.</span> <span id="s961">for a drop of water, in that terrible heat without having anything on their head or protecting."</span> <span id="s962">So I took, you know, a dish and a cup; and I went from one to one.</span> <span id="s963">And I said to myself, "If I die with them, I die.</span> <span id="s964">But I can't...can't see it.</span> <span id="s965">At least, the last moment."</span> <span id="s966">They been so grateful.</span> <span id="s967">They knew they are going to die, but they said, "At least we have a little water."</span> <span id="s968">And you know, the selection was done in a terrible way.</span> <span id="s969">Like sometimes it was a sickness which is not even a sickness.</span> <span id="s970">It is just like a scratching.</span> <span id="s971">You call it "kretze," you know?</span> <span id="s972">It was also an implanted thing.</span> <span id="s973">But they knew about it.</span> <span id="s974">So they let the woman undress totally naked; and when somebody had a little mark of scratch, in they went to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s975">Then later, I..</span> <span id="s976">.</span> <span id="s977">I became a block oldest.</span> <span id="s978">And in every barrack, there was a SS man responsible for that barrack.</span> <span id="s979">And he had the right every day to make selection himself.</span> <span id="s980">Even so that many people went to work, but some was staying home because either they didn't needed them or they was not well; so they was at home.</span> <span id="s981">And that SS man made the selection again.</span> <span id="s982">So I said, "How could I stand by and see him selecting the people, my own friends and bro...and sisters?"</span> <span id="s983">So I arranged the girls so that in the front and in the back was a strong girl, and everywhere; and in the middle was the weaker ones.</span> <span id="s984">And I pushed the girls together.</span> <span id="s985">'Cause usually you had to stand so that you can go through, here and there, and here and there.</span> <span id="s986">And he said, "Do you think I don't know why you're pushing the girls so much in together?</span> <span id="s987">So I couldn't walk through, I shouldn't see that they are sick or weak woman which I have to send to crematorium."</span> <span id="s988">And I said, "Yes, that's why I did it.</span> <span id="s989">But I'm going to tell you something.</span> <span id="s990">They are not so sick that a few days at home wouldn't...they wouldn't recover.</span> <span id="s991">They just need a little rest."</span> <span id="s992">"So, and what are you going to do?</span> <span id="s993">How...how you want to do that?</span> <span id="s994">," he says.</span> <span id="s995">So I said, "I tell you how.</span> <span id="s996">(Pause - drinking water) I want to do something good for Germany."</span> <span id="s997">"What you mean, 'good'?"</span> <span id="s998">(Pause) I said, "You know how many um shoes are lying around, and how many dresses are discarded everywhere?</span> <span id="s999">Lying around in heaps, and not...nothing happen to them.</span> <span id="s1000">And those can be recycled."</span> <span id="s1001">"What you mean, 'recycled'?"</span> <span id="s1002">I said, "Washed and dried.</span> <span id="s1003">And those girls can do it.</span> <span id="s1004">All the shoes," I said, "could be gathered and washed and dried and band together.</span> <span id="s1005">And while they are doing that, they will recover."</span> <span id="s1006">"Where are they going to do it?"</span> <span id="s1007">I said, "In the back in the barrack, there is a wash room.</span> <span id="s1008">And they can wash there.</span> <span id="s1009">I will look after them.</span> <span id="s1010">I will get some string where they will dry the clothes, and they will dry the shoes.</span> <span id="s1011">And it's recycled, you can use it again.</span> <span id="s1012">And the good things, you can send to Germany.</span> <span id="s1013">That's a..</span> <span id="s1014">.</span> <span id="s1015">a service, isn't it?</span> <span id="s1016">Give me that chance!"</span> <span id="s1017">And he says, "Have it.</span> <span id="s1018">If you want to bother with that, go on.</span> <span id="s1019">Bother."</span> <span id="s1020">I said, "Thank you."</span> <span id="s1021">And I established that, that they was in the back doing what I said.</span> <span id="s1022">And I tried to...you call it "organize" food.</span> <span id="s1023">I said to the girls, the... Next to the kitchen, it was um onions and potatoes.</span> <span id="s1024">And woman was peeling it; and there was a fence clo...around it.</span> <span id="s1025">Not Jewish girls do that, because it was too good for Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s1026">Jewish girls would survive there.</span> <span id="s1027">So they gave it to the Polish girls.</span> <span id="s1028">But you know, one way or another, you make a eye contact; and when nobody sees... So we told them, "Throw some potatoes close to the fence.</span> <span id="s1029">And in the evening when nobody's there and the SS man is out, so we will pull that before...between the fence out, the onions and the potatoes.</span> <span id="s1030">And we will in this way help each other."</span> <span id="s1031">And some of the girls could do miracles.</span> <span id="s1032">They could cook from...from nothing.</span> <span id="s1033">From nothing.</span> <span id="s1034">They could um peel the potatoes; and they found some dish and they made holes in it and they (laughter) mashed it up.</span> <span id="s1035">And then they, somewhere from the kitchen--also from...from Polish girl--they got flour.</span> <span id="s1036">And they mixed it up and they boiled it.</span> <span id="s1037">And it was food.</span> <span id="s1038">Additional food.</span> <span id="s1039">So you see, little things like that made a difference in helping, somehow.</span> <span id="s1040">And some girls who worked outside and digging the potatoes out, sometimes... Again, it was dangerous.</span> <span id="s1041">If they catch you with one onion, one potato: death.</span> <span id="s1042">But they did it.</span> <span id="s1043">They brought the potatoes.</span> <span id="s1044">Everyone brought one potato or two, and so they helped somehow.</span> <span id="s1045">How long, nobody had a guarantee; because came the selection was so often happening.</span> <span id="s1046">So often.</span> <span id="s1047">Some...and if...if it wasn't...if it wasn't then, they punished you this way or the other way, or...or beat you up.</span> <span id="s1048">I tell you a sample.</span> <span id="s1049">A nice girl--she was blond and blue eyes--and she was working.</span> <span id="s1050">SS man came to her.</span> <span id="s1051">"I show you blue eyes!"</span> <span id="s1052">And he took the revolver...not the revolver, the big one.</span> <span id="s1053">How you call that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: Rifle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: The rifle.</span> <span id="s1056">And beat her so long that he beat her to death.</span> <span id="s1057">And he says, "Now you can have blue eyes!"</span> <span id="s1058">And things like that happened very often.</span> <span id="s1059">Or they say, "Would you run there and there.</span> <span id="s1060">And bring me that, my cap."</span> <span id="s1061">And while she was running and doing the order, he shot her.</span> <span id="s1062">For nothing.</span> <span id="s1063">So like ...like I told you, I was from time to time chosen from one function to another.</span> <span id="s1064">I didn't want to; but when the SS said, "You are going to be block oldest," there was no excuse.</span> <span id="s1065">You said, "No," right... So you been.</span> <span id="s1066">And now it depended on you.</span> <span id="s1067">You could...and you tried to do the best you could.</span> <span id="s1068">Not everyone could.</span> <span id="s1069">A sixteen year old girl in charge for thousands hungry, tired, sick girls, to keep order... Because order has to be, you know.</span> <span id="s1070">The German order has to be.</span> <span id="s1071">And if it wasn't, so she went to the gas chambers because she couldn't manage.</span> <span id="s1072">But they didn't consider that she's sixteen years old, and how can you manage?</span> <span id="s1073">Not everybody could manage.</span> <span id="s1074">And cases like that was many, many.</span> <span id="s1075">And um I had um... When I came in charge, so I had Czech not Jewish girls from Beneš--he was President of Czechoslovakia.TPPT The whole family came there.</span> <span id="s1076">Then I have Polish woman, non-Jewish woman.</span> <span id="s1077">And that costed me terrible much, because they had typhoid and they had diarrhea.</span> <span id="s1078">And being on the third bunk, how can you run down with diarrhea to get to the toilet who was so far?</span> <span id="s1079">It's impossible!</span> <span id="s1080">So, first of all, um with the girls I choose from the girls on the new arrivals a few who would be my helpers.</span> <span id="s1081">So I said, "We have to do something."</span> <span id="s1082">So we steal some ...it was wooden boxes.</span> <span id="s1083">And we cut a hole in, and we put a like...what you...what you carrying food in it...a bucket.</span> <span id="s1084">We put the bucket in so they could relieve themselves.</span> <span id="s1085">But some couldn't even walk down.</span> <span id="s1086">So what they did, the poor girls, in that dish--which is not even nice to say--what they had for food, they finish themselves there.</span> <span id="s1087">And they threw it through the window out; because windows was broken.</span> <span id="s1088">There wasn't windows, good windows.</span> <span id="s1089">So they threw it out.</span> <span id="s1090">But imagine, then came the sun.</span> <span id="s1091">And that was terrible.</span> <span id="s1092">So I found out that in back of the barrack, there is a certain clay where the gypsies used to make their houses to cover it from.</span> <span id="s1093">So I said, "A good idea!"</span> <span id="s1094">Then I approached one day a man who delivered all...for the Kommandant woman.</span> <span id="s1095">And I..</span> <span id="s1096">.</span> <span id="s1097">when nobody saw me, I said, "Please bring me two whitewash, and two..." How you say?</span> <span id="s1098">Where the beer is in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: Kegs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: Kegs of beer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: Big kegs, big... How you call them?</span> <span id="s1103">I don't know the expression in this moment.</span> <span id="s1104">He said, "How you want me to?</span> <span id="s1105">Where do I get it?"</span> <span id="s1106">I said, "I don't care."</span> <span id="s1107">"How will I get it in?"</span> <span id="s1108">I said, "You're delivering for the kommandant.</span> <span id="s1109">So if...if somebody asks, it's for her."</span> <span id="s1110">"But what happen if they say, 'It's...it's not for her'?"</span> <span id="s1111">"Then you tell it's for me.</span> <span id="s1112">Then I have the responsibility."</span> <span id="s1113">But, somehow, he went through.</span> <span id="s1114">He put it down.</span> <span id="s1115">The girls quickly grabbed it and took it in.</span> <span id="s1116">And during the night, the one group... Yah, we steal some um leather and sticks, and rags which we covered the stick on.</span> <span id="s1117">And they did that outside with that mud, which had the color of um...nearly color of the bricks; and the windows, and inside the girls did it with the whitewash.</span> <span id="s1118">I thought I will disinfect the barracks.</span> <span id="s1119">And I had already that here, and maybe it will help a little.</span> <span id="s1120">But I didn't realize what I am doing.</span> <span id="s1121">In the morning, they got up and here is the barracks standing with white windows.</span> <span id="s1122">Can you imagine that?</span> <span id="s1123">Oh!</span> <span id="s1124">They run.</span> <span id="s1125">You know, they say, "We are going to shoot you, hang you, because you are going to give signs for the...for the Americans: 'So here is a camp.'</span> <span id="s1126">You know what you doing?</span> <span id="s1127">You are doing the worst thing, and for that is punishment.</span> <span id="s1128">Not in the gas chambers, but punishment.</span> <span id="s1129">First punished, punish and then hanged too.</span> <span id="s1130">But first you will get it."</span> <span id="s1131">So I thought, "What I am going to do?"</span> <span id="s1132">And meantime, I..</span> <span id="s1133">.</span> <span id="s1134">that SS man who...you know, who was in my barrack when I did the ...what I did with the washing, he was in another barrack.</span> <span id="s1135">And by one occasion, when he was in my barrack, some girls was so grateful.</span> <span id="s1136">So from rags, they made me two dolls.</span> <span id="s1137">You know the...I don't know if you know in America, but in Europe it was like um long legs, long hands, with black velvet.</span> <span id="s1138">And here it had the pointed um head, and the face was white and pointed.</span> <span id="s1139">And it was such a doll.</span> <span id="s1140">And they made me that.</span> <span id="s1141">I don't where they got the material and whatever, because the impossible was possible.</span> <span id="s1142">And they put it on my bed.</span> <span id="s1143">And I said, "My goodness!</span> <span id="s1144">What I am going to do with that?</span> <span id="s1145">They found it, so then I am in trouble and they are in trouble: where did they get it."</span> <span id="s1146">So I thought myself, "Be smart.</span> <span id="s1147">Give it to him as a present."</span> <span id="s1148">So I ...when he came in, I said, "You are probably going one stage home.</span> <span id="s1149">Take it to your wife as a present.</span> <span id="s1150">She will be very pleased."</span> <span id="s1151">He said, "Oh, that's beautiful.</span> <span id="s1152">That's a good idea!</span> <span id="s1153">I really was thinking what to get to my wife.</span> <span id="s1154">That's what I am going to take."</span> <span id="s1155">And he forgot to punish me.</span> <span id="s1156">So...but what now I use the opportunity.</span> <span id="s1157">So I approached him, and I said, "You know what, they want to hang me, but first to punish me and...and get...beat me up and so on.</span> <span id="s1158">But what I did, I do it for some hygienic reason."</span> <span id="s1159">And I said, "And I did for you, too."</span> <span id="s1160">"How you mean?"</span> <span id="s1161">"Because you and the other SS who are coming to the camp, and they are approaching the bad barracks where the typhoid is, they will get it, too."</span> <span id="s1162">She [NB: he] said, "Don't tell anybody.</span> <span id="s1163">Just recently five SS man died on typhoid."</span> <span id="s1164">First I thought myself, "Oh, let them go.</span> <span id="s1165">Why only us?</span> <span id="s1166">Let them be ill, too."</span> <span id="s1167">But on the other side, he said, "Hold on."</span> <span id="s1168">So I hold on; and he went to the SS men commanders.</span> <span id="s1169">'Cause that was the woman commanders.</span> <span id="s1170">The man commanders; and he explained that "What she's doing is really for..." Not on...not for us, so much as for them, because they are coming to the barracks.</span> <span id="s1171">So they was talking in favor of me.</span> <span id="s1172">And now they came back, and you know what?</span> <span id="s1173">"The commander says that you are in charge.</span> <span id="s1174">And you will have to tell all others that they have to do the same thing what you doing...what you did."</span> <span id="s1175">"Oh, my God.</span> <span id="s1176">Did I have...did I need that?</span> <span id="s1177">," I said.</span> <span id="s1178">But I was running around; and when I came to the barrack where that was the 25th barrack--where all they was selecting to the death--so he said, "Are you crazy?!"</span> <span id="s1179">Because there was a huge wall around, and you know how much work it has to do to paint that, too.</span> <span id="s1180">So he said, "Are you crazy?!</span> <span id="s1181">I'm going to...to listen to a bloody Jewess, she has crazy ideas?"</span> <span id="s1182">And I said...announced my number, I said, "Would you be so kind and ask the commander?"</span> <span id="s1183">He looked at me.</span> <span id="s1184">He didn't say a word.</span> <span id="s1185">And so... But what happened: now the women was very mad at me.</span> <span id="s1186">And they wanted to kill me, and now the men saved me.</span> <span id="s1187">They have to punish me somehow.</span> <span id="s1188">So what happened: in this stage, the experimental barrack opened in Auschwitz, in Barrack 10.</span> <span id="s1189">TPPT So they said, "Alright.</span> <span id="s1190">They saved your life.</span> <span id="s1191">But in you go, in the experimental block...barrack.</span> <span id="s1192">But you will be in charge of the barrack."</span> <span id="s1193">So I ask straight away, "But could you give me also help, because I can't manage."</span> <span id="s1194">"Ah, take yourself!"</span> <span id="s1195">So I said, "Sixteen girls."</span> <span id="s1196">And I quickly named girls which are... they working outside, and I knew they won't last long.</span> <span id="s1197">So I took those girls with me.</span> <span id="s1198">And I went to the that barracks, which was the windows--that was the only women barrack in the men camp.</span> <span id="s1199">So they close...the windows was all with shutters and wire wiring.</span> <span id="s1200">So we couldn't look out, and they couldn't look in.</span> <span id="s1201">And we been closed up.</span> <span id="s1202">And a SS woman was there all day with us.</span> <span id="s1203">And the food was delivered 'til the door and--by men--and the woman took over.</span> <span id="s1204">But when I arrived there...so Hauptsturmführer Doctor Wirths,TPPT whose brain child this idea was, he came and he said to me... I was blond and short cropped hair.</span> <span id="s1205">My hair grew a little bit.</span> <span id="s1206">And I was slim, naturally.</span> <span id="s1207">And he said, "You are not Jewish, are you?"</span> <span id="s1208">And I said, "Yeah, I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s1209">Like all others."</span> <span id="s1210">"There must be a mistake."</span> <span id="s1211">He said, "There must be a mistake.</span> <span id="s1212">You don't act like Jewish.</span> <span id="s1213">You don't look like Jewish.</span> <span id="s1214">You don't behave like Jewish.</span> <span id="s1215">You'll stand up for yourself.</span> <span id="s1216">There is a mistake."</span> <span id="s1217">And he said, "And what are you from profession?"</span> <span id="s1218">I said, "Kindergarten teacher."</span> <span id="s1219">"That proves it!"</span> <span id="s1220">(Laughter) Incredible!</span> <span id="s1221">That proves it!</span> <span id="s1222">Why?</span> <span id="s1223">Why does that prove it?</span> <span id="s1224">So now I saw that he wants this way.</span> <span id="s1225">So I said, "If you want that to be a hospital, then we need blankets and then we need bed covers, sheets and towels and soaps.</span> <span id="s1226">And even nightgowns."</span> <span id="s1227">I told myself, "Now he's going to give me a kick in my pants!"</span> <span id="s1228">But he said, "Alright.</span> <span id="s1229">You can have everything, and it will be delivered today.</span> <span id="s1230">But the nightgowns will come tomorrow."</span> <span id="s1231">You see?</span> <span id="s1232">And now, because I managed to do that, so every SS man told that I am his protegée.</span> <span id="s1233">I didn't do anything for him, and I didn't even try to make a nice face opposite.</span> <span id="s1234">But that was written I am his protegée.</span> <span id="s1235">And um now I tell you, you know, because it's a tragicomedy.</span> <span id="s1236">Those girls was there in the barracks to choosen for the experiments.</span> <span id="s1237">So I thought to enlighten their life a little bit.</span> <span id="s1238">I said, "As the nighties come, you are not going to pick and choose.</span> <span id="s1239">If it's a small nightie and a big woman, she has it or worse.</span> <span id="s1240">And they can't exchange it."</span> <span id="s1241">And then they are walking down from the step down.</span> <span id="s1242">So imagine, with those miserables as they been, it was a laughter.</span> <span id="s1243">Because a tall woman had a nightie coming here (showing hand on thigh) and (laughter) and a small woman had a nightie coming there (showing hand on ankle).</span> <span id="s1244">So I said, "Don't laugh!</span> <span id="s1245">This is the fashion parade."</span> <span id="s1246">And then it gave me idea that, matter of fact, now where we are closed up--because the SS woman went away.</span> <span id="s1247">Um, she was there 'til lunch time counting, and then she went.</span> <span id="s1248">So we been locked up.</span> <span id="s1249">So I said, "Is there anybody who is um like a little bit in the theater, or knows something?</span> <span id="s1250">Dancing, acting, whatever.</span> <span id="s1251">And we will make theater in the evening."</span> <span id="s1252">And that's what we established, a little group.</span> <span id="s1253">And nobody was there.</span> <span id="s1254">We was sitting down, and somebody was performing.</span> <span id="s1255">But I tell you what.</span> <span id="s1256">I didn't last there long either.</span> <span id="s1257">Why?</span> <span id="s1258">Because I..</span> <span id="s1259">.</span> <span id="s1260">First of all, I must tell you that that um about the experiments, closer I can't tell you.</span> <span id="s1261">Because I wasn't a nurse.</span> <span id="s1262">I just checked which experiments are the least dangerous, there I will put more people.</span> <span id="s1263">So the sterilization was not so dangerous; because a doctor said to me that is his idea, and that Dr. ClaubergTPPT stole the idea for him before he finished it.</span> <span id="s1264">So he...even if it's not pleasant, what they still will be able if they survive, to have children.</span> <span id="s1265">But they didn't survive, from other reason.</span> <span id="s1266">But then, naturally, they made also a very bad experiments.</span> <span id="s1267">Brutal experiments, without any anesthetic.</span> <span id="s1268">Terrible!</span> <span id="s1269">And the girls suffered.</span> <span id="s1270">And the radiation they made.</span> <span id="s1271">And I tell you, it's terrible.</span> <span id="s1272">And when they finished with the experiments, they send them to Birkenau where they didn't last long.</span> <span id="s1273">Because now they been sleeping in bed and had a blanket and had a towel.</span> <span id="s1274">And they even if they suffered, but they had a little bit and like could look after themself.</span> <span id="s1275">And there was nurses which could help them a little.</span> <span id="s1276">But that, they didn't survive.</span> <span id="s1277">So even, like I said, the sterilization wasn't so bad.</span> <span id="s1278">But they didn't survive when they... When it was the experiments was ready they sent in; and they are not needed anymore, and then send them away.</span> <span id="s1279">What...</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: Can you tell us something about the women in the experimental barracks, people there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: No.</span> <span id="s1282">I tell you one case.</span> <span id="s1283">Um they picked some woman which they made mask.</span> <span id="s1284">And they said...they said the Jewish race is minor below the Aryan race, and they want to prove it somehow.</span> <span id="s1285">So they took the mask, and then they said they are going to send them to a sanitorium where they will have a good life and the doctors will making certain experiments on it.</span> <span id="s1286">They closed the women up in a room, and they give the key to me because I was in charge of this barrack.</span> <span id="s1287">Like I told you, the protegée of Dr. Wirths.</span> <span id="s1288">But suddenly... And they supposed to come at nighttime, twelve o'clock, to pick them up.</span> <span id="s1289">Suddenly a girl pick...um knocked on the door.</span> <span id="s1290">She said, "Please, let me out.</span> <span id="s1291">I don't believe they are sending us to the sanitorium.</span> <span id="s1292">Because how can they make to prove that our brain is not good?</span> <span id="s1293">They have to kill us first.</span> <span id="s1294">So this is not a sanitorium.</span> <span id="s1295">It is a certain camp where they will kill us first, and then from our brain they will make the experiments."</span> <span id="s1296">So she said, "Let me out."</span> <span id="s1297">So I let her out.</span> <span id="s1298">Another one knocked.</span> <span id="s1299">She said, "I have a sister here.</span> <span id="s1300">I want to be with her.</span> <span id="s1301">Please let me out."</span> <span id="s1302">I let her out.</span> <span id="s1303">Closed the door.</span> <span id="s1304">I didn't think what will be the after effect of it.</span> <span id="s1305">I let her out.</span> <span id="s1306">And, naturally, when they came, they didn't think that the um amount is not proper.</span> <span id="s1307">But when they put them on the train coming to that camp where they did that--they killed them and they made.</span> <span id="s1308">Later I found out.</span> <span id="s1309">But after the war I found out; not during the war.</span> <span id="s1310">So they counted up two are missing.</span> <span id="s1311">And they said, "You know what you did?</span> <span id="s1312">This is sabotage!</span> <span id="s1313">What right did it give you to take the girls out?</span> <span id="s1314">You know what you are going to get for it?</span> <span id="s1315">You are going to be punished, and you are going to be hanged or shot!"</span> <span id="s1316">And in 11, Barrack 11, was a man named Jacob who was the hangman.</span> <span id="s1317">But he was a Jewish man and a very good-hearted man.</span> <span id="s1318">But sometimes, he couldn't help it.</span> <span id="s1319">He had to do it.</span> <span id="s1320">Otherwise, they kill him.</span> <span id="s1321">And he send a message to me.</span> <span id="s1322">He said, "Magda, I will do it in the quickest way."</span> <span id="s1323">So I was prepared.</span> <span id="s1324">And they send me to the Politisch Abteilung.</span> <span id="s1325">That means the "Politisch [NB: Political] Department."</span> <span id="s1326">A woman came to pick me up.</span> <span id="s1327">And there was Aumeier.TPPT He was a small man with a husky voice, who was a brute.</span> <span id="s1328">Who came under his hand, with his own hands he murdered him on the spot.</span> <span id="s1329">Whoever it was.</span> <span id="s1330">And she said, "Goodbye, Madga.</span> <span id="s1331">I know you are not going to survive that.</span> <span id="s1332">Because he will tear you to pieces like he does with the others."</span> <span id="s1333">What can I do?</span> <span id="s1334">So we said goodbye.</span> <span id="s1335">But I came in; and he said, "What are you thinking, Staatskriminal ...?!"</span> <span id="s1336">You know, and made him... I said, "I did what I was asked for, and I think I did a good thing."</span> <span id="s1337">He say, "What!?!"</span> <span id="s1338">And he screamed, but he didn't touch me.</span> <span id="s1339">I can't believe it, even today not.</span> <span id="s1340">He didn't touch me.</span> <span id="s1341">So I told myself, "Who did it?"</span> <span id="s1342">Then I thought, "That's the work of Hauptsturmführer Doctor Wirths.</span> <span id="s1343">He did it.</span> <span id="s1344">He wanted to frighten me.</span> <span id="s1345">And he wanted to please the woman [NB: SS women commanders], you know?</span> <span id="s1346">But he didn't kill me.</span> <span id="s1347">And what happened once, with Hauptsturmführer Wirths, there in the barracks was... in the um experiment barracks, was a lot of Greek girls.</span> <span id="s1348">And I tried to help them; well, because either you try your best or you you don't care.</span> <span id="s1349">But I cared.</span> <span id="s1350">Wherever I could, I helped.</span> <span id="s1351">So they were so grateful that, again I don't know where they got it, they made me two pillows.</span> <span id="s1352">Hand-made pillows.</span> <span id="s1353">And they put it on my bed.</span> <span id="s1354">The same story.</span> <span id="s1355">What do I do with two pillows?</span> <span id="s1356">If somebody sees it: "Where did you get it?</span> <span id="s1357">Who made it?"</span> <span id="s1358">So they will be in trouble.</span> <span id="s1359">I will be in trouble.</span> <span id="s1360">So one day, Hauptsturmführer Wirths came in.</span> <span id="s1361">And he left the door open and his car was standing before.</span> <span id="s1362">I ran for one minute out.</span> <span id="s1363">I threw the pillows in, and I run back.</span> <span id="s1364">And I didn't say a word.</span> <span id="s1365">He didn't say a word for weeks.</span> <span id="s1366">But then he came and he asked me the same question.</span> <span id="s1367">"What did you do?</span> <span id="s1368">Didn't you do what, now what this for that punishment for what you did?"</span> <span id="s1369">I said...I said the same thing to that, to him.</span> <span id="s1370">And he just said so much: "The pillows was very nice."</span> <span id="s1371">So much is said.</span> <span id="s1372">And I came to the barrack, and the girls didn't believe I am alive.</span> <span id="s1373">And you know, I don't know if you know this is U[tilam (ph)]U, you know?</span> <span id="s1374">The girls was praying U[tilam (ph)]U for that that I survived; because they loved me so much and I helped them so much.</span> <span id="s1375">But that didn't help me for long.</span> <span id="s1376">Because one day Grese--the "Angel of Death" they call her, but I had experience with her before--came to pick me up.</span> <span id="s1377">And "You are coming with me."</span> <span id="s1378">And I said, "Where I am going?"</span> <span id="s1379">She said, "You are just coming."</span> <span id="s1380">I didn't know where I am coming.</span> <span id="s1381">And I don't know...you know what's a bunker is?</span> <span id="s1382">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1383">There was a bunker under the earth which was so big that four woman could stand next to each other like sardines.</span> <span id="s1384">My punishment was... The woman couldn't stand it that the men saved me again, so they wanted to punish me.</span> <span id="s1385">So I had the punishment: seven nights to stand there all night, then to be on the call-- the Zählen Appell [NB: Census roll call]--and then punishment was to clean all the la...toilets or latrines.</span> <span id="s1386">I wouldn't survive one day, because standing there and then the roll call for hours.</span> <span id="s1387">I..</span> <span id="s1388">.</span> <span id="s1389">I was... You know, one minute I would be finished.</span> <span id="s1390">And now to clean all the toilets.</span> <span id="s1391">But, you know, there was a certain um... You know, news travel.</span> <span id="s1392">And the men who was working in the camp, they found out while I got this punishment.</span> <span id="s1393">So they came to my rescue.</span> <span id="s1394">They said, "You lie down here, and we will do your work.</span> <span id="s1395">When SS man comes, then you will get up.</span> <span id="s1396">Pretend that you are working."</span> <span id="s1397">And that saved my life.</span> <span id="s1398">You see, this is what I mean, helping each other.</span> <span id="s1399">That was only the way that some, some--meaning from twenty thousand of us, a few hundred--survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">Q: At this point I want to pause, and we're going to change tapes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">UTAPE #3U</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s1405">We are on.</span> <span id="s1406">Would you tell me about...?</span> <span id="s1407">Tell us about Irma Grese.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1409">I met Irma Grese in beginning of my life in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1410">I mean, in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1411">From beginning...um it was...it must be August, September '42.</span> <span id="s1412">And I was a Stubendienst --a helper.</span> <span id="s1413">Not in my...stuben oldest, just like a little helper who went...carried the bread and the food.</span> <span id="s1414">And I went to um... and I needed always volunteers to that.</span> <span id="s1415">People who was working; and I asked them nicely, "Listen, I know it's very hard, because you're working hard.</span> <span id="s1416">But if we don't get the food, the bread, you won't have any.</span> <span id="s1417">And we can't...for so many, those few girls, they can't manage to... We've haven't got even time, because then it's the roll call and everything.</span> <span id="s1418">So, please come."</span> <span id="s1419">And I was talking to them on...where Grese was there, because she was in the...in the...where the bread was given out.</span> <span id="s1420">She was in charge as a SS woman.</span> <span id="s1421">She looked a chubby woman, young woman.</span> <span id="s1422">In my eyes, she was about eighteen, nineteen; with long blond pleats...plaits, chubby.</span> <span id="s1423">And she didn't even have the hat on.</span> <span id="s1424">And while I was talking, I was telling the girls, "Look girls, um I know it's very hard, but please do it.</span> <span id="s1425">And I will myself carry as much bread as you.</span> <span id="s1426">So let's do it nicely and quickly."</span> <span id="s1427">And while I was doing it every day, she called me and she said, "What's your name?"</span> <span id="s1428">I said, "Magda."</span> <span id="s1429">And she said, "I'm watching you, because you are talking to the people and you carry the bread.</span> <span id="s1430">You are different like the others.</span> <span id="s1431">You taking so much energy and time to...to encourage the people."</span> <span id="s1432">And I said, "I will do it to the last breath of my life.</span> <span id="s1433">If I can help, I do it."</span> <span id="s1434">And...and I said, "And what's your name?"</span> <span id="s1435">I forgot I am talking to the (laughter) SS woman.</span> <span id="s1436">And she said, "My name is Irma."</span> <span id="s1437">And I again said, "Nice to know you."</span> <span id="s1438">Then later, I said, "My goodness!</span> <span id="s1439">What are you, crazy?</span> <span id="s1440">You're talking to SS woman!"</span> <span id="s1441">But that did it, that I said to her.</span> <span id="s1442">And um so, for a while she was there and I was...and she, every time she was talking with me and asking me something.</span> <span id="s1443">And she pretended, that woman...you know, deceiving me.</span> <span id="s1444">She said that she didn't...part maybe was right.</span> <span id="s1445">She said, um, "I was um living in a small place, and suddenly they asked for volunteers.</span> <span id="s1446">But I didn't know where they are taking me.</span> <span id="s1447">So I volunteered, and here I am."</span> <span id="s1448">But later, I found out they first they took them to a place to brutalize them and prepare them to be brutal; and then she came.</span> <span id="s1449">But that I didn't know then.</span> <span id="s1450">Anyway, so we been in contact like that; and suddenly we lost touch about each other.</span> <span id="s1451">She went her way, and I went my way.</span> <span id="s1452">And later I found out that she was wanting to be somebody, suddenly.</span> <span id="s1453">And then one day I met her, and she was slimmed down.</span> <span id="s1454">She had her hair up and very nicely the cap on.</span> <span id="s1455">She had boots shining like glass, or silver or whatever.</span> <span id="s1456">And she had...in her boots, she had a whip and she had a belt with a pistol who was shining also like silver.</span> <span id="s1457">And she said, "Hello, Magda."</span> <span id="s1458">Nobody called me Magda, because I was for everybody number.</span> <span id="s1459">And I said, "Hello, Irma."</span> <span id="s1460">And I said, "Oh, but now you look dressed!"</span> <span id="s1461">And I said, "Shining like that, and like a real SS woman.</span> <span id="s1462">I hope I will never see you brutal like the others."</span> <span id="s1463">She didn't say anything.</span> <span id="s1464">She didn't say, "This is not your business," or...or "How dare you."</span> <span id="s1465">She just listened and went away.</span> <span id="s1466">Later, I found out that since she is like she is, she's riding out on a horse and going out to the Kommandos and with that whip she's whipping the girls.</span> <span id="s1467">And mostly she's whipping on the breast, because that is very sensitive part.</span> <span id="s1468">And often it breaks it.</span> <span id="s1469">And what is the end?</span> <span id="s1470">Death.</span> <span id="s1471">But I didn't know.</span> <span id="s1472">I found it out much later.</span> <span id="s1473">And then, what happened: the...I was working in a office [at] one stage.</span> <span id="s1474">I was so happy to work in the office, not to have that responsibility and to see the...all the cruelty.</span> <span id="s1475">Because there I was working on the U[karteaustaschs (ph)]U.</span> <span id="s1476">You know, the Germans are punctuality plus!</span> <span id="s1477">And I learned the, the... I had anyway a nice writing as you saw; and now even I made it even nicer.</span> <span id="s1478">And I was happy.</span> <span id="s1479">But one day, I heard the news that the Hungarian arrivals are coming from Budapest and from Hungary.</span> <span id="s1480">And one day I was called up by the commander replacing the commander-in-charge.</span> <span id="s1481">And he...she said, "You will be the Lagerältest in the new camp where the arrivals are coming."</span> <span id="s1482">So I said, "Oh, I am so happy here in, in where I am."</span> <span id="s1483">And she laughed.</span> <span id="s1484">She had teeth standing out like that, you know.</span> <span id="s1485">She said, "Oh, ho, ho, ho."</span> <span id="s1486">She said, "Oh, you are happy here, are you?"</span> <span id="s1487">She said, "But you are taking that.</span> <span id="s1488">You will be in charge."</span> <span id="s1489">And I said, "I don't know how to be a Lager oldest."</span> <span id="s1490">I said, "I never been one."</span> <span id="s1491">And she laughed with her teeth, and she said, "Where could you be?</span> <span id="s1492">There was never a camp...where there was a camp."</span> <span id="s1493">And the other reason was, I said because for the time being I heard that in this camp are men on one side.</span> <span id="s1494">And I'm so afraid that I got involved...I will get involved with some man for what is punishment there, and I don't want that.</span> <span id="s1495">She said, "About that, you don't have to worry.</span> <span id="s1496">We will watch you carefully."</span> <span id="s1497">Nothing helped me.</span> <span id="s1498">So...and there was the report um writer which I knew, and I approached her.</span> <span id="s1499">I said, "Please, U[Gatka (ph)]U. Don't let it happen.</span> <span id="s1500">I know how can you help all thousands and thousands people?</span> <span id="s1501">And when we really would, by any miracle survive, how many enemies will I have?</span> <span id="s1502">'Cause you can't help by the thousands.</span> <span id="s1503">Somebody...I, I didn't look nice or whatever."</span> <span id="s1504">So she said, "Look, this is not that the SS wants you.</span> <span id="s1505">But the underground wants you; because they know that you will try the best to save people, as many as you can.</span> <span id="s1506">And if there another woman comes there which is a sadist, she will have the pleasure to do it.</span> <span id="s1507">So there is no way.</span> <span id="s1508">They choose you.</span> <span id="s1509">The underground choose you.</span> <span id="s1510">You have to take.</span> <span id="s1511">And it's up to you how you will manage."</span> <span id="s1512">What can I do?</span> <span id="s1513">So they took me to the camp.</span> <span id="s1514">And the Lagerkommandant, KramerTPPT--which was a man of six foot six, with hands like that--he said, "Here you will be Lagerältest."</span> <span id="s1515">And I looked in.</span> <span id="s1516">There was empty barracks, nothing in it.</span> <span id="s1517">Not bed, no straw sack, no blankets, nothing.</span> <span id="s1518">And I said...clapped my feet and announced my number, and I said, "Lagerführer, please.</span> <span id="s1519">Here you want me to be, that next day or the Thursday you can call all the woman 'Jewish swines."</span> <span id="s1520">Because they're...where can they... they will sleep on top of each other, and they probably won't be able to go to the toilet and they will make on each other!"</span> <span id="s1521">So I said, "Why don't you send them straight away to the gas chambers?"</span> <span id="s1522">And I said...and he said, "Why you worrying so much about the other people?</span> <span id="s1523">Worry about yourself, that you take care of yourself!"</span> <span id="s1524">And I..</span> <span id="s1525">.</span> <span id="s1526">but wonder of wonders... Now I tell you, I don't know who was talking from my mouth.</span> <span id="s1527">I said again, that ceremony...I said, "If you, in reverse, would be in charge and you will be a Lager oldest; and the prisoners would be your fellow Germans and you wouldn't help them, I would call you 'Coward.'"</span> <span id="s1528">And I said it.</span> <span id="s1529">I said, "My goodness!</span> <span id="s1530">Magda, are you crazy?</span> <span id="s1531">Whom you talking?</span> <span id="s1532">This is the commander who whenever somebody he doesn't even like or who is just in his way, he grabs it by his neck, squeezes it a minute, throws them like a doll.</span> <span id="s1533">And he is killed.</span> <span id="s1534">And you telling him what is?"</span> <span id="s1535">But I stood straight, and I said, "Be strong, and don't move from this space."</span> <span id="s1536">And he looked at me, and he saw I am not shaking.</span> <span id="s1537">I am not crying.</span> <span id="s1538">I am not begging.</span> <span id="s1539">He says, "You know what?</span> <span id="s1540">You are right.</span> <span id="s1541">Tomorrow you will have what you want."</span> <span id="s1542">So I said, "I want beds.</span> <span id="s1543">I want straw sacks.</span> <span id="s1544">I want blankets.</span> <span id="s1545">I want um a utencils to eat; and I want spoons."</span> <span id="s1546">"OK.</span> <span id="s1547">Have it."</span> <span id="s1548">And I said, "And I want some woman who...who will be in charge.</span> <span id="s1549">In every barrack is thirty barracks, and I want some thirty girls which I can have which I want."</span> <span id="s1550">He says, "Have them!</span> <span id="s1551">Just tell them which one you want, and have them."</span> <span id="s1552">So again, miracle [of] miracles, they thought--you know, the news traveled--that I am the protegee of Kramer.</span> <span id="s1553">But that's nothing.</span> <span id="s1554">Never mind.</span> <span id="s1555">I couldn't do...I couldn't just save everybody.</span> <span id="s1556">I can't... couldn't, but where I could.</span> <span id="s1557">I was running up and down from morning to evening.</span> <span id="s1558">Where I could, I explained, I begged.</span> <span id="s1559">I..</span> <span id="s1560">.</span> <span id="s1561">I ...I watched the...the...the girls in charge.</span> <span id="s1562">I said, "You try your best.</span> <span id="s1563">If not, I personally punish you."</span> <span id="s1564">And I did.</span> <span id="s1565">I came in; and I saw that the girls didn't take care that they should have the proper kind of food.</span> <span id="s1566">And they was a little bit U[leger (ph)]U on it.</span> <span id="s1567">So I called them to the front where I ____.</span> <span id="s1568">And I said, "You are going..." There was water for in case there will be fire; so it was from that it would be taken, the water.</span> <span id="s1569">"Around that water," I said, "you are going to jump.</span> <span id="s1570">Because you are here for helping, not for making yourself comfortable.</span> <span id="s1571">You saw me running from morning 'til evening to the camp Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1572">You saw my feet um swollen like that.</span> <span id="s1573">You look at my face, how it's swollen.</span> <span id="s1574">You I picked and choose, and I took you out from maybe you wouldn't be alive.</span> <span id="s1575">So you do your duty.</span> <span id="s1576">And now this was a punishment.</span> <span id="s1577">I know you are my friends, and I know you will be angry at me.</span> <span id="s1578">But you will remember, because it's still better like a SS man would come in and something is not in order."</span> <span id="s1579">So that was it.</span> <span id="s1580">But this why I said I was so strict on my own friends.</span> <span id="s1581">But one girl um who who was a..</span> <span id="s1582">.</span> <span id="s1583">she could write poems, she got a paper and she wrote a long poem about me, to me.</span> <span id="s1584">That, you know, she appreciates that she knows what I am doing and it was wrong for them to be negligence, a little bit.</span> <span id="s1585">But, you know, persons is like that--if he can make himself the life easier, he is.</span> <span id="s1586">But not with me.</span> <span id="s1587">So one day Commander Kramer came... Because here was the women camp, there was a road and the next after the road was the main camp.</span> <span id="s1588">And often the woman husbands was in the camp.</span> <span id="s1589">And they just arrived.</span> <span id="s1590">So they screamed over to each other.</span> <span id="s1591">Or sometimes the man, if he had a chance to get something extra, so he put it in a piece of paper um in in a rock and he threw it over.</span> <span id="s1592">So...and he [NB: Kramer] found out that they are doing it.</span> <span id="s1593">So he put me in charge that I have to...Sunday when SS are not in, I have to watch it shouldn't happen.</span> <span id="s1594">So I have to watch next to the um fence.</span> <span id="s1595">I have to walk up and down.</span> <span id="s1596">But naturally I said to the girls, "When I am up, down you can talk.</span> <span id="s1597">And...but watch if you hear some automobile or whatever coming, or SS man."</span> <span id="s1598">So the little runners which we have watch it.</span> <span id="s1599">One day Kramer came.</span> <span id="s1600">All the girls disappeared.</span> <span id="s1601">And he said, "What are you doing here?"</span> <span id="s1602">I told myself, "You know, you put here in charge."</span> <span id="s1603">So I said--unbelievable--I said, "I am...I want to go to the theater, and I am thinking what I am going to wear.</span> <span id="s1604">I haven't got a dress.</span> <span id="s1605">I haven't got soap.</span> <span id="s1606">I haven't got a mirror.</span> <span id="s1607">I haven't got perfume, and all those things which needed to the theater.</span> <span id="s1608">That's what I am here standing and thinking about."</span> <span id="s1609">And you...would you believe?</span> <span id="s1610">And he said, "You are right!</span> <span id="s1611">Tomorrow morning, I am coming to pick you up.</span> <span id="s1612">And I take you there, and I get you all what you wanted."</span> <span id="s1613">And I came to the girls and I told them.</span> <span id="s1614">So, you know, the tragicomedy...they started to laugh.</span> <span id="s1615">"Magda, are you crazy?!"</span> <span id="s1616">I said, "What could I tell him?</span> <span id="s1617">Should I tell him I do the duty?"</span> <span id="s1618">And I thought...I said a very bad expression.</span> <span id="s1619">I said (laughter)...you know, and I said, "I am not going to satisfy that 'I am doing what...what you told me to be here,' because then I am a little crawling rat."</span> <span id="s1620">And I said, "No, I am not telling him.</span> <span id="s1621">I am telling him the impossible.</span> <span id="s1622">Tomorrow he will forget it, anyway," I said.</span> <span id="s1623">But you know, in the morning the runner came.</span> <span id="s1624">"Magda...Lagerältester, to the front!</span> <span id="s1625">Lager Commander Kramer wants you."</span> <span id="s1626">So I..</span> <span id="s1627">.</span> <span id="s1628">I arrived there.</span> <span id="s1629">I announced myself.</span> <span id="s1630">He said, "So here I am."</span> <span id="s1631">And I said, "But I need fifty people for this."</span> <span id="s1632">"Fifty people?"</span> <span id="s1633">And I said, "Yes.</span> <span id="s1634">Fifty people or nothing."</span> <span id="s1635">So he said, "Have them!"</span> <span id="s1636">So quickly I said to the runner, "Bring the fifty people in the fifth...by the five, five, five..." Whichever, whoever was the first fifty; and we went to the place that all the clothing was done.</span> <span id="s1637">I never been there before.</span> <span id="s1638">I was standing outside.</span> <span id="s1639">And I left the message through that they should prepare little...um it looked like... How could I say?</span> <span id="s1640">Like a big box, and in the front was two sticks and here through; and you could um carry it like...you could wheel it.</span> <span id="s1641">It was um... How could I say?</span> <span id="s1642">You know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1643">So I said, "Get me five of those trolleys, or whatever you call it.</span> <span id="s1644">And give the message all over they should put there soaps, towels, medicines, blankets, clothings, sweaters.</span> <span id="s1645">But pile it up to the full capacity."</span> <span id="s1646">And that's why I needed fifty; because to every one, ten woman would be able to to wheel it.</span> <span id="s1647">Alright.</span> <span id="s1648">It was all prepared.</span> <span id="s1649">Suddenly Kramer came, and you know he brought me antique little um...like in on the boudoir you have it.</span> <span id="s1650">It is a mirror coming here and back; and here two...two drawers.</span> <span id="s1651">And he showed me.</span> <span id="s1652">"Here you have the soap, the perfume, the lipstick, the comb, the brush.</span> <span id="s1653">Everything."</span> <span id="s1654">And on his hand, he had a most beautiful silk dress.</span> <span id="s1655">"And here is the silk dress.</span> <span id="s1656">Do you like it?</span> <span id="s1657">So now you have everything, and you can go to the theater.</span> <span id="s1658">Are you satisfied?"</span> <span id="s1659">I said, "Very much so."</span> <span id="s1660">And he pretended not to see the fifty woman.</span> <span id="s1661">And he...I said, "I take it."</span> <span id="s1662">He said, "No, I take it.</span> <span id="s1663">I told you I bring you, so I take you 'til your camp.</span> <span id="s1664">And then I give it to over to you."</span> <span id="s1665">And he came 'til the door, 'til the the place of the camp.</span> <span id="s1666">And then he said to...they're in charge, "Let the woman through, the fifty.</span> <span id="s1667">And when they are ready let them...the empty, and one with them is going to deliver those back.</span> <span id="s1668">And here now you can go to the theater."</span> <span id="s1669">So quickly we wheeled that in in one of the barrack where I've been.</span> <span id="s1670">It was a big foyer there empty, and I said, "Unload quickly the things, and um select the soaps."</span> <span id="s1671">And all...all the girls I..</span> <span id="s1672">.</span> <span id="s1673">I took which was there, the little runners, "Come on, quick.</span> <span id="s1674">Put the soaps here, the sweaters there, and then go outside.</span> <span id="s1675">Don't say anything, but put the people in the rows, always by the fifty.</span> <span id="s1676">Bring them in and discharge them, this...give everybody."</span> <span id="s1677">And I said, "Everyone has to save it on the bed who with him.</span> <span id="s1678">The soap, the towel.</span> <span id="s1679">One gets the towel.</span> <span id="s1680">One gets the soap.</span> <span id="s1681">One gets the..." You know, and like that; 'til we emptied everything.</span> <span id="s1682">And nobody should know about that.</span> <span id="s1683">It had to be done very quickly and very quietly.</span> <span id="s1684">No SS man saw it.</span> <span id="s1685">This was the second thing.</span> <span id="s1686">The third thing what he did: one day I should come to the front.</span> <span id="s1687">The Lagerkommandant is there with his black car, and he wants to discuss certain things with me.</span> <span id="s1688">So I come there.</span> <span id="s1689">Grese is...she became the Lagerführer of our camp.</span> <span id="s1690">The other side is Mengele; and here in the middle with the car is Kramer.</span> <span id="s1691">And he says, "Lagerältester, come and sit in the car.</span> <span id="s1692">I want to discuss with you some matters."</span> <span id="s1693">And I said, "But um Kommandant, please.</span> <span id="s1694">I am just a bloody Jewess.</span> <span id="s1695">Here is Dr. Mengele.</span> <span id="s1696">Take him in the car."</span> <span id="s1697">"Let him bloody walk.</span> <span id="s1698">And you come and sit in the car."</span> <span id="s1699">Grese heard that.</span> <span id="s1700">She didn't believe her eyes.</span> <span id="s1701">But you know, my status symbol went high; because she thought who knows what I have with the Kramer.</span> <span id="s1702">But I still said, "No, I better don't sit in.</span> <span id="s1703">It wouldn't look nice."</span> <span id="s1704">But, you know, this was a old car which outside it had like a stand on it.</span> <span id="s1705">I don't know if that cars are still in.</span> <span id="s1706">I said, "I better stand on it outside."</span> <span id="s1707">And I forgot one thing.</span> <span id="s1708">I forgot that I had the ring which the War...Warsaw uprising people made.</span> <span id="s1709">And they brought it in, in some miracle way.</span> <span id="s1710">And when they heard about me, how I am to the people, they donated me.</span> <span id="s1711">And that was also not a easy thing to bring in, and I just got the ring on.</span> <span id="s1712">So...and while I was, while I was standing I leaned with my hand on the car.</span> <span id="s1713">And he said, "What!</span> <span id="s1714">You are wearing a ring of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising before me?!"</span> <span id="s1715">And he grabbed a pistol.</span> <span id="s1716">"I am going to shoot your hand with the ring up!"</span> <span id="s1717">And I said, "I am in your charge.</span> <span id="s1718">Whatever you want, you can do.</span> <span id="s1719">I am just a bloody Jewess."</span> <span id="s1720">He looks at me and said, "Ah!"</span> <span id="s1721">He said, "Ah, get away!"</span> <span id="s1722">And he put the revolver back.</span> <span id="s1723">And all that, Grese saw.</span> <span id="s1724">So, you know, these are the unbelievable believable thing.</span> <span id="s1725">So now about Grese: like I told you, she became Lagerführerin in our camp.</span> <span id="s1726">And our contact was still the old contact.</span> <span id="s1727">When I became there in the camp, I gathered all the doctors from the camp, they should come to me.</span> <span id="s1728">And I said to..., "Now I am going to divide you.</span> <span id="s1729">In every barrack will be how many you are, two or three."</span> <span id="s1730">I can't remember, but minimum two.</span> <span id="s1731">"And you are watching, and you are going to help those people.</span> <span id="s1732">I am going to try to get some medicines, whatever.</span> <span id="s1733">We can't do miracles, but whatever.</span> <span id="s1734">But you watch; and especially watch the mostly for an epidemic."</span> <span id="s1735">And they said, "And what we are going to do?"</span> <span id="s1736">So I said, "What I am afraid is scarlet fever.</span> <span id="s1737">And what you doing with them, straight away came...come to me and tell me about it.</span> <span id="s1738">And that person who has that, put in the..." Back of barracks was a room which supposed to be a washroom, but they didn't finish it.</span> <span id="s1739">"So that will be the quarantine."</span> <span id="s1740">So, suddenly, all the doctors came that "We found two," "We found three."</span> <span id="s1741">"But now how to...we are to do with the counting?</span> <span id="s1742">," asked me the girls.</span> <span id="s1743">So I said, "Leave it to me."</span> <span id="s1744">So it was summer...hot.</span> <span id="s1745">Hot!</span> <span id="s1746">The sun was incredible shining, you know?</span> <span id="s1747">Like I said, if it was as Satan...Satan was there in this place, in...in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1748">So I approached Grese; and I said, "Irma, look.</span> <span id="s1749">Why should you run around in this hot weather and do the counting?</span> <span id="s1750">I am going to do the counting for you, and you be comfortable.</span> <span id="s1751">Sit down here in this room.</span> <span id="s1752">And the report writer, and I will announce her and she will count it up.</span> <span id="s1753">And when it's all right, then you..." "You are right."</span> <span id="s1754">But she said, "And what will do the Lagerkommandant in from the camp to mine camp?"</span> <span id="s1755">And I said, "Are you Lager um Führer of this camp?"</span> <span id="s1756">She said, "Yeah."</span> <span id="s1757">"Then you do what pleases you the best.</span> <span id="s1758">And she has nothing to say in your camp."</span> <span id="s1759">And she sat down.</span> <span id="s1760">And I sent the runners down, and they put the legs down on the bed, you know?</span> <span id="s1761">So it was easy to count.</span> <span id="s1762">And they counted, you know, like this.</span> <span id="s1763">They didn't go out, because then it would be missing.</span> <span id="s1764">So nobody knew about it.</span> <span id="s1765">And nobody should know about it.</span> <span id="s1766">It was kept secretly.</span> <span id="s1767">And so I did the counting for six weeks, 'til the scarlet fever is over.</span> <span id="s1768">The worst part is six weeks.</span> <span id="s1769">I did the counting, and Grese agreed with me.</span> <span id="s1770">And it was always the counting right, so she didn't have any excuse.</span> <span id="s1771">And that we saved thirty thousand people.</span> <span id="s1772">Why I am saying that, because there was a little camp across or across the road.</span> <span id="s1773">They called that camp "Mexico."</span> <span id="s1774">It was B..</span> <span id="s1775">.</span> <span id="s1776">zwei...drei, three.TPPT And there the scarlet broke out, and there wasn't so prepared.</span> <span id="s1777">And eight thousand five hundred--healthy or not healthy--all went to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s1778">So that's what it is what I am saying.</span> <span id="s1779">That you could be in function which was not very pleasant--because always a Damocles [NB: Sword of Damocles] was hanging over your head--but you had the chance to save people.</span> <span id="s1780">I saved the people some other way, too.</span> <span id="s1781">Mengele came to select and often I had to be present.</span> <span id="s1782">And he did it in the most unbelievable way.</span> <span id="s1783">He was whistling the Donau Waltz.</span> <span id="s1784">And he said (humming a bar of the Blue Danube Waltz), that means that went to the left.</span> <span id="s1785">(Humming the subsequent bar of the Blue Danube Waltz), was to the right.</span> <span id="s1786">(Humming from Blue Danube Waltz) And that was left, right, left, right--healthy, sick, that's how it came.</span> <span id="s1787">He didn't touch anybody.</span> <span id="s1788">He didn't!</span> <span id="s1789">But he just pushed them to the gas chambers good or bad.</span> <span id="s1790">So what happened: when he finished um like the selecting and he went away, so I run to the door.</span> <span id="s1791">And I don't know, I couldn't...I couldn't steal them all.</span> <span id="s1792">But I just came like...like I would be in charge of it, and I cut a certain part.</span> <span id="s1793">And I said, "Turn backwards, and with me march."</span> <span id="s1794">Nobody knew.</span> <span id="s1795">Nobody knew.</span> <span id="s1796">And I saved that woman.</span> <span id="s1797">Sometimes it was twenty.</span> <span id="s1798">Sometimes fifty.</span> <span id="s1799">Sometimes hundred.</span> <span id="s1800">Sometimes two hundred.</span> <span id="s1801">And back to life.</span> <span id="s1802">How long, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1803">But the most um thing with Grese was, that like I told you, before me she was good as gold.</span> <span id="s1804">So much so that even she introduced me her boyfriend.</span> <span id="s1805">She had the boyfriends galore.</span> <span id="s1806">She had the boyfriends, every day somewhere else.</span> <span id="s1807">Matter of fact, to point out, one day she came and she said, "Magda, I have in the main camp a man.</span> <span id="s1808">He's a prisoner, and I fall in love with him.</span> <span id="s1809">And I would love to visit him."</span> <span id="s1810">So I said, "Now, why don't you?</span> <span id="s1811">You are in charge.</span> <span id="s1812">Go to visit him."</span> <span id="s1813">She said, "No, that wouldn't look nice.</span> <span id="s1814">Because what I am doing there?"</span> <span id="s1815">So she said, "But you come with me."</span> <span id="s1816">I said, "I?"</span> <span id="s1817">I said, "Why?"</span> <span id="s1818">"Because then I make it official.</span> <span id="s1819">You are coming.</span> <span id="s1820">We have some...something to finish up.</span> <span id="s1821">And I put you there in the un like in the schreibstube."</span> <span id="s1822">In the... where the papers are done.</span> <span id="s1823">"You will be waiting there for me, so they think you have some... Nobody will check."</span> <span id="s1824">So I said to myself, "Oh, you give me U[there (ph)]U occasions!"</span> <span id="s1825">So I sent right away my runners; and I said, "Woman who has husbands in the other camp, write quickly.</span> <span id="s1826">We will organize some paper and pencils.</span> <span id="s1827">Write quickly a few words and give it to me; because I am going, say two o'clock or three o'clock, and I take it with me."</span> <span id="s1828">So I took the letters and I been there.</span> <span id="s1829">And I asked the man in charge there who was the writer... I said, "Look, you have the number of the barracks.</span> <span id="s1830">Please do me a favor.</span> <span id="s1831">When they catch you, I am.</span> <span id="s1832">But they won't probably ask you, because you just going like on official business.</span> <span id="s1833">Take it to them.</span> <span id="s1834">It's a letter from their wife, and if they... Take paper with you and pencil.</span> <span id="s1835">They just have to write one or two words, because we haven't got more time."</span> <span id="s1836">And so I was a delivery man.</span> <span id="s1837">A postman.</span> <span id="s1838">Just because she had that fantasy on a certain man.</span> <span id="s1839">So I show you that unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1840">She needed me, I should go with her.</span> <span id="s1841">So it was for a while I did it.</span> <span id="s1842">And she even introduced me another boyfriend, what I think about him.</span> <span id="s1843">If I agree with him.</span> <span id="s1844">She had every day another one.</span> <span id="s1845">I don't know why she did it.</span> <span id="s1846">But she asked me, "What you think?"</span> <span id="s1847">And he was a good looker--a tall, broad-shoulder.</span> <span id="s1848">And he didn't look like a cruel man to me; but um yet you never know.</span> <span id="s1849">So things like that she did.</span> <span id="s1850">But one day she was in camp, and suddenly the words was coming, the runners: "Magda, please!</span> <span id="s1851">Come quickly!</span> <span id="s1852">Quickly!</span> <span id="s1853">Grese got...Grese got...Grese got crazy."</span> <span id="s1854">"What is she doing?"</span> <span id="s1855">She's...with the whip, she's whipping the woman through the breast.</span> <span id="s1856">And it's opened all the breast, and it's blood running and the woman are crying.</span> <span id="s1857">Come quickly!"</span> <span id="s1858">So I said, "Oh, my goodness!</span> <span id="s1859">That vicious, vicious, vicious witch!</span> <span id="s1860">She had to do it when I am turned away?!"</span> <span id="s1861">So I came there, and I saw.</span> <span id="s1862">And I said, "Now you can be proud of yourself!</span> <span id="s1863">What did you do?</span> <span id="s1864">You know what you did?</span> <span id="s1865">Imagine somebody would do that to you!"</span> <span id="s1866">And I said, "And if I don't get quick help for them, tomorrow they are going...or in an hour in gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1867">Because they will get infected."</span> <span id="s1868">So I quickly sent some to the Revier, and they should at least give them First Aid.</span> <span id="s1869">And she lifted the whip on me.</span> <span id="s1870">So I said, "Go ahead!</span> <span id="s1871">Whip me!</span> <span id="s1872">You like to do it.</span> <span id="s1873">You like to do it for woman, especially on the...on the bust.</span> <span id="s1874">Do it to me!"</span> <span id="s1875">She looked at me, that I am standing there.</span> <span id="s1876">She put the whip down; and I said, "I am offended!"</span> <span id="s1877">And I walked away.</span> <span id="s1878">Would you believe it?</span> <span id="s1879">I didn't believe it myself.</span> <span id="s1880">And half an hour later, she came.</span> <span id="s1881">And I pretended that I am offended still.</span> <span id="s1882">And she said, "Forgive me."</span> <span id="s1883">She said, "Forgive me."</span> <span id="s1884">And the girls heard that.</span> <span id="s1885">She said, "Magda, I don't know, what you have a sypo...hypnotic um power over her or something?"</span> <span id="s1886">She [NB: I] said, "I don't want you to see it once more again, what you did before."</span> <span id="s1887">I didn't.</span> <span id="s1888">She did it somewhere else, but not before me.</span> <span id="s1889">Imagine.</span> <span id="s1890">Imagine.</span> <span id="s1891">So this so far I can tell you, she was the worse sadist ever been; and she wanted to be in very high.</span> <span id="s1892">You know, that how good she is, how brutal she over does all everybody.</span> <span id="s1893">And she looked million dollars, because she was very pretty.</span> <span id="s1894">And especially now, being always dressed--everyday immaculate shirts.</span> <span id="s1895">A matter of fact, a cousin of mine was...I put her in charge to work to wash her clothes, because in this way she was saved and she helped her.</span> <span id="s1896">And everybody was happy.</span> <span id="s1897">So every day, she was washing and ironing her shirts.</span> <span id="s1898">So she was starched collar and beautiful.</span> <span id="s1899">But um...but then people said what she can do, she was terrible.</span> <span id="s1900">She was terrible.</span> <span id="s1901">But um that's how we existed together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1902">Q: Did you know anything about Irma Grese's lesbianism?</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">A: I..</span> <span id="s1904">.</span> <span id="s1905">I knew.</span> <span id="s1906">I knew.</span> <span id="s1907">I knew about her lesbianism, because she wanted approach some of the girls in the...in our camp too.</span> <span id="s1908">But I, I heard about it.</span> <span id="s1909">So I said, "You can cleverly avoid it, because she has plenty other German woman and other woman.</span> <span id="s1910">But why should she use a Jewish woman to..." And especially she liked dark-haired woman.</span> <span id="s1911">She approach; and she told me that Grese came and she told her.</span> <span id="s1912">But, you know, you can um you can say it in such a way it's too obvious.</span> <span id="s1913">But I said, "You be very diplomatic about it, not to offend her much.</span> <span id="s1914">But you just say that you don't know.</span> <span id="s1915">Because you don't know that, because we don't know.</span> <span id="s1916">We never heard about it.</span> <span id="s1917">'And there many others who'd be willing, because you are so beautiful.'"</span> <span id="s1918">And so I know...I knew about it.</span> <span id="s1919">But um luckily she didn't try with me; and like I told you, I warned the girls because I heard she is.</span> <span id="s1920">She was having affairs one after the other, and even prisoner.</span> <span id="s1921">It didn't matter.</span> <span id="s1922">And one I was there...(laughter) That was a funny part.</span> <span id="s1923">When we been in the experimental block, from some...from no reason whatsoever--because she wasn't in charge of that--she came and she said, "Magda, came with me."</span> <span id="s1924">I said, "Why?"</span> <span id="s1925">"Because I like a man in this...I know in barrack.</span> <span id="s1926">And um I want to see him."</span> <span id="s1927">But you know what um the coincidence is and the irony is, when they delivered the food... I must say something.</span> <span id="s1928">I managed from Hauptsturmführer Wirths to ask that the girls had all day locked in, and they can go out and either to collect herbs or collect flowers and be a little bit on the fresh air.</span> <span id="s1929">And he said, "By all means."</span> <span id="s1930">You know?</span> <span id="s1931">And so the girls went out, and a herbalist came and they collected herbs.</span> <span id="s1932">And also they...also they always brought some flowers.</span> <span id="s1933">And they been an hour or so outside in the fresh air; and the food, when they delivered, the men--because they saw the girls out, so everybody picked one--and they... In the kettle, when they lift it up between the food, they put a little either packets of some special food, or just a letter or a little present.</span> <span id="s1934">And so a man send me letter on little parcel, and to...directed to me.</span> <span id="s1935">And this is the man she picked (laughter) for liking.</span> <span id="s1936">He wrote me love letters which was... Yeah, love letters!</span> <span id="s1937">He saw me just walking by.</span> <span id="s1938">I didn't...I didn't even see him.</span> <span id="s1939">He saw me.</span> <span id="s1940">But then I found out that who he is, because signed the name and we found out.</span> <span id="s1941">And one day, she said, "I want to go to this and this."</span> <span id="s1942">And now we faced each other with this man who was writing me those love letters.</span> <span id="s1943">And she said, "You wait here, Magda.</span> <span id="s1944">I am going with him.</span> <span id="s1945">And I will try if I can... You wait here outside."</span> <span id="s1946">She was waiting...I was waiting outside, and... But nothing came out of it.</span> <span id="s1947">I don't know how he got out of it; because he...he was um he was a Polish man, but he supposed to be um released.</span> <span id="s1948">So maybe that's why he, he um... I don't know how or what, 'cause I didn't um go in detail.</span> <span id="s1949">But um when she came out; and then in the next letter, he wrote me that she wanted him...to go with him.</span> <span id="s1950">But he... (laughter) he just didn't feel for her nothing, so... So he just wrote me.</span> <span id="s1951">I, I don't know if they went; probably they went.</span> <span id="s1952">I don't...but what, what that made difference?</span> <span id="s1953">He was...he writes me.</span> <span id="s1954">Alright, I took his word.</span> <span id="s1955">But I took with reserve his word, because he just wrote me letters.</span> <span id="s1956">So never he mentioned anyway.</span> <span id="s1957">So I tell you those... those things, you see, incredible.</span> <span id="s1958">Unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1959">This was Grese.</span> <span id="s1960">This was Grese.</span> <span id="s1961">She could talk to me like...like a friend; and the next minute she was a devil.</span> <span id="s1962">That...that's what she was.</span> <span id="s1963">A real devil.</span> <span id="s1964">A sadistic devil.</span> <span id="s1965">But she was so pretty, you know?</span> <span id="s1966">That's why they called her "Angel of Death."</span> <span id="s1967">That's about Grese; because I think that covers it, more or less.</span> <span id="s1968">Now...</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">Q: (Cough)</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">A: I want to tell you about a French woman, because that has also something to do with the experimental block.</span> <span id="s1971">One day, arrival of um...</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">Q: I just want to make time clear.</span> <span id="s1973">We're now going back to when you were in the experimental block?</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">A: No.</span> <span id="s1975">No.</span> <span id="s1976">I been in Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">Q: We're still in Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">A: I am in Birkenau, and I am going to the "Revier"--so-called Hospital--with some woman to get some medication.</span> <span id="s1979">Because we didn't dare to leave them here...there for long, because soon as the "Revier" was filled, they went over to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1980">So we are there, and suddenly we heard woman singing the Marseillaise.</span> <span id="s1981">And every...after two woman a police, an SS man with the... How you call it?</span> <span id="s1982">I forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">Q: With a rifle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1984">A: With a rifle.</span> <span id="s1985">And the whole camp had to turn to the face away from them, so not to get in touch with them or they were afraid we will make a revolution.</span> <span id="s1986">Ho, ho, ho.</span> <span id="s1987">But this is...suddenly the...the girl who was in charge, the report um writer, she was looking for me.</span> <span id="s1988">"Magda, Magda!</span> <span id="s1989">Where are you?</span> <span id="s1990">I need you."</span> <span id="s1991">I said, "Why you need me?"</span> <span id="s1992">"I want you to take those French woman over.</span> <span id="s1993">You will be in charge."</span> <span id="s1994">I said, "Oh, my goodness, leave me alone!</span> <span id="s1995">I am now in so hidden.</span> <span id="s1996">I want to have a little peace.</span> <span id="s1997">But what you want?"</span> <span id="s1998">"They are French woman.</span> <span id="s1999">They are all politisch.</span> <span id="s2000">They are writers.</span> <span id="s2001">They are um doctors.</span> <span id="s2002">They are nurses.</span> <span id="s2003">They are professionals.</span> <span id="s2004">They are... they all have red triangle, because they are politisch.</span> <span id="s2005">You want them to to get somebody who won't be able to handle them, and they should die or or take them to the chambers?"</span> <span id="s2006">So she said, "You take them."</span> <span id="s2007">But I said, "I don't know French."</span> <span id="s2008">You know, excuse.</span> <span id="s2009">She said, "Oh, my God, you don't know French!</span> <span id="s2010">You know 'essayez-vous,' or a few words.</span> <span id="s2011">(Laughter) I know that you went to gymnasium, so what you telling me?</span> <span id="s2012">And the rest, I leave it to you."</span> <span id="s2013">Anyway, nothing helped.</span> <span id="s2014">I went in charge.</span> <span id="s2015">First thing, I said, "Who is speaking German here?"</span> <span id="s2016">So it was Maria Elise.</span> <span id="s2017">She was a journalist, and she spoke German.</span> <span id="s2018">And I explained to her I didn't volunteer for that, and I don't want that position.</span> <span id="s2019">"And it's not a pleasure.</span> <span id="s2020">And the whole life here is not a pleasure.</span> <span id="s2021">But I am going to try to make your life as easy as possible, with your help.</span> <span id="s2022">We have to communicate.</span> <span id="s2023">We have to manage to help each other, because typhus is raving.</span> <span id="s2024">Um flies...lice are there.</span> <span id="s2025">Everything.</span> <span id="s2026">Try...um take the hygienic as possible, with all the little possibility as it is."</span> <span id="s2027">Because I..</span> <span id="s2028">.</span> <span id="s2029">for example, when I didn't...I couldn't wash.</span> <span id="s2030">So at night when the kettles from the tea was empty, so I emptied the left-overs from all the kettles and poured for that what was there.</span> <span id="s2031">From that I washed myself.</span> <span id="s2032">Somehow, I had to wash myself.</span> <span id="s2033">Because I knew how important is.</span> <span id="s2034">And wet.</span> <span id="s2035">Naturally, I didn't have a towel, too.</span> <span id="s2036">(Laughter) Anyway, so I told...I told her everything, to explain to them.</span> <span id="s2037">When is the roll call, then roll call.</span> <span id="s2038">When is to take food, then is taking the food.</span> <span id="s2039">Not to hesitate, because then they make life harder and I don't want to scream at them.</span> <span id="s2040">I don't want to be cruel to them.</span> <span id="s2041">And so they have to help me.</span> <span id="s2042">So they did.</span> <span id="s2043">What I did the first day, I said to them, "Tomorrow I am going to wake you up a little bit earlier because we are going to do exercises, because I believe that in healthy body is a healthy spirit.</span> <span id="s2044">And the moral [NB: morale] is very important."</span> <span id="s2045">And I got up with them.</span> <span id="s2046">And the rest said "Magda, that crazy Madga!</span> <span id="s2047">She thought that...(laughter) She's doing exercises.</span> <span id="s2048">She's getting up earlier.</span> <span id="s2049">She could be in bed a half an hour!"</span> <span id="s2050">So I said, "Never mind.</span> <span id="s2051">Never mind.</span> <span id="s2052">Let me be crazy," I said.</span> <span id="s2053">"I'm doing it."</span> <span id="s2054">So...and the girls was very appreciative.</span> <span id="s2055">And so much so that...that Maria Elise, she said ...after a while she said, "Tell me, Magda.</span> <span id="s2056">How could you survive being so human under such unhuman circumstances?</span> <span id="s2057">I don't believe I could.</span> <span id="s2058">I don't believe I could."</span> <span id="s2059">So anyway, now I just give you a little backwards, forwards.</span> <span id="s2060">After fifty years I found out her name is Maria Elise Cohen, and I found out her address.</span> <span id="s2061">And before I went away, I wrote her a letter.</span> <span id="s2062">Because, you see, it works and I have to run backwards and forwards.</span> <span id="s2063">It...it takes two to tango.</span> <span id="s2064">It's always working.</span> <span id="s2065">You help somebody, it gets back to you.</span> <span id="s2066">But I come back to that later.</span> <span id="s2067">Just remind me; because I want to tell you when I was in the Barrack 10, the experimental block.</span> <span id="s2068">So one of the girl...woman, of the French woman, was chosen to be a doctor for these experiments.</span> <span id="s2069">But she was the only one who refused to do unnecessary operations.</span> <span id="s2070">And she said...you know, like when we promise so to be a doctor, so we are helping the others.</span> <span id="s2071">And she's not going to do any operation which makes wrong.</span> <span id="s2072">And not anesthetic...without anesthetic.</span> <span id="s2073">If she can repair something which a woman has, that she do.</span> <span id="s2074">But not to make terrible things what they do.</span> <span id="s2075">So they said, "And you know what you are getting for it?"</span> <span id="s2076">"Whatever I getting, I am taking it."</span> <span id="s2077">So they said, "All right.</span> <span id="s2078">Now you are going to be placed in the Straf bunker... kommando."</span> <span id="s2079">Which means a "punishment kommando."</span> <span id="s2080">But her being a doctor--tall and slim--she wouldn't survive a day.</span> <span id="s2081">Because those sadists would just make a toy out of her, because she was so clumsy probably in this work what she has to do there.</span> <span id="s2082">So I got in touch--and it was always ways, unbelievable ways--to this woman who was in charge of report writer.</span> <span id="s2083">And I said, "Look, this woman, Doctor Adelaide Hautval, is on the way to go to this Kommando.</span> <span id="s2084">Please transfer her quickly somewhere else, because she won't survive."</span> <span id="s2085">So she transferred her...on the way coming, she transferred her to that Revier.</span> <span id="s2086">But the next day went a transport with French woman to Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s2087">So she added her quickly so nobody knew about her existence.</span> <span id="s2088">I didn't know about her existence for many years.</span> <span id="s2089">Once I been in Israel, and there is a forest on honor of people.</span> <span id="s2090">And I said to my husband, "Let me have a look there at trees."</span> <span id="s2091">He said, "There are hundreds of trees!</span> <span id="s2092">What are you going to look for?"</span> <span id="s2093">I said, "Never mind.</span> <span id="s2094">Just let me for one minute."</span> <span id="s2095">Because, you know, men are sometimes so impatient.</span> <span id="s2096">And the first tree I see is Dr. Adelaide Hautval.</span> <span id="s2097">The tree is donated from France on her honor.</span> <span id="s2098">I said, "Béla, Béla, come quickly!</span> <span id="s2099">Make a picture here."</span> <span id="s2100">And he made a picture of me, and there was Adelaide Hautval.</span> <span id="s2101">So meantime, I got her address from Dr. Lore Shelley.</span> <span id="s2102">I don't know if you heard about her; because she wanted to know our experimental block and I helped her.</span> <span id="s2103">And so I asked her, "Do you by any chance know the address?"</span> <span id="s2104">So she knew.</span> <span id="s2105">So I wrote Adelaide Hautval, and I sent her this picture.</span> <span id="s2106">And she was very pleased with that picture.</span> <span id="s2107">And she said that "I was surprised, because you looked so well.</span> <span id="s2108">So I wish you everything the best in the future."</span> <span id="s2109">And so...so we been in contact with each other, and unfortunately she died.</span> <span id="s2110">But the family of hers send me the announcement of her death, and so I sent my sympathy.</span> <span id="s2111">So you know, it's going backwards and forwards.</span> <span id="s2112">It's...somehow it's entwined.</span> <span id="s2113">And now if you want to know further on, I was there in the...in the Lager C;TPPT and some women went on transport.</span> <span id="s2114">They was chosen people who had good hands, in certain factories.</span> <span id="s2115">Who had good eyes, I had to bring always to the front because some specialists from this factory and this factory came.</span> <span id="s2116">And I had to um send out runners: Who had good eyes?</span> <span id="s2117">Who can see well?</span> <span id="s2118">Brought them there.</span> <span id="s2119">And he selected so many, and they went--who had good hands, they are good with the fingers.</span> <span id="s2120">And so lot of transport went; but unfortunately, a lot of people went to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s2121">Which I couldn't, by all my strength and influence, I couldn't... Because Eichmann was here.</span> <span id="s2122">Not I was the one who dictated the...the running of world.</span> <span id="s2123">Eichmann did.</span> <span id="s2124">Anyway, so the Lager finished abruptly; and Kramer came for me and he said, "Now, come with me.</span> <span id="s2125">I am going to take you and you are going to work hard."</span> <span id="s2126">I said, "Like all others."</span> <span id="s2127">"No, you are going to work harder."</span> <span id="s2128">So I said, "This is my fate.</span> <span id="s2129">I am going to work."</span> <span id="s2130">And imagine, he took me to the kitchen, and--the lager kitchen--and he announced to the SS woman um...um Schultz... No, I don't say the name because maybe it comes back.</span> <span id="s2131">And he said, "Here I bring you a new kapo of the kitchen.</span> <span id="s2132">She will be in charge."</span> <span id="s2133">And she said, "Fine."</span> <span id="s2134">Franz.</span> <span id="s2135">Did I said Franz before?</span> <span id="s2136">Franz.</span> <span id="s2137">Because we called her "Franzka."</span> <span id="s2138">Franzka.</span> <span id="s2139">And um she had a sister there, too.</span> <span id="s2140">She was working somewhere else.</span> <span id="s2141">And um I knew that there is a kapo, a German woman, who is a lesbian friend--you know, because you knew those things--of a Lagerältester.</span> <span id="s2142">A German woman with a red triangle.</span> <span id="s2143">And I said, "If I take the position of her lesbian friend, how she will handle the other woman?</span> <span id="s2144">Because she will be mad; and mad on...on innocent people."</span> <span id="s2145">So I said to her, Franz...I said, "Listen, I am not good in those things.</span> <span id="s2146">I wouldn't even know how to manage those things.</span> <span id="s2147">She is doing a very good job."</span> <span id="s2148">But I said, "I would rather do the counting out, the Lager office work.</span> <span id="s2149">I'm good in that.</span> <span id="s2150">I will count on the food.</span> <span id="s2151">How much, so many."</span> <span id="s2152">So she said, "But what will the Lagerkommandant Kramer says?"</span> <span id="s2153">I said, "He will be satisfied."</span> <span id="s2154">Like he would tell me, you know.</span> <span id="s2155">I said, "He will be satisfied."</span> <span id="s2156">So, in this case, he said, "Go and do the counting."</span> <span id="s2157">And I was in the counting; and another woman who used to be in the kitchen in the C, she was suddenly here and she didn't have what to do.</span> <span id="s2158">She said, "Can you help me somehow?"</span> <span id="s2159">So I said to Franz, to this SS woman Franz, "Listen.</span> <span id="s2160">There is so much work.</span> <span id="s2161">It's two camps to handle and a little bit too much for me.</span> <span id="s2162">Could I have another help?"</span> <span id="s2163">"Ah, have how many you need!"</span> <span id="s2164">"No," I said, "one will do.</span> <span id="s2165">And now I can count wonderful."</span> <span id="s2166">People didn't know why they suddenly got double portions.</span> <span id="s2167">(Laughter) Because I counted so many.</span> <span id="s2168">But it didn't last long.</span> <span id="s2169">With me, it never lasted.</span> <span id="s2170">I felt very comfortable there.</span> <span id="s2171">You know, we...we did the counting, and...and I was happy to know that people are happy.</span> <span id="s2172">Suddenly, they called my number to the front.</span> <span id="s2173">When you call the number to the front, that meant that you are going to the Politisch [NB: the Politisch Abteilung] and probably did something terrible, and they are going to kill you.</span> <span id="s2174">All the girls said goodbye.</span> <span id="s2175">They kissed me, hugged me.</span> <span id="s2176">And I went to the front; and here again Kramer with his black car.</span> <span id="s2177">And he said, "Sit in the car."</span> <span id="s2178">I sat in the car.</span> <span id="s2179">So now, he said, "Tell me what did you..." It's a German expression: "ausgefressen" [Trans: "chewed out" or "finished"; colloquialism] Which means, "what did you do wrong?"</span> <span id="s2180">What is special, more than wrong.</span> <span id="s2181">And I said, "I did always to the best of the people and the running of the camp."</span> <span id="s2182">And he repeated it hundred times, and hundred times I said the same thing.</span> <span id="s2183">And now when we went to...in the car, so if he would go straight then that means he would take me to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s2184">Suddenly, I see that he wents in.</span> <span id="s2185">And that was again to the Camp C, where I was.</span> <span id="s2186">Why I was afraid that when he said that "What did you do wrong," because I still had the letters which I didn't have time to deliver.</span> <span id="s2187">And I thought they found the letters, and now the punishment will be gas chambers.</span> <span id="s2188">But no...because he said, "Step out.</span> <span id="s2189">U[Ranken (ph)]U." And he said once more, "What did you ausgefressen?"</span> <span id="s2190">And I said, "I did to everything to the best of the camp and the people."</span> <span id="s2191">"Is that so?"</span> <span id="s2192">"Yes, that's so."</span> <span id="s2193">"So here you will be Lagerältester again, but you will have a Weberei."</span> <span id="s2194">That means, a Weaving [Room].</span> <span id="s2195">They...they will be weavers in the camp.</span> <span id="s2196">So I became again Lagerältester.</span></p> <p><span id="s2197">Q: We must stop.</span> <span id="s2198">OK.</span> <span id="s2199">The tape has run out...has ended.</span> <span id="s2200">We are going to break.</span></p> <p><span id="s2201">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s2202">UTAPE #4U</span></p> <p><span id="s2203">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s2205">We are back.</span> <span id="s2206">Um, Madga, would you tell us about being returned to Lager C?</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2208">As I mentioned it before, I was um returned by Kommandant um Kramer to Lager C. And there was a Weberei.</span> <span id="s2209">We been for a while there.</span> <span id="s2210">And in another Lager, in another camp next to us a..</span> <span id="s2211">.</span> <span id="s2212">It was emptied the camp.</span> <span id="s2213">And there was a Lagerführerin, her...her name Danz, was her... And she was a terrible brutal woman.</span> <span id="s2214">But the camp was emptied.</span> <span id="s2215">And also the girls, whom she was working with, um was free.</span> <span id="s2216">So she thought she will put me down, and she will put the other girls on and herself.</span> <span id="s2217">And she is push...and she pushes Grese out, too.</span> <span id="s2218">So, yah.</span> <span id="s2219">She came to the camp; and she says, "Magda, you are not Lagerältester anymore."</span> <span id="s2220">And she was watching me what I will say, I will beg for it.</span> <span id="s2221">But I said, "That's alright."</span> <span id="s2222">So she said I will be um somewhere in a barrack.</span> <span id="s2223">I accepted it.</span> <span id="s2224">And the other girls came on, with her together.</span> <span id="s2225">But she was even more brutal than...than Grese; because she was running like crazy all over the camp with the whip, and whipping left and right.</span> <span id="s2226">I was very sorry that is happening, but I had no way to stop her from it.</span> <span id="s2227">But there was a German um prisoner, and who was really a..</span> <span id="s2228">.</span> <span id="s2229">with a black triangle which he was a thief sometime.</span> <span id="s2230">But he was sitting many years there.</span> <span id="s2231">And he was saying there to a young girl, who he sometimes he rested in...in her barrack; because it was the last barrack on the camp, and he used to come with the kommando there.</span> <span id="s2232">And he had different privileges, so he asked if he could rest there.</span> <span id="s2233">And he told to that girl, "I will fix her!</span> <span id="s2234">Madga is coming back, and that's it!"</span> <span id="s2235">So it was really lasting three days.</span> <span id="s2236">And after three days, I was back.</span> <span id="s2237">Back again in the... like...like Lagerältester.</span> <span id="s2238">But it didn't last um very long, because it was coming already close to the march of January 18th [1945], when the death march started.</span> <span id="s2239">But...and may I..</span> <span id="s2240">.</span> <span id="s2241">?</span> <span id="s2242">Before I go with the death march, I have a few interesting things which I forgot.</span> <span id="s2243">First of all, in Lager C--the first time--it was in one...in two barracks was concentrated all the young girls who was from fourteen 'til about seventeen.</span> <span id="s2244">And in one of the barracks--and Mengele who couldn't, you know, stand such beautiful girls, Jewish girls, being there.</span> <span id="s2245">So just when one of the barracks was emptied, either part went on transport or the other part into the crematoria, he asked to transfer all the barrack from one block to Block 3.</span> <span id="s2246">And there, at night, they supposed to come for them to be gassed.</span> <span id="s2247">He put there, in the front of the barrack, a post man.</span> <span id="s2248">Not a post man--a SS man who was...he didn't have a big...a big function, you know?</span> <span id="s2249">Just a ordinary man, who should um be there on watch.</span> <span id="s2250">When I heard what happening, so I went together with the report uh writer of mine.</span> <span id="s2251">And I said, "What can we do to save those children?</span> <span id="s2252">After all, from no reason whatsoever, from there one day or 'nother they should be gassed.</span> <span id="s2253">This is our future, if there will be a world.</span> <span id="s2254">We need that generation!"</span> <span id="s2255">So I said, "You know what?</span> <span id="s2256">We are going to approach this man.</span> <span id="s2257">And we will have a little chat with him."</span> <span id="s2258">Because it was already after the "appell," the counting; and in the camp was no other SS man but him.</span> <span id="s2259">So I started to talk with him.</span> <span id="s2260">And I said, "How are you" and so so.</span> <span id="s2261">And he told me that he is going...tomorrow morning he is going to the Siberia, to the front.</span> <span id="s2262">I came with the news together, and said "Oh, here is our chance.</span> <span id="s2263">We have to do something."</span> <span id="s2264">So she said, "What?"</span> <span id="s2265">"We have to get somewhere a bottle of schnapps and make him drunk."</span> <span id="s2266">So we found a bottle of schnapps.</span> <span id="s2267">Matter of fact, at that girl's place where the German with the black triangle used to rest.</span> <span id="s2268">And he left a bottle, so next day he should drink.</span> <span id="s2269">We...we searched all the barracks 'til we came to that barrack, and there we find.</span> <span id="s2270">So I said, "Gerda, ..." She was...that was her name. "</span> <span id="s2271">...Go there with a cup and tell him, 'Have a little um drink.</span> <span id="s2272">Tomorrow you are going to the front.</span> <span id="s2273">Be a little bit merry.'"</span> <span id="s2274">So he had a little drink.</span> <span id="s2275">After a while, I went and offered him a little drink.</span> <span id="s2276">Again, Gerda.</span> <span id="s2277">The fourth time, I gave him the whole bottle.</span> <span id="s2278">I said, "Look, be merry!</span> <span id="s2279">What...you know what happens.</span> <span id="s2280">Forget the world."</span> <span id="s2281">He was already a little bit tipsy, so he didn't need much.</span> <span id="s2282">And when he drank the bottle, he fell asleep.</span> <span id="s2283">You know, he slammed down and fell asleep.</span> <span id="s2284">I said, "Gerda, that's our oppor...opportunity."</span> <span id="s2285">I went to the back of the barrack--which I told you there supposed to be like a wash room, but wasn't.</span> <span id="s2286">I knocked on the door.</span> <span id="s2287">They opened the door, and I said, "Shhhh..." And I put the girls down in the five, about hundred a time.</span> <span id="s2288">And then I just went, and I put the girls in every barrack.</span> <span id="s2289">I said, "You have hundred girls more tomorrow on your counting, and don't say anything."</span> <span id="s2290">And so by the hundred I took them, and I divided them all over the camp.</span> <span id="s2291">And we left.</span> <span id="s2292">When everybody was divided, we just left the barrack, closed the door; and we went to bed.</span> <span id="s2293">'Til today, we didn't know how it is possible that nobody was claiming the girls and nobody claimed anything.</span> <span id="s2294">If they killed the man, or they sent him to the Siberia anyway.</span> <span id="s2295">What happened, we don't know.</span> <span id="s2296">But one thing I know: that in this way, we saved the eight hundred girls.</span> <span id="s2297">And the eight hundred girl... Yah, just with that thinking how can we overcome and play out at Mengele.</span> <span id="s2298">Because I was so mad at him that he did it.</span> <span id="s2299">Anyway, but um later it was very interesting that... Um now I have to jump ahead.</span> <span id="s2300">On that death march when we been already um going towards Malchow,TPPT but I will come back to it.</span> <span id="s2301">So an SS man, in a orderly manner, approached me.</span> <span id="s2302">And I don't know from what reason he asked me, "What are you from profession?"</span> <span id="s2303">I said, "My goodness me!"</span> <span id="s2304">I said, "We are going to Malchow.</span> <span id="s2305">What do I need to have profession?"</span> <span id="s2306">"No, no.</span> <span id="s2307">I need, because I have forty young girls here.</span> <span id="s2308">And I want you to be in charge of the forty girls."</span> <span id="s2309">And that was a part of those forty girls.</span> <span id="s2310">Where the other girls are, I don't know; but I just recently heard that they are still... A few of them, I don't know where else or how many, are living in Israel.</span> <span id="s2311">So this is the one thing which I thought I will mention; because it was not such a easy thing.</span> <span id="s2312">How when we went to sleep 'til we woke up, we thought, "My goodness!</span> <span id="s2313">If they found out..." But they didn't, thanks heavens.</span> <span id="s2314">Then (cough) the other thing which I forgot.</span> <span id="s2315">In Birkenau, one um day I was called again to the front.</span> <span id="s2316">Always called to the front.</span> <span id="s2317">And the Lagerkommandant said to me that a Russian um village is coming here as an exchange for the Russian...for the German generals.</span> <span id="s2318">"And we found in the papers that you are a kindergarten teacher, so you will take over this whole um Russian village except the the woman between eighteen 'til thirty-five.</span> <span id="s2319">The rest--the little babies, the pregnant woman, the whole, the old ones--belongs... Um, you will take them over."</span> <span id="s2320">So I again open my mouth; and I said, "In this case, if I have to take over Russian village who has to be exchanged for Russian general, so I want."</span> <span id="s2321">And I put conditions.</span> <span id="s2322">I said, "I want them to be bathed daily.</span> <span id="s2323">I want them to have not to stand on the app...on the counting.</span> <span id="s2324">I want to pick um sixteen girls out from the Russian woman to be my helpers.</span> <span id="s2325">I don't want to them to stand "appell."</span> <span id="s2326">And I want them to get the food of the German SS."</span> <span id="s2327">You know, I was waiting; and I was thinking, "Madga, you crazy?!</span> <span id="s2328">What you are...(laughter) What you are asking?</span> <span id="s2329">Who are you to demand?"</span> <span id="s2330">And he said, "OK.</span> <span id="s2331">You get it."</span> <span id="s2332">And so I got the Germa...the Russian village, with the little babies to the old woman.</span> <span id="s2333">And, naturally, didn't take them long to find out that the...how the other people lived and how they lived.</span> <span id="s2334">So they um...really, they admired me; carried me around, took me to the...to the room.</span> <span id="s2335">And they said they will take me to U[batushka (ph)]U Stalin.</span> <span id="s2336">They take me to Russia to show me to Stalin.</span> <span id="s2337">Thanks very much.</span> <span id="s2338">I didn't know then (laughter)... I didn't know what Stalin is, anyway.</span> <span id="s2339">And so they stayed with me, and they was very grateful.</span> <span id="s2340">One thing, which is a cruel thing of the Germans; that one day they gathered all the children from about um four or six, and they send them to Germany.</span> <span id="s2341">And matter of fact, Grese, you see--who always was telling me things... She said, "You know where they going?</span> <span id="s2342">They are going to Germany, and they will be um...they will be given away to um the farmers, who hasn't got children, for adoption.</span> <span id="s2343">In a few years, they won't even know they are Russians.</span> <span id="s2344">And they, the parents, will have a new genera...new children."</span> <span id="s2345">Anyway, and um also anoth...another occasion, Grese told me, "You know why we are putting Jewish woman in charge?</span> <span id="s2346">With all the strength which you wouldn't want to, I know.</span> <span id="s2347">But imagine, if the war will be over and the Germans are losing, so they won't...they won't remember the SS.</span> <span id="s2348">But they ... Because they don't see them so often.</span> <span id="s2349">But they will remember those girls with whom they been everyday, and who had such a hard position, when they are so hungry, thirsty and tired.</span> <span id="s2350">And now comes a woman in charge; and maybe she raises her voice or demanding.</span> <span id="s2351">Her, they will remember!</span> <span id="s2352">And that's what we want.</span> <span id="s2353">We want to be unknown.</span> <span id="s2354">If we either um not succeed, but we do succeed."</span> <span id="s2355">I tell you, she said.</span> <span id="s2356">Anyway, this was the other thing.</span> <span id="s2357">And now um coming back, um... So that was the Russians.</span> <span id="s2358">I really did...um we went to U[bombard (ph)]U, and they had a beautiful food.</span> <span id="s2359">And imagine, the whole camp was saying, "Magda is crazy!</span> <span id="s2360">What she is doing, nobody can do that like her!</span> <span id="s2361">Demanded Russians should get the SS food, for the SS man!"</span> <span id="s2362">But anyway... Then we went on the march, which you heard it so many times displayed.</span> <span id="s2363">So I'm not going to details, only...</span></p> <p><span id="s2364">Q: I do want to hear your story.</span></p> <p><span id="s2365">A: You want to...?</span></p> <p><span id="s2366">Q: Yes I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2367">A: Yah, so when we went on the march.</span> <span id="s2368">So um before we went, so they broke in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s2369">And the girls, they took what they could; because they knew what...they didn't know how long the march will be and where they are going.</span> <span id="s2370">So they took some um salami, bread, margarine, sugar and salt.</span> <span id="s2371">And they went; but naturally who... The...the SS men was running away, because they knew the Russian are coming close.</span> <span id="s2372">So they...yah, they was rushing us with all the speed possible, because they didn't want to be caught by the Russians.</span> <span id="s2373">And anyone who...who moved down to fix her um shoes or bend down for something, they straight away um put her to death.</span> <span id="s2374">And my aim was: "Girls, we in the front."</span> <span id="s2375">Because in the back, they was shooting everybody.</span> <span id="s2376">And um the girls was carrying the...that we found there some rucksacks in the store room; and they, in the rucksacks they put the food.</span> <span id="s2377">But it was heavy to run and to carry; so slowly, they threw most of the food away.</span> <span id="s2378">And what I asked them to keep is margarine and sugar, because this time we thought that this is the source of energy.</span> <span id="s2379">And so we marched, and we came to Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s2380">Ravensbrück...um we been put on the floor, and there were just a huge tent.</span> <span id="s2381">And in that tent, we been in without food, on the floor--nothing, no mattresses, no blankets.</span> <span id="s2382">The situation was terrible.</span> <span id="s2383">I don't think...many, many um lost their life.</span> <span id="s2384">And I was very sick there.</span> <span id="s2385">But, you see, again the fate wanted something.</span> <span id="s2386">So I told you about the French woman who was so grateful to me, and there was in Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s2387">Because they was, like I told you, intellectuals; and they was working there in the offices.</span> <span id="s2388">They found out that the Birkenau girls arrived.</span> <span id="s2389">So... and they came to the tent, and they looked for Magda.</span> <span id="s2390">So they found me.</span> <span id="s2391">They took me to them, and they really brought me back to health.</span> <span id="s2392">And they...they let me have U[butna (ph)]U wash.</span> <span id="s2393">There they feed me.</span> <span id="s2394">They been...they gave me medicament.</span> <span id="s2395">And so, 'til we had to march, I just went to the roll call there.</span> <span id="s2396">Otherwise, I been always in their barrack.</span> <span id="s2397">(Cough).</span> <span id="s2398">When it was the time to march farther on, I was good again.</span> <span id="s2399">But on the march, (cough) suddenly the Germans, they drove us to a empty um...like where the trees are.</span> <span id="s2400">What is it?</span> <span id="s2401">A..</span> <span id="s2402">.</span> <span id="s2403">(cough) (Pause) Not a mountain, but where are the trees....</span></p> <p><span id="s2404">Q: The trees...the hills?</span> <span id="s2405">Trees, in the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s2406">A: Woods.</span> <span id="s2407">They...they... Yeah, thank you.</span> <span id="s2408">In the woods, and there was nothing.</span> <span id="s2409">It was snow and freezing...just was an empty...empty barrack there.</span> <span id="s2410">And they put us there, and they went away.</span> <span id="s2411">And we been finishing nearly with that little margarine and sugar, which I every day made a little bowl.</span> <span id="s2412">And I divided to everyone which the group which I had.</span> <span id="s2413">Like a hand with the little chickens.</span> <span id="s2414">I had always around me, you know, like a harem.</span> <span id="s2415">Whom I couldn't help everybody, but whom I could.</span> <span id="s2416">So it was getting to end, and we been very hungry.</span> <span id="s2417">And I was um, you know, dozing away in the weakness.</span> <span id="s2418">And suddenly I had a dream.</span> <span id="s2419">And in the dream, my mother came.</span> <span id="s2420">And she had a big dish, with fresh beautiful um cakes what you make for Saturday, you know?</span> <span id="s2421">From butter, butter and milk and little...round little cakes--like roll-types.</span> <span id="s2422">And I want to grab one in my dream, and she is pushing it always away.</span> <span id="s2423">And I said Mom, "I'm so hungry.</span> <span id="s2424">Why you taking it away?"</span> <span id="s2425">She said, "Because I want your promise."</span> <span id="s2426">And I said, "What is the promise?"</span> <span id="s2427">"Promise me when you marry and you will have children, you will bring them up as Jewish children."</span> <span id="s2428">And I, in my dream I said, "My goodness, Mom!</span> <span id="s2429">Where I am alive?</span> <span id="s2430">Where I am married?</span> <span id="s2431">Where I have children?</span> <span id="s2432">What you want that promise, when I am so hungry?"</span> <span id="s2433">She said, "You can't have it 'til you don't promise."</span> <span id="s2434">And so I said, "Alright, I promise."</span> <span id="s2435">In this moment, somebody's touching my shoulder.</span> <span id="s2436">And I open my eye.</span> <span id="s2437">And the Russian woman--like I told you, they been very good--and they already heard that in the woods are people from the um from Ausch...from Birkenau.</span> <span id="s2438">And they...and when she heard, she was working like a nurse in the SS hospital.</span> <span id="s2439">She made a big bowl of peeled potatoes, like potatoes in the peel.</span> <span id="s2440">She wrapped that all over in blankets, and she was going through the woods and was looking for me.</span> <span id="s2441">And she found me.</span> <span id="s2442">And she said, "Magda, I brought here food for you."</span> <span id="s2443">And this was when I was just reaching with my hands in my dream.</span> <span id="s2444">And here I have my hand like that, and she is petting.</span> <span id="s2445">And I open it, and here she offers the fresh boiled hot potatoes.</span> <span id="s2446">And we been...you know, it was the biggest delicacy.</span> <span id="s2447">And that really saved our life for a while again.</span> <span id="s2448">And so I say that it's never...like when you do something good, you never know when you are getting um repaid with some goodness again.</span> <span id="s2449">And that was it.</span> <span id="s2450">Then um we marched, um and we came to the place Malchow, like I said.</span> <span id="s2451">So I had the forty girls there.</span> <span id="s2452">But meantime, there was a girl who knew me um a few years ahead and she knew how I was.</span> <span id="s2453">So she said, "The forty girls can hand to somebody else.</span> <span id="s2454">But there is um many like thousands um woman, and they need somebody to take care of them."</span> <span id="s2455">So I was exchanged, and I became there again block oldest.</span> <span id="s2456">And again I was explaining the girls that we have to keep together.</span> <span id="s2457">We are to help each other, and we will survive.</span> <span id="s2458">"And...and I will try to do everything you should get food, and I will make sure that everybody...nobody is left over.</span> <span id="s2459">I divide the food evenly.</span> <span id="s2460">Whatever I have, you have."</span> <span id="s2461">And so it it was for a while.</span> <span id="s2462">And suddenly the news came that Danz is coming here.</span> <span id="s2463">So...and I saw her again with the whip running around the camp.</span> <span id="s2464">So I said, "Oh, my goodness!</span> <span id="s2465">What could we do to stop her?"</span> <span id="s2466">But she made the decision herself.</span> <span id="s2467">They needed a a woman who would um divide people to go to work; and they called Arbeitsdienst--"working in charge," or something.TPPT So um everybody wanted to be in that position, because it's not that bad position.</span> <span id="s2468">I didn't.</span> <span id="s2469">And she choose me.</span> <span id="s2470">She choose me.</span> <span id="s2471">So when she choose me, I [NB: she] said, "You know why I choose you?</span> <span id="s2472">Because I have a respect for you."</span> <span id="s2473">And I said, "Do you?"</span> <span id="s2474">"Yes.</span> <span id="s2475">You remember when I put you down as from Lagerältester, and pushed you down and you wouldn't be maybe alive now.</span> <span id="s2476">And you didn't for one moment say "Why," or beg at me that I should give you the position or nothing.</span> <span id="s2477">You just accepted and you been proud standing there.</span> <span id="s2478">And...and I have respect from you, that you weren't afraid and you didn't ask or you didn't bring me or you didn't want to bribe me, that all...that I should put you on.</span> <span id="s2479">So I..</span> <span id="s2480">.</span> <span id="s2481">I am picking you for that position."</span> <span id="s2482">So I said, "Now I have the chance!"</span> <span id="s2483">There was, you know, in all positions like that camp or prison, there is always that you are looking... reading from the palm and all things.</span> <span id="s2484">So while she got acquainted with me again, she told me all her story: about a brother she has in Siberia, and how she's worrying about him and all those things.</span> <span id="s2485">And I listened, and I said, "Now is my chance."</span> <span id="s2486">I looked for one of those girls who was also reading for my palms, and I told her the story about the Danz and her brother, and that.</span> <span id="s2487">I said, "You have to be very careful.</span> <span id="s2488">What you know the facts, but you don't have to make it obvious.</span> <span id="s2489">You have to just slowly, gradually... Because you have plenty time; because while you are occupying her, she's not trying...running around with the whip around."</span> <span id="s2490">So she went around.</span> <span id="s2491">And she um told her this and that.</span> <span id="s2492">But it finished up that, "Oh, your brother is worrying about you."</span> <span id="s2493">"What you mean?"</span> <span id="s2494">"Because he is in the Russian front."</span> <span id="s2495">"How you know?"</span> <span id="s2496">"I can see it in your hands.</span> <span id="s2497">And he is worrying you."</span> <span id="s2498">"What you mean, 'he is worrying you?'</span> <span id="s2499">You mean he's worrying that the war is to the end, and that I am like I am, doing that to the prisoners, and he is afraid that maybe I will get the punishment for it?"</span> <span id="s2500">And she said, "I don't know what you mean, but that's what is written in your hand.</span> <span id="s2501">That he is very worried, and he is really thinking on you with all his heart.</span> <span id="s2502">And he loves you so much, and he's caring for you and he's scared for you."</span> <span id="s2503">So, that did it.</span> <span id="s2504">Next... And I was keeping away, meantime; I didn't want to know.</span> <span id="s2505">And then she calls me, and she said, "Magda, this woman is wonderful.</span> <span id="s2506">Do you know what she told me?"</span> <span id="s2507">And that and that.</span> <span id="s2508">So she said, "You think I should stop going hitting people on... on the...with the whip?"</span> <span id="s2509">I said, "I don't know."</span> <span id="s2510">I said, "I don't know.</span> <span id="s2511">Um, is that your brother's wish?"</span> <span id="s2512">She said, "It seems to be."</span> <span id="s2513">So I said, "I leave it to you."</span> <span id="s2514">But it left her this way; but I thought maybe she would think it over, because... So I found somebody else.</span> <span id="s2515">There is...was a..</span> <span id="s2516">.</span> <span id="s2517">is a girl, she lives in Melbourne.</span> <span id="s2518">She's a very good portrait artist, not a professional but....</span> <span id="s2519">And I came to her the next day, before she has a chance to reading her whipping again.</span> <span id="s2520">And she said...I said to her that, um, "Oh, I have a very good um portrait writer ...um painter, who thinks you would be very good um to make a portrait about you."</span> <span id="s2521">"She...and she thinks I have the face for it?"</span> <span id="s2522">"Definitely!"</span> <span id="s2523">I said, "Definitely.</span> <span id="s2524">Would you like her to come, and...and she will make you a nice portrait.</span> <span id="s2525">It, it...she doesn't want anything.</span> <span id="s2526">Doesn't cost you anything.</span> <span id="s2527">You just have to sit and see.</span> <span id="s2528">If you like it, good.</span> <span id="s2529">If you don't like it..." But I knew she would like it.</span> <span id="s2530">So that was it.</span> <span id="s2531">I kept her from the street again.</span> <span id="s2532">And I said to her--Edith is her name--I said, "Don't rush with the...(laughing) with the painting.</span> <span id="s2533">But always show her your progress, because then she is interested."</span> <span id="s2534">And one day she told me, "You know, this girl.</span> <span id="s2535">She's very good.</span> <span id="s2536">She's doing a wonderful job.</span> <span id="s2537">I wonder when she finish?</span> <span id="s2538">I am really anxious to see how it will look."</span> <span id="s2539">And anyway, then I said, "You know, you better make it now quicker.</span> <span id="s2540">Because um that would not be good."</span> <span id="s2541">And...and so she finished the um portrait.</span> <span id="s2542">And she was very happy with it.</span> <span id="s2543">And you know what?</span> <span id="s2544">She never used the whip again.</span> <span id="s2545">And I was very happy because, you know, such a whip.</span> <span id="s2546">It wasn't just a whip.</span> <span id="s2547">With inside, it was uh like...like iron, you know, a certain thing.</span> <span id="s2548">It was...outside it was leather, but inside... When you got whipped with it, it really hurted.</span> <span id="s2549">Anyway, and meantime the war was getting closer.</span> <span id="s2550">And again they was rushing us out from the camp and they wanted to us to go closer...um deeper in Germany.</span> <span id="s2551">And on the way, it was...the population was moving backwards and forwards with their baskets and with their furniture and everything.</span> <span id="s2552">And suddenly some Russian girls arrived.</span> <span id="s2553">Because they found out that we are marching, and...and they thought I will be there.</span> <span id="s2554">And they knew that the Russian are coming close.</span> <span id="s2555">So suddenly they been there.</span> <span id="s2556">And they said, "Magda, we came to save you.</span> <span id="s2557">And we are going.</span> <span id="s2558">We are partisans.</span> <span id="s2559">We been partisans, and we know how to hide a person in the woods.</span> <span id="s2560">We will make like a little hut for you, and we will hide you.</span> <span id="s2561">Because when the Russian will come--which we have heard that they are very close--there, first of all, they will rape you all...um like not one, but all.</span> <span id="s2562">And then if somebody pointed that you been in function, then they will kill you.</span> <span id="s2563">And I want to have a chance...we want to have a chance to explain who you are, and then we take you out."</span> <span id="s2564">So first, I..</span> <span id="s2565">.</span> <span id="s2566">I was arguing; because I was the hand with that little chickens.</span> <span id="s2567">So I argued, and I said, "I want to take girls to hide."</span> <span id="s2568">She said, "Magda, you ask the impossible!</span> <span id="s2569">How...then we had to make a real...not a [place to] hide, a bungalow.</span> <span id="s2570">A bungalow!</span> <span id="s2571">So we can't do."</span> <span id="s2572">Anyway, on the end, three.</span> <span id="s2573">Three we managed, and they really hide us in the woods.</span> <span id="s2574">They made branches, and so we been inside like in a cocoon.</span> <span id="s2575">And the Russians soon arrived.</span> <span id="s2576">Meantime, before they arrived they um stopped in a..</span> <span id="s2577">.</span> <span id="s2578">Uh where ...where they made um flour.</span> <span id="s2579">No, how you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2580">Q: In a mill?</span></p> <p><span id="s2581">A: In a mill.</span> <span id="s2582">And in the mill, they was... They run away, the Germans; but there was a store room of everything what you think.</span> <span id="s2583">In the cellar: food, meat, everything.</span> <span id="s2584">They had supplies for years there.</span> <span id="s2585">Anyway, so they always brought us something to eat.</span> <span id="s2586">Meantime the Russian arrived.</span> <span id="s2587">And they settled in this mill, because it was so big.</span> <span id="s2588">And they settled in; and the girls, they used the opportunity to slowly brought them to the idea that...about me, and that how now they was explaining how I was to them and like a mother, like a this, like that.</span> <span id="s2589">And when that was explained, so they came to pick us up.</span> <span id="s2590">And when they came to pick us up, so they put us to the head table.</span> <span id="s2591">And, you know, was like personality plus I was.</span> <span id="s2592">And when I wanted to help to cooking, you know, how because there was a lot of... So he said, "No."</span> <span id="s2593">You know the Russians said, "Nyet."</span> <span id="s2594">You know how they said, "Nyet.</span> <span id="s2595">You sit down.</span> <span id="s2596">You have the celebrity.</span> <span id="s2597">You did a very important thing for our Russians.</span> <span id="s2598">Now the...let the others work."</span> <span id="s2599">So that was that.</span> <span id="s2600">But naturally they had to continue their journey; and we continued, too.</span> <span id="s2601">And then we came to a place, and um where all the Czechoslovakian people gathered.</span> <span id="s2602">And now they started to bring them with the trucks back to Czechoslovakia, 'cause it wasn't very far.</span> <span id="s2603">But I can't tell you the place, which is not important.</span> <span id="s2604">Anyway...but what happened: there was a lot of Hungarian girls, and the Hungarian girls went on the rampaging, you know, in the houses and... How you call it?</span> <span id="s2605">Um, stealing the jewelry and then the bed and carpets and everything.</span> <span id="s2606">So the Czech girls, they said um they are very upset about those girls and they don't want with those girls to go home.</span> <span id="s2607">First of all, the Russians wanted them to send to Siberia and to work, or to the harvesting.</span> <span id="s2608">So and they came to me: "Magda, listen.</span> <span id="s2609">They are sending us to harvesting!</span> <span id="s2610">We want to go home, and see what...if somebody is alive.</span> <span id="s2611">And we work enough.</span> <span id="s2612">We don't want again."</span> <span id="s2613">So I went to the commander; and I spoke by the time, you know, very well Russian.</span> <span id="s2614">And I told them, "They are not your enemies.</span> <span id="s2615">They... they been Jews.</span> <span id="s2616">That's why the um Hungarians threw them out.</span> <span id="s2617">Now you want them...to send them to work to Russia, because they are enemies of...of um...like of the Russians.</span> <span id="s2618">Like they are like friends with the Hungarian!</span> <span id="s2619">They are not Hungarians.</span> <span id="s2620">They are Jews who suffered because they are Jews."</span> <span id="s2621">So they...he said, the commander, "Yes, you right."</span> <span id="s2622">Then they wanted to send the girls to work in the meat factory.</span> <span id="s2623">So again they came.</span> <span id="s2624">"Magda, what we are going to do?</span> <span id="s2625">They send us to the meat factory!"</span> <span id="s2626">So I again went to the commander.</span> <span id="s2627">And I said, "Look.</span> <span id="s2628">They are girls who live three, three and a half years, two years concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2629">And now you want them to work here?</span> <span id="s2630">Isn't that enough German woman here who was living here in comfort?</span> <span id="s2631">Take them!"</span> <span id="s2632">And he said, "You're right!"</span> <span id="s2633">And so I saved those also.</span> <span id="s2634">But then they didn't want to take the Czechoslovakian girls home, the Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s2635">So a woman, like a older woman, from my hometown, she said, "Magda, you have to do something or they will leave us here.</span> <span id="s2636">They will take the Czech people, and be...leave us here under the Russians and between the Germans.</span> <span id="s2637">What will be our fate, I don't know.</span> <span id="s2638">You have to do something.</span> <span id="s2639">You have to go to the Committee of the Czechoslovakians."</span> <span id="s2640">And... and I said, "Please leave me out.</span> <span id="s2641">I was sweeping enough.</span> <span id="s2642">Let somebody sweep."</span> <span id="s2643">And, you know, that's a song like that... (singing) "that I sweeped already enough."</span> <span id="s2644">Anyway, so she said, "But this is the last time you have to do something."</span> <span id="s2645">So I went there...(laughter) I went there to the Committee; and I said, "I heard that you are sending away the Czech girls, but you are not sending the Jewish girls."</span> <span id="s2646">And...and he said, "We haven't got enough trucks."</span> <span id="s2647">And I put my hand on the table, and I hit the table so that the papers all jumped up.</span> <span id="s2648">And I said, "If I would be a cousin of President Beneš, then would be trucks for me.</span> <span id="s2649">But because I am not, I am only a Jewess who was a very good citizens for the Czechoslovak Republic.</span> <span id="s2650">We been honest and right citizens, and you threw us out like rubbish.</span> <span id="s2651">And now, after the war, you don't take us back?</span> <span id="s2652">This is not fair."</span> <span id="s2653">And he got up; and he says, "I am the cousin of President Beneš."</span> <span id="s2654">And I said, "Then you are going home.</span> <span id="s2655">But we are going to stay here?"</span> <span id="s2656">And he looked at me and he says, "The first trucks which arrive, you will be on it."</span> <span id="s2657">I came there; and they say, "Oh, Magda, you saved us again!"</span> <span id="s2658">And that's how it finished up.</span> <span id="s2659">And that goes the story now, which is not important, how I meet my husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s2660">Q: No.</span> <span id="s2661">I'd like to hear that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2662">A: You would like to hear it?</span> <span id="s2663">So we arrived in Prague, and I announced right away I want to Palestine.</span> <span id="s2664">I didn't...I didn't even think on Béla, or something.</span> <span id="s2665">But I thought, "I am going to Palestine.</span> <span id="s2666">I'm not staying in this place where they threw me out like dirty linen."</span> <span id="s2667">So while I am signing all the papers I am going to Palestine and everything, from far away--because it was a huge room and there was hundreds of people there--somebody screams.</span> <span id="s2668">I know he was a doctor, and I know from what town he is.</span> <span id="s2669">And I don't know how he knew; but he says, "Béla is alive!"</span> <span id="s2670">Béla is alive.</span> <span id="s2671">Fine.</span> <span id="s2672">And um...and he said, "You should go after him."</span> <span id="s2673">But he screamed that over hundreds of people, you know.</span> <span id="s2674">(Laughter) He screamed, "Ah..." And I..</span> <span id="s2675">.</span> <span id="s2676">you know, I listened to that.</span> <span id="s2677">And so I..</span> <span id="s2678">.</span> <span id="s2679">he told me, while...while he told me that I should look after him.</span> <span id="s2680">And he told me that he has a sister in a certain place, the first thing I should go there.</span> <span id="s2681">When he came home, then...</span></p> <p><span id="s2682">Q: Which...which...which "he"s are we talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s2683">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s2684">Q: We're talking about Béla?</span></p> <p><span id="s2685">A: Béla!</span> <span id="s2686">When Béla came home to Prague, so girls told him on the station, "Magda is home in her home town."</span> <span id="s2687">Everyone told him that I am home.</span> <span id="s2688">They saw me here.</span> <span id="s2689">They saw me there.</span> <span id="s2690">They saw me there, and they saw me there.</span> <span id="s2691">So as he heard that I am home, so off he went to my hometown.</span> <span id="s2692">Meantime, because he said the first thing I should go to his sister's place, so I went there.</span> <span id="s2693">I am coming there; and they said, "But he is looking for you in your hometown!"</span> <span id="s2694">Anyway...so I was there a few days, and then I went to my hometown.</span> <span id="s2695">I'm going home, and he is coming back.</span> <span id="s2696">(Laughter) When he came back and found that I went home, so he wrote me a letter.</span> <span id="s2697">And I should straight away come, because he... So...so I came back to _ilina, was the name; but I felt very awkward to live at his sister place, who didn't know me ever.</span> <span id="s2698">And...and I had there some friends from my hometown, so I went to live there.</span> <span id="s2699">I thought, "'Til Béla comes home, I don't want strange people."</span> <span id="s2700">But his nephew, who was twelve years old, he came to pick me up.</span> <span id="s2701">And he said, "You know, Magda, my uncle loves you very much."</span> <span id="s2702">(Laughter) He is...he was a tall boy for twelve.</span> <span id="s2703">And he says, "And he is the best man on the world.</span> <span id="s2704">So please don't run away from here, because he will be very unhappy.</span> <span id="s2705">So come with me, and wait till he is coming home."</span> <span id="s2706">And that child didn't move 'til I didn't go with him.</span> <span id="s2707">And he was going with me to swimming, to exercise, to um the pictures, whatever, 'til Béla did came home.</span> <span id="s2708">And so then I..</span> <span id="s2709">.</span> <span id="s2710">that night I stayed at their place, and at night Béla came home.</span> <span id="s2711">And then he saw me, he grabbed me in his hand, run around in...in a..</span> <span id="s2712">.</span> <span id="s2713">in the... Because he was happy.</span> <span id="s2714">And that's we...how we met; and the rest is not so important anymore.</span> <span id="s2715">But that's how we met anyway.</span> <span id="s2716">And um that, matter of fact, I think finishes up.</span> <span id="s2717">Because there was so many other stories, which I go away for hours.</span> <span id="s2718">But I think the most you heard.</span> <span id="s2719">You heard enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s2720">Q: When did you--just tell us, briefly--after the war about when you and Béla married and when you moved to Israel and then to...</span></p> <p><span id="s2721">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2722">Q: Just bring us through to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s2723">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2724">When, when we...when we met then, then I said, "I'm not going to stay here.</span> <span id="s2725">We have to move away from here."</span> <span id="s2726">So we went first up to Prague, and we booked in the hotel.</span> <span id="s2727">He, meantime--that's why he went away, because he wanted to earn a few...few crowns that he would have.</span> <span id="s2728">And because for those who been in camp, there was a possibility to get somewhere...like to settle, to start.</span> <span id="s2729">A new start, because we didn't have a penny.</span> <span id="s2730">So, so we went.</span> <span id="s2731">But Béla, being as he was--broken down, lost his wife and child--and something broke in him.</span> <span id="s2732">He didn't have that really business sense, or... So he didn't pick a big factory, or big shop or whatever.</span> <span id="s2733">He picked a little...in a little town.</span> <span id="s2734">On the end of the town, a little house which used to here have a woman whose husband was working and she was doing the repairs and meantime she was selling something.</span> <span id="s2735">A little... So when...when I saw that what he choosed--because he wanted away from people, you know?</span> <span id="s2736">He suddenly didn't want to see many people.</span> <span id="s2737">So I..</span> <span id="s2738">.</span> <span id="s2739">I told myself, "That little place!</span> <span id="s2740">Couldn't he pick something bigger, that we should have a chance?"</span> <span id="s2741">Because it was all empty.</span> <span id="s2742">We had to run away for material, and...and get things done.</span> <span id="s2743">And ...and you know that place had stairs like that.</span> <span id="s2744">Spiral stairs.</span> <span id="s2745">So I had run up and be in the shop and cook.</span> <span id="s2746">And...and...and sometimes customers came in, and...and I was running down.</span> <span id="s2747">And I said, "Don't worry.</span> <span id="s2748">You can't touch anything, because everything is on wire.</span> <span id="s2749">And when you touch anything, it's...(laughter) it's um ...the bells are ringing upstairs.</span> <span id="s2750">So, and tell it to everybody," I said.</span> <span id="s2751">Sometimes I had to go up; but I know, and then I know.</span> <span id="s2752">And, you know, you can tell people and they believe you.</span> <span id="s2753">And they believed me.</span> <span id="s2754">Anyway, so they didn't touch anything.</span> <span id="s2755">And um so we started to work it up.</span> <span id="s2756">But, you know, because really with hard work and with friendliness, with our personality, we brought people from...from the town to the end of the town.</span> <span id="s2757">And so we started to do a little prospering.</span> <span id="s2758">And then I was um pregnant with my first child...was our first child.</span> <span id="s2759">And when I was in hospital even... This time, in Czechoslovakia, they made, you know, from feathers a little...like um feather [bed] and this is like--like I said--like a wurst, and here it gets over and you have to attach things.</span> <span id="s2760">And the baby is inside; and here is lace around.</span> <span id="s2761">And when Maya was born, so baby...Béla made it up and brought in.</span> <span id="s2762">And there was a woman who didn't have that thing, and she liked it very much.</span> <span id="s2763">So Béla said, because he was so happy, he will make [for] her.</span> <span id="s2764">But then it come to pay, because he didn't have it for nothing.</span> <span id="s2765">So worked out that her husband is a very high um in this business to checking everything; and...so he didn't want to pay.</span> <span id="s2766">And when Béla demanded he should pay, so he send a committee and they gave us a punishment.</span> <span id="s2767">A financial big punishment.</span> <span id="s2768">Imagine!</span> <span id="s2769">I said, "Béla, you see how it happens.</span> <span id="s2770">When you're good and good-hearted, somebody--not that he doesn't say thank you because you made it for his child.</span> <span id="s2771">He makes us all our saving and our hard work went on...on it."</span> <span id="s2772">And here we been, and somebody on top of it was jealous because we brought all the customers there.</span> <span id="s2773">He wanted that shop.</span> <span id="s2774">So they took away the shop.</span> <span id="s2775">So then I went again to Prague to demand that what happened, and with no reason they took it away.</span> <span id="s2776">So we gave another shop.</span> <span id="s2777">But now was the question that they wanted...it came a change, and they wanted Béla to be a member of the Communist Party.</span> <span id="s2778">He didn't want to be.</span> <span id="s2779">So they closed him out from the party, without being in the party.</span> <span id="s2780">And they said...again they take all the business away, because if he is not a member... So I said, "What you mean?"</span> <span id="s2781">They said, "You can have it, if you divorce him."</span> <span id="s2782">So again...so we had a lot of bad luck like that.</span> <span id="s2783">The fate wanted to see how much I can endure.</span> <span id="s2784">And naturally then we got another little... I was running after this member and this member, and we got another little business.</span> <span id="s2785">But Béla had to travel, and it didn't bring much money.</span></p> <p><span id="s2786">Q: When did you go to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s2787">A: And then I decided...I said, "Look.</span> <span id="s2788">You...you are not a communist.</span> <span id="s2789">And whatever will be, they will find out a reasons of you."</span> <span id="s2790">And they was...did find out.</span> <span id="s2791">They said that he wants to overthrow the government; which I said, "I didn't know he was so smart."</span> <span id="s2792">(Laughter) I said that to that man who...who said it.</span> <span id="s2793">"I didn't know my husband is so smart."</span> <span id="s2794">You know, I could always talk.</span> <span id="s2795">But um...but that didn't help me.</span> <span id="s2796">And then Israel started, so I said, "We are going to Israel."</span> <span id="s2797">All my life, I wanted to go.</span> <span id="s2798">All my friends and relatives said, "In this time, beginning with a baby of one and a half and three, you are going to Israel?</span> <span id="s2799">You know where you will live?</span> <span id="s2800">In tents on the sand."</span> <span id="s2801">I said, "I don't mind.</span> <span id="s2802">Israel was um born, and we belong there."</span> <span id="s2803">They said, "But you can't...you can come with us first to Australia, and then go to visit Israel when you made already money."</span> <span id="s2804">And I said, "If everybody would say it, where would Israel be?"</span> <span id="s2805">So I think, "I'm going:" and we went.</span> <span id="s2806">And naturally we was being in the camp in the tents.</span> <span id="s2807">Wasn't the best thing.</span> <span id="s2808">So the only thing was that I..</span> <span id="s2809">.</span> <span id="s2810">I uh said that I want a kindergarten job.</span> <span id="s2811">So I went to the directress, and I said, "Would you give me a kindergarten job?"</span> <span id="s2812">And she said, "Can you speak Hebrew?"</span> <span id="s2813">I said, "A few words."</span> <span id="s2814">But he [NB: she] said, "So how do you want to be a kindergarten teacher?"</span> <span id="s2815">I said, "Did Danny Kaye talk with all the children, with all the nations which he didn't know the language?</span> <span id="s2816">So I will be!"</span> <span id="s2817">So she looked at me.</span> <span id="s2818">"I give you a chance.</span> <span id="s2819">I go in that camp, and I take all the teachers out and the helpers.</span> <span id="s2820">And you go in.</span> <span id="s2821">If you survive ten minutes, you get it."</span> <span id="s2822">I went in; and in ten minutes, the children was on the floor and on top of me.</span> <span id="s2823">And we been laughing and giggling.</span> <span id="s2824">So she say, "Ah, have it!"</span> <span id="s2825">She made, "Oh, have it."</span> <span id="s2826">So that's how I got a job.</span> <span id="s2827">And I need a job most of it because the food wasn't made for Europeans.</span> <span id="s2828">It was made for Africans.</span> <span id="s2829">And for a little baby of one and a half, she started to get sick.</span> <span id="s2830">But then I..</span> <span id="s2831">.</span> <span id="s2832">as I was on the staff, so I got the food of the staff.</span> <span id="s2833">And, you know, a mother is never hungry when it comes to it.</span> <span id="s2834">And I said, "Could I take the food to her home, when I will be hungry?"</span> <span id="s2835">She said, "By all means.</span> <span id="s2836">Take it!"</span> <span id="s2837">And so I brought the food home, divide it between the children and Béla, and what was left was mine.</span> <span id="s2838">I was so skinny...</span></p> <p><span id="s2839">Q: We need to move a bit.</span> <span id="s2840">When did you come to Australia?</span></p> <p><span id="s2841">A: Um first...and then we went to live in um Holon.</span> <span id="s2842">And then again I put um my furniture out, brought a kindergarten in; and then again the kindergarten out and the furniture in.</span> <span id="s2843">And Béla had to go always to the military service, which he didn't like very much because he wasn't as young anymore.</span> <span id="s2844">And one stage, he was there for a month.</span> <span id="s2845">And it was terrible; and they been attacked and then it was it was wet and everything.</span> <span id="s2846">And meantime, my cousins from Australia send the papers.</span> <span id="s2847">"Come to Australia."</span> <span id="s2848">And Béla came home.</span> <span id="s2849">He said, "Send the papers."</span> <span id="s2850">My cousins wrote, "You have to wait anyway for two years, so...so then send it quick as possible."</span> <span id="s2851">We send the papers; but a fluke luck, in six weeks we had the papers to move.</span> <span id="s2852">So that's...in '65 we went to Australia.</span> <span id="s2853">But again, without a penny; because the place what we had we sold, and that was just enough for our journey.</span> <span id="s2854">We arrived again penniless.</span> <span id="s2855">So, again a hard time.</span> <span id="s2856">Hard time all the time.</span> <span id="s2857">But I never lost faith.</span> <span id="s2858">We brought our children up in a very good way, and they are...they... Because they had to work.</span> <span id="s2859">They had to help me to clean to the place where the children... And they helped.</span> <span id="s2860">They had to wash the floors.</span> <span id="s2861">And the neighbors said they know better the bottom of my children than the faces.</span> <span id="s2862">(Laughter) And that's happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2863">Q: Magda, thank you.</span> <span id="s2864">You had a statement you wanted to read.</span></p> <p><span id="s2865">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2866">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2867">Q: We wanted to know the effect of the war on you, and I think your statement does that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2868">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s2869">Must still be a little wet.</span> <span id="s2870">Yeah.</span> <span id="s2871">Can I take my glasses?</span></p> <p><span id="s2872">Q: Sure can.</span></p> <p><span id="s2873">PAUSE</span></p> <p><span id="s2874">A: (Reading from paper) My number is 2318.</span> <span id="s2875">Under this number, I survived and endured unbelievable dehumanizations, beatings, screams.</span> <span id="s2876">I suffered all kind of sicknesses.</span> <span id="s2877">I had malaria.</span> <span id="s2878">My Lager sisters took me to the Revier (kind of hospital), so I could at least rest a little.</span> <span id="s2879">But rats been running around me, biting on my toes.</span> <span id="s2880">So I asked my lager sisters to discharge me rather to the barrack.</span> <span id="s2881">The same day, unfortunately, the whole Revier been sent to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s2882">I had typhoid, and all different sicknesses.</span> <span id="s2883">As a consequence, I lost my eyesight, my hearing.</span> <span id="s2884">I couldn't walk.</span> <span id="s2885">I was many times close to be sent to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s2886">By one occasion, I was one the track together with other victims on the way to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s2887">Against all the odds, I lived through three and a half years; first in Auschwitz, then in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s2888">My hair been cut many times, with blunt scissors so after my head was always bruised.</span> <span id="s2889">On a chair, (looking up) I was telling you already that, (reading from paper) um while laughing men been cutting or shaving everywhere where hair was.</span> <span id="s2890">On SS order, all my possessions were taken away.</span> <span id="s2891">And I was dipped in murky water in large bins, ten at a time.</span> <span id="s2892">Then I stood wet and naked, shaking in the wintery cold 'til I got remnants after the Russian prisoner of wars.</span> <span id="s2893">Cotton pants and top.</span> <span id="s2894">On mine, all the buttons been missing; so I have to hold the top and bottom with my hands, not to lose them.</span> <span id="s2895">And a pair of wooden clogs.</span> <span id="s2896">Before I start to tell my story, I wanted to mention this part as a start.</span> <span id="s2897">Because there are people, some writers, professors, scientist, who from unbelievable reason try to deny that the Holocaust existed.</span> <span id="s2898">They try to say Holocaust was only a hoax.</span> <span id="s2899">Unfortunately, all the barbarism of the German SS, sadism, deceiving, the cruelty, was true.</span> <span id="s2900">Believe me.</span> <span id="s2901">Often I feel I should ask from all those people why are they doing it.</span> <span id="s2902">Wasn't there enough our suffering?</span> <span id="s2903">And now, on top of...on top those people claiming it should have the last laugh?</span> <span id="s2904">And a lot of followers?</span> <span id="s2905">So I turn to you, all parents, to all the teachers, professors, scientists, preachers, priests, rabbis.</span> <span id="s2906">Educate the children, the people, about those horrors that the German nation under the Nazi system did to all other nations, not only Jews.</span> <span id="s2907">I been witnessing that, nobody was excepted...exception.</span> <span id="s2908">(Pause) Make the wrong right.</span> <span id="s2909">Be understanding and helpful to those survivors.</span> <span id="s2910">It's not right not to talk about it for shame or frustration.</span> <span id="s2911">Some will say, "It happened a long time ago--forty-five, fifty years ago.</span> <span id="s2912">Let's forget it."</span> <span id="s2913">But on the other side, they continue on thousands of places to preach two thousand years history about the Golgotha.</span> <span id="s2914">Don't believe those so-called professionals whose informations are coming from, to me, unknown sources who have the reason and own interests.</span> <span id="s2915">And who, for a lot of money, tried to persuade the world about the non-existence of the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s2916">But would and could you, and you, and you, forget it, if you would live through all the horrors which changed your life, your career?</span> <span id="s2917">We're tormented by nightmares.</span> <span id="s2918">When you close your eyes, you relive the misery again and again.</span> <span id="s2919">So you don't even go to sleep.</span> <span id="s2920">And how about the millions and millions of babies, young, innocent children, people young and old?</span> <span id="s2921">So, please!</span> <span id="s2922">Don't minimize the Holocaust as a old story.</span> <span id="s2923">But try to work against it, that happenings like the Holocaust shouldn't have ground to happen again ever.</span> <span id="s2924">(Looking up) Finish.</span> <span id="s2925">That's it.</span> <span id="s2926">Hmmm?</span></p> <p><span id="s2927">Q: Beautiful.</span> <span id="s2928">OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s2929">A: OK.</span></p>
