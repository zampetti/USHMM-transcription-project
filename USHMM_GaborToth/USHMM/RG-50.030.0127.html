Nardus.</span> <span id="s46">And Jacob was called Jaap, which is a Dutch name, Jaap.</span> <span id="s47">J-A-A-P, Jaap.</span> <span id="s48">And Joseph was called Joop, J-O-O-P.</span> <span id="s49">Jacob died before the war.</span> <span id="s50">Joseph was killed by the Germans.</span> <span id="s51">So was his wife, Jeana and their little son, whose name I can't recall right now.</span> <span id="s52">In essence, those three people are the only ones in my family, my direct family...near family that were killed in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s53">Everyone else either had died before or died a natural death.</span> <span id="s54">So my father's older brother died</span></p> <p><span id="s55">01:04: before the war, and his younger brother died in a concentration camp in, I think, Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s56">So my father...oh, by the way, this younger brother, Joseph or Joop was also a tailor or went into the clothing industry, helped by my grandfather.</span> <span id="s57">My father was the only one who somehow or other got into a completely different profession.</span> <span id="s58">He became a musician.</span> <span id="s59">And when he was 17 he left his parental house...home, and from what I can find out he never returned.</span> <span id="s60">He booked on or he signed on a ship as a musician at 17, and it was his first trip overseas, and he never forgot it.</span> <span id="s61">He always told me about it.</span> <span id="s62">So he was a musician all his life.</span> <span id="s63">No matter what he tried to get out of it, he never...he never managed.</span> <span id="s64">He tried many things, together with my mother later on.</span> <span id="s65">They tried to set up businesses and sell things and it never worked.</span> <span id="s66">Papa always came back to being a musician.</span> <span id="s67">So let me say now...</span></p> <p><span id="s68">01:05:40</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: Tell us about you as a child.</span> <span id="s70">What was your home like growing up as a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Well, it's a little difficult to tell you because my father and my mother married in 1925 and had me, of course, in 1926, and traveled around a lot.</span> <span id="s72">In 1929, for instance, my parents decided that they would go to the United States.</span> <span id="s73">They would follow in the path of my aunt and uncle who had moved there.</span> <span id="s74">They had moved.</span> <span id="s75">My aunt and uncle lived in Holyoke, Massachusetts, and my parents decided that that they also wanted to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s76">So 1929, I, as a three year old, arrived in the States, and learned to speak English.</span> <span id="s77">However, they had a lot of bad luck.</span> <span id="s78">1929 wasn't a very good year to arrive in the States as you can imagine.</span> <span id="s79">So Pop had a hard time finding work and, in addition he got sick.</span> <span id="s80">He got tuberculosis, which ran in the family.</span> <span id="s81">Tuberculosis was a kind of a family disease with us.</span> <span id="s82">A lot of members had it...got it.</span> <span id="s83">My daughter got it.</span> <span id="s84">Pop got tuberculosis and had to go to a hospital.</span> <span id="s85">And Mom had to go and scrub floors and later worked in a travel agency in Boston.</span> <span id="s86">And I was farmed out to to a lady who was supposed to take care of me, but who took very badly care of me for one of the reason I have been in psychotherapy for the last 22 years is that [it] didn't help what happened later on [in] the war.</span> <span id="s87">So we moved to the States in 1932.</span> <span id="s88">Pop not finding work.</span> <span id="s89">Well, very occasionally, he had some friends in the Boston Symphony who helped with the summer engagement, but all in all he didn't find much work.</span> <span id="s90">In 1932 they moved back to Holland.</span> <span id="s91">In Holland they moved around from place to place, wherever Pop could find work.</span> <span id="s92">Pop worked as a musician mostly in night clubs, bars or restaurants, hotels, in the time that hotels still had live music, you know, little trios and... So we moved around quite a bit throughout Holland.</span> <span id="s93">I once counted that between the time that I was born and the war that we had...and the war was 1940, so it's between 1926 and 1940, that I once counted approximately 32 addresses.</span> <span id="s94">So that's a lot, you know.</span> <span id="s95">Some places, we may have been only...I don't know, a</span></p> <p><span id="s96">01:08:30 month so, but we had a lot of moving around.</span> <span id="s97">So my parents, as I said, came back in 1932 to Holland.</span> <span id="s98">Then Pop started playing and my mother had...my mother got three...three more children.</span> <span id="s99">One, another boy after me, died.</span> <span id="s100">His name was Joop...Joop again named after my grand...I guess great grandfather Jacob.</span> <span id="s101">Yeah.</span> <span id="s102">He died when he was 9 months.</span> <span id="s103">It was a terrible blow for my mother.</span> <span id="s104">And as my father said...a psychiatrist...he had consulted a psychiatrist because my mother was...was totally distraught.</span> <span id="s105">He said the best thing was to get Mother a child as quick as possible.</span> <span id="s106">She got two more children.</span> <span id="s107">Two...my two brothers, my brother, At, and my brother Fred.</span> <span id="s108">So there's a difference...a big difference between my brothers and me.</span> <span id="s109">The next my brother At is 8 years younger and my brother, Fred, is 10 years younger than I am.</span> <span id="s110">So I sort of stood alone most of the time.</span> <span id="s111">I was alone...a loner.</span> <span id="s112">We lived the last years before the war sort of in The Hague, Holland.</span> <span id="s113">And just before...a year before the war...I think 1939, with the help of my grandfather, who you may recall was a tailor, opened a clothing store in Delft, the nearby small town.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">01:10: Delft is located between The Hague and Rotterdam, a small town, a beautiful little town where Delft pottery comes from.</span> <span id="s115">So we moved there and that was...no I was going to say it was the last move before the ...that was the last move before the war, of course.</span> <span id="s116">So the war of 1940...the invasion, the German invasion found us in Delft with a sort of a small clothing store.</span> <span id="s117">And when the war broke out, I was 14, and my brother Fred was 4 and my brother At, was 6.</span> <span id="s118">Does that give you some background on my family?</span> <span id="s119">What else would you like me to go into at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Tell us what happened when the war broke out.</span> <span id="s121">Can you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s123">Very well.</span> <span id="s124">I was 14.</span> <span id="s125">The war broke out 2 days after my birthday.</span> <span id="s126">My birthday was the 8th of May.</span> <span id="s127">I remember very well getting a canoe for my birthday because Delft is sometimes called the Venice of Holland.</span> <span id="s128">It's riddled with canals, little bridges.</span> <span id="s129">It's [a] very, very beautiful little town.</span> <span id="s130">I got the canoe on the 8th of May and I was very happy with that.</span> <span id="s131">It was my birthday.</span> <span id="s132">And on the 10th...that was the 8th of May, 1940.</span> <span id="s133">And on the 10th of May, 5 o'clock in the morning, I woke up to thunderous noises, machine gun fire, planes flying over.</span> <span id="s134">Great commotion.</span> <span id="s135">Dawn was just breaking.</span> <span id="s136">It was a most beautiful</span></p> <p><span id="s137">01:12:30 day.</span> <span id="s138">It was sun[ny], warm, unusual day for Holland in that sense.</span> <span id="s139">I went upstairs, looked out of the attic windows.</span> <span id="s140">The sky was full of planes.</span> <span id="s141">And some of the planes men were jumping with parachutes.</span> <span id="s142">I thought it was fabulous.</span> <span id="s143">It was wonderful.</span> <span id="s144">I tried to climb on the roof.</span> <span id="s145">Almost got shot down by Dutch machine nest which had been placed right near the hole by that time.</span> <span id="s146">My father ...my father retrieved me from the roof and said you shouldn't be doing this.</span> <span id="s147">I thought it was fabulous.</span> <span id="s148">I mean this was like stuff you'd see in the movies.</span> <span id="s149">I was 14 years old.</span> <span id="s150">What the Hell did I know?</span> <span id="s151">Besides, we hadn't the faintest idea of what was going on really.</span> <span id="s152">We thought it was sort of an exercise of the Dutch, probably Dutch air force.</span> <span id="s153">No idea of what was going on.</span> <span id="s154">We soon found out, of course.</span> <span id="s155">By news that came from the radio that the Germans had invaded Holland.</span> <span id="s156">To give you a little background in this, Holland hadn't been in a war as far as I know since the Napoleonic war.</span> <span id="s157">Holland was neutral in the first world war.</span> <span id="s158">Matter of fact, I remember my father telling that in their home...at my grandfather's home, they had a Belgian refugee.</span> <span id="s159">Somebody from the first world war fled the battlefields in Belgium and come to Amsterdam and to The Hague and lived with them for a while.</span> <span id="s160">I think that was the most exotic story that happened ages ago.</span> <span id="s161">Of course, I never realized that that</span></p> <p><span id="s162">01:14: was in that time only maybe 25 years ago or so.</span> <span id="s163">So Holland wasn't a country that was used to battles and war.</span> <span id="s164">The idea that there was a actual war going on was...was ludicrous in our eyes.</span> <span id="s165">I mean it was...but it took 5 days.</span> <span id="s166">After the first morning, it sort of died down.</span> <span id="s167">My father almost got shot I remember.</span> <span id="s168">He wanted to go out get something to eat near the nearby grocery and there was Dutch soldier.</span> <span id="s169">You see, we had a street that had in the middle a canal, and on each side, couple thin streets, and across the canal on the other side was a Dutch soldier standing and Pop opened the front door and shouted to the Dutch soldier...was it alright and go to the grocery store?</span> <span id="s170">And the soldier misunderstood him and fired at him.</span> <span id="s171">And the bullet hit in the wall right next to him.</span> <span id="s172">That would have been the end of my father right there and then.</span> <span id="s173">So my father was in a hurry very pale.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Five days the war took and, of course, in the course the Germans bombarded Rotterdam and brought the Dutch government to its knees in a hurry.</span> <span id="s175">And quiet reigned after that.</span> <span id="s176">As a boy I remember going out with a friend as soon as the war was over and going out on the highway, and there were all these German planes that had been shot down...one right next to another...these planes that had dropped parachute troops which were easy targets because these were slow flying planes.</span> <span id="s177">One after another.</span> <span id="s178">And we thought it was fabulous.</span> <span id="s179">It was interesting.</span> <span id="s180">All these crashed planes and... I'll give you a cute little sideline.</span> <span id="s181">Everyone one of these planes had two engines.</span> <span id="s182">And on each engine was a little plaque.</span> <span id="s183">Blue and White.</span> <span id="s184">It said BMW.</span> <span id="s185">And to this day, it's very difficult for me to accept anyone driving a car with those emblems.</span> <span id="s186">Of course, there is a lot.</span> <span id="s187">They're preferred cars now.</span> <span id="s188">Right?</span> <span id="s189">But to me, that symbol means war and German invasion.</span> <span id="s190">That's strange isn't it.</span> <span id="s191">So as a boy and with my friends on bicycles, we thought it was all fabulous.</span> <span id="s192">All these crashed planes, and I remember going out to some other planes that were parked.</span> <span id="s193">The Dutch had parked some planes under trees.</span> <span id="s194">Supposedly, if there would be some battle and these planes had never been touched.</span> <span id="s195">They were totally outmoded planes.</span> <span id="s196">By the way, my friend and I loved planes.</span> <span id="s197">I still do.</span> <span id="s198">So my friend and I went in there and got instruments out of these planes you know, and for the first time I had a real instrument out of an airplane.</span> <span id="s199">So you realize that, to me, the German invasion was kind of...well, it was a little scary, but it was a lot of fun.</span> <span id="s200">There was a lot of excitement.</span> <span id="s201">And when the first German rolled into town...the first one that I saw was in a camouflage suit with a..</span> <span id="s202">.</span> <span id="s203">with a typical German helmet on, and on a motorcycle with a sidecar and in the sidecar was another German.</span> <span id="s204">And they all had camouflaged suits and...and the motorcycles were...oops... Maybe you want to make a break here.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Can we stop the tape a minute please.</span> <span id="s206">We need to fix this.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: I've had quite a time with this mike.</span> <span id="s208">This is the second time it fell off.</span> <span id="s209">Is this alright now?</span> <span id="s210">Q: You're fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s212">You tell me when I should resume.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Alright.</span> <span id="s214">You're fine.</span> <span id="s215">You were looking at all these planes.</span> <span id="s216">01:18:30</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: And the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s218">The first Germans right on the motorcycles.</span> <span id="s219">They were kind of curious specimens.</span> <span id="s220">They didn't speak Dutch.</span> <span id="s221">They sort of roared through town.</span> <span id="s222">They seemed harmless.</span> <span id="s223">As a boy I had no idea what this really meant.</span> <span id="s224">We settled in with the Germans.</span> <span id="s225">By now, the Germans would march through town as they [were] singing sometimes or they would walk by the stores.</span> <span id="s226">As a matter of fact, there was a German came into my father's store to buy a suit and my father helped him and the guy bought a suit.</span> <span id="s227">I think he bought two suits and he bought that.</span> <span id="s228">Life seemed normal.</span> <span id="s229">We seemed to be able to live with this you know.</span> <span id="s230">That's how it all started.</span> <span id="s231">Nice days in May.</span> <span id="s232">Strange people walking the streets, but rather harmless.</span> <span id="s233">It would all be over pretty soon anyway.</span> <span id="s234">That was the story.</span> <span id="s235">The war would be over soon.</span> <span id="s236">It would last maybe a couple of months and then the English would come and the American would come and the Russians...no, the Russians...I guess...they hadn't invaded Russia yet.</span> <span id="s237">Well, then, of course, the English got defeated and the English and French got defeated in a hurry in France, and there was Dunkirk and then everything came to sort of a standstill you know, sort of the English were in England and we were in Holland and life would go on until the war was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">And very slowly, very slowly, things began to happen.</span> <span id="s239">Little notices in the newspapers about....</span> <span id="s240">Now, I don't exactly know the sequence, of course, but little notices in newspapers such as Jews were not allowed anymore to live right near the coastal areas because they could be traitors.</span> <span id="s241">And then some weeks later maybe there would be a notice that said that Jews shouldn't have any radios.</span> <span id="s242">So every Jew was supposed to bring his radio to town hall.</span> <span id="s243">This went all through the Dutch government you see, so it all didn't seem so terrible.</span> <span id="s244">It and the reaction of my parents and I guess most Jews in Holland who hadn't been repressed for 300 years probably was that was a minor thing, you know.</span> <span id="s245">They wanted our radios.</span> <span id="s246">So the hell with them.</span> <span id="s247">We'd bring the radio.</span> <span id="s248">If they wanted us not to live in the coastal areas, so we'd move inland a ways.</span> <span id="s249">It all seemed rather...how shall I say childish to us....all this nonsense, you know.</span> <span id="s250">And the choice always was either you comply or you go to jail.</span> <span id="s251">Well, nobody in my family had ever gone to jail.</span> <span id="s252">You didn't go to jail.</span> <span id="s253">You didn't...the Dutch were very disciplined people.</span> <span id="s254">When somebody said don't go through this gate because that is private property, you didn't go through that.</span> <span id="s255">You followed the law.</span> <span id="s256">And these laws were new laws.</span> <span id="s257">So the idea was...I mean you begin...you begin to feel something was going on there that we didn't like, of course, but it was easier to comply with it than to to get thrown in jail.</span> <span id="s258">You weren't going to be thrown in jail for having a radio.</span> <span id="s259">This is crazy you know.</span> <span id="s260">So you brought your radio.</span> <span id="s261">But then a little later on...I think it was a matter of copper and brass and all kinds of stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">And for strange reason we thought that was kind of ridiculous so we took all...I remember taking all our copper and brass pots that we had in the house.</span> <span id="s263">It wasn't...my parents weren't very rich so it wasn't much of any consequence and burying it somewhere in a park, where we were sure after the Germans were gone, we'd dig it up and put it back on the shelf.</span> <span id="s264">As a matter of fact, after the war I went back and never find the Goddamn stuff back.</span> <span id="s265">I never could find a park.</span> <span id="s266">It was so changed.</span> <span id="s267">Who the hell knows.</span> <span id="s268">So there was this slow infiltration of little</span></p> <p><span id="s269">01:23:20 things.</span> <span id="s270">And the best thing was to comply with it because the alternative was heavy punishment.</span> <span id="s271">None of it seemed worthwhile.</span> <span id="s272">Then it was bicycles.</span> <span id="s273">Jews shouldn't have bicycles.</span> <span id="s274">We should bring all our bicycles.</span> <span id="s275">People brought their bicycles.</span> <span id="s276">I don't think we did.</span> <span id="s277">Now let's see.</span> <span id="s278">How did it go on?</span> <span id="s279">Then there came a decree.</span> <span id="s280">And this is all issued in the Dutch newspapers, mostly through Dutch authorities.</span> <span id="s281">It would say that the German command had issued a decree to the Dutch government, and the Dutch government said that Jews were no longer allowed to have businesses.</span> <span id="s282">Well, my father had a big business, so they sold all the clothing as fast and made quite a bundle of money because by that time clothing was rationed.</span> <span id="s283">They sold the clothing.</span> <span id="s284">And rented a house...a large house in Delft in a different location...had many rooms there...had 17 rooms I think, and rented out rooms to students.</span> <span id="s285">Delft is a university town.</span> <span id="s286">So they set themselves in sort of a business renting rooms to students which was a very common business in Delft because there was so many students and lots of people just lived on renting out rooms to students.</span> <span id="s287">So they did that, and they got this big house I remember and lots of rooms in it.</span> <span id="s288">And meanwhile, new decrees slowly came out.</span> <span id="s289">Jews couldn't have this.</span> <span id="s290">Jews couldn't do that.</span> <span id="s291">Jews couldn't go to school.</span> <span id="s292">I was in school.</span> <span id="s293">I was a teenager, and I was in high school.</span> <span id="s294">By the way, I was an awful student.</span> <span id="s295">Probably one of the worst.</span> <span id="s296">My parents were at wits end with me.</span> <span id="s297">I was a lousy student.</span> <span id="s298">I was a clown.</span> <span id="s299">I had a good time everywhere and tried to attract attention by being very funny and was held back several times and finally my father, you know, said, "I don't know what the hell to do with him.”</span> <span id="s300">He went to to a friend and said what should I with this boy?</span> <span id="s301">And he said, "Why don't you let him learn a profession?"</span> <span id="s302">So I was sent to, what do you call that,...a trade school, which was kind of shame because there weren't any Jewish kids in trade schools.</span> <span id="s303">This was for non-Jewish kids who wanted to become carpenters and electricians and stuff like.</span> <span id="s304">Here I was and I was supposed to first become an electrician.</span> <span id="s305">And, of course, I horsed around there too and didn't learn.</span> <span id="s306">And then I was switched and my father talked with someone and said, "What should my son do?</span> <span id="s307">What do you think is a good profession.”</span> <span id="s308">And this man said, "Do you know what's a good profession?</span> <span id="s309">Instruments making, tool maker.”</span> <span id="s310">And so I started studying for that.</span> <span id="s311">And...but as I said one bad day there was a notice in the paper that Jewish children couldn't go to the</span></p> <p><span id="s312">01:27:20 regular schools anymore...could go only to special Jewish schools.</span> <span id="s313">Since I lived in a very small town, there were no special Jewish school.</span> <span id="s314">All in all maybe in Delft before or during the war...I said before...at the beginning of the German invasion, my guess is maybe that there were maybe 150 maybe 200 Jews in Delft.</span> <span id="s315">It's a small town.</span> <span id="s316">So we knew most of them by the way.</span> <span id="s317">No Jews in school anymore meant that I couldn't go to school anymore.</span> <span id="s318">So I was out of trade school.</span> <span id="s319">And Pop said to me...he said "Well, you know the best thing is maybe you should learn to play music.”</span> <span id="s320">Because he was a musician.</span> <span id="s321">So I took up the trumpet for a while.</span> <span id="s322">And I kinda liked that.</span> <span id="s323">I played...started studying the trumpet with a teacher, a very nice man.</span> <span id="s324">Everyone felt sorry for me that I couldn't go to school anymore, you know, that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s325">So I studied the trumpet for a while, and I also played the piano.</span> <span id="s326">Pop gave me lessons which was horrendous because it's very, very terrible to take lessons from your parents, you know.</span> <span id="s327">It didn't work out too well.</span> <span id="s328">He taught me piano, and I still play the piano.</span> <span id="s329">Badly.</span> <span id="s330">Then...oh, and I also had a part-time job as a delivery boy for a for a pharmacy.</span> <span id="s331">All these things to keep me busy while my parents got more and more worried about what was going on of course.</span> <span id="s332">.</span> <span id="s333">I still don't think I grasped exactly what was going on.</span> <span id="s334">I just sort of went along with it.</span> <span id="s335">Then came a decree one day that you had to wear a star.</span> <span id="s336">All Jews had to wear a star if they went out of the house.</span> <span id="s337">So my mother sewed on stars on my clothes.</span> <span id="s338">And I remember an incident.</span> <span id="s339">I have a cousin.</span> <span id="s340">My cousin, Hans, who lives in Springfield, Massachusetts now.</span> <span id="s341">He's about my age, and at the time we looked a little bit similar.</span> <span id="s342">And we had both gotten the same overcoats from my father's former clothing store, so we looked like twins.</span> <span id="s343">And Hans always said, "Let's go out and walk like twins.”</span> <span id="s344">So we put on the same socks, shirt, much as possible...same outfit and we walked as twins.</span> <span id="s345">That was wonderful.</span> <span id="s346">Except I had a star.</span> <span id="s347">He didn't.</span> <span id="s348">Well, that was the only thing different.</span> <span id="s349">His mom...his mother...my Aunt Clara had married a non-Jew.</span> <span id="s350">So Hans was only half Jewish.</span> <span id="s351">And I remember walking through Delft and once get stopped by a German.</span> <span id="s352">This was the only time a German physically touched me.</span> <span id="s353">I was stopped by this German.</span> <span id="s354">We were stopped by this German in our same overcoats.</span> <span id="s355">And the German said to my cousin, Hans, "What're you do walking with a Jew?"</span> <span id="s356">And I said, "He's my cousin.”</span> <span id="s357">And the German slapped me full in the face and I fell on the ground.</span> <span id="s358">Pow.</span> <span id="s359">Like this...he said something like "You lousy Jew.”</span> <span id="s360">And he said to my cousin, "Don't let me ever see you walking with him...with a Jew.”</span> <span id="s361">It's the only time that I physically was abused by a German.</span> <span id="s362">And I'll never forget it.</span> <span id="s363">When I think of the concentration camps and what people went through that's my only reference.</span> <span id="s364">That incident was</span></p> <p><span id="s365">01:31:20 like...I think it must have woken me up to what was really going on to some extent.</span> <span id="s366">Not that I remember it as such now, but that was the only time that I was really physically abused by those bastards, if I can use that expression.</span> <span id="s367">Well, he went away.</span> <span id="s368">And, of course, my cousin and I still would be together.</span> <span id="s369">As a matter of fact during the war, I spent a short time hidden by my Aunt Clara.</span> <span id="s370">Hans and I would go out at night after dark...go to the Catholic churches.</span> <span id="s371">I'll get back to that later.</span> <span id="s372">It's little bit of ahead.</span> <span id="s373">Well, the shipments [i.e. deportations?]</span> <span id="s374">begin.</span> <span id="s375">Jews were to register, of course.</span> <span id="s376">We had all registered I presume at the beginning of the war.</span> <span id="s377">I forget that part because some point or another we all supposed to register and we all did.</span> <span id="s378">The punishment I guess for not registering was death.</span> <span id="s379">So...what the hell?</span> <span id="s380">You go to register.</span> <span id="s381">What's the big deal.</span> <span id="s382">Since in Holland, ostensively there was no anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s383">I mean you could walk out in the street with a star.</span> <span id="s384">Nobody'd say, "Hey, you lousy Jew.”</span> <span id="s385">It was like a sign of respect.</span> <span id="s386">People felt sorry for you.</span> <span id="s387">It was kind of nice to have people feel sorry for me.</span> <span id="s388">Shipments began, of course.</span> <span id="s389">Since I lived in a very small town, it didn't immediately hit us that much.</span> <span id="s390">It happened mostly in Amsterdam...big city where there was thousands and thousands of Jews.</span> <span id="s391">And you heard this and you read about it and, of course, we got the Jewish newspaper that was published by something called the Joodse Raad, the Jewish Committee in Holland, that sort of tried to regulate...diminish the pain sort of.</span> <span id="s392">But in the process actually now as I look back at it helped the Germans, of course.</span> <span id="s393">But there again...the goal was to...if somebody had to go and work in Poland as it was held up to us, they would...let's first send healthy people who are not going to suffer too much from the cold there.</span> <span id="s394">So they regulated who would go on shipments and so on and who would not.</span> <span id="s395">All that for us a little bit far away, but we knew that someday we will have to go and work in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">This was...now I want you to understand this very clearly.</span> <span id="s397">That not until May 1945, the liberation of Holland, did I have the slightest idea of what was going on with these people who were sent away.</span> <span id="s398">We had no idea.</span> <span id="s399">I had no idea.</span> <span id="s400">I don't know who... Some people must have.</span> <span id="s401">As far as we were concerned, you went to Poland to work.</span> <span id="s402">And I remember very much very well a member of my family in Amsterdam...I think a cousin of my father's...who stood in the open market in a stall and sold underwear and socks.</span> <span id="s403">Saying, her name was Beppie saying, "What's the big deal?</span> <span id="s404">We work like dogs here.</span> <span id="s405">So we'll go work over there if they want us to do that.</span> <span id="s406">This was commonly accepted.</span> <span id="s407">And so my father and mother in anticipation of being shipped to Poland, having to go to Poland to work, got nice bundles of backpacks.</span> <span id="s408">We got blankets.</span> <span id="s409">We got water containers or whatever...socks.</span> <span id="s410">You know, socks, warm shoes, whatever...sweaters.</span> <span id="s411">It was all neatly in a closet in our house you know.</span> <span id="s412">We were ready.</span> <span id="s413">All set.</span> <span id="s414">We'd be warm.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">01:36: We'd have clothing, blankets.</span> <span id="s416">We'd go and if we had to Poland, we'd go there.</span> <span id="s417">It might be a little colder.</span> <span id="s418">Papa and Mom would have to work a little harder, but gee, they were used to work.</span> <span id="s419">We were all set.</span> <span id="s420">Interesting thing is that my grandfather came over from Amsterdam and he, of course, told horror stories of thousands of Jews being shipped off and the way I remember it.</span> <span id="s421">I don't know if I have this from a story by my grandfather or by my father or I was there myself at that particular instant that my father and mother opened this closet and showed my grandfather how well they were prepared.</span> <span id="s422">How beautiful.</span> <span id="s423">Backpack and how wonderful the blankets, and my grandfather saying, "Do you think you're going to go to Poland to work?</span> <span id="s424">And my parents saying, "Yes.”</span> <span id="s425">"You're not going to go to work.</span> <span id="s426">You're going to get killed there.</span> <span id="s427">You're gonna die there.”</span> <span id="s428">Not that I think he knew that we were being murdered outright but that it was cold and that you'd work yourself to death and that you might die in.</span> <span id="s429">.</span> <span id="s430">you know, like in Siberia, people died in camps.</span> <span id="s431">And it's at that point I guess that my parents decided we weren't going to go.</span> <span id="s432">Now the penalty for that was death.</span> <span id="s433">But by now we came to a state where you had to choose between possibly instant death by being caught and by being set up against and the wall being shot or being shipped to Poland to maybe die of cold and hunger or whatever that was there.</span> <span id="s434">Surely no one came back from there.</span> <span id="s435">So I guess at some point my parents decided, "We're going to take the chance.”</span> <span id="s436">And when I think about it now, it's almost impossible to convey what it must have meant for my parents who had never defied a single law in their life in that sense.</span> <span id="s437">To defy a law that had the death penalty on it.</span> <span id="s438">But they decided.</span> <span id="s439">They made a decision.</span> <span id="s440">Now this town was very small and there was a gentleman in town, Mr. Kohn, who was sort of the Joodse Raad, the member of the committee in Delft who was to oversee shipment of people from Delft.</span> <span id="s441">I guess he was made responsible or whatever.</span> <span id="s442">He was a German Jew who had immigrated to Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">He knew what it was all about I think.</span> <span id="s444">And he said, "I'll give you a warning when they come to get you.”</span> <span id="s445">And I guess as close as I can find out, in October 1942, the warning came.</span> <span id="s446">They're coming to get you.</span> <span id="s447">My father and mother, two brothers, and I just put on coats and walked out of the house.</span> <span id="s448">Shut the door behind us and walked out.</span> <span id="s449">And walked to a different part in Delft...outskirts of Delft where we had some friends of the family.</span> <span id="s450">Two older people and two daughters, friends of my parents and settled down there for that day and that night.</span> <span id="s451">And that's how we left our house.</span> <span id="s452">And I guess we didn't back to Delft until maybe June 1945.</span> <span id="s453">Interesting enough, my wife, Carla, was hidden in Delft, the town that I that I had left.</span> <span id="s454">And you'll get that story too of course.</span> <span id="s455">Well, from here on, it becomes my story.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: What do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: Well, I once...I need dates a little bit for my...these are only monthly dates.</span> <span id="s458">They are not exact dates, but I need them for my own reference because it gets kind of confusing.</span> <span id="s459">And I'm not so sure that this is even correct.</span> <span id="s460">In any case,</span></p> <p><span id="s461">01:41: it's my guess that I stayed there about 3 months.</span> <span id="s462">The families was called the Nieuwenhuizens.</span> <span id="s463">He was an older gentleman who worked as an amanuensis at the university.</span> <span id="s464">A very wonderful old man and his wife and they had a young daughter.</span> <span id="s465">And I stayed in a little room.</span> <span id="s466">That first evening we dispersed.</span> <span id="s467">My little brothers went to my grandfather in Amsterdam, and I can't tell you much more about them from there on.</span> <span id="s468">But those stories are all with my brothers.</span> <span id="s469">My parents went to some friends somewhere else near The Hague.</span> <span id="s470">And so that same evening we were all dispersed, and we didn't really get together again until after the war.</span> <span id="s471">All of us.</span> <span id="s472">I was the only one who stayed at this address...at the Nieuwenhuizens, and I stayed there for about 3 months.</span> <span id="s473">And all of a sudden, life was very strange.</span> <span id="s474">I had no more parents, of course.</span> <span id="s475">I had these very loving people, friends.</span> <span id="s476">But this was a strange business.</span> <span id="s477">I had nothing to do.</span> <span id="s478">I mean I would sit there in this little room and read a little bit.</span> <span id="s479">I fell in love with the girl, of course.</span> <span id="s480">What else was there to do?</span> <span id="s481">She would have none of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Tell us about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: I can't tell you very much.</span> <span id="s484">She was gorgeous.</span> <span id="s485">There were a couple...they must have been.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">I don't know how this happened.</span> <span id="s487">They must have been like in their 40s maybe.</span> <span id="s488">They looked much older.</span> <span id="s489">They were like old people to me.</span> <span id="s490">They had this gorgeous young daughter.</span> <span id="s491">Beautiful, long hair.</span> <span id="s492">I can't tell you very much about her.</span> <span id="s493">I talked with her.</span> <span id="s494">I tried to... See...how old was I?</span> <span id="s495">14.</span> <span id="s496">I tried to get her into bed.</span> <span id="s497">She wouldn't.</span> <span id="s498">I wouldn't know what to do with her probably, but anyway I was very much in love.</span> <span id="s499">I was very lonely already right away.</span> <span id="s500">I was there from what I could figure out till about January 1942 [43].</span> <span id="s501">I couldn't stay very long.</span> <span id="s502">I couldn't stay very long anywhere really.</span> <span id="s503">My mother then sort of took over during...when we were all dispersed who started to pretty soon and arranged to find places for the family.</span> <span id="s504">And this is the reason why she was later on caught.</span> <span id="s505">She was the one...the only one who traveled.</span> <span id="s506">She had a false identity card, just like mine.</span> <span id="s507">And she traveled and found places.</span> <span id="s508">She had contacts here and there I presume with the underground.</span> <span id="s509">I'm not quite sure.</span> <span id="s510">I really don't know.</span> <span id="s511">But the second address I went to were friends of my father when he was a young man.</span> <span id="s512">So we're talking about...talking about 1942....we're talking about 19...between 1920 and 1925.</span> <span id="s513">He had lived in Utrecht.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">He'd been a musician.</span> <span id="s515">I think he had been in love with one of the sisters.</span> <span id="s516">There were three sisters.</span> <span id="s517">Now they were all old and middle-aged ladies.</span> <span id="s518">And somehow another they talked one of the ladies I think her name was Fie Troost, T-R-O-O-S-t, Troost into taking me.</span> <span id="s519">Now remember the...the penalty for taking in Jews was death.</span> <span id="s520">That was for sure.</span> <span id="s521">So if you took some one in, if you were discovered that's it.</span> <span id="s522">You forfeited your life.</span> <span id="s523">By this time I was, of course, a fugitive.</span> <span id="s524">And I went to this Feetje Troost.</span> <span id="s525">I think her name was Fietje Troost, and she lived together with another woman, a younger woman who was a receptionist at a hotel, and I settled in there.</span> <span id="s526">I had a beautiful room.</span> <span id="s527">I have a picture of that in the pictures that I gave you...the two ladies, and I have a view of the church tower which I made a nice sketch of.</span> <span id="s528">My father used to sketch by the way.</span> <span id="s529">He was always sort of amateur painter or sketcher and I sort of followed in his steps.</span> <span id="s530">I liked the idea.</span> <span id="s531">And I started sketching a little bit.</span> <span id="s532">So I sketched.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">01:46: I had nothing to do.</span> <span id="s534">Days went by with me sitting in the room.</span> <span id="s535">But there was a piano there.</span> <span id="s536">So I got my piano books, songs with piano books, and started practicing the piano a couple hours a day.</span> <span id="s537">I stayed with these ladies, and at night I would go out after dark.</span> <span id="s538">I would take a small walk around the block.</span> <span id="s539">Now in those days it was war time.</span> <span id="s540">And everything was dark, blacked out.</span> <span id="s541">You know, there was a black out.</span> <span id="s542">So it was a little easier to get out of the house and nobody could see you really.</span> <span id="s543">The streets were pitch...pitch black.</span> <span id="s544">The only thing that you could see in the light was like little flashlight that people had and cars had little slits...you know, the head lights were blocked off, and little slits left open.</span> <span id="s545">And so everything was very dark.</span> <span id="s546">So it was relatively safe to walk out, take a walk around the block and get a little fresh air.</span> <span id="s547">I also visited some of Fie's sisters....Fietje's sisters...this lady's sisters who lived about 15 minutes walk away in another part of Utrecht.</span> <span id="s548">Is it okay that I go into so much detail?</span> <span id="s549">Bizarre things happened sometimes during the war.</span> <span id="s550">Here I was a fugitive kid.</span> <span id="s551">I was 16 years old at that time.</span> <span id="s552">And I would walk over in the dark towards that other home to this lady's sister.</span> <span id="s553">That lady's sister had a daughter.</span> <span id="s554">She was a illegitimate child conceived by a German years and years ago before the war.</span> <span id="s555">These lady's...since there was the mother, the sister of Fee and the daughter who was...about 20 is my guess, had always been kind of pro-German because the mother had conceived this child by a German.</span> <span id="s556">And the child was half German in a sense.</span> <span id="s557">The child would be kind of attracted to German soldiers to go out.</span> <span id="s558">Not the common street soldier I think, but officers.</span> <span id="s559">I was with these strange people.</span> <span id="s560">In addition, in this house they rented a room to a German officer.</span> <span id="s561">He was not a member of the army.</span> <span id="s562">He was a member of the railroad corps or something like that.</span> <span id="s563">The Germans liked uniforms so everybody had lots of uniforms.</span> <span id="s564">My father always said, "There's nothing a German likes more than uniforms.”</span> <span id="s565">This guy had a elaborate uniform, and actually all he was a clerk I presume or a little higher level clerk in the railroad stations.</span> <span id="s566">Of course, all the railroads had been taken over by the Germans because this was vital to the war.</span> <span id="s567">I'll tell you something bizarre which I'm ashamed at this point.</span> <span id="s568">But it's some clowning around in that basement where these ladies lived which by the way was a basement apartment...part of the house was a basement apartment.</span> <span id="s569">I would I once donned the whole uniform of this officer, strutted around in his boots with his cap on and his black...sort of blackish dark blue and everybody applauded.</span> <span id="s570">They thought it was wonderful the way I looked.</span> <span id="s571">I can't imagine</span></p> <p><span id="s572">01:50: doing this now.</span> <span id="s573">But I did.</span> <span id="s574">They were very lovely.</span> <span id="s575">The dangers seems enormous at this point while I'm retelling it.</span> <span id="s576">To go to these people...their heart was in the right place.</span> <span id="s577">They would have never said that they had a Jew visiting, because I was a son of an artist, Nardus, their childhood friend.</span> <span id="s578">Anyway, I stayed with these ladies for ...I have here from January 43 to July 43.</span> <span id="s579">That's my guess.</span> <span id="s580">I'm not quite sure.</span> <span id="s581">Seems...everything seems much longer.</span> <span id="s582">But when I tried to schedule this out until the end of the war, I got in the end compressed.</span> <span id="s583">It was shorter than I thought.</span> <span id="s584">From there I'm not quite sure where we went, but I think what happened was that my parents...I should back track for a second.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">My parents wound up in the middle of Holland in a place called Soest.</span> <span id="s586">They wound up for the better part of the war with a couple.</span> <span id="s587">He was an ex-Marine.</span> <span id="s588">She was a ex-cleaning lady.</span> <span id="s589">And these people had taken my parents in a room.</span> <span id="s590">So they were always in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">This is where my mother knitted.</span> <span id="s592">My father did sketching and went crazy sometimes because no matter how good the relations were, eventually some friction would ensue with all these people, four people in a tight space, a little house.</span> <span id="s593">Irritations set in.</span> <span id="s594">My parents decided that it would be wonderful if they could find a little summer place for just a week to escape and just go like ordinary non-Jewish people.</span> <span id="s595">Stay a week somewhere in a little hotel.</span> <span id="s596">By the way, my father and I had dyed our hair.</span> <span id="s597">It was supposed to come out blonde.</span> <span id="s598">We dyed it with peroxide I remember except that I don't know how Pop came out.</span> <span id="s599">I came out red.</span> <span id="s600">For the rest of the war, I had to keep this up by the way because in Holland anybody who was not blonde and Dutch I mean you know, Jews you could almost pick them out from a crowd in Holland.</span> <span id="s601">There were no Italians.</span> <span id="s602">There weren't any Spanish-speaking people.</span> <span id="s603">The only sort of little bit outlandish looking...well, the darker looking people were Jews.</span> <span id="s604">Not outlandish...darker looking.</span> <span id="s605">So, anyway we dyed our hair and...and Pop and my mother decided they'd go and rent.</span> <span id="s606">They rented a room in a little hotel in a very tiny hamlet called Lage Vuursche.</span> <span id="s607">Lage Vuursche was to play quite a role in my life, I guess.</span> <span id="s608">Lage Vuursche was a little hotel and a gas station I think and five houses and that was it.</span> <span id="s609">It was very lovely.</span> <span id="s610">It was like a little hamlet in the middle of the woods.</span> <span id="s611">And Papa went and rented this rented this room for a week and moved in.</span> <span id="s612">On sort of sideline this because it's important what my father and mother did at that point, they, as Pop told me later on, he said we weren't in that room for more than 15 minutes and there was a knock at the door, and there was a policeman there.</span> <span id="s613">And he said, "I want to talk with you people.”</span> <span id="s614">And Papa and Mother knew that was the end.</span> <span id="s615">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">01:54:21 They were caught.</span> <span id="s617">However, the man closed the door behind him and sat down and said, "I want to tell you something.”</span> <span id="s618">He said, "I'm a policeman in this village.”</span> <span id="s619">He said, "And I can readily see that you are Jews.”</span> <span id="s620">He said, "I want to tell you where you should walk and where you should not walk.”</span> <span id="s621">He said, "I'll protect you.”</span> <span id="s622">He said, "If anything goes wrong, I'll tell you.”</span> <span id="s623">This is the man I showed you a picture of, a man sitting with his wife and a child.</span> <span id="s624">This is the policeman.</span> <span id="s625">I do not know his name anymore.</span> <span id="s626">He was an angel to all of us.</span> <span id="s627">From what I remember, I joined my father and mother...not in that hotel room, but in a little house called Ons Huis(?)</span> <span id="s628">which was a sort of...I didn't know there were people like that then already, but they were people who were nature preservists.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">They had this...some did a little hiking, a little walking, and somehow or other my parents spent some time in that house and I went there too and we joined and I was for a little I don't know, maybe a week, but I can remember together with my parents in that place.</span> <span id="s630">Now, I had to go somewhere else.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: At that point, let's hold it.</span> <span id="s632">They're going to change tapes.</span> <span id="s633">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: Great idea.</span> <span id="s636">I would like to go to the bathroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s638">We can get started again.</span> <span id="s639">Let's pick up where we left off.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s641">We're now at July 1943 and after having spent maybe a week with my parents at this this nature lover's retreat...someone found a new place for me.</span> <span id="s642">Now, I don't know who.</span> <span id="s643">It's the first time that I went to work on a farm.</span> <span id="s644">Now, you gotta realize I was a teenager from the city.</span> <span id="s645">I'd really never done any heavy physical work in my life.</span> <span id="s646">I was rather spoiled I think.</span> <span id="s647">My father and my mother I remember accompanying me not very far from this place in Lage Vuursche, this little hamlet, to a road that led into farm land, grassy farm land, along a canal and you went a couple of miles and you wound up at this tiny little farmhouse.</span> <span id="s648">Far away from really everything.</span> <span id="s649">That's how I remember it anyway.</span> <span id="s650">And a Dutch farm in that part of the country was very small and was all dairy and a few cows, and that's about all the farm I had.</span> <span id="s651">I don't remember him having a wife.</span> <span id="s652">I have a feeling that he had.</span> <span id="s653">Now this is the first that I was placed in a place where the farmer didn't know I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s654">I was now from then on...I was a Christian kid from the city where in the meantime food became less, you know.</span> <span id="s655">I mean it's harder to get and everything was rationed since the Germans stole every damn thing away.</span> <span id="s656">And this was sort of like a pose I presume as a kid from the city who needed fattening up and he would work for his keep.</span> <span id="s657">So here I was, of course, with my red hair and dropped off at this farm.</span> <span id="s658">And the first thing I had to do was wear wooden shoes.</span> <span id="s659">Because that part of Holland is all I would say practically below water level I guess.</span> <span id="s660">It was all green land, all meadows with.</span> <span id="s661">.</span> <span id="s662">with every hundred yards or so little canals to...to drain off the water.</span> <span id="s663">So wherever you went it was wet.</span> <span id="s664">First thing, I had to get pair of wooden shoes because that is the ideal wear in places like that so.</span> <span id="s665">I remember I'm mentioning this because wooden shoes, if you're not used to them, they're hell on your feet.</span> <span id="s666">They will chafe open the upper part of your feet and your heels and this is what I did.</span> <span id="s667">For about a week, I'd walk around with this blood in my...in these wooden shoes.</span> <span id="s668">It's really okay for people who are used to it, but I got used to it.</span> <span id="s669">You grow callouses very fast.</span> <span id="s670">I had to get up at 4 o'clock in the morning and milk cows.</span> <span id="s671">I had to learn how to milk cows, then carry the, you know, 40 gallon cans to a little boat.</span> <span id="s672">Put them in a little row boat, then row them down to the end of the canal where I presume a cart would pick them up.</span> <span id="s673">Other parts were cleaning out stables spreading manure, mowing grassland, feeding the animals, and</span></p> <p><span id="s674">02:04:50 helping by the birth of one.</span> <span id="s675">I remember pulling out a calf with ropes.</span> <span id="s676">For me it was hell.</span> <span id="s677">It was utter hell.</span> <span id="s678">I mean I was only 16 or 17 years old.</span> <span id="s679">I had no parents.</span> <span id="s680">I was in constant danger of my life.</span> <span id="s681">By then I knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s682">One wrong word, one wrong move, one wrong clue and I would have had it.</span> <span id="s683">Farmer would have said when(??)</span> <span id="s684">and he would have maybe denounced me.</span> <span id="s685">Right?</span> <span id="s686">Would have maybe collected some reward for delivering a Jew to the Nazis.</span> <span id="s687">So, it's in that time my mother said and she swore that I have said this several times.</span> <span id="s688">I don't remember anything of it.</span> <span id="s689">My mother swore that during...especially during that time I wanted to give myself up.</span> <span id="s690">I didn't want to hide anymore.</span> <span id="s691">I remember nothing of this.</span> <span id="s692">But my mother has...kept good records in her head usually so I believe and she wouldn't make this up.</span> <span id="s693">She said, "You were so desperate that you wanted to give yourself up and I kept saying to you...we kept saying to you, "It will pass.</span> <span id="s694">It will pass.”</span> <span id="s695">My mother had a little sign.</span> <span id="s696">It said, 'This also will pass.'"</span> <span id="s697">So things were pretty grim then.</span> <span id="s698">I was a very lonely kid.</span> <span id="s699">I learned to work, but it wasn't easy.</span> <span id="s700">The farmer was very unhappy.</span> <span id="s701">I was not much help in the beginning.</span> <span id="s702">I couldn't lift 40-gallon cans.</span> <span id="s703">You know...you gotta know how to do it.</span> <span id="s704">I could barely walk in those God damn shoes.</span> <span id="s705">I wasn't there very long.</span> <span id="s706">From what I could find out, I must have been there from July 43 until September 43.</span> <span id="s707">In looking at the map, the farm must have been in place called Tienhoven (?)</span> <span id="s708">.</span> <span id="s709">It's the closest I can find out.</span> <span id="s710">I don't remember the man's name.</span> <span id="s711">I remember that we ate badly.</span> <span id="s712">He was very poor.</span> <span id="s713">It was a poor little farm.</span> <span id="s714">Where did I go from there?</span> <span id="s715">Let me see.</span> <span id="s716">Yeah, it seems to me that from September 43 for about a month, I went to my Aunt Clara in The Hague where my cousin Hans lived.</span> <span id="s717">I have two more cousins, Hans, Fritz, and Tony.</span> <span id="s718">They all lived in The Hague in a small house.</span> <span id="s719">And I stayed with my Aunt Clara and I stayed with my Aunt Clara's in-laws, older people.</span> <span id="s720">And I think it can't have been for very long.</span> <span id="s721">It can't have been mostly a couple of weeks or a month.</span> <span id="s722">And...yes...I remember being at my cousin Hans's grandfather and grandmother, my Aunt Clara's in-laws in The Hague.</span> <span id="s723">They only lived a couple of streets apart, so I could walk from the one to the other.</span> <span id="s724">And I was with these older people and they were very...very sweet.</span> <span id="s725">But they only would take me for a week.</span> <span id="s726">That was my....</span> <span id="s727">They were scared.</span> <span id="s728">It was all scary.</span> <span id="s729">During that week, their son came to visit...my Aunt Clara's former husband.</span> <span id="s730">They had been divorced.</span> <span id="s731">And I can remember he came unexpectedly and I threw myself under the couch.</span> <span id="s732">And I was lying there and I saw these footsteps going...his shoes going by.</span> <span id="s733">But that whole period in The Hague, that couple of weeks or whatever it was was very wonderful.</span> <span id="s734">It was with my family and my aunt.</span> <span id="s735">It was with my cousin.</span> <span id="s736">My cousin, Hans, and I would go out in the evening for a walk.</span> <span id="s737">In the daytime, of course, I was always indoors.</span> <span id="s738">In the evening we'd go and at night we'd go out and we would go to the Catholic Church and we'd sit in the back of the Catholic Church.</span> <span id="s739">I had never been in my life in a Catholic Church.</span> <span id="s740">So here was all this ceremony going on.</span> <span id="s741">And it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s742">I thought that.</span> <span id="s743">They would come by with these censers and they...and the hats and all the...I thought I'd seen the Pope every time.</span> <span id="s744">I said...I came back to my Aunt Clara, "I saw the Pope.”</span> <span id="s745">And she laughed.</span> <span id="s746">This was our entertainment.</span> <span id="s747">We'd go to the church and sit in the back in a pew and watch the processions going.</span> <span id="s748">It it was a wonderful time, but we couldn't stay there.</span> <span id="s749">Everybody was dead scared, you know.</span> <span id="s750">My Aunt who was Jewish herself, of course.</span> <span id="s751">Her children...the only thing that saved her I guess was her children were half Jewish.</span> <span id="s752">So I had to leave.</span> <span id="s753">Now from my recollection what happened was that from there in October 1943, I went back with the help of this policeman to the Lage Vuursche, but not to that little hotel where my parents had stayed for a week.</span> <span id="s754">The policeman had helped to I say build a camp, a underground resistance camp, in one of the woods nearby.</span> <span id="s755">It was right next to a Catholic, what do you call a place where nuns?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: Convent.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Convent.</span> <span id="s758">Right next to a convent.</span> <span id="s759">There was the fence of the convent and then there was...in Holland, you don't really have large forests.</span> <span id="s760">And in Lage Vuursche at that time, they were like rectangles of forests.</span> <span id="s761">Not very high trees...trees maybe 50, 60 feet maybe at most or something you know.</span> <span id="s762">all planted...these were planted forests.</span> <span id="s763">In the middle of that, the resistance...members of the resistance had dug out a camp.</span> <span id="s764">It was half underground and then covered with timbers and on the timbers sod and on top of the sod, grass and trees and plants.</span> <span id="s765">So that if you would stand right next to it, you wouldn't know it was there.</span> <span id="s766">The entrance to it...well, there was one entrance.</span> <span id="s767">It was sort of dug out was hidden by little pine trees that were cut from some other forests and put there so that...and footsteps were erased, so that you could stand almost in front of this place and you wouldn't know there was anything there.</span> <span id="s768">The entrance to this underground resistance camp was by a very cicuitous road.</span> <span id="s769">It started if...if you can visualize a rectangle...it started in one end and you sort of...it's a little bit like one of these puzzles...how to get out of the maze.</span> <span id="s770">It would swirl around and swirl around and then finally wind up in the center at this camp.</span> <span id="s771">This was in order...also to not have a straight path and not see footsteps and all that.</span> <span id="s772">It was very cleverly done.</span> <span id="s773">Food was and I must mention this wonderful... Food was delivered to us by the nuns of the convent.</span> <span id="s774">Food was delivered to us on their side of the fence and we would lift it over the fence.</span> <span id="s775">It was a high fence...about a 6 or 8 foot high fence.</span> <span id="s776">We would...either we had cut an opening.</span> <span id="s777">Warm food in the evening.</span> <span id="s778">Yes.</span> <span id="s779">It was wonderful.</span> <span id="s780">Nobody knew at first.</span> <span id="s781">The nuns didn't know anything.</span> <span id="s782">The convent was a convent.</span> <span id="s783">The only one who kept all the contact was the policeman.</span> <span id="s784">He had to come back between the nuns and the Nazis.</span> <span id="s785">Now this man posed as a Nazi you see.</span> <span id="s786">This man had intimate contact with the Germans, who thought he was real hero.</span> <span id="s787">You see, there was a Dutch Nazi party called the NSB, The National Socialist Bond and he was a member of that.</span> <span id="s788">He posed very cleverly as a Nazi and played a dual role.</span> <span id="s789">His real heart was with us, I must say.</span> <span id="s790">I was in that camp I do not know how long.</span> <span id="s791">I tried to find out.</span> <span id="s792">It seemed to be me I can't have been there any longer than 1 to 3 months really.</span> <span id="s793">It seemed like a long time.</span> <span id="s794">In that camp I was a non-active member because I was very young first of all.</span> <span id="s795">Most of the members were grown up men.</span> <span id="s796">And the only thing that I actively did there was when they would bring in English or American flying personnel that had been shot down somewhere in Holland some of those they would convey to our underground hideout and I remember I spoke English for some reason.</span> <span id="s797">Now I had lived, of course, for 3 years in the States when I was a little kid, like I told you but I spoke enough English for some...I can't recall how.</span> <span id="s798">I learned some English in high school.</span> <span id="s799">I forgot.</span> <span id="s800">Yeah.</span> <span id="s801">I learned some English in high school and I guess probably what was still resided in the back of my head.</span> <span id="s802">I was designated to find out if these guys were for real because the Nazi would sometimes pose fake flyers and and that discover members of the underground.</span> <span id="s803">So I was designated to sit with these men and interview them.</span> <span id="s804">You know, just like you're interviewing me now, but in a very casual manner and find out if they were real or not.</span> <span id="s805">And I remember sitting up a whole night with a English navigator and a Canadian gunner to find out and they were real alright.</span> <span id="s806">Because the Canadian gunner told me about he would hunt bears.</span> <span id="s807">And their river somewhere in the north near the polar circle and he talked very real.</span> <span id="s808">And the English was differently, told about his family and his home somewhere in England.</span> <span id="s809">So that's what I did.</span> <span id="s810">And the rest I don't know what I did.</span> <span id="s811">I guess I learned to play chess.</span> <span id="s812">We listened to classical music.</span> <span id="s813">We had...the members were all over the place as far as denomination or whatever...religions.</span> <span id="s814">There was one communists.</span> <span id="s815">There was one very Christian man.</span> <span id="s816">There was a shoemaker.</span> <span id="s817">There was a bookkeeper.</span> <span id="s818">And there were people who would come in and out.</span> <span id="s819">Women, messengers nearby in the woods were covered caches of guns and ammunition and all that.</span> <span id="s820">They would go out on night raids and raid town halls and city halls for stamps such as you can see on my false</span></p> <p><span id="s821">02:17:17 identity card.</span> <span id="s822">So we had there a whole like place where they would also steal identify cards and they would falsify them.</span> <span id="s823">So this was sort of like a center like that.</span> <span id="s824">Sometime my guess it was December...sometime during December 1943, our policeman...our friendly policeman gave the warning that he had heard rumors about a raid and it was decided by the members of the camp that we would post guards on the periphery near where the road was...in shifts.</span> <span id="s825">And it happened that a young man...shoemaker...and I got the shift from midnight until or maybe from 4 AM to 8...8 AM.</span> <span id="s826">I think we had four hour shifts.</span> <span id="s827">Everybody else was in bed in the camp.</span> <span id="s828">It was very quiet.</span> <span id="s829">It was very quiet in the morning.</span> <span id="s830">It was overcast.</span> <span id="s831">It was dark.</span> <span id="s832">It was 4 o'clock in the morning, 5.</span> <span id="s833">We heard noise.</span> <span id="s834">We heard like trucks coming up the road, and these little slits of lights and then we saw them come driving up the road.</span> <span id="s835">Now we thought maybe they'd pass by.</span> <span id="s836">Maybe it was just a German convoy going someplace else.</span> <span id="s837">But they stopped like 200 yards away from us.</span> <span id="s838">And they started to dismount.</span> <span id="s839">There were hundreds.</span> <span id="s840">They dismounted, they had dogs.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">They had machine guns.</span> <span id="s842">They lined up in hundreds.</span> <span id="s843">Their information was sketchy I presume.</span> <span id="s844">They didn't know what they were going to find.</span> <span id="s845">They knew there was a resistance camp there.</span> <span id="s846">They thought...maybe have thought find a couple hundred resistance men with...with guns.</span> <span id="s847">They came with searchlights.</span> <span id="s848">It was a big, big operation.</span> <span id="s849">As soon as we realized this was it, we ran back to this path...this crazy path...ran into the...into the camp, shouted at the top of our lungs, "The Germans...the Germans.</span> <span id="s850">They're coming.</span> <span id="s851">They're here.</span> <span id="s852">They're here.”</span> <span id="s853">Well, it was pandemonium.</span> <span id="s854">You know, these guys trying to jump out of their beds in pajamas and without pajamas trying to get into clothes.</span> <span id="s855">We didn't stop.</span> <span id="s856">As soon as we realized that everybody had been, you know, knew what it was, we fled out.</span> <span id="s857">And just as we were fled out of this rectangle of woods, we saw the Germans coming from around the corner on that side and around the corner on this side, circling.</span> <span id="s858">So he and I..</span> <span id="s859">.</span> <span id="s860">this young man who I don't know his name anymore, just ran into the next wood and into the next wood and into the next wood, and we ran and ran and ran.</span> <span id="s861">We must have run for, I don't know, maybe three quarters of an hour till we were far, far away from that place.</span> <span id="s862">We had made an agreement though...the members of this resistance camp...they were very well organized.</span> <span id="s863">They said if ever there's a raid we will meet again after it's over at a certain, particular place about 2 miles from the camp.</span> <span id="s864">This was the way it was organized.</span> <span id="s865">So we ran and ran and ran and we really didn't know where the hell to go and I said, "You know what?</span> <span id="s866">My father is taking painting lessons somewhere.”</span> <span id="s867">Pop you see we had a strange kind of hiding life.</span> <span id="s868">Papa and my mother were hiding in this room, but once a week Pop would get out on his bicycle I think and peddle to this nearby town where there was a painter who gave him lessons.</span> <span id="s869">I'm not sure this...this painter knew he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s870">I think he probably did.</span> <span id="s871">I know my brothers and I have paintings hanging on his mantle.</span> <span id="s872">So I have a painting by Mr.Schluter of all many other German names.</span> <span id="s873">Mr. Schluter.</span> <span id="s874">It's a very good painting...Dutch painting.</span> <span id="s875">So I knew Pop was there.</span> <span id="s876">How I don't know.</span> <span id="s877">I guess it was like a Wednesday or whatever.</span> <span id="s878">So I said, "Let's go there.”</span> <span id="s879">What I didn't realize at that point that I been so shocked.</span> <span id="s880">I'm sitting here, I'm still shocked now.</span> <span id="s881">At that point I didn't realize.</span> <span id="s882">I was like just a boy running.</span> <span id="s883">I thought, "Well, we ran and we made it.”</span> <span id="s884">Somehow or another I found this painter.</span> <span id="s885">This boy and I we came there.</span> <span id="s886">This young man and I, we came there and there was my father sitting and painting and very quiet.</span> <span id="s887">And I said, "Pop, I got to talk with you.”</span> <span id="s888">He said, "Yes.”</span> <span id="s889">I said, "Something terrible is happening.”</span> <span id="s890">He said, "What happened?"</span> <span id="s891">I said, "The Germans came for us.”</span> <span id="s892">"Oh," he said.</span> <span id="s893">"Well," he said, "You're here now.”</span> <span id="s894">Pop never understood things too well.</span> <span id="s895">"Well, you're here now.</span> <span id="s896">Relax.”</span> <span id="s897">I said, "Yes, but all these men are there and they're all surrounded.”</span> <span id="s898">He said, "Oh.</span> <span id="s899">What do you want to do?"</span> <span id="s900">I said, "I don't know what to do.”</span> <span id="s901">Christ, I was only...what was I..</span> <span id="s902">.16, 17 years old boy.</span> <span id="s903">I didn't know what the hell to do in this situation.</span> <span id="s904">Nobody did ever tell if they later come with...as later on found half a division of men with search lights and dogs and machine guns and anti-aircraft...anti...I mean anti-tank guns and anti-aircraft stuff.</span> <span id="s905">I mean...not to shoot down planes, but kind of, you know guns to...heavier stuff.</span> <span id="s906">They didn't know what they would find.</span> <span id="s907">I said, "Pop, we suppose to meet later on again after dark.”</span> <span id="s908">"Oh," he said, "Well, okay.</span> <span id="s909">Then stay here for a time and then you'll meet them after dark.”</span> <span id="s910">So we stayed there from all I can remember.</span> <span id="s911">Well, I was...you know, I was in shock.</span> <span id="s912">Pop didn't know it.</span> <span id="s913">Nobody else knew it.</span> <span id="s914">I didn't know it.</span> <span id="s915">It got dark.</span> <span id="s916">Pop in the meantime, I guess, had gone back to his...peddled back to my mother's and gone into his room again and he must have told my mother what was going on.</span> <span id="s917">My mother was much sharper, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Always was.</span> <span id="s919">It got dark, and this young man and I wandered back into what we didn't realize was a huge net which had been set up by the Germans...wondered back into this hugh circle and waited at this spot.</span> <span id="s920">Nobody showed up.</span> <span id="s921">Except one person.</span> <span id="s922">My mother.</span> <span id="s923">She said to the young man and to me...she said, "We will just act like we are lovers.</span> <span id="s924">We will just be a threesome and we'll laugh and we'll act.”</span> <span id="s925">I said, "What about my gun?"</span> <span id="s926">I had a 9 millimeter Mauser pistol with me and so did he.</span> <span id="s927">We were armed.</span> <span id="s928">My mother took the guns and she buried them somewhere under a tree and we got to a point where there was a German guard.</span> <span id="s929">Then we laughed it up and we kissed and we hugged and he laughed and he let us through.</span> <span id="s930">And I spent that first night...the boy I don't know where he went, but he went off some place else.</span> <span id="s931">I went with my parents to their hiding place, and spent a night...restless, every home there...their place was right on the highway.</span> <span id="s932">Every time a truck came back I was like this.</span> <span id="s933">For years afterwards, every time a truck went by.</span> <span id="s934">I stayed only one night there because they didn't dare to have me in addition, of course, and I went into a..</span> <span id="s935">.</span> <span id="s936">I was I think again helped by this policeman.</span> <span id="s937">I went for a short while in Hilversum.</span> <span id="s938">It's a nearby town to a home of a notary public and his sister.</span> <span id="s939">Lovely people.</span> <span id="s940">Lived in a mansion from what I remember.</span> <span id="s941">It's probably larger...rather a large house.</span> <span id="s942">They gave me a room with maid service.</span> <span id="s943">Yeah.</span> <span id="s944">Gave me a room with maid service, and it was just what I needed because there's a little picture in the group of small pictures of hiding places that looks out on the garden.</span> <span id="s945">That was my view.</span> <span id="s946">And there was a bookcase.</span> <span id="s947">I was growing up fast.</span> <span id="s948">By then, I wasn't anymore a boy I think.</span> <span id="s949">It's an interesting thing what happened to me there in that I came from a family that was terribly non-religious.</span> <span id="s950">Matter of fact, my father hated anything that smacked of religion.</span> <span id="s951">He always felt that priests and ministers and rabbis were all the same breed and organized religion was hell, and he didn't want to have anything to do with it.</span> <span id="s952">I never was religious either.</span> <span id="s953">I didn't know anything about being Jewish very much.</span> <span id="s954">I was in that room and there was a Bible in the bookcase.</span> <span id="s955">It was a Bible for reading.</span> <span id="s956">A nice big edition.</span> <span id="s957">I'd never read a word in the Bible in my life.</span> <span id="s958">I thought it would be interesting to...as I said, I said I was growing up fast.</span> <span id="s959">I thought maybe I should read something, and something philosophical.</span> <span id="s960">I grabbed the Bible.</span> <span id="s961">I opened it.</span> <span id="s962">I opened it onto one of the prophets.</span> <span id="s963">I think Jeremiah.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">And what I read was, 'and you shall try to sell yourself and nobody will want to buy you, and you shall try to hide and nobody...nobody will take you.'</span> <span id="s965">And on and on and on it went.</span> <span id="s966">And I said, "Gees, this is my story.</span> <span id="s967">This is me.”</span> <span id="s968">You know.</span> <span id="s969">I got instant religion, I got instant...it was not instant.</span> <span id="s970">I read through the whole Old Testament.</span> <span id="s971">It was a revelation to me.</span> <span id="s972">Something to hold on to.</span> <span id="s973">All of a sudden, here was my people.</span> <span id="s974">This is my history.</span> <span id="s975">And I pledged...I pledged to God if he would save all my family, I would be religious to the end of my life.</span> <span id="s976">I'm ashamed to say I didn't keep the promise.</span> <span id="s977">I tried to keep it for some years after the war, but it slowly leaked away, especially after I found out that God had let 6 million others perish.</span> <span id="s978">Anyway, I got instant religion.</span> <span id="s979">And I got a Bible.</span> <span id="s980">I got a Bible.</span> <span id="s981">I think I got it for free from the Bible Society.</span> <span id="s982">And I carried that Bible with me from there on wherever I went.</span> <span id="s983">I went from that house...I went back to farming.</span> <span id="s984">But in better farms.</span> <span id="s985">I went from December...We're now at December 43 and I must have been there a few weeks in this house, maybe a month and I recuperated to a great extent.</span> <span id="s986">At least the jitters left me.</span> <span id="s987">I had been very close to death I realized.</span> <span id="s988">And I went out to a farm.</span> <span id="s989">I don't know if the policeman again helped me there with the first farm.</span> <span id="s990">It may well have been because I have the feeling these people knew I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s991">This was an entirely different kind of farm.</span> <span id="s992">This was in the eastern part of Holland more...this was a rotund farm with rotund wife and three rotund daughters.</span> <span id="s993">Big apple cheeks, just like you expect farmers to look.</span> <span id="s994">And they were jolly people, and they were friendly and they ate well.</span> <span id="s995">And by this time, I also knew how to work better.</span> <span id="s996">You know, I again cleaned stables.</span> <span id="s997">I milked cows.</span> <span id="s998">I got very good at milking.</span> <span id="s999">I could milk 14 head of cow in the morning.</span> <span id="s1000">You know, I went from that farm to another farm and there I got the shock of my life one morning.</span> <span id="s1001">And everywhere I went I read the Bible, which worked excellently because these people didn't know I was Jewish, and they thought I was a very Christian boy.</span> <span id="s1002">Little did they know I only read the Old Testament.</span> <span id="s1003">Whatever... I slept like Dutch farm hands do in a little room with a straw...bag with straw...straw in it, a straw mattress.</span> <span id="s1004">And right in with the animals portion of the house.</span> <span id="s1005">I was used to it.</span> <span id="s1006">One morning I woke up I heard German voices.</span> <span id="s1007">I thought this is it.</span> <span id="s1008">Again, this is it.</span> <span id="s1009">German voices.</span> <span id="s1010">However...I mean it was like dying.</span> <span id="s1011">I tell this now you know....</span> <span id="s1012">Well, let me finish this first.</span> <span id="s1013">It was like dying.</span> <span id="s1014">All they came to do is steal a couple of head of cattle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">They had a truck, and they carried them off you know.</span> <span id="s1016">I thought it was it.</span> <span id="s1017">This is it.</span> <span id="s1018">This is me.</span> <span id="s1019">You know, as I am telling you it seemed to me that I was in good shape.</span> <span id="s1020">However, I have been for...the last 22 years in psychotherapy and I tell this story very often over and over again to my psychiatrist.</span> <span id="s1021">That on those farms I trained myself to such an extent to forget things that if I would walk from here to the door if you had asked me at the door where did you come from, I wouldn't know.</span> <span id="s1022">If you ask me where did you go, I would say to the door.</span> <span id="s1023">But beyond that, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1024">I lived in like a tiny segment of time.</span> <span id="s1025">I presume that the past and the possible future were too awful to contemplate so that... It was a strange thing.</span> <span id="s1026">Anyway,</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">02:33:20 I worked on these farms and I worked very well.</span> <span id="s1028">The last farm I worked got to be winter from all I could find.</span> <span id="s1029">Well, now it...from December 1943 to what I figure is August 44, I worked on farms as a farm hand.</span> <span id="s1030">I would actually go to the towns where I worked and register at the town hall with my false identify card, which is quite dangerous.</span> <span id="s1031">If I would have run into someone who would have recognized what the signs of a false identify card was, I would have been caught.</span> <span id="s1032">However, they would register me.</span> <span id="s1033">These were Dutch clerks, you know.</span> <span id="s1034">My brothers were somewhere...I don't know.</span> <span id="s1035">On one of the farms my...one of my brothers...my brother, At, came over for a week and stayed with me.</span> <span id="s1036">He was billed as Ed's brother who came from the city who also needed some fattening up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Actually, he came from some hiding place that I don't know.</span> <span id="s1038">My brother could tell you.</span> <span id="s1039">My parents were still in their own...in their little place.</span> <span id="s1040">But my mother had a plan.</span> <span id="s1041">She did a lot of traveling around taking care of places for my brother.</span> <span id="s1042">My brother, Fred, almost died here.</span> <span id="s1043">I don't know...he had pneumonia, and nobody took care of him.</span> <span id="s1044">She found him with high fever somewhere, got him to a hospital.</span> <span id="s1045">You see, my mother did all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s1046">She traveled.</span> <span id="s1047">My mother had a plan.</span> <span id="s1048">She had a plan for summer of 1944.</span> <span id="s1049">She would rent a little cottage, and she would spend it together with my father there as people from the city who came to rent a little place for the summer.</span> <span id="s1050">Like you would do any place.</span> <span id="s1051">And my two brothers would come there too at times, and would be like having her children around her for a little bit my mother said.</span> <span id="s1052">And as she traveled toward my brother...let me not lose track of the time, we're now talking spring of 1944, May 1944.</span> <span id="s1053">I was working on farms.</span> <span id="s1054">My brothers were in the south of Holland, spread around.</span> <span id="s1055">My parents were still in Soest with those two people.</span> <span id="s1056">My brother traveled toward my brother or came back from my brother in the south, again arranging another home which was...my brother, At, was a very difficult child.</span> <span id="s1057">He was a very nervous child.</span> <span id="s1058">It was difficult.</span> <span id="s1059">He would wet his bed.</span> <span id="s1060">And people wouldn't have anymore.</span> <span id="s1061">And it was all very difficult.</span> <span id="s1062">I think those boys also went as Christian boys by the way, not just Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s1063">They had to pray.</span> <span id="s1064">They learned to pray and, you know, all this stuff.</span> <span id="s1065">My mother on her way back in May 44...I think it was in Utrecht, somewhere in a railroad station ran into a Gestapo character, green police member who could recognize falsified identify cards, nabbed her and sent her to a Dutch concentration camp, in Westerbork.</span> <span id="s1066">From there, she was shipped to Bergen-Belsen in the fall of 44.</span> <span id="s1067">I was at the farm.</span> <span id="s1068">Pop decided that the little house had been rented already by my mother.</span> <span id="s1069">He might as well go there.</span> <span id="s1070">He went.</span> <span id="s1071">My two little brothers were delivered there by an aunt of mine.</span> <span id="s1072">My father had two brothers.</span> <span id="s1073">I'm not quite clear.</span> <span id="s1074">At some point, we visited them because they were now not very far from where I was working on the farm, about an hour bicycling.</span> <span id="s1075">So I visited them, and decided Pop needs helps with these two boys.</span> <span id="s1076">By this time I was a man.</span> <span id="s1077">I had been</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">02:27:20 working on farms.</span> <span id="s1079">I'd been laughing at jokes about Jews at the breakfast table with farmers.</span> <span id="s1080">I had learned my lesson.</span> <span id="s1081">And I decided Pop needed help.</span> <span id="s1082">So I gave up my job at the farm.</span> <span id="s1083">bicycled and joined my father and my two brothers.</span> <span id="s1084">I guess this is around August 44.</span> <span id="s1085">And that's how four of us spent the ending of the war.</span> <span id="s1086">Minus my mother, of course, who we knew now had been shipped to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1087">We still didn't know that they were destroying Jews.</span> <span id="s1088">We still didn't know what was going on.</span> <span id="s1089">We knew there was a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1090">We didn't know they were killing people.</span> <span id="s1091">May 44, my mother was caught.</span> <span id="s1092">We spent the winter of 44 in this tiny little cottage of which you have a drawing of mine.</span> <span id="s1093">We installed a stove when it got to be winter.</span> <span id="s1094">The owner of the cottage lived right next door in a beautiful home didn't know we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1095">He thought we were family from the city who didn't have enough to eat anymore.</span> <span id="s1096">By this time things were getting very desperate in Holland.</span> <span id="s1097">And he was no friend of ours because, as Pop told me, one of the first days that he was in this cottage this gentleman said to him, "Mr. Lessing, would you like to take a walk and I'll show you the property.</span> <span id="s1098">I have many fruit trees and so on.”</span> <span id="s1099">And Pop said, "Sure.</span> <span id="s1100">Sure.”</span> <span id="s1101">And acted very civilized and took a walk around and as they were walking, the gentleman meandered in talking about the war situation which could hardly help because it had been going on then for about 4, 5 years and he said, "It's a terrible situation with the war.”</span> <span id="s1102">My father said, "No doubt.</span> <span id="s1103">No doubt.”</span> <span id="s1104">And he said, "Those Germans," he said, "they are terrible.”</span> <span id="s1105">"No doubt," said my father, "no doubt.”</span> <span id="s1106">"They are almost as bad as the Jews.”</span> <span id="s1107">"No doubt," said my father, "no doubt.</span> <span id="s1108">You said it.”</span> <span id="s1109">We then proceeded to steal every Goddamn thing we could find on his property and sell it to the farmers in the area to get bread so I mean I felt so sorry about this.</span> <span id="s1110">This man had interesting then...a natural fruit, no artificial fertilizers, nothing...no sprays...natural fruit farm.</span> <span id="s1111">He had thousands of of these what you call these...these glass jars in which you preserve...preserve fruits in.</span> <span id="s1112">Farmers wanted those very much.</span> <span id="s1113">We sold them by the hundreds and survived the war there.</span> <span id="s1114">It's a long story that.</span> <span id="s1115">I don't know how much time I still have to tell you, but to tell you stories about that little house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: Tell us some.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: Some.</span> <span id="s1118">Alright.</span> <span id="s1119">I'll tell you some of the interesting highlights.</span> <span id="s1120">Since there was no kitchen in this little cottage, we put a stove in.</span> <span id="s1121">Anything was on a very heavy protest of the gentleman next door.</span> <span id="s1122">But we said, "Well, we don't want to go back to the city.”</span> <span id="s1123">We put in a stove.</span> <span id="s1124">We needed fuel.</span> <span id="s1125">Every night my father and I would go out to a nearby woods where they had high pine trees and with our little saw we would cut apart one of the pine trees and then cut of the branches and spread them around so it wasn't too... We'd go into the forest so you wouldn't see them.</span> <span id="s1126">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1127">We'd carry this tree on our shoulders.</span> <span id="s1128">We had shoulder pads specially made, carried it home, and we cut it up into portions and the next day we would split it and we would cook.</span> <span id="s1129">We didn't have salt, so my father found that the farmers had on the corners of their meadows, bit blocks of salt for the cows to lick on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">They called it cow licks I think.</span> <span id="s1131">And we'd steal those, and we'd break those in pieces and hammer them down and then boil them in water and then out of that sediment, we'd boil away and out of that we'd have salt.</span> <span id="s1132">We got the news from the nearby homes where there many people hidden.</span> <span id="s1133">And so every night we go and listen to radio Orange so we got the news from there.</span> <span id="s1134">One morning I woke up.</span> <span id="s1135">There was something draped over the window of the cottage.</span> <span id="s1136">A huge orange parachute.</span> <span id="s1137">We're talking now about probably November 44.</span> <span id="s1138">I went out the little house and looked around and the ground was covered with parachutes and containers with...as I opened one...guns.</span> <span id="s1139">I thought, "This is trouble.</span> <span id="s1140">This is trouble for us.”</span> <span id="s1141">Radios.</span> <span id="s1142">Shoes.</span> <span id="s1143">Uniforms.</span> <span id="s1144">Everything dropped for the resistance.</span> <span id="s1145">Miss dropped.</span> <span id="s1146">Dropped in the wrong place.</span> <span id="s1147">Soon the Germans showed up.</span> <span id="s1148">I was still...I presume...too...too adventurous.</span> <span id="s1149">I stole a parachute.</span> <span id="s1150">I figured we could make blouses out of it or something.</span> <span id="s1151">You know, everything was pretty desperate.</span> <span id="s1152">Clothing, everything.</span> <span id="s1153">I took a parachute.</span> <span id="s1154">The goddamn Germans counted the containers and the parachutes and came to our little house and said, "We're missing a parachute.</span> <span id="s1155">If it isn't back here within a half hour, we shoot the four of you.</span> <span id="s1156">I just brought the parachute back.</span> <span id="s1157">They left.</span> <span id="s1158">They were really Wehrmacht.</span> <span id="s1159">They were really army.</span> <span id="s1160">They were...come to persecute Jews.</span> <span id="s1161">However, I still had hidden a container with a friend of mine under a..</span> <span id="s1162">.</span> <span id="s1163">There's a container had fallen under a tree trunk.</span> <span id="s1164">That tree had fallen over in a storm.</span> <span id="s1165">They never found it.</span> <span id="s1166">So we had some English cigarettes and we had chocolates.</span> <span id="s1167">We had a couple of things for a little while.</span> <span id="s1168">The winter of 44 was very harsh.</span> <span id="s1169">We ran out of everything.</span> <span id="s1170">We went begging for food.</span> <span id="s1171">My brothers we went begging for sandwiches, which was sometimes funny too but I won't go into detail unless I still have time.</span> <span id="s1172">But we went begging for sandwiches and we went begging for grain and then we would out of the grain make boiled bread and so on and we were far better off than some of the people in the west of Holland.</span> <span id="s1173">At least we could get our hands on some foods.</span> <span id="s1174">And we stayed there in the very harsh winter.</span> <span id="s1175">My father and I made a trip by bicycle to some of the farms where I had worked.</span> <span id="s1176">And we got a couple of eggs and a quart of milk and carried it all back.</span> <span id="s1177">And so my brothers worked too...went out begging for grain when they were thrashing.</span> <span id="s1178">.</span> <span id="s1179">when there was a thrashing machine nearby.</span> <span id="s1180">And so the winter went.</span> <span id="s1181">And we burned up trees and the forest got pretty thin, and then came the spring.</span> <span id="s1182">And it came a tremendous noise and firing and guns and we said, "This is it."</span> <span id="s1183">It was Arnhem.</span> <span id="s1184">No, sorry.</span> <span id="s1185">Got it mixed up.</span> <span id="s1186">That was in the fall, 44.</span> <span id="s1187">Tremendous firing of guns and we said, "This is it.</span> <span id="s1188">Freedom!</span> <span id="s1189">They're coming.”</span> <span id="s1190">And it was Arnhem .</span> <span id="s1191">And they got defeated as you probably know, and everything stopped for the winter.</span> <span id="s1192">But then in the spring, in April, the end of April...I think the beginning of May...May was always an important month for us.</span> <span id="s1193">Everything happened in May.</span> <span id="s1194">My birthday.</span> <span id="s1195">The Germans.</span> <span id="s1196">My mother got caught.</span> <span id="s1197">We just found out that my mother is still alive, again in May.</span> <span id="s1198">Then in May, noise came.</span> <span id="s1199">Firing started.</span> <span id="s1200">Grenades started flying over.</span> <span id="s1201">Explosions.</span> <span id="s1202">It was war.</span> <span id="s1203">And we were in the center of it.</span> <span id="s1204">So we had a dugout where we could hide.</span> <span id="s1205">And I don't know if there's enough time?</span> <span id="s1206">Is there still enough time for a little story?</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: Because this is a cute story.</span> <span id="s1209">I don't want to miss it.</span> <span id="s1210">Not everything is so heavy.</span> <span id="s1211">This is a cute story.</span> <span id="s1212">The farmers around us...we lived...the little cottage was actually in the middle of farm country.</span> <span id="s1213">There were little farms around.</span> <span id="s1214">The farmers never gave us anything.</span> <span id="s1215">We would ask them for some bread.</span> <span id="s1216">Naw, we ain't got bread.</span> <span id="s1217">We had to go a little further away and beg.</span> <span id="s1218">As the firing came nearer and nearer, branches started falling off the trees, bullets whizzing around.</span> <span id="s1219">Just like you see in a wild west movie.</span> <span id="s1220">One of the farmers came over and said, "You want a duck?"</span> <span id="s1221">My father</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">02:46:40 said, "A duck?</span> <span id="s1223">A real duck?"</span> <span id="s1224">"Yeah," you want a duck?"</span> <span id="s1225">"Yeah," said my father, "I want a duck.</span> <span id="s1226">Sure.”</span> <span id="s1227">He said, "Okay, here's a duck.”</span> <span id="s1228">We got this duck which was riddled with shrapnel.</span> <span id="s1229">It had been hit by a grenade or something.</span> <span id="s1230">Anyway, we took the pieces of steel out and we put it in the fire and started frying the duck.</span> <span id="s1231">The fighting got so heavy though that my Pop sent the boys...my brothers into the dugout with that gentleman with his family.</span> <span id="s1232">And we didn't want to leave the duck.</span> <span id="s1233">I mean a duck, we hadn't eaten any meat for God knows how long.</span> <span id="s1234">So the duck was doing okay, but the fire was getting lower so, the stuff was breezing right around our... So finally the duck was done, and we crawled on our bellies, Pop holding the pot with the duck toward the dugout.</span> <span id="s1235">And we were in this underground dugout for two days and two nights.</span> <span id="s1236">This shell fire was hell.</span> <span id="s1237">It was awful.</span> <span id="s1238">I mean it...it just holes like, you know, the size of a good size room were dug right around us.</span> <span id="s1239">And it stopped.</span> <span id="s1240">We heard voices.</span> <span id="s1241">Oh, my God, this is it.</span> <span id="s1242">Freedom.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">German voices.</span> <span id="s1244">Two German soldiers with machine guns going right over our dugout.</span> <span id="s1245">It's the last Germans I saw.</span> <span id="s1246">The last Germans in uniform I saw.</span> <span id="s1247">I don't know where they went.</span> <span id="s1248">Firing started up again.</span> <span id="s1249">It lasted for awhile.</span> <span id="s1250">Silence again.</span> <span id="s1251">I said to Pop, "Let's go out and see what's happening.”</span> <span id="s1252">Pop and I walked out of the dugout.</span> <span id="s1253">We got in front and I can't demonstrate this here.</span> <span id="s1254">We stood up and we both went right to our knees on the floor.</span> <span id="s1255">The nerve shattering...I mean the firing of these...these projectiles whizzing around you howling and exploding.</span> <span id="s1256">I could just imagine what soldiers go through in the field.</span> <span id="s1257">It had shaken us so much we couldn't we couldn't stand up for a while.</span> <span id="s1258">But to make a long story short, that was it.</span> <span id="s1259">Soon tanks were rattling by with big white stars on it.</span> <span id="s1260">And we stood at the side of the road and we waved and these guys said, "Hi.”</span> <span id="s1261">I said, "Why aren't they happy?"</span> <span id="s1262">I mean this...we cried.</span> <span id="s1263">We stood there crying at these...at these trucks went by and we couldn't believe.</span> <span id="s1264">Of course, we thought maybe they're Germans.</span> <span id="s1265">There not happy.</span> <span id="s1266">Now these guys were in the army.</span> <span id="s1267">So it was not a bad day.</span> <span id="s1268">Some more resistance of the Germans, but the village was liberated...the nearby village...of 4,000.</span> <span id="s1269">And Pop almost got killed the last minute.</span> <span id="s1270">Pop almost got killed during.</span> <span id="s1271">.</span> <span id="s1272">when the firing stopped, he said, "We should be able to get some food.”</span> <span id="s1273">Now there was a communal kitchen in the village where we would go every day and get a pail with some slop.</span> <span id="s1274">And he said, "We should go there.”</span> <span id="s1275">I said, "Pop, I don't think...you know, it's just after the battle.”</span> <span id="s1276">He said, "I should go there.</span> <span id="s1277">We have to eat something.”</span> <span id="s1278">So he went and came back very pale.</span> <span id="s1279">He said he had gone to the</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">02:50:15 edge of the village with two guys with machine guns post in the street and he had to rattle his way on the bicycle.</span> <span id="s1281">In those days there were no more tires that had air in them.</span> <span id="s1282">So we made tires out of old car tires.</span> <span id="s1283">We cut strips of old car tires.</span> <span id="s1284">But, of course, this was solid.</span> <span id="s1285">It was like driving on wood you know.</span> <span id="s1286">I mean it was like the bicycle rattled and made a horrendous noise, so these two Canadian soldiers must have heard him coming from a mile.</span> <span id="s1287">But they were on their alert, and he rattled right in front of them and he pointed the machine gun on him and said, "Who the hell are you?"</span> <span id="s1288">He said, "I'm going for some food.”</span> <span id="s1289">He said, "Get the fuck off the street.”</span> <span id="s1290">And he passed by and he came back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">And that was the second time in the war.</span> <span id="s1292">At the beginning and the end he almost got killed.</span> <span id="s1293">So after that, we got liberated.</span> <span id="s1294">I will tell you one small, funny incident.</span> <span id="s1295">We had nothing to eat very much.</span> <span id="s1296">So Pop decided...I had found some...my brothers and I found some German objects...a helmet and instruction book to go with a gun, a couple of crazy things.</span> <span id="s1297">Pop said, "You know what?</span> <span id="s1298">Maybe we could trade with Canadians.</span> <span id="s1299">These are souvenirs.”</span> <span id="s1300">So we went to the Canadian camp.</span> <span id="s1301">By now we were surrounded by Canadians, all settled down in tents.</span> <span id="s1302">And a whole division settled down.</span> <span id="s1303">Pop was simply amazing.</span> <span id="s1304">He went there and he said, "You want a German helmet.”</span> <span id="s1305">The guy said, "Yeah.”</span> <span id="s1306">He says, "Well, we'd like to have some coffee.”</span> <span id="s1307">"Well," he said, "here's a pot of coffee.”</span> <span id="s1308">"We got this nice instruction book.”</span> <span id="s1309">"Oh.</span> <span id="s1310">Well, we'll give you five cans of...of of spam for that.”</span> <span id="s1311">And so we traded.</span> <span id="s1312">And we got to the village, and there was a detachment of military police.</span> <span id="s1313">Big, strapping guys, with red mustaches, and big helmets and MP on it you know, and on Harley Davidson's and Pop said "Can I trade anything for sugar.</span> <span id="s1314">We have no sugar.”</span> <span id="s1315">This guy said, "Well, he said, "We haven't got sugar right now.</span> <span id="s1316">If you come back tomorrow morning, he said, we'll give you some " And he went back the next morning and they were just packing up.</span> <span id="s1317">And he said...my father said, "Hey, you told me I could get some sugar.”</span> <span id="s1318">You know, they were revving up these big Harley Davidsons' you know, and they're going to move the whole division.</span> <span id="s1319">You know, these guys...these guys division so.</span> <span id="s1320">He said, "By the way...big mustache, red haired guy, huge, said, You a Jew?"</span> <span id="s1321">Pop instinctively said, "No, of course, I'm not a Jew.</span> <span id="s1322">We had come through years of hiding.</span> <span id="s1323">He said, "That's too bad.</span> <span id="s1324">I only give food to Jews because I'm Jewish myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">Bye.”</span> <span id="s1326">And zoomed off.</span> <span id="s1327">So this was this was the fortune.</span> <span id="s1328">Well, to wind it up, we found transportation back on a truck.</span> <span id="s1329">Got back to Delft.</span> <span id="s1330">And in Delft, Pop went to town hall and said, "I used to have a house here.</span> <span id="s1331">17 rooms.”</span> <span id="s1332">And they said, "Thank God, somebody came back.”</span> <span id="s1333">"What do you want?"</span> <span id="s1334">he said.</span> <span id="s1335">"You want a house?"</span> <span id="s1336">"Yeah, we need a house.”</span> <span id="s1337">"So, we'll give you a house.</span> <span id="s1338">Let's take you around" He said, "Now this house was from this Nazi and this house from this Nazi.”</span> <span id="s1339">And they gave us a house, and then they said, "What do you do for living.”</span> <span id="s1340">Pop said, "I'm a music teacher.”</span> <span id="s1341">"So, what do you teach?"</span> <span id="s1342">"I teach cello and piano.”</span> <span id="s1343">He says, "I'll give you a piano.</span> <span id="s1344">Here's 15 pianos.”</span> <span id="s1345">They had taken everything from the Nazi.</span> <span id="s1346">We got everything.</span> <span id="s1347">A whole house set up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Now, I'll back track for a second to May the liberation.</span> <span id="s1349">We're liberated.</span> <span id="s1350">What happened to my mother?</span> <span id="s1351">One of the first weeks that we were liberated...there was no transportation, of course.</span> <span id="s1352">There was no trains, no...the only thing that was going was the Canadian army, all around.</span> <span id="s1353">Pop got on his old bicycle and went to Barneveld a nearby town to find... He had heard there was a Red Cross station there that gave information about people, missing people.</span> <span id="s1354">And he went there and I understand as Pop said it the exact day that my mother was called, they found her on the list in Philipsville, Algeria in a UNRRA, United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration camp.</span> <span id="s1355">Well, that story's my mother's really, but she told me later or she told us later that she was in this camp in Bergen- Belsen and she was very sick and she tried...sick at heart and... She didn't have typhoid.</span> <span id="s1356">People were dying left and right around her.</span> <span id="s1357">She had maintained she was an American citizen.</span> <span id="s1358">The minute she was caught...says, "I'm a American citizen and you have no right to arrest me and me.”</span> <span id="s1359">They interviewed her at length.</span> <span id="s1360">Since we had lived for 3 years in the States, she knew how to describe streets, stores.</span> <span id="s1361">It was all God knows 25 years old or something, but they seemed to believe her.</span> <span id="s1362">My mother sometimes was like a little psychic it seems.</span> <span id="s1363">She could predict people coming to visit.</span> <span id="s1364">She said, "I had a dream in which somebody held up a newspaper, and on the newspaper it said January 15th, and I woke up and I thought I had to remember that date.</span> <span id="s1365">That's important.</span> <span id="s1366">On January 15th, she was put on...on a transport and exchanged for German prisoners with another bunch of Dutch Jews, went to Switzerland where many of them still died, and from Switzerland I guess to Portugal and Portugal to whatever, and wound up in Algeria.</span> <span id="s1367">And some months after we had been settled in this Nazi house, former Nazi house, a truck...it was...it was dusk.</span> <span id="s1368">You couldn't see too well anymore, and trucks stopped...an army truck stopped in front of the house which, by then, wasn't anything very...very extraordinary because they were English and American and Canadian army trucks all around and my brothers had been made mascots of the Israel soldiers.</span> <span id="s1369">And the truck stopped and a woman in a jumpsuit, very tanned, looked at me and said, "Oh, could you tell me where the Lessings live.”</span> <span id="s1370">I said, "Mama.”</span> <span id="s1371">I said, "Mother, it's you?"</span> <span id="s1372">She said, "Yes.”</span> <span id="s1373">We were all back together.</span> <span id="s1374">We were all back together again for a little while because pretty soon, of course, I guess maybe a year later or so, Pop and I went to the States.</span> <span id="s1375">We had reapplied for a visa.</span> <span id="s1376">Mother stayed behind with my two brothers and came over a year later.</span> <span id="s1377">But I had...in the meantime, I'd joined the Zionist organization.</span> <span id="s1378">Thanks to the the Jewish Brigade which was a brigade within the 8th English army.</span> <span id="s1379">These soldiers came over with a patch with a Star of David on it.</span> <span id="s1380">These men did everything to rehabilitate us.</span> <span id="s1381">They settled...first we had Canadians.</span> <span id="s1382">Then we had some English soldiers taking care of a bunch of German prisoners of war who were in a nearby camp.</span> <span id="s1383">Then the Jewish soldiers came.</span> <span id="s1384">And my two brothers, my two little brothers said, "There's Jewish soldiers.</span> <span id="s1385">They're Jewish soldiers.</span> <span id="s1386">They have the Star of David on their arm.”</span> <span id="s1387">And we said, "There's no such thing.”</span> <span id="s1388">"Yes.</span> <span id="s1389">Yes.”</span> <span id="s1390">We found out.</span> <span id="s1391">It was the Jewish Brigade.</span> <span id="s1392">But my brothers went to this camp, and there was two soldiers in the English fashion standing guard, pacing back and forth, turning back and forth.</span> <span id="s1393">He had this Jewish Star.</span> <span id="s1394">And my brothers wanted to make contact.</span> <span id="s1395">They didn't know how.</span> <span id="s1396">And my older brother who always was very ingenious said, "Let's sing a song.”</span> <span id="s1397">And he started to sing Maoz Tsur Yeshuati.</span> <span id="s1398">One of the guards stopped and said, "Hey, you.</span> <span id="s1399">Over here.</span> <span id="s1400">Are you Jew?</span> <span id="s1401">Are you Jewish?"</span> <span id="s1402">He said, "Yes.”</span> <span id="s1403">"Come into the camp.”</span> <span id="s1404">They became their mascots.</span> <span id="s1405">Trucks would stop full of soldiers and say, "Are the boys here?"</span> <span id="s1406">And then the boys would come down and "Oh, we take to over here and there," and take them on trips.</span> <span id="s1407">My mother came back and I said, "Mother, there are Jewish soldiers here.”</span> <span id="s1408">And you know what she said?</span> <span id="s1409">"I never want to see a Jew again in my life.”</span> <span id="s1410">Two weeks later she was singing...I think it was .</span> <span id="s1411">it was New Years.</span> <span id="s1412">It was Rosh Hashanah or maybe it was Purim or some festival.</span> <span id="s1413">And she'd changed her mind.</span> <span id="s1414">She was singing Jewish songs to 46 soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: I want to stop it here.</span> <span id="s1416">I want to show one picture.</span> <span id="s1417">A: Excuse me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">Q: Let's stop it here.</span> <span id="s1419">A: Good.</span> <span id="s1420">We finished?</span> <span id="s1421">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">A: Did I talk away two hours?</span> <span
