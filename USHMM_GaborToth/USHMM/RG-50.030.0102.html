But the teachers say I'm not good, so I didn't go on with the piano.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Did you like ballet?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: I liked ballet, but then my grandfather say I'm too old to go undressed in front of people.</span> <span id="s33">And I had to stop when the war started in 1940.</span> <span id="s34">I couldn't go on anymore; because it was a non- Jewish class, and we couldn't do that.</span> <span id="s35">The Germans didn't allow.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Before the Germans came, what, uh, kind of school did you go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: I went to school, uh, in Antwerp there is called like college.</span> <span id="s38">To college, yeah, I went.</span> <span id="s39">But then they could not...uh, children could not go to school for half a year.</span> <span id="s40">But after that, I went to the nuns; and I learned English and German private.</span> <span id="s41">In a nun's school...in a monastery went during the war.</span> <span id="s42">There I learned English and German.</span> <span id="s43">So now I speak six languages a little.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Let's go back a little, so that we don't get confused.</span> <span id="s45">Uh, what do you remember, if anything, of the invasion of Belgium?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: The invasion was the 10th of May, 1940.</span> <span id="s47">The Germans came into Belgium; and all people, mostly Jewish, went away running to La Panne.</span> <span id="s48">La Panne is on the frontier from France and Belgium.</span> <span id="s49">And we stayed there for three, four days.</span> <span id="s50">Some people were smart enough, waited for a ship and went wherever they took them.</span> <span id="s51">But then the people between them say the Germans are not so bad, and we came back to Antwerp.</span> <span id="s52">And that was the biggest mistake.</span> <span id="s53">Most of the Jews did run back to Antwerp.</span> <span id="s54">And we sort of live a regular life, but we started to feel that we were not allowed to go on a bus.</span> <span id="s55">We are not allowed to go that.</span> <span id="s56">And other people had left.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Uh, talk a little more about, uh, what those early years under the Germans were like.</span> <span id="s58">Did you have any restrictions?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: We had a lot of restrictions.</span> <span id="s60">We couldn't go in a bus.</span> <span id="s61">We couldn't go to a library.</span> <span id="s62">Uh, they more or less closed the schools.</span> <span id="s63">Twice a week, we could go then.</span> <span id="s64">And it was felt what I didn't look exactly like Jewish.</span> <span id="s65">So sometimes I would go out to Raphaele, my friend, without the Star of David.</span> <span id="s66">And the Germans wouldn't know; because her mother had Germans coming over to her house, and the Germans liked me very much.</span> <span id="s67">So one day, he [a German] liked me as a child, because I was the age of his daughter that was left in Germany.</span> <span id="s68">But I was, uh, old enough and smart enough to know that he's a German and I'm Jewish.</span> <span id="s69">But the next day of that happening, I went in the main street in Antwerp--de Keyserlei, they call it-- with my mother.</span> <span id="s70">And I had the star on.</span> <span id="s71">And here, towards me, comes the same German.</span> <span id="s72">So my reaction was to run in the first store I saw.</span> <span id="s73">My mother didn't know why.</span> <span id="s74">So the next day he says to my friend's mother, "I could have sworn I saw Anny with a st..</span> <span id="s75">.</span> <span id="s76">uh, as a Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">But she's not Jewish.</span> <span id="s78">Why would it be?</span> <span id="s79">But she looks exactly like Anny!"</span> <span id="s80">If he would have known that I'm Jew--as much as he loved me and I looked like his daughter--he would have...he would have uh called the Gestapo and they would have taken me away.</span> <span id="s81">So miracle after miracle.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Was your friend...your friend was obviously not Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: My girlfriend, no.</span> <span id="s84">She also helped my grandfather, who was very old at the time.</span> <span id="s85">She brought him food and everything.</span> <span id="s86">She endangered her life, because she put a star on.</span> <span id="s87">She went like if she would be Jewish; and went to my grandfather and brought him food and brought him some things.</span> <span id="s88">Went to my uncle that is in Israel now, to his wife, and brought them food.</span> <span id="s89">And she did a lot.</span> <span id="s90">And some people don't appreciate.</span> <span id="s91">But I appreciate every minute what she did for me.</span> <span id="s92">I'll give her first the money before I eat myself.</span> <span id="s93">And so do my husband and my sister-in-laws.</span> <span id="s94">They'll send her all the time checks; because they say if I..</span> <span id="s95">.</span> <span id="s96">if not her, they wouldn't have me.</span> <span id="s97">And they love me dearly.</span> <span id="s98">That's what they say.</span> <span id="s99">I hope it's true.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Let's go back.</span> <span id="s101">Her name is Raphaele...?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Raphaele Saintnoy.</span> <span id="s103">Her name was Jeanine, but she changed it when she started to paint.</span> <span id="s104">Her name is Raphaele Saintnoy.</span> <span id="s105">She's approximately a year old...younger than I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Did the two of you go to school together?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: We went to school together in Antwerp.</span> <span id="s108">And she loved my family.</span> <span id="s109">She loved my grandfather.</span> <span id="s110">She came very often to us.</span> <span id="s111">She even, before the war started, started talking Yiddish; because she loved the Yiddish language.</span> <span id="s112">She loved Jews.</span> <span id="s113">'Til now, she loves Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: What about school during those years?</span> <span id="s115">This is 1940...'41.</span> <span id="s116">What did you and Raphaele do about school?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Uh, we could not go more than three times a week; and Raphaele went on.</span> <span id="s118">And my mother had wanted me to go to a certain university out from Antwerp.</span> <span id="s119">But I couldn't do it; because in '42, I was gone and my parents were deported.</span> <span id="s120">I was gone to my hiding place.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s122">But '40, '41, you were still going to school somewhere?</span> <span id="s123">A: Yeah, somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: Uh, what were living conditions like in your house in '40...'41?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: It was a little tense; 'cause some of my family went to France, some to United States.</span> <span id="s126">And my mother wanted very badly to go to United States.</span> <span id="s127">We had the tickets to go to United States, where I had an uncle; and we had everything everyday.</span> <span id="s128">But my father didn't want to leave his father and his mother.</span> <span id="s129">And he say, "I'll sacrifice my family for my parents."</span> <span id="s130">That's what he did.</span> <span id="s131">We also had, in the building--was five floors--on the fourth floor, lived a man with a woman that he worked in the underground.</span> <span id="s132">And he did a lot.</span> <span id="s133">On the third floor, lived a woman with two daughters who were going with the German.</span> <span id="s134">And that was very bad for my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: How was it bad?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Bad, because she owed my father some hundred francs.</span> <span id="s137">That is nothing.</span> <span id="s138">And she thought that my father would want to have the hundred francs.</span> <span id="s139">And he told her always, "I don't want the money back."</span> <span id="s140">So one day, she came and she said, "I'm sorry, but as you live in a neighborhood [where] there's no Jewish, the German forgot to take you.</span> <span id="s141">And I called up the SS.</span> <span id="s142">They should take you on Tuesday, 8:30, the 19th."</span> <span id="s143">So my mother started to laugh.</span> <span id="s144">She says, "You--my friend who gave us up!"</span> <span id="s145">So my father said, "I don't believe you."</span> <span id="s146">She said, "Please go away."</span> <span id="s147">And Tuesday at 8:30 they came.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: Your parents did not go away?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: They went.</span> <span id="s150">Tuesday at 8:30, the SS came....</span> <span id="s151">Q: And picked up your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: My brother tried to close himself in the bathroom.</span> <span id="s153">And they broke the door, and they took him away.</span> <span id="s154">And the woman on the second floor, she was an easy woman.</span> <span id="s155">Like they call...she had pleasure with everyone.</span> <span id="s156">So she wanted to take my brother and put him under the bed until the Germans go away.</span> <span id="s157">But he wouldn't leave my parents.</span> <span id="s158">And it was hard for him to be hidden; because he was around seventeen, eighteen years--soldiers' time.</span> <span id="s159">The army age.</span> <span id="s160">And he wouldn't leave me parents.</span> <span id="s161">And that's the reason he didn't overlive Auschwitz, because he went all the time to my father.</span> <span id="s162">He wouldn't leave him.</span> <span id="s163">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: Where were you during this?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: I, a few minutes before, they put me by Raphaele's aunt--her father's sister.</span> <span id="s166">She lived in La Hulpe.</span> <span id="s167">It's written in the book.</span> <span id="s168">La Hulpe is like half an hour from Brussels.</span> <span id="s169">It's a little town.</span> <span id="s170">And they had a house there.</span> <span id="s171">The man that I called "Uncle" worked as a manager in a very big book store in Brussels.</span> <span id="s172">They had a daughter that was retarded.</span> <span id="s173">So I took care of the daughter, while they paid for me--I don't remember how much it is--three thousand Belgian francs every month.</span> <span id="s174">So after my parents were deported, I was afraid they'll give me up because no money coming in.</span> <span id="s175">She took me properly.</span> <span id="s176">She needed the money.</span> <span id="s177">So what happened... So she uh...I couldn't...I couldn't understand.</span> <span id="s178">It went on coming, the money.</span> <span id="s179">The landlord where we lived, my father told him, "Please send.</span> <span id="s180">Save my daughter."</span> <span id="s181">And he sent, from his own pocket, every month three thousand Belgian francs for me.</span> <span id="s182">Even I paid the three thousand francs, I had to help in the house.</span> <span id="s183">She used to say, "If you don't know, you cannot tell somebody else.</span> <span id="s184">You better clean the floor.</span> <span id="s185">You break an egg.</span> <span id="s186">You can get an egg.</span> <span id="s187">You have to wait until tomorrow's eggs."</span> <span id="s188">But she never, never made pork while I lived there.</span> <span id="s189">She respected me.</span> <span id="s190">She never put pork on the table, or on the dishes.</span> <span id="s191">Never, never.</span> <span id="s192">I used to go to church.</span> <span id="s193">I had my own chair; and she used to say, "Pray for your God here."</span> <span id="s194">I said, "It's a little hard."</span> <span id="s195">But Sunday was the only day I went out --for an hour to church.</span> <span id="s196">The neighbors should see that I go out.</span> <span id="s197">They thought I'm a sick niece who lives in Antwerp, and the doctor prescribed me to be in, uh, outside... Not in town, in the suburbs.</span> <span id="s198">That's the reason I came to live with them.</span> <span id="s199">But they were very nice, very good.</span> <span id="s200">They wanted even to adopt me after the war.</span> <span id="s201">But my uncle wouldn't let me become a shikse [Yidd: non-Jewish girl].</span> <span id="s202">But they liked me very much.</span> <span id="s203">And the man helped me a lot, with sending the three thousand francs; because God forbid if I would be taken away, uh, the woman--my "Aunt," like I called her--would be taken away, too.</span> <span id="s204">Because the people who hide other people... And I'll never forget Raphaele, as long as I live.</span> <span id="s205">People forget.</span> <span id="s206">I never forget.</span> <span id="s207">Because thanks to her, I'm alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: You were living with Raphaele's aunt.</span> <span id="s209">Uh, what kind of papers did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: I had an identity card.</span> <span id="s211">Identity card on the name from Raphaele Saintnoy, and that's all.</span> <span id="s212">I was Raphaele Saintnoy.</span> <span id="s213">I got stamps for food under her name, and I was under her name.</span> <span id="s214">But even then I was the... How do you say?</span> <span id="s215">Somebody told about me, that I was Jewish, and they should go in the house and there is a Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s216">They squealed.</span> <span id="s217">And when they squealed, the Germans came to look for me, as I told you.</span> <span id="s218">And the first time they came to look for me, it was a minute or two minutes.</span> <span id="s219">And I had a cord with...like steps; and I put it up on the attic.</span> <span id="s220">Nobody could go up there, it was so narrow.</span> <span id="s221">I put the ladder, and I was there for five and a half hours.</span> <span id="s222">[When] they took me out, I was fainted; because it was all the smoke from the chimney.</span> <span id="s223">It was near the chimney on the attic .</span> <span id="s224">It was bad.</span> <span id="s225">The second time they came, I was in the garden unexpected.</span> <span id="s226">And they had pictures on me, whom they look for.</span> <span id="s227">So my "Aunt" made...digged a hole in five minutes--I don't know how she did it--put me in, and put the hole....</span> <span id="s228">Like if I would be buried alive.</span> <span id="s229">They looked and they looked and they looked, and they walked on me.</span> <span id="s230">They never found me.</span> <span id="s231">So anyway, my lawyer was not a good lawyer.</span> <span id="s232">He found that I have not enough reasons to get, uh they call it...</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: Reparations.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Reparation.</span> <span id="s235">Because I wasn't born in Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Ok.</span> <span id="s237">Let's let's hold that--OK--that whole question.</span> <span id="s238">I want to stay with this hole.</span> <span id="s239">How did you breathe?</span> <span id="s240">You were buried alive.</span> <span id="s241">How did you breathe?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: I don't remember.</span> <span id="s243">I know I was half faint when they took me out.</span> <span id="s244">I was very bad shape.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Because the next day of that what I went through--the same day that they dig me in and hid me in the ground.</span> <span id="s246">I, uh, we made soap.</span> <span id="s247">We didn't have.</span> <span id="s248">And I burned my two arms, and they couldn't take me to a doctor; because the doctor was very German...for the German.</span> <span id="s249">And we didn't want to go.</span> <span id="s250">He would start the names, he would start.</span> <span id="s251">So they healed by themselves, all the arms.</span> <span id="s252">I couldn't go to a doctor.</span> <span id="s253">They wouldn't take me to a doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: How long did you stay with Raphaele's aunt?</span> <span id="s255">A: From '42 to '44...'45.</span> <span id="s256">To the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: What did you do?</span> <span id="s258">Did you do anything about school or education during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Uh, I went to the monastery; and I took English and I took German.</span> <span id="s260">And then my "Uncle," her husband, tried to help me in French and mathematics, and so on.</span> <span id="s261">Really, to a school I couldn't go, because it was too far away.</span> <span id="s262">But the monastery was not far away.</span> <span id="s263">And I went two, three times a week; and I picked up French and English and German.</span> <span id="s264">So that's....</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: Did the nuns know that you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: No.</span> <span id="s267">'Til after the war, they never knew.</span> <span id="s268">We didn't want anyone to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Did you learn how to be a Catholic during that period, just to protect yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: No.</span> <span id="s271">I..</span> <span id="s272">.</span> <span id="s273">I went to church.</span> <span id="s274">I sat there.</span> <span id="s275">And they go usually to communion, and they give you something.</span> <span id="s276">But I didn't do that.</span> <span id="s277">She didn't want me to do that.</span> <span id="s278">Just went to church, sat; and when it was over we went home.</span> <span id="s279">And that's all.</span> <span id="s280">Sometimes, they would give me a soda.</span> <span id="s281">That was something.</span> <span id="s282">But that's all, and then we came home.</span> <span id="s283">That's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: What else do you remember from those two years?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: These two years were very hard, for one thing.</span> <span id="s286">Because my "Aunt"--the woman, Raphaele's aunt--and [her] husband didn't live very good.</span> <span id="s287">And I was very naïve.</span> <span id="s288">I didn't know.</span> <span id="s289">He was an intellectual, and he was sorry that the only child they have was retarded.</span> <span id="s290">So they didn't get along so well.</span> <span id="s291">And I used to take the part of her and of him, to make shalom b'bayit [Heb: "peace in the house"]; and not always did I succeed.</span> <span id="s292">And it was aggravating me, because my parents never spoke a loud word to each other.</span> <span id="s293">When they would like discuss, they would go to the other room.</span> <span id="s294">My brother and I wasn't, uh, there.</span> <span id="s295">And I wasn't used to see people, who live together and loved each other, [who] shouldn't talk for days.</span> <span id="s296">[Who] should eat together, and make like was a stranger.</span> <span id="s297">I wasn't used like that.</span> <span id="s298">I wasn't brought up like that.</span> <span id="s299">'Cause I was brought up in a very warm and loving family my parents had.</span> <span id="s300">So it was hard for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">And I all the time thought, "When my parents come back, I'll appreciate them more.</span> <span id="s302">And if my brother comes alive, I'll never get married.</span> <span id="s303">Never.</span> <span id="s304">Take care of him all my life, as long as I live."</span> <span id="s305">But it didn't happen.</span> <span id="s306">It didn't happen, so I can't do anything.</span> <span id="s307">And it's still...when people are with their children, are complaining, it hurts me.</span> <span id="s308">Because, thank God, they have normal children and parents.</span> <span id="s309">They have old mothers, old fathers.</span> <span id="s310">My mother was 43 and my father 41 when they died.</span> <span id="s311">So it's very young.</span> <span id="s312">And my brother was 17 or 18.</span> <span id="s313">He had nothing from life.</span> <span id="s314">So it's very painful.</span> <span id="s315">And sometimes, you'll remember... Like my uncle who lives in Israel, he lost a child of six years and a child of 18 months.</span> <span id="s316">A little girl.</span> <span id="s317">And he went through a lot.</span> <span id="s318">A lot.</span> <span id="s319">But, uh, that's it.</span> <span id="s320">Never hurts--uh, it was hard.</span> <span id="s321">These two years were like twenty years.</span> <span id="s322">Because if you don't know who you are, or you forget maybe... But I didn't forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">And I knew.</span> <span id="s324">And I had a picture of my parents.</span> <span id="s325">Day and night, I looked at them.</span> <span id="s326">And since...after the war, when I knew that they won't come back, and I hear bad news or something--God forbid--I can't cry.</span> <span id="s327">See me sitting here?</span> <span id="s328">It's inside, the pain.</span> <span id="s329">I cannot cry.</span> <span id="s330">It's hard for me to cry.</span> <span id="s331">It's healthy to cry.</span> <span id="s332">But I just can't cry.</span> <span id="s333">Like last night, I was thinking about this morning.</span> <span id="s334">But I can't cry.</span> <span id="s335">Some people just cry, but I have it inside me.</span> <span id="s336">And I don't forget one day.</span> <span id="s337">And it's not easy to get along without parents.</span> <span id="s338">But I remember what is the worst in my whole life is my father took me to the train to go to Brussels.</span> <span id="s339">And from Brussels, they would pick me up to go to La Hulpe, where I would stay.</span> <span id="s340">I had only two dresses.</span> <span id="s341">One dress and a blouse for the week, and another dress with other pieces for Sunday.</span> <span id="s342">So I only had... the socks were mended so hard it spoiled my feet.</span> <span id="s343">Because she mended our socks.</span> <span id="s344">We couldn't afford...she couldn't afford to buy me.</span> <span id="s345">But the worst thing that I remember is [that] my father took me to the train to go to Brussels.</span> <span id="s346">And we walked on the sidewalk for fifteen minutes; and there comes the German that my father didn't see.</span> <span id="s347">And he slapped my father, because he didn't go down the sidewalk when you are...when he was coming.</span> <span id="s348">And I'll never forget, my father told me in Yiddish--because French maybe [they] understand--"Don't do anything."</span> <span id="s349">Because I was ready to slap him, and then he would take me along.</span> <span id="s350">But I never forget the feeling, to see... With so much respect for my parents, that I saw somebody slapping my father.</span> <span id="s351">I..</span> <span id="s352">.</span> <span id="s353">I couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s354">But it was... it was very painful.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Very painful.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Tell me a little more about Raphaele and the papers.</span> <span id="s357">You had....</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Raphaele's mother was pro-German.</span> <span id="s359">And Raphaele loved the Jews.</span> <span id="s360">And she did not tell her mother that she went to my grandfather to bring food, and that she wore the star.</span> <span id="s361">She didn't tell her mother she goes to my aunt to bring food.</span> <span id="s362">Because the mother wouldn't accept it.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">And she was a young girl; she was living home.</span> <span id="s364">She had like a double life.</span> <span id="s365">She was more Jewish than not-Jewish.</span> <span id="s366">She did it because she wanted it.</span> <span id="s367">She never asked her mother the permission.</span> <span id="s368">So she she put her life on stake, like they say; but she helped a lot.</span> <span id="s369">My grandfather was then 79 years old, and she helped him; and [it] gave her a very big satisfaction.</span> <span id="s370">In a few years now, lately, we...she moved and I moved.</span> <span id="s371">And we cut our getting together and writing; but now she'll write to me every ten days, every two weeks.</span> <span id="s372">And she's still so excited from her trip to Israel, two weeks, that she...she's over-excited.</span> <span id="s373">She said that was the nicest two weeks since she remembers her youth.</span> <span id="s374">If we wear clothes, my mother would like make uh pairs for Saturday; and I would carry there to Raphaele and break my leg not to break the plate.</span> <span id="s375">So when I had the uh cast on my foot, you didn't walk at that time.</span> <span id="s376">And it was all designs and painted.</span> <span id="s377">Raphaele painted.</span> <span id="s378">The Germans took that even.</span> <span id="s379">I wanted that to keep; but when they took out our clothes and our things in the house, they took even that.</span> <span id="s380">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s382">The year is 1944.</span> <span id="s383">You are still at Raphaele's aunt's farm.</span> <span id="s384">Uh, what happened at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: The American or the English...the English came in.</span> <span id="s386">And the monastery knew that I'm Jewish.</span> <span id="s387">We told them.</span> <span id="s388">They were very proud of Raphaele's aunt.</span> <span id="s389">And when you had a big house, you had to take somebody to live in a room or two.</span> <span id="s390">Because they needed a place for soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">And we took in an English soldier.</span> <span id="s392">His name was Tom; and he got a room there.</span> <span id="s393">He used to bring his Cadbury chocolates, so I shined his shoes.</span> <span id="s394">And we went to Brussels together--my aunt, he and I.</span> <span id="s395">Then once I became sick with the flu.</span> <span id="s396">They went alone.</span> <span id="s397">And since then, they never took me along again.</span> <span id="s398">And she started to...not like to her husband.</span> <span id="s399">She started to have an affair, which I didn't know.</span> <span id="s400">I was very naïve.</span> <span id="s401">And I don't know if it's good to tell here, because when he came home one...suddenly, my "Uncle."</span> <span id="s402">And he said, "Where is your aunt?"</span> <span id="s403">I say, "She went in the room from Tom, because she was cold."</span> <span id="s404">I was so naïve and so stupid.</span> <span id="s405">But he figured out when Tom wore nice shirts, and then I would say, "'Uncle' Henri, it's your shirt!"</span> <span id="s406">I shouldn't have said it.</span> <span id="s407">I didn't know.</span> <span id="s408">I'm naïve.</span> <span id="s409">I was brought up very naïve, and I didn't know.</span> <span id="s410">Then after the war, I stayed with my "Uncle" Henri; and she left her husband for the Englishman.</span> <span id="s411">After twenty-five years.</span> <span id="s412">And a sick child.</span> <span id="s413">She left a sick child home, too.</span> <span id="s414">And I was staying with him 'til my uncle would come back and find a place.</span> <span id="s415">And when my uncle found a place, it was a very big house of his parents-in-law and....</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Tell me, just to make things a little clearer.</span> <span id="s417">Where had... This is your real uncle now?</span> <span id="s418">Where had he been during the war, and how did he find you?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: My uncle was in the same house as his wife and her parents.</span> <span id="s420">They were Belgian citizens.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Once you're a Belgian citizen, the Queen say, "The German made a pact.</span> <span id="s422">They won't take a Belgian citizen."</span> <span id="s423">So she was living there in that house with the two little children and her parents.</span> <span id="s424">Her sister--my aunt's sister, my uncle's sister-in-law--didn't want to stay in the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">She went with false papers to France, and was killed--eight months pregnant.</span> <span id="s426">But the other ones were staying in the big house.</span> <span id="s427">[On] September 3, 1943, the Germans broke their promise and took all the Ger...Belgian Jews.</span> <span id="s428">It was a Friday night.</span> <span id="s429">And they came to take my aunt and her parents and the two little children.</span> <span id="s430">But my aunt...my uncle didn't know they came for her.</span> <span id="s431">He thought somebody gave him in, and they coming for him.</span> <span id="s432">So she was shouting all the time.</span> <span id="s433">"Izy..." His name is Izy. "</span> <span id="s434">...where you are, stay.</span> <span id="s435">God should save you."</span> <span id="s436">So he was sure it was for him they are looking.</span> <span id="s437">So after three or four hours, he came down and he saw the shoes of the little baby.</span> <span id="s438">And it was coldish; it was September.</span> <span id="s439">And they weren't there.</span> <span id="s440">And he understood that he couldn't go out from the house.</span> <span id="s441">When these....</span> <span id="s442">So nice furniture--they would lock the house from the outside, and come a day or two later to pick up the furniture, the clothes and the diamond and the silverware.</span> <span id="s443">So he couldn't go out; and he was blocked in that house from Friday 'til Monday.</span> <span id="s444">On Monday, the maid who came in, she knew about him.</span> <span id="s445">She went on the roof of a neighbor and went in to him on the roof.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Then they went out from the roof.</span> <span id="s447">She brought him clothes from her husband and identity card.</span> <span id="s448">But my uncle looked very Jewish and has evidently a beard.</span> <span id="s449">So he shaved and he shaved, and he went with her to Brussels.</span> <span id="s450">And they succeeded.</span> <span id="s451">She put him in a monastery.</span> <span id="s452">Him and another Jewish couple.</span> <span id="s453">The monastery [Mother] Superior knew; but all the other nuns didn't know anything.</span> <span id="s454">And he shaved five to six times a day, while wearing the clothes from the nuns.</span> <span id="s455">But he shaved five to six times.</span> <span id="s456">And he ate kosher all the time, believe it or not.</span> <span id="s457">She brought him sometimes food, and he wouldn't eat too much, because he was religious.</span> <span id="s458">And after a year, after the war was over, he came and he found the little slippers.</span> <span id="s459">They never took it away.</span> <span id="s460">Nothing.</span> <span id="s461">But uh...they were killed in Auschwitz, too.</span> <span id="s462">They were killed in Auschwitz, too--like my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: So your uncle, after all of this, came now and found you at the farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s465">And then he organized...in the house that we had, he organized seven bedrooms for the people--my parents, my other aunt, who was deported with her husband.</span> <span id="s466">The two boys were taken by train, and they didn't want to go.</span> <span id="s467">They jumped from the train, but....</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Which two boys?</span> <span id="s469">I'm sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: My aunt--my father's sister--and her husband were deported.</span> <span id="s471">She had two sons.</span> <span id="s472">They were in a train from Antwerp to Drancy.</span> <span id="s473">Drancy's in France.</span> <span id="s474">And they jumped from the train, both.</span> <span id="s475">Taking a chance, "We'll save ourselves."</span> <span id="s476">But they shoot them.</span> <span id="s477">So they were also 18 and 20, too.</span> <span id="s478">So it's a big generation.</span> <span id="s479">And my uncle, after the war, was very sick.</span> <span id="s480">Because he couldn't believe that nobody will come back.</span> <span id="s481">'Til he had to accept that the child--the child was the worst thing.</span> <span id="s482">For 18 months.</span> <span id="s483">It was the worst thing for him, and for me.</span> <span id="s484">And then--two days after the English and the American came--my grandmother spent all that time in the hospital.</span> <span id="s485">My grandmother... My grandfather was taken the December 3rd.</span> <span id="s486">My grandmother was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s487">They arranged it she should live.</span> <span id="s488">So my grandmother died; first funeral in Belgium.</span> <span id="s489">She lived a little, but she... She didn't have Alzheimer's; she was all mixed up from all what she went through.</span> <span id="s490">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: So you were all living in this big house?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: My uncle and myself.</span> <span id="s493">And then, everyday, we sold another bedroom.</span> <span id="s494">But we saw nobody comes.</span> <span id="s495">There were seven bedrooms arranged.</span> <span id="s496">You know, we were sure they will come back.</span> <span id="s497">But they didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: How did you live?</span> <span id="s499">Uh, how did you get money to eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: My uncle opened a fur store in Antwerp, and I managed it.</span> <span id="s501">And he used to travel, himself.</span> <span id="s502">So I was working until eleven at night.</span> <span id="s503">Because the soldiers would pick up a girl and buy her a fur coat.</span> <span id="s504">So I worked until eleven at night.</span> <span id="s505">And all my friends were smarter.</span> <span id="s506">They went to...there was already the Army from Israel.</span> <span id="s507">Chaialim (ph)--the "Brigade," they called it.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">They came.</span> <span id="s509">They went out.</span> <span id="s510">They had a good time.</span> <span id="s511">They went to parties.</span> <span id="s512">I was working, and I never went to a party.</span> <span id="s513">I worked all my life very hard.</span> <span id="s514">Very hard past.</span> <span id="s515">If you think it's...it was not easy, but uh we worked.</span> <span id="s516">And then my uncle went to Uruguay, and I went to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: How did you arrange all that?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: Because my family in Israel never saw me.</span> <span id="s519">They had pictures but they never had seen me.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">My two aunts and my uncle.</span> <span id="s521">And they asked my other uncle that I should come to Israel and then go to Uruguay to meet...to stay with him.</span> <span id="s522">In the meantime, I loved Israel so much [that] I never went to Uruguay.</span> <span id="s523">I went after a time.</span> <span id="s524">I went about three times.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: When did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: I got married in 1967 only.</span> <span id="s527">My husband, who came as a trip to Israel in 1964.</span> <span id="s528">I came here in 1965.</span> <span id="s529">And I was used to the noise from Israel, and working and going.</span> <span id="s530">And here, they put me in a beautiful home and I didn't work.</span> <span id="s531">I didn't give anything of myself.</span> <span id="s532">Later I worked for Ziuei (ph); but I couldn't live like that.</span> <span id="s533">So I took my pack, and I went back to Israel.</span> <span id="s534">But it seems he liked me very much.</span> <span id="s535">And we started to correspond; and I came back in '67.</span> <span id="s536">And I told him, "I have to be busy.</span> <span id="s537">I have to do something."</span> <span id="s538">So I worked volunteer, and they liked it.</span> <span id="s539">And I was satisfied that I do something for Israel, not being there.</span> <span id="s540">And that's it.</span> <span id="s541">And we got married in '67; and my husband was teaching at Hebrew Academy over at Washington, the school.</span> <span id="s542">Now he's retired.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: Do you know--let's go back a little.</span> <span id="s544">Uh, do you know how Raphaele survived the war?</span> <span id="s545">What did she do?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: She survived very hard.</span> <span id="s547">Her mother died, and her father died.</span> <span id="s548">And she...her father died after the war.</span> <span id="s549">She was living with her father.</span> <span id="s550">She was working very hard, all kind of work.</span> <span id="s551">She was a saleslady, a painter, a sculptor.</span> <span id="s552">She's a little Bohemian, because she's a very good artist.</span> <span id="s553">And I'm sorry that now she has that farm, and has to paint and sell her paintings.</span> <span id="s554">But, uh, she say, "If you want, I can give one painting."</span> <span id="s555">She send me.</span> <span id="s556">And it's a very nice painting.</span> <span id="s557">It's the world, Adam and Eve.</span> <span id="s558">She's very good.</span> <span id="s559">And she...I forgot to bring it, but</span></p> <p><span id="s560">she's very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: But during the war....</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: During the war, she went to university.</span> <span id="s563">She finished college, like they call it here.</span> <span id="s564">And uh she was very gifted.</span> <span id="s565">But she could not stay in a town.</span> <span id="s566">She needs her...she needs air.</span> <span id="s567">She needs open places.</span> <span id="s568">That's the reason, I think, she stays on that farm; and I talked about that.</span> <span id="s569">I explained to her that I would like her very much to come to Israel now; and we go... And spend some time with us, and go and see if you can go in a kibbutz.</span> <span id="s570">I think in a kibbutz, in Israel, she would feel very happy.</span> <span id="s571">'Cause she likes that kind of work.</span> <span id="s572">And they would accept her, I think.</span> <span id="s573">She was a person who helped a lot of people.</span> <span id="s574">I think the kibbutz would accept her.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: What...what did it feel like to you, during the war, when you were...you had Raphaele....</span> <span id="s576">You had false papers in Raphaele's name, while Raphaele kept your own papers?</span> <span id="s577">Is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s580">Uh, how did you manage day-to-day on those papers?</span> <span id="s581">Did you have to show them often?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: The problem was that I lived day-to-day.</span> <span id="s583">Because sometimes the man called me, wanted to know my real name.</span> <span id="s584">But I was not stupid.</span> <span id="s585">I told him that's my name.</span> <span id="s586">But one time, I had a very big problem.</span> <span id="s587">And my "Aunt" that kept me was very angry.</span> <span id="s588">I went to a girlfriend to play.</span> <span id="s589">And I shouldn't have gone; because in the front of the house of that girlfriend was a big truck, and they had just picked up Jewish people.</span> <span id="s590">And that boy who was sitting in the truck knew me.</span> <span id="s591">He wanted to go with me to my "Aunt" Paulette--her name.</span> <span id="s592">And "Aunt" Paulette didn't want to accept.</span> <span id="s593">When he saw me, he told the Germans, "She is Jewish.</span> <span id="s594">Put her in the truck with me."</span> <span id="s595">But when the German went down, I was gone.</span> <span id="s596">I was very fast.</span> <span id="s597">I was gone; but for three days, I was very sick.</span> <span id="s598">Like shock.</span> <span id="s599">I was so nervous.</span> <span id="s600">I was so afraid.</span> <span id="s601">How a person can.... "If I am in a problem, I want you to be."</span> <span id="s602">He shouldn't have done that.</span> <span id="s603">And he knew me.</span> <span id="s604">But he told the German; and I was maybe not far away, and that's what happened.</span> <span id="s605">I disappeared.</span> <span id="s606">I don't know how.</span> <span id="s607">I had the courage to stand up in a second; because he just had to go down from the truck and he showed .</span> <span id="s608">And they looked and they looked in all the houses; but I put a scarf over my head, and he didn't look at my face.</span> <span id="s609">And when he came in, he didn't see me.</span> <span id="s610">He didn't know who I am.</span> <span id="s611">"I was looking for that girl, but..." You understand.</span> <span id="s612">So it was very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Did you have other escapes like this?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: I had a few escapes that I told you.</span> <span id="s615">That he took my papers at night.</span> <span id="s616">He said....</span> <span id="s617">Q: Which he?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: The man who kept the...who kept the identities cards.</span> <span id="s619">The identity cards.</span> <span id="s620">He called me to his house; and he told me, "Give me your card.</span> <span id="s621">I'll give it back to you next week, 'cause I have to change the age, or the time or something."</span> <span id="s622">And I had a feeling that I shouldn't give it.</span> <span id="s623">And I had not discussed it with my "Aunt," but I had a feeling not to give him.</span> <span id="s624">And I say, "No, she'll give you next week."</span> <span id="s625">And next morning, at six in the morning, he was killed with the papers from 25 or 40 people that he had.</span> <span id="s626">And all these people were taken.</span> <span id="s627">And I thank God....</span> <span id="s628">Must have been a will from God that, uh, that I wasn't taken; because he didn't have my papers.</span> <span id="s629">If he would have my papers, it would be the same as my papers.</span> <span id="s630">So that's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">And, uh, I had a lot of little events; events that I would feel bad if...like Germans would go in the front of the house, and go and look for something or what.</span> <span id="s632">So instinctively, I thought it's for me.</span> <span id="s633">I got nervous that they're looking for me.</span> <span id="s634">But I think when you are in the situation, you are stronger and braver.</span> <span id="s635">I could pay attention myself you see.</span> <span id="s636">I knew when to let go, because like when he ...they looked for me when I was like buried.</span> <span id="s637">I knew I have to breathe my nose, my mouth.</span> <span id="s638">I have to keep up 'til they come to save me.</span> <span id="s639">When they came, they were happy that I was breathing; because it was very hard for me.</span> <span id="s640">So, problem is that uh the closest from my aunt's, my uncle's--twenty-four people the closest--were taken all to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s641">So sometimes I say, if people complain, people should be happy.</span> <span id="s642">It is a too narrow road, people set in cars, came from home.</span> <span id="s643">But there is no one day that I forget my parents or Raphaele.</span> <span id="s644">Because she...really did a lot for me.</span> <span id="s645">And if not, I wouldn't be alive.</span> <span id="s646">So that's the reason I always want her to feel good, to buy something special for her, you know.</span> <span id="s647">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: Anything you want to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: Well, then my uncle came to Uruguay, got married and lives now in Israel.</span> <span id="s650">Has two boys-- two sons.</span> <span id="s651">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s653">Thank you very much.</span></p></body></html>
