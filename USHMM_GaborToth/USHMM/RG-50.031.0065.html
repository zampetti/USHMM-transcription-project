<p><span id="s12">lW: The house we had belonged to ever since we were children.</span> <span id="s13">We went back to the apartment and told my parents what we had seen.</span> <span id="s14">We were horrified.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: You lived on the sixth floor, right?</span> <span id="s16">And what did you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">lW: We saw SS men knocking on our door.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: They were in uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">lW: No, I shouldn't say that, they were not all in uniform.</span> <span id="s20">They had as I recall hired/used convicts from neighboring towns to do the demolition, so it was a combination of the both, they just let them loose giving them hammers and tools, and whatever else, and hacked everything to pieces.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: And then you said...</span></p> <p><span id="s22">lW: Well we had the stores gone, so we had no income in that direction anymore.</span> <span id="s23">We had to supplement our income besides the rent which we took in from the building, we had a nice size apartment.</span> <span id="s24">There were also Jewish refugees streaming into the town from all neighboring small towns.</span> <span id="s25">And so we decided to use two of the rooms that we weren't using, like the dining room and another room and we sold the furniture and made extra bedrooms, and we took in extra refugees from these towns that stayed…away from us…</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: In 1938 you were 12 years of age, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">lW: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Did it ever occur to you that there could possibly be any other...or specifically...</span></p> <p><span id="s29">lW: Not originally, I didn't see anything I just didn't see anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: Did you fantasize about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">lW: Perhaps I fantasized, but it was something that was unavailable just didn't exist except for the people who could get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">lW: As I said, we were to be collected at the railway station.</span> <span id="s33">We had to surrender our keys.</span> <span id="s34">There was a heap of nothing but keys all keys to the apartments they had taken.</span> <span id="s35">They had sealed our apartment off as we left.</span> <span id="s36">We took what we could carry.</span> <span id="s37">And on the train we were guessing where they were going to take us: To the east would mean Dachau.</span> <span id="s38">If it goes to any other direction we didn't know where.</span> <span id="s39">And as it headed down south-west from Anheim we came to the French-German border where the train stopped.</span> <span id="s40">We were each allowed 100 marks per person.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">(BREAK IN TAPE) lW: ........continued on in different parts of Spain and Portugal until we reached the Portuguese Border.</span> <span id="s42">There we were Put on buses to Lisbon.</span> <span id="s43">In Lisbon, we were housed approximately a week before the transport to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: In light of what you said earlier about the hopelessness, the fact that you were on a train going someplace, did that sense of hopelessness seem to change?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">lW: Yes, for the first time I really believed that</span></p> <p><span id="s46">(BREAK IN TAPE) lW: Yes I am on the list here, and we all had to wear an I.D. tag on the boat, and on the way over and I was No. 82.</span> <span id="s47">I also still have the ID.</span> <span id="s48">Here is my name and the list of children.</span> <span id="s49">Of course it was my maiden name.</span> <span id="s50">I'll show you my tag: No. 82, Silberman Hannenoah and then my birth day, June 221926 from Reichstag concentration camp, father and mother in Germany.</span> <span id="s51">That's a misprint, they were not in Germany, they were in Reichstag.</span> <span id="s52">Then it says, "Stranded in Camp."</span> <span id="s53">It should read, father and mother came from Germany, stranded in camp.</span> <span id="s54">In closing I would like to show you the tag I had to wear when I to be afraid of anything.</span> <span id="s55">Everybody said we are going to work on a farm, we are going to work on a farm.</span> <span id="s56">And I as a little boy had different thoughts.</span> <span id="s57">I didn't really like the rumors that I was hearing, but what could I do, if we go, we go.</span> <span id="s58">Still, We saw a lot of German SS at the time...</span></p> <p><span id="s59">(BREAK IN TAPE) lM: So he hit me over the head with some kind of rubber hose and I almost passed out, but I managed to carry on, and I saw my sisters then, I didn't see my mother, but I saw my sisters, and so I told my father I saw my sisters.</span> <span id="s60">Then they marched us into a barrack.</span> <span id="s61">It was a regular barrack.</span> <span id="s62">It was not Auschwitz, it was Birkenau.</span> <span id="s63">There were two camps, Auschwitz and Birkenau.</span> <span id="s64">Then we had already met all the haftlinge.</span> <span id="s65">The first guy I met: we wanted to know a little information, where he was from, how long he had been here etc.</span> <span id="s66">This was the first solid information we got about what was going on.</span> <span id="s67">I was constantly looking for a guy who told me I was 18, I somehow wanted to see him again.</span> <span id="s68">And then I saw a guy who looked a little bit like him but it didn't turn out to be, I never saw this guy again.</span> <span id="s69">I walked up to him and said to him "What is going on here?"</span> <span id="s70">"You see this striped uniform?</span> <span id="s71">The 50% who have this striped uniform have a chance at 13:58 surviving."</span> <span id="s72">"And the other 50%?"</span> <span id="s73">"Phew, gone."</span> <span id="s74">He said " I have already been here two years.</span> <span id="s75">These guys already knew the rules.</span> <span id="s76">Other people had only been there a short time.</span> <span id="s77">Some 2 or 3 or 5 days.</span> <span id="s78">But this was the most miserable of places...</span></p> <p><span id="s79">(BREAK IN TAPE) They were on rails pushed by people, which they keeled over, and I could see them left and right filled with bodies, with people.</span> <span id="s80">I was there for about two weeks with my father.</span> <span id="s81">I had no appetite to eat they gave us a little warm potato peel and a little piece of bread.</span> <span id="s82">I couldn't eat even though my father wanted me to.</span> <span id="s83">I just observed, and all the time, I felt I couldn't speak to my father because I didn't want to hurt him.</span> <span id="s84">I was the oldest son, and I couldn't speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">(BREAK IN TAPE) Three weeks and the last one died because of the sudden shock from the extreme change in conditions.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">(BREAK IN TAPE) 2W: We brought out different people, and they got out, they were able to get out, and I don't know what happened to them.</span> <span id="s87">Whether they survived or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: How old were you at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">2W: I was 16.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: The refugees had been able to flee the Germans, so they had no experience under them?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">2W: Not all of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: So you had begun to hear personal experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">2W: Oh sure.</span> <span id="s94">They were fleeing the Germans before they had occupied the cities, so their experiences were just running away from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: If I understand you correctly, it was a period of hard times, but not of great anxiety?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">2W: There was some anxiety because we didn't know what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s97">But look, when you are that age you cannot be too overly anxious.</span> <span id="s98">I don't think that 15 or 16 year old realized what the danger was.</span> <span id="s99">They just took it step by step.</span> <span id="s100">I don't think I had a sleepless night because I was worried about my future.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: The family conferences?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">2W: They remained the same.</span> <span id="s103">And they were worried, discussing whether they should go into Russia.</span> <span id="s104">It was all talking.</span> <span id="s105">Nobody did anything.</span> <span id="s106">Then we came to the point when the war broke out, which was in 1941, the Germans started the fight with Russia and two days later they were in our town.</span> <span id="s107">I remember one incident when I walked out, it was day, and I was not afraid, I met some German soldiers patrolling the street where I live.</span> <span id="s108">He asked me who I was, and I said "Ein Jude", and he said he felt sorry for me.</span> <span id="s109">That was my very first encounter with a German.</span> <span id="s110">And again by virtue of my looks, not looking Jewish, I was made supplier.</span> <span id="s111">On the scavenges, looking for food and stuff.</span> <span id="s112">I spent the first month looking to see if stores were open, looking for bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: What did the Germans do?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">2W: The started off by gathering up all of the men.</span> <span id="s115">My uncle was taken, and his son, my cousin, was taken.</span> <span id="s116">They came to the house, not the Germans but the...</span></p> <p><span id="s117">(BREAK IN TAPE) …I got there and Simas Mabirus was one of those open homes that took in stray people.</span> <span id="s118">She had a house full of people over.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: But you didn't know this, and wandered straight in there?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">2W: I didn't know at all.</span> <span id="s121">But they were the ones that practically took everybody in, whoever that came to the city.</span> <span id="s122">They took you in, or if they were overflowing, they arranged it so that another family would take you in.</span> <span id="s123">And they took me in.</span> <span id="s124">The family consisted of a mother, father and a brother.</span> <span id="s125">One brother lived far away in another city, and was already married.</span> <span id="s126">He ran away to Russia.</span> <span id="s127">I stayed with them for quite a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: We are now at the end of 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">2W: We are at the end of 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: How big a town was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">2W: Oh, a very small town.</span> <span id="s132">One street.</span> <span id="s133">A village in a forest.</span> <span id="s134">The whole community could have got up and walked into the forest and saved themselves.</span> <span id="s135">There were no Germans, the few policemen in the town were all people we knew and didn't bother us.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Did the people in the town know what was going on in the outer cities?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">2W: No, they had no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">(BREAK IN TAPE)</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: But there was a some anxiety?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">2W: Sure, there was a lot of anxiety, but a lot of anger more so than anxiety, because here we are fighting together, but you (the Polish) still hate us.</span> <span id="s141">The Polish were killing Jews just as much as the Germans were.</span> <span id="s142">In fact one of the girls who was caught by a group of the Polish party while on a mission was tortured.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: One of the girls from your group?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">2W: Yes my group.</span> <span id="s145">Where were we?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Russian deserters taking over?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">2W: Then it was the spring of 1944, and we were liberated, and our part was taken over by the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">(BREAK IN TAPE) lM: "Jahvol," that's me.</span> <span id="s149">So there was a German master standing there pointing at me saying "This is the guy."</span> <span id="s150">He said I was goofing around.</span> <span id="s151">So he pulled me out and gave me twenty-five lashes with a metal filled rubber house.</span> <span id="s152">That was also a time when I felt "This is it," because after the tenth one I didn't feel anything anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Was it on your back?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">lM: No, on my behind.</span> <span id="s155">But I managed to survive.</span> <span id="s156">Another close call that we had in Melk was a bombing raid on a Jewish fast day.</span> <span id="s157">We were on the day shift at the time and we heard bombs going off nearby, so we came back to camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: What month was that in?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">lM: It was July 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">(BREAK IN TAPE) lM: We were very lucky, because they gave us the chance to go to another camp, and probably another work detail.</span> <span id="s161">This is what was in the back of my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">(BREAK IN TAPE) 1M: Can you imagine the emotion and feeling when you could go through the gate, with a big sign "Arbeit macht das Lieber," without anyone pointing a gun at your back.</span> <span id="s163">Some of us who really had the strength to roam around went wild, we went into the German barracks and we found guns.</span> <span id="s164">We were basically looking for food, but we found guns.</span> <span id="s165">The feeling of being able to walk around free without any guards.</span> <span id="s166">We stumbled across an Oberstundfeer of the camp who had probably several people for breakfast and lunch and dinner.</span> <span id="s167">We stumbled across him in the woods, wearing civilian clothing and carrying two suitcases, and we recognized him.</span> <span id="s168">And he knew who we were, we were still in the clothing (uniforms).</span> <span id="s169">We started drawing a gun on him saying, "Remember this is the guy who killed so many people," and one friend said "Take care of him, shoot him," and the other said "No you shoot him," and we argued back and forth for ten minutes but no one really had the nerve to shoot him.</span> <span id="s170">So we took his suitcases and we picked him up and gave him to the American authorities, which either meant a short prison term or who knows what.</span> <span id="s171">We don't know whether he was liberated again or what, but we just couldn't do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Nobody could shoot him?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">lM: There were a few.</span> <span id="s174">Really the Russian prisoners were tougher, they took care of a few.</span> <span id="s175">But we really couldn't.</span> <span id="s176">And I really can't think today as I reflect back on it whether I should have or shouldn't have.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: You couldn't kill?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">lM: And couldn't kill the murderer that we witnessed killing every day for the fun of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">27:16 (BREAK IN TAPE)</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: What sustained you in Melk?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">lM: Basically what sustained me was hope, hope that there is war going on and this war can't go on forever and as long as I can survive somehow then I may come out of it.</span> <span id="s182">We came to Melk about 18 to 20 boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">(BREAK IN TAPE) 3W: Target shooting at Jews.</span> <span id="s184">I remember, they tied a girlfriend of mine to a tree and target shot at her eyes just for amusement.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Did they kill her?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">3W: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: What else do you remember about the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">3W: I remember that we had as I mentioned the Judenrat, and one of the obligations of the Judenrat was to supply the Germans an allowance of workers everyday that they needed...</span></p> <p><span id="s189">(BREAK IN TAPE) 3W: I was the only one that came through the transport with pictures and it was a very unusual situation to have been in.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Out of this group, how many survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">3W: Out of that group of about 50 people, I am the only survivor.</span> <span id="s192">Out of my whole family, 76 people, only four people survived.</span> <span id="s193">One of the most trying moments was when I had to say goodbye to my mother and grandmother, and 30:05 brother.</span> <span id="s194">I remember this was the leader of our people the evening before we left, I said goodbye, I had to smuggle out in the morning from the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: You made the decision?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">3W: We had to go.</span> <span id="s197">I felt I wanted to join the underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: The Jewish underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">3W: The Jewish underground in Cracow.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: So you one day decided that that is what you wanted to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">3W: I had an Aryan look.</span> <span id="s202">I didn't look Jewish.</span> <span id="s203">For instance he had an Aryan look, but he had the misfortune of having one leg shorter than the other, so he would have been easily recognized.</span> <span id="s204">Even if he wanted to join, they didn't want him, because he would have been recognized.</span> <span id="s205">And anyone who looked definitely Jewish could not have joined because it was very hard to be disguised.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">(BREAK IN TAPE) 3W: I was hidden.</span> <span id="s207">The first day my father hid me under the stairs with another 20 people.</span> <span id="s208">And the Germans rechecked to see that there weren't any people hiding at all, but they didn't find us, otherwise they would have shot us all.</span> <span id="s209">The second day my father was up the whole night making a hiding place up in the attic, and made a double 31:46 wall, and put feather beds and other things to disguise the smell of human beings.</span> <span id="s210">I hid there with ten other people, and my father said "I don't trust these Germans, if they are not going to have enough people, and there were 15,000 Jews in that town, and they are not going to have enough people, then they are going to cut off a whole wing.</span> <span id="s211">And sure enough, they cut off a whole wing, and then they took my father in the last day of the deportation.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">(BREAK IN TAPE) 3W: I felt frightened, very much alone.</span> <span id="s213">I was as alone as everybody else was who were in the same shoes.</span> <span id="s214">I lived in Stajisk in a room with 500 women around me, and I felt good.</span> <span id="s215">Somehow this was a comfort to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: What was the importance of Stajisk to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">33:15 3W: The importance of Stajinsk to me was that I got no contact with another Zionist group.</span> <span id="s218">In Piotcuf I was not living with people with my background.</span> <span id="s219">They behaved very well, and were very considerate.</span> <span id="s220">In fact, I have to say that when they rescued me they not only used my money, but they used their own rings.</span> <span id="s221">It was like they all got together and wanted to rescue me as a matter of principle.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">(BREAK IN TAPE) 3W: ...An American P.O.W. working for him from a Polish background, and the next morning he came there and we were talking, and while we were sitting outside he expressed his fears that the camp would be liquidated before they come in and I didn't disclose that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s223">She was so involved with the fight, "the enemy is coming," and the children were still praying for the welfare of Hitler and the winning of the war, when they knew that the Americans were outside their door.</span> <span id="s224">And she didn't give me anything to eat, and I slept with the pigs, and shared the potatoes which tasted very good to me.</span> <span id="s225">The next morning sitting on a hill with an American soldier outside the door I saw the American 5th army walk in and I was liberated.</span> <span id="s226">In the gymnasium, one of the languages I had learnt was English and so I could communicate a bit.</span> <span id="s227">They wanted me to be translator.</span> <span id="s228">And when the war ended, all of a sudden I realized what had happened.</span> <span id="s229">I already had a friend who had run away before me, and so I ran off after her to the ?</span> <span id="s230">triangle?</span> <span id="s231">.</span> <span id="s232">I went back to the Tikham camp hoping that maybe I would find her.</span> <span id="s233">And then I stood by a German family.</span> <span id="s234">Those American soldiers took over the administration of the whole Biern village.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">(BREAK IN TAPE) 3W: I was just crazy about him, and he was crazy about me too.</span> <span id="s236">He could bring me into a store and buy me anything I wanted.</span> <span id="s237">I remember when he bought me high-heels when I was 12 years old.</span> <span id="s238">People in Europe just didn't do that sort of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">36:40</span></p> <p><span id="s240">(BREAK IN TAPE) 2M: I was a stamp collector and I was going to visit a German officer to exchange stamps.</span> <span id="s241">"Exchange stamps on a day like this?"</span> <span id="s242">I don't know about a day like this, but all I know is that I have to visit this German officer, and I mentioned the name...</span></p> <p><span id="s243">(BREAK IN TAPE) 2M: We came to the village, and suddenly there were police looking for a grandfather and a grandchild.</span> <span id="s244">I was sitting with the farmers who didn't recognize me as being Jewish.</span> <span id="s245">Suddenly there were some shots fired and they came across some other Jews who were hiding there.</span> <span id="s246">The farmers were afraid to hold me there, and I went into the field...</span></p> <p><span id="s247">(BREAK IN TAPE)</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: You mean because you entered the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">2M: Yes the fact that I entered the army, and that I made myself older (than I was) and that I knew German, I became a translator for them, I ?</span> <span id="s250">stymied them?</span> <span id="s251">, got away from them.</span> <span id="s252">But that was 1945, and at that time I was 15 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: How did you get reunited with your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">38:20</span></p> <p><span id="s255">(BREAK IN TAPE) 4W: ...Out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s256">And my husband asked if he could help us.</span> <span id="s257">He said he would like to find some Polish people who would maybe help us and take us in, but that was supposed to be for some big financial reward.</span> <span id="s258">We did not have any money, but we knew where some wag buried in the ghetto in Lublin.</span> <span id="s259">So these people were willing to help us out, and keep us for a little while.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">(BREAK IN TAPE)</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: How did it feel back in 1942-43?</span> <span id="s262">Did it feel like it was going to ever end?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">4W: No it didn't.</span> <span id="s264">When we were in 1944 in a small town, first of all, we knew that the Russians were advancing.</span> <span id="s265">It was a fact, because they were in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s266">Then we knew it would be only a matter of weeks or months before the Russians would come.</span> <span id="s267">It was just a matter of
