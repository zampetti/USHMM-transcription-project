Okay.</span> <span id="s38">So Ron, when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">[RJ] Er April the 30th 1917</span></p> <p><span id="s40">[DL] And whereabouts were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">[RJ] Here in Bassaleg.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">[DL] Okay.</span> <span id="s43">And what was your family background?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">[RJ] My father was a blacksmith.</span> <span id="s45">An industrial blacksmith.</span> <span id="s46">My mother, mother, was a tailor.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">[DL] And in terms of your schooling and your background?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">[RJ] I went to the local school, then I won a scholarship and went to the grammar school.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">[DL] And from there, what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">[RJ] When I was fourteen, my father was trades, all he believed in was trades and he wouldn’t let me stop there so they got me out at 14 and they apprenticed me to the local firm Geskin and Nettleford as a wire drawer.</span> <span id="s51">I learnt my trade as wire drawer.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">[DL] And when the outbreak of war actually happened when you were twenty two, whereabouts were you and what happened to you from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">[RJ] I worked in Cardiff, Eastmoor, Cardiff, GKN, Geskin and Nettlefold and, er, I got called up in September 1940, which was rather a mistake because I had a reserved occupation – er, cut a long story shot, it was, I had my call up papers but erm when I went down to work to see about it they discovered that my form that I had filled in to say that I had a reserved occupation was some typist put it in the incoming mail instead of the outgoing mail, no record of me at the labour exchange - so I got called up.</span> <span id="s54">So I went to the Brecon to the South Wales borders and I was there for about two months and I got called in to the CO as my firm had err tried to get me back naturally.</span> <span id="s55">Oh he said, you’ll have to serve three months proficiency pay first.</span> <span id="s56">I said, yes, okay.</span> <span id="s57">So another couple of months went by and I got another call to go in there and his argument then was oh it’s changed he said you’ll have to serve six months proficiency and then we’ll see about it.</span> <span id="s58">It was pretty obvious to me that he wasn’t going to let me go so, so, in the meantime, they offered me to let me go to a CADRE course and I thought it was a bit more money and so I took it.</span> <span id="s59">I had another request from the firm to get me back.</span> <span id="s60">And he said, “Oh my God,” he said, “NCOs I couldn’t let you go.</span> <span id="s61">On no account.”</span> <span id="s62">And within six months I was out abroad.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">[DL] So, where did they send you first?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">[RJ] They sent me out to Cairo.</span> <span id="s65">To the Citadel in Cairo.</span> <span id="s66">To make up a battalion of the First battalion Welsh Regiment that got knocked about in Crete.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">[DL] And briefly describe your time in North Africa leading up to your capture?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">[RJ] I was in Cairo for about four or five weeks</span></p> <p><span id="s69">[00:05:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s70">[RJ] and then they sent us what they called “the blue” up the desert and we fought our way up to Benghazi and we got up to Benghazi by Christmas, had my Christmas dinner there and then in January, forty five, the Russians, the Germans came out there and Rommel circled our camp at Benghazi and caught the lot of us, the whole end block.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">[DL] And how where you captured?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">[RJ] Er, Sgt Major Convill said to me Corporal Jones Go up the road and take a section up the road and see what is going on.</span> <span id="s73">(Laughs).</span> <span id="s74">I hadn’t gone 100 yards up the road and there was a dirty great tiger tank coming down the road with a big swastika on the side, a big black cross and there was err a fellow, I presume a German officer, sticked up in the turret there and in perfect English he said to me, “Come on boys drop your weapons, for you the war is over.”</span> <span id="s75">So I was a prisoner of war.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">[DL] So when you were captured where were you sent?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">[RJ] We taken up to Tripoli and we were put in empty little cargo boats that were going out to Naples with equipment for the Germans so I arrived in, I forget what the date was, it was about the end of February when I got out to Naples and the Italians took us down to Camp 065 in the heel of Italy in Brindisi err and I was there for about, oh, going on for nine months and then one day they got us together and put us on a train and took us up to a place I think it was called Tarona just outside Rome</span></p> <p><span id="s78">[DL] And when was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">[RJ] This was something like July, August 43.</span> <span id="s80">And then one day, the interpreter came round and he asked for anybody with engineering experience and, of course, a couple of hundred of us stuck our hands up.</span> <span id="s81">We wanted to know what for.</span> <span id="s82">He said, “Oh,” he said, “we are short of labour in the car factories in Milan,” and we thought, “Oh that’s a good thing to get out anyway” - cause nobody worked in Italy mind, so, anyway we got on this train now and we travelled overnight and we pulled up in this station in the morning thinking it was Milan and we heard “Rous!</span> <span id="s83">Rous!”</span> <span id="s84">outside and one of the boys said, “Hey, that’s German!”</span> <span id="s85">It was the Brenner Pass and they were handing us over to the Germans.</span> <span id="s86">The Germans then stuck us in cattle trucks, forty in a truck, and took me then I was in the truck for two days, no food, and we all had the runs, just imagine how humiliating it is in those trucks with no toilets nothing and we used one of the corners as a toilet.</span> <span id="s87">We go to, I think Stalag IVB at Moosburg, I think it was, and there they got us out they gave us some food and by this time, don’t forget, we are covered in lice.</span> <span id="s88">So they took all of our uniforms and put it in whatever it did, cleaned them up and gave it to us back whilst we were naked they took us through a place where they had like sheep shearers and they took all our hair off, everywhere, up, down below, up on the top, everywhere, and then they dabbed us with what I called was a bucket of creosote, and disinfectant anyway they put us back on the train now and we were on the train again for about another two days and eventually pulled up in a station called Lansdorf, Poland.</span> <span id="s89">Err, it was Stalag V111B</span></p> <p><span id="s90">[DL] And when, when did you arrive at Stalag VIIIB?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">[RJ] Stalag VIIIB?</span> <span id="s92">It was in err, I think it was around about the beginning of September 43.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">[DL] So when were you captured in North Africa?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">[RJ] I was captured in North Africa on the second week in January 45</span></p> <p><span id="s95">[00:10:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s96">[DL] Sorry, forty?</span> <span id="s97">When you were captured, was it 1943?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">[RJ] No, forty two.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">[DL] Forty two.</span> <span id="s100">So, you were captured in 1942 and then ended you up at Stalag VIIIB.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">[RJ] I ended up in Italy first and then Stalag VIIIB was close on I think it was, about, the end of, round about the beginning of September 43.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">[DL] Fine.</span> <span id="s103">So at this point you had spent close on 18 months in captivity.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">[RJ] In Italy, in Italy, it was a problem.</span> <span id="s105">If it hadn’t been for the Red Cross parcels then I don’t think we would have survived.</span> <span id="s106">All they gave us was a little loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s107">We used to call it a Piccolo Parnie.</span> <span id="s108">A bit of cheese and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s109">And then every day we used to get what we called potato soup, a ladle of soup, that was all we had.</span> <span id="s110">If it hadn’t have been for the Red Cross parcels then I don’t think we would have survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">[DL] In terms of what conditions were like at Stalag VIIIB, how did the Germans treat you and how long were you there for?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">[RJ] Well, the Germans didn’t bother us but the British had a bit of a err a centre, like a medical centre, they took all of our clothes and of course by then there was a blue diamond on the back of your coat and your trousers to say that you was a prisoner of war.</span> <span id="s113">Err, they sorted us out.</span> <span id="s114">By this time I had a beard and they sorted us out but, in Germany, everybody below the rank of Sergeant worked.</span> <span id="s115">There was about, as far as I know, 130,000 Prisoners of War, of all nationalities in Poland.</span> <span id="s116">They worked on farms, err, one mate of mine, Trevor Manly, lived up the road here, he worked in a coal mine, err, railways, err, then eventually, they picked out 280 of us and sent us out to work at IG Farben chemical industry.</span> <span id="s117">That’s all we knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">[DL] And, the British were effectively organizing themselves at Stalag VIIIB?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">[RJ] Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">[DL] So…</span></p> <p><span id="s121">[RJ] The guards didn’t interfere with us they effectively just patrolled the grounds.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">[DL] So how did you go from Stalag VIIIB to…</span></p> <p><span id="s123">[RJ] They took us on an ordinary civilian train, err, and (phone rings) we were on the train for several hours and then we pulled up in the station and we marched down to our camp.</span> <span id="s124">On the way down, we saw all this high barbed wire and men in pyjamas digging trenches.</span> <span id="s125">Now, don’t forget this is October and it’s pretty cold in Poland in October so I said to one of the guards, “Who are they?”</span> <span id="s126">And he said, “Juden!”</span> <span id="s127">I said, “Pardon?”</span> <span id="s128">And he said, just how I’ll say it, “Jews!”</span> <span id="s129">Like as though we should have known.</span> <span id="s130">It took us a couple of days to realize that it was Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s131">We didn’t know what Auschwitz was in those days but it didn’t take us long to find out what was going on.</span> <span id="s132">We went down to the works and found out.</span> <span id="s133">The first thing we noticed was a terrible smell and the Jews in the works told us it was the crematorium.</span> <span id="s134">We didn’t know what they were talking about to start with but after a while we realized what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">[DL] When you got to Auschwitz, your first POW camp there:E711.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">[RJ] Yes, yes, they took us into a camp called E711.</span> <span id="s137">It was pretty primitive.</span> <span id="s138">The toilets, for instance, were just a hole in the floor over a cesspool and we were there for two to three weeks and then they sent us over to E715 which I presume was a, a camp built for the Hitler Youth.</span> <span id="s139">There, of course, the facilities were totally different, we even had showers and flushed toilets and a place where you could do a bit of cooking.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">[DL] And the actual location of your first camp, E711, compared to Monowitz.</span> <span id="s141">Whereabouts would you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">[RJ] I think.</span> <span id="s143">We didn’t march there.</span> <span id="s144">We just sort of strolled over to the new place so I should imagine that it was attached to it but I am not quite certain of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">[00:15:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s146">[DL] But within the compound of Auschwitz itself (Ron: yeah), within the actual wired facility (Ron: yeah) that was Auschwitz (Ron: yeah)?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">[RJ] I would think we were about two to two and a half kilometers from Birkenau which was the death camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">[DL] And whereabouts was E715 Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">[RJ] It used to take us about 10 minutes, quarter of an hour to march there so it must have been quite close to IG Farben.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">[DL] And, what was the average day like for yourselves?</span> <span id="s151">In terms of…</span></p> <p><span id="s152">[RJ] We got up at half past five with a cup of Ersatz coffee, burnt acorns as they called it.</span> <span id="s153">(Laughs) Er, that’s all we had then, then we, oh, they used to give us a piece of bread, with, we used to have cut up a loaf of bread which we would cut up between eighteen of us, just one thick slice.</span> <span id="s154">And then we used to get, what they called a piece of cheese, it was like a round, err, how could you call a round pasty of cheese?</span> <span id="s155">You could see fish scales in it and it stunk like all the heaven.</span> <span id="s156">But when you’re hungry then, believe me, you’ll eat anything.</span> <span id="s157">Err, and then we had sometimes a bit of, sometimes, a bit of jam to go on your bread.</span> <span id="s158">That was the rations you had then you marched to work, you got into, marched about six o’clock, then you got into works about ten to quarter past six and then they used to hand us over to the civilians.</span> <span id="s159">There were nine of us in a little gang and they they, they handed us over to a fellow called Master Beaver.</span> <span id="s160">He was a a a German civilian.</span> <span id="s161">In fairness, he was pretty fair to us.</span> <span id="s162">He’d say like, I want this, we were, we were constructing, err, I worked on a place, there was synthetic petrol, when I got there it was only just being built.</span> <span id="s163">They had, what they called, the Germans called “kramers” – it was like, erm, an iron pipe about sixty feet high.</span> <span id="s164">There were three of them there and they were full of clay filters and the petrol used to go in through the top and down through the filters but we used to move err machinery and rails and, fair play for Beaver, he used to say “Get this done, get that done and you can go back to the camp.”</span> <span id="s165">So, occasionally, instead of going back to the camp at six o’clock, we went back at three o’clock in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s166">When we had completed what he wanted us to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">[DL] And what did you actually witness when you were at IG Farben when you were working in there with the slave laborers around you?</span> <span id="s168">How were they treated and what did you witness when you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">[RJ] Well, we saw, all these Jews working there and they used to be digging trenches and laying cables and all what we would used to call the menial tasks.</span> <span id="s170">You know.</span> <span id="s171">Err, to give you an idea, one of them, I had some, we had some food parcels in, so we didn’t eat the German rations so I had a piece of sausage and I took it down to the works one day and I gave it to one of these Jews and he said his name was Josef, a couple of days after he gave me that ring, he said he made it out of a steel pipe.</span> <span id="s172">I stuck it on my finger and there it’s been ever since.</span> <span id="s173">About a week after that, he disappeared, so I said to one of his mates, “Where’s Josef this morning?”</span> <span id="s174">and he said “Oh, gas chamber.</span> <span id="s175">Kaput.”</span> <span id="s176">That’s just what he said.</span> <span id="s177">The life of the Jews in the camp, they were in such a state, they were shambling about, bent up, couldn’t stand up straight and there lives at the works was about a month and when they couldn’t work they stuck them in a trolley (interrupts himself to correct) in a lorry and took them to the death camp to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s178">So the fellow who made that ring for me went to the gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">[DL] Did you see any high ranking SS officials?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">[RJ] Er, yes, we used to watch Kramer, I presume it was Kramer, someone said his name was Kramer.</span> <span id="s181">He’d been walking around the works with a gang around him.</span> <span id="s182">Fortunately, unfortunately, if a Jew got in his way then he’s just kick them out of his way and twice I’d saw him actually take his Luger out and shoot two of them.</span> <span id="s183">Different times.</span> <span id="s184">I’d actually seen him shoot a couple of Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">[00:20:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s186">[DL] When you saw that, what was your reaction?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">[RJ] Oh, crikey.</span> <span id="s188">Disgusted.</span> <span id="s189">It, it, it, if it had been in civilian life we would have mobbed him but what can you do against Germans that were armed?</span> <span id="s190">We, we, cat called, we shouted but he didn’t take any notice of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">[DL] How were you treated?</span> <span id="s192">How were the British POWs treated?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">[RJ] In fairness, the Jews (corrects himself) the Germans treated us alright.</span> <span id="s194">We never had really any problems.</span> <span id="s195">There was only one incident.</span> <span id="s196">These iron cylinders, the Germans used to call them “kramers.”</span> <span id="s197">One day me and Reynolds, err, Corporal Reynolds, was err, asked to go up and change over the pipes at the top because they occasionally flushed them, clean them out but Reynolds not able to speak enough German tried to explain that he did not have enough clothes or the right clothes.</span> <span id="s198">He said he was a bit hairy of heights, that he’d fall off, he kept on arguing and old Beever then sent for a guard.</span> <span id="s199">Unfortunately, it was, err, I don’t know his name but he was an Under Officer, like a Sergeant to us, three stripes.</span> <span id="s200">An argument, and he astonished me, he pulled his Luger out and he threatened Reynolds and Reynolds says I can’t go up there and he shoot him.</span> <span id="s201">You should have seen me go up there.</span> <span id="s202">I went up there like a monkey.</span> <span id="s203">(Slight quiet laugh)</span></p> <p><span id="s204">[DL] What was your reaction when, when you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">[RJ] Oh, terrible.</span> <span id="s206">We all got together.</span> <span id="s207">A crowd of us got together and remonstrated but when we got to camp that night that Under Officer had disappeared.</span> <span id="s208">When we enquired what had happened to him because we wanted the Red Cross to come there they said they’d sent him to the Russian Front.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">[DL] So you said that you wanted the Red Cross to investigate the shooting?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">[RJ] We wanted the Red Cross to investigate it because, let’s be fair, the Germans weren’t like that, they didn’t, they didn’t treat us bad at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">[DL] Because they treated the Jews badly.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">[RJ] (Jones does not hear and continues interview and ends reference to the Reynolds shooting by saying: That was just a one off).</span></p> <p><span id="s213">[DL] In terms of an actual war crime against the British POWs, as far as you’re aware, that was the only war crime which took place?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">[RJ] That was the only war crime which I spied myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">[DL] Okay.</span> <span id="s216">What was your initial impressions during your first few weeks at Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">[RJ] We couldn’t get over this smell and, and, and they were burning fellows, they were burning the Jews.</span> <span id="s218">It was astonishing.</span> <span id="s219">We just couldn’t believe it but, eventually, we knew it was right.</span> <span id="s220">That’s what was happening.</span> <span id="s221">It shook us rigid.</span> <span id="s222">We just didn’t know.</span> <span id="s223">We just couldn’t understand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">[DL] In terms of the crematoria, how did you know, what?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">[RJ] Occasionally, we would see smoke coming up and we’d say to ourselves that’s some more poor buggers burnt to death again.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">[DL] Were you scared of the crematoria?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">[RJ] Of course we were.</span> <span id="s228">We thought if ever they got desperate then they’d put us in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">[DL] So that was a very genuine concern?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">[RJ] That was a genuine scare.</span> <span id="s231">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">[DL] Even though the Geneva Convention supposedly…</span></p> <p><span id="s233">[RJ] Even though, there was always that danger.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">[DL] Okay.</span> <span id="s235">How did the British POWs cope, how did you cope, knowing that the gas chambers were, were on site and what was happening to the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">[RJ] Well, well, we just carried on working and I, I just can’t remember.</span> <span id="s237">We were alright.</span> <span id="s238">Prisoner of war life wasn’t all that bad.</span> <span id="s239">Err, we suffered malnutrition.</span> <span id="s240">To give you an idea we suffered with our teeth.</span> <span id="s241">Used to chip and enamel would come off with malnutrition.</span> <span id="s242">Err, and err, once every week on a Wednesday, a guard was allowed to take three or four of us err up into Caravichi to a Polish dentist.</span> <span id="s243">(Laughs) Laughable as I was on this and Wally Martin and two fellows went up to this Polish dentist one day, and the guard knocked on the door and the dentist came to the door but there was two German soldiers sat inside waiting their turn and, of course, immediately they jumped up, clicked their heels and “Heil Hitler!”</span></p> <p><span id="s244">[00:25:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s245">[RJ] and Wally Martin, as quick as a flash, said “Larry Adler!”</span> <span id="s246">so that became our signature tune.</span> <span id="s247">Ask John Bishop (corrects himself) or Brian Bishop, I’d expect he’ll remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">[DL] Did you take part on any acts of sabotage that the British undertook?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">[RJ] The only acts of sabotage that I did, when we use to go up to on the top (of the chimneys) to change these, we use to take a handful of sand and put a handful of sand, that was the only sabotage that I could get too.</span> <span id="s250">But I heard some of the boys when they were building things they used to disturb it and create all sorts but that’s the only kind of sabotage that I was involved in.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">[DL] So, how did that work?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">[RJ] We used to put a handful of sand when we were changing the pipes over.</span> <span id="s253">We’d stick a handful of sand in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">[DL] So, the pipes would become blocked?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">[RJ] Well, I presume that the synthetic petrol would wash it down into the others, so…</span></p> <p><span id="s256">[DL] And did you find that your fellow POWs didn’t want you to become involved in acts of sabotage?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">[RJ] No, because, we were all of us of the same opinion, I think.</span> <span id="s258">There was all sorts of sabotage that went on because they were still building it.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">[DL] And did you find that being married made a difference at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">[RJ] Yes, because I was married they didn’t allow me to be a member of the escape committee.</span> <span id="s261">They wouldn’t allow it because I was a married man.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">[DL] We’ve already touched on Master Beaver who was in charge of your working group you were in.</span> <span id="s263">How large was the working group that you were actually in…</span></p> <p><span id="s264">[RJ] There were nine of us who worked for Master Beaver.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">[DL] And in terms of the actual work which you undertook apart from cleansing out the towers, what other types of work did you undertake?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">[RJ] Oh, we used to move machinery around.</span> <span id="s267">As a matter of fact, the nail on my left foot is like a great big claw because I dropped a rail on it one day.</span> <span id="s268">We were moving rails for runners and things like that, all sorts of machinery.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">[DL] And in terms of the British and their attitudes towards you for medical help in that sort of situation.</span> <span id="s270">What sort of medical help was there for you at E715 Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">[RJ] All we had was a er, as far as I know, he was a South African doctor and that’s all we had.</span> <span id="s272">I think he had a fellow that used to assist him but I’m not quite sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">[DL] And what were conditions like in your medical facility there?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">[RJ] Erm, well, to get a day off as, one thing, we were covered in boils, I used to get boils and carbuncles and even when I came home I had them.</span> <span id="s275">And when I say I had a boil everywhere, I mean everywhere.</span> <span id="s276">I used to get terrible carbuncles and boils, I presume it was malnutrition.</span> <span id="s277">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">[DL] And the actual medical facilities on site at E715?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">[RJ] Oh, poor.</span> <span id="s280">Poor.</span> <span id="s281">They never had the equipment, they never had the drugs as far as I know.</span> <span id="s282">Don’t forget, we were all reasonably fit men so I don’t suppose we needed that kind of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">[DL] And in terms of your relationships with the Jews, how did that work?</span> <span id="s284">Did you build any type of relationship with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">[RJ] No, you weren’t allowed.</span> <span id="s286">They had Capos with them so you had to watch if he turned his head and you wanted to talk to a Jew, if a Capo saw it he’d go straight to the Jew and belt him with like a truncheon he used to carry.</span> <span id="s287">The Capos were as far as I know, they were Polish political prisoners and they used to wear an arm band with Capo on it, always in charge of the Jews.</span> <span id="s288">Why they treated the Jews like that, I don’t know, but they were sods, the Capos.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">[DL] In terms of what the British actually did to try to alleviate the suffering of the Jews, in terms of providing food or…</span></p> <p><span id="s290">[RJ] If we had any food cause when we had Red Cross parcels in we wouldn’t eat the rubbish that the Germans gave us so we always took it to work and gave it to the Jews when the Capo wasn’t looking of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">[DL] So, how would you give you’re your food, this is the soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">[RJ] Yeah, yeah, just give it to a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">[00:30:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s294">[DL] And what difference did that make do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">[RJ] Made us feel clever, made us feel good that we were doing something.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">[DL] And how did the Jews respond to it?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">[RJ] Of course, they used to be overwhelmed when you used to give them some food.</span> <span id="s298">Poor buggers were starving, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">[DL] So, their condition.</span> <span id="s300">How would you describe their condition today?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">[RJ] Terrible.</span> <span id="s302">Terrible.</span> <span id="s303">One day, er, they didn’t bring the soup for us so someone gave us what the Jews ate and it was just plan cabbage water.</span> <span id="s304">That’s all it was.</span> <span id="s305">Oh crikey, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s306">I’d take a mouthful and spit it out.</span> <span id="s307">Terrible.</span> <span id="s308">So that’s all the Jews lived on.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">[DL] And were the British able to pass cigarettes as well to the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">[RJ] Yes, if it was possible then we would.</span> <span id="s311">I wrote home and told my wife once that, err, cigarettes was currency so I think she used to go to Smiths in Newport and they had some scheme where you paid your money and they sent us parcels of cigarettes so I had quite a few parcels of cigarettes.</span> <span id="s312">One day, of course we used to take cigarettes down to the works and we used to barter for a bit of white bread and eggs and I had half a dozen eggs one day, coming back to the camp and we used to walk into the camp like this, you know, and the guard’s run his hands down to see if there’s anything and, this one day, I’d done it before but the guard went right down and found the eggs and he said, “Oh, I am, mein libre” and squashed the eggs around the leg and then took me into the guard room and then shoved me into a, in a civilian prison for three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">[DL] And was this prison on site in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">[RJ] No, up in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">[DL] No, sorry, up in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">[RJ] No in the civilian part of it.</span> <span id="s317">Up in the town of Auschwitz, it wasn’t called Auschwitz, we called it Auschwitz but I think was…</span></p> <p><span id="s318">[DL] Oswiecim?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">[RJ].</span> <span id="s320">Oswiecim.</span> <span id="s321">Something like that it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">[DL] So it was actually in Oswiecim .</span></p> <p><span id="s323">[RJ] In the village, yeah.</span> <span id="s324">It was just a police place, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">[DL] And what were facilities like in the cell there?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">[RJ] Bread and water, (laughs) that’s all I had for three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">[DL] When you were back at E715 Auschwitz, did you witness atrocities happening around your POW huts there?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">[RJ] There were no atrocities in our camp there, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">[DL] But, in terms of the Germans, bringing people, you talk about, the British cesspool being pumped out on one occasion and then the following day…</span></p> <p><span id="s330">[RJ] Oh that, yes, yes, they brought, they used to bring a a a horse and cart in those days of course and then they’d bring in tanks and pump out the sewers to empty them and one day, they went out in the fields opposite with these carts, knock the bung out the back and walk back and forth dropping all our muck in a field.</span> <span id="s331">And a couple of days after, a lorry pulled up, with, I presume, Jewesses on, and they like had a bag around their waist full of potatoes and a little mattock and bear feet and they walked through dropping a potato in it and of course, they were women, and we were all eyes naturally (laughs).</span> <span id="s332">What a disgusting thing, couldn’t believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">[DL] And how did the POWs, how did yourself react?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">[RJ] Well, we were crowding round and shouting and cat calling and booing.</span> <span id="s335">(laughs) I think the woman in charge of them was Irma Grese but I’m not quite sure.</span> <span id="s336">Someone said, “That’s Irma Grese” but I don’t know.</span> <span id="s337">I think after the war, I think they recognized her from Nuremberg and someone said when we had our reunion, “Hey, that was Irma Grese with those women.”</span> <span id="s338">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">[DL] And how did she treat the women who would…?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">[RJ] Well, whipping them, what do they call it?</span> <span id="s341">A leather thing and she used to shout at them.</span> <span id="s342">Treat them terrible.</span> <span id="s343">Terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">[DL] What were the guards like?</span> <span id="s345">Both in terms of what you have just described there and also in terms of…</span></p> <p><span id="s346">[RJ] I would say that 90 per cent of the guards were all men with patches on their eyes and wounds on their arms…</span></p> <p><span id="s347">[DL] I’m sorry, these are the guards who were?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">[RJ] These were our guards…</span></p> <p><span id="s349">[DL] At E715?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">[RJ] I think 90 per cent of the guards that we had had either been injured on the front or were too old to go to the front.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">[00:35:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s352">[DL] So these were the guards that were therefore in charge of yourselves, were….</span></p> <p><span id="s353">[RJ] In charge of us, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">[DL] Were members (Ron: yeah) of the German Army effectively (Ron: yeah) who were too poorly to fight…</span></p> <p><span id="s355">[RJ] The verntabel who was in charge of course was a normal verntabel he wasn’t injured but occasionally we used to get the Gestapo who would come into the camp and search because to start with they knew we had a wireless and to search for the wireless and if they knew we had cigarettes then they’d pinch them but we used to shove them in all sorts of places we used to hide everything more often than not we knew they were there</span></p> <p><span id="s356">[DL] Were they Gestapo or SS?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">[RJ] I wouldn’t know, we used to call them Gestapo but I they did have SS on their collars.</span> <span id="s358">I presumed they were all one in the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">[DL] How did you know when the SS came into your camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">[RJ] Oh, there was, a car, posh car pull up with four or five men, so you knew: Watch out!</span> <span id="s361">Gestapo about!</span></p> <p><span id="s362">[DL] And how did the guards change in their behaviour?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">[RJ] Oh, crikey.</span> <span id="s364">They were frightened to death of them (laughs) so they were a bit keen at that particular time and once the Gestapo, of course, had gone they’d relaxed again.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">[DL] And these were your guards, members of the German army who were too ill to fight?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">[RJ] In fairness, in fairness, we got friendly with a couple of guards.</span> <span id="s367">They they they didn’t they didn’t want war no more than we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">[DL] And in terms of what you witnessed with the SS guards, erm, at IG Farben and in Auschwitz itself.</span> <span id="s369">What were they like?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">[RJ] Oh, the SS.</span> <span id="s371">Terrible.</span> <span id="s372">Strict.</span> <span id="s373">Military.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">[DL] And what did you see them do?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">[RJ] Er, they used to walk around the works and er, used to push the Jews out the way but apart from when Kramer came round with half a dozen fellows with him there wasn’t that kind of problem as they were just building anyway, a lot of the works had just been reconstructed.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">[DL] You talked about the wireless, how did that actually work?</span> <span id="s377">Where did you find a radio from?</span> <span id="s378">How did you get it into your camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">[RJ] I wasn’t involved but, er, evidently they got a wireless down in the works and they broke it up into little parts and some fellows brought it back in.</span> <span id="s380">Don’t forget there were all sorts of technicians in the prisoner of war camp and they put it together.</span> <span id="s381">I believe that Coward, Charlie Coward, CMS Coward, used to have it inside a Red Cross parcel in the Red Cross stores and he used to go in there every night and get the latest news and then come round the camp and tell us what was going on so we knew exactly what was going on…</span></p> <p><span id="s382">[DL] And are…</span></p> <p><span id="s383">[RJ] We knew about the second front, we knew about the Russians coming in.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">[DL] And are you aware of any of the British POWs trying to then disseminate that information to the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">[RJ] Not as I know of.</span> <span id="s386">They might of but I I I the nine that I was involved in, we didn’t see much of the Jews at all.</span> <span id="s387">There was one incident that I’d like to tell you about.</span> <span id="s388">Master Beaver came to me one day and he says er he used to call me Jonas, not Jones, Jonas you get er tins of meat he said in your parcel don’t you?</span> <span id="s389">Bring one to work one day so I took this tin of bully beef to the works and he borrowed some bikes and three of us and Beaver went done to his cottage and he made us a big stew.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">[DL] And the cottage was within the perimeter of…</span></p> <p><span id="s391">[RJ] It was within in the perimeter of the erm…they encircled a village</span></p> <p><span id="s392">[DL] So it was within the perimeter of the Auschwitz camp</span></p> <p><span id="s393">[RJ] It was inside the perimeter of the electric fence</span></p> <p><span id="s394">[DL] And how did Master Beaver who was a civilian engineer, from what you’re saying there he seems to have treated you quite reasonably</span></p> <p><span id="s395">[RJ] Yes he treated us very fair</span></p> <p><span id="s396">[DL] And how did he treat….</span></p> <p><span id="s397">[RJ] We had no problem with him at all.</span> <span id="s398">The only incident we had and he was as shocked as we were was when Reynolds got shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">[DL] And how did Master Beaver treat the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">[RJ] I wouldn’t know, as far as I know I don’t think I see him in contact with any of the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">[DL] Did the Germans ever plant anyone in your camp to effectively spy on you?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">[00:40:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s403">[RJ] Well there was a rumour which went round the camp one day A fellow came in he said he had come from Stalag VIIIB and, er, well there was a bit of a doubt, I don’t know why, but there was a bit of a doubt about him.</span> <span id="s404">And after a couple of weeks, I heard that they killed him and dumped him in the cesspool whether that’s true or not I don’t know I wasn’t involved myself, I only heard it.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">[DL] The facilities at E715 Auschwitz, what were the facilities like there?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">[RJ] They were alright.</span> <span id="s407">We had proper toilets, we even had a proper shower.</span> <span id="s408">We used to walk across and have a proper shower occasionally.</span> <span id="s409">We were pretty good there, it was alright.</span> <span id="s410">All the huts had, er, hot water pipes around them, it was a bit cold at times but, er, don’t forget that in winter out there the temperature used to drop down to sometimes around 15 below…</span></p> <p><span id="s411">[DL] There was also a library?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">[RJ] Yes, we also had a library there.</span> <span id="s413">Some of the boys built up a library.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">[DL] And you also had a mending facility for clothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">[RJ] Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s416">Another thing we did was on a Sunday afternoon, we’d play football and when the Red Cross used to come there occasionally and inspect us all and found out that we used to play football there on a Sunday afternoon.</span> <span id="s417">I don’t know where they got the ball from, I’m not sure and we used to play on a Sunday afternoon and there was crowds – some of the, er, slave labourers from the different camps used to come and watch us and guards used to watch us, er, but once the Red Cross found out we played the next thing was they brought us four lots of shirts – English, Welsh, Scots and Irish and so we sorted ourselves out.</span> <span id="s418">There were eleven of us but we weren’t all, er, er, Welsh.</span> <span id="s419">Do you want to see a photograph?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">[DL] We’ll have a look at the photograph at the end.</span> <span id="s421">So it wasn’t just guards, and other POWs and local townsfolk, there were also concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">[RJ] Well, of course, other than our camp, there wasn’t guards around other camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">[DL] No, but in terms of those who actually watched and spectators.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">[RJ] Yes, it was slave labour but some of them were Poles, Ukranians, there were all sorts of different people.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">[DL] So, the Jews weren’t allowed to watch?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">[RJ] No, no.</span> <span id="s427">The Jews weren’t.</span> <span id="s428">The Jews weren’t allowed to go outside their camp – only to go to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">[DL] But some of the other slave labourers who were in a different category?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">[RJ] Yes, yes, sometimes on a lovely afternoon, they’d be a crowd around, cheering and shouting.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">[DL] So other slave labourers who were in a different category…</span></p> <p><span id="s432">[RJ] And in different camps</span></p> <p><span id="s433">[DL] And in different camps were…</span></p> <p><span id="s434">[RJ] But they were free, you know, they used to walk up and down the road, you used to see gangs of women, all sorts walking up the road, between us and IG Farben, the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">[DL] And these football matches: how often did you play?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">[RJ] Sunday afternoons.</span> <span id="s437">That was the only time we were allowed.</span> <span id="s438">In the summer.</span> <span id="s439">We couldn’t play in the winter because it was too cold then.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">[DL] And how long would these matches actually last for?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">[RJ] Oh, we were out there for a couple of hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">[DL] And how important were these matches for British POWs?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">[RJ] Oh, terrific in importance (laughs) you used to get rivalry but it was all for basic fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">[DL] In terms of the (pause) atrocities that were happening against the Jews, we’ve already touched on the food which you tried to supply to them.</span> <span id="s445">Were there any other ways in which the British tried to elevate the suffering of the Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">[RJ] Not as I know of.</span> <span id="s447">We used to pass them food but there was nothing else we could do.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">[DL] And, in terms of your own treatment, you talked earlier of the Italian camps and how difficult facilities were for you there and that at E715 Auschwitz: did you feel that facilities were better at E715 than in Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">[RJ] Oh, definitely.</span> <span id="s450">Yes.</span> <span id="s451">Yes, we were alright there just because we were prisoners of war, it didn’t make everything bad.</span> <span id="s452">We used to make the most of everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">[00:45:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s454">[RJ] We didn’t have the food we wanted naturally but, er, other than that, we used to make packs of cards out of cigarette packets – there was always something going on and then we had, we also had with us, Wally Martin, who was a small time producer with the BBC and he used to put plays on at night time and the Germans always kept the front row for the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">[DL] You were in one of Wally Martin’s plays called Sweeney Todd.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">[RJ] Yes, yes, he put a play on called Sweeney Todd.</span> <span id="s457">I was the Police Sergeant.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">[DL] And you acted alongside Arthur Gifford England who was in the same play.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">[RJ] Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">[DL] How long did the play last for, not just in terms of its duration.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">[RJ] We used to put it on for about two to three nights.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">[DL] And how popular were these plays?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">[RJ] Oh, everybody used to go to watch the plays.</span> <span id="s464">I can’t… We had one hut which had a stage and the hut was full.</span> <span id="s465">Always.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">[DL] So, how many people would you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">[RJ] A hundred or more I’d expect.</span> <span id="s468">Sure to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">[DL] And what difference did these plays make for yourselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">[RJ] Oh, it used to create all sorts of excitement.</span> <span id="s471">First of all there were the rehearsals and then there was the wigs.</span> <span id="s472">We used to make wigs, erm, we took the string from the Red Cross parcels and used to take us hours to thread it and make a wig, to make a brunette, we used to dip the wig in indelible pencil in the bucket to make a black one (laughs).</span></p> <p><span id="s473">[DL] And when the Nazis came to watch these plays in the front row…</span></p> <p><span id="s474">[RJ] It wasn’t Nazis that came in to watch the plays, this was the German guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">[DL] The German guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">[RJ] I wouldn’t call them Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">[DL] Why wouldn’t you call them Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">[RJ] I don’t think they, the only people we called Nazis were the Gestapo and the officials.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">[DL] So, in other words, members of the SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">[RJ] The guards weren’t like that.</span> <span id="s481">For instance, if you get a guard on his own then he used to call Hitler and all these, “silly buggers” and all.</span> <span id="s482">They didn’t believe in it no more than we did.</span> <span id="s483">They could see what was happening but they were controlled by the Nazis, weren’t they?</span> <span id="s484">So they didn’t have a chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">[DL] And do you remember, a censor watching the plays at the same time as you were on the stage?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">[RJ] Might have been, I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">[DL] So in terms of where you would have preferred to have been between E715 Auschwitz where the conditions were better for yourselves in terms of shower facilities and toilet facilities (Ron: yeah) but where you were constantly afraid that you might end up in the gas chambers, as you mentioned earlier, or the Italian camps where the facilities weren’t so good.</span> <span id="s488">Where would you have preferred to have been?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">[RJ] Oh, the German camp, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">[DL] At E715?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">[RJ] Oh, yes, at E715?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">[DL] Even though…</span></p> <p><span id="s493">[RJ] Stalag VIIIB was another place where the facilities were first class, no problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">[DL] So even though the facilities were there how did the British POWs feel knowing that the crematoria and the gas chambers were there and that there was all that suffering?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">[RJ] Well there was always that fear, you didn’t want to believe it but there was always that fear in the back of your mind that it could happen to you, I suppose.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">[DL] And, how, in terms of the Jews and that suffering being so close to you and the facilities which you had at your camp which were arguably better than they were at Italy and obviously certainly a lot better than anything that the Jewish victims were suffering – what sort of feeling did that leave in your camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">[RJ] Hard to describe really.</span> <span id="s498">I mean, it never used to bother us all that much but there was always that fear that we used to talk about sometimes, “Aye, I suppose we’d be next.”</span> <span id="s499">That type of thing.</span> <span id="s500">You made a joke of it.</span> <span id="s501">You know.</span> <span id="s502">You never took it serious.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">[DL] And apart from the plays, the card games and the football, were there any other recreational activities that was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">[RJ] Yes.</span> <span id="s505">There were all sorts going on.</span> <span id="s506">They used to have people who play in chess club, they’d have whist drives always something going on in the recreation hut as we’d call it.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">[DL] And when did you take part in these activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">[RJ] After we’d come back and had our food at night time.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">[DL] In the evening?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">[RJ] You were never idle.</span> <span id="s511">There was always something to do in the evenings.</span> <span id="s512">Always.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">[DL] And was this because you were pre-occupying yourselves to take yourselves away from the horror of what you were witnessing during the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">[RJ] Naturally, yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">[DL] So, this was almost unique in terms of your experience as a POW (Ron: yes, yes) in Italy (Ron: yes) where you didn’t seem to do,</span></p> <p><span id="s516">[00:50:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s517">[DL] is there a difference in the recreational time in Italy compared to your time at E715.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">[RJ] In Italy, it was shocking.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">[DL] I think what I’m trying to drive at is that were you deliberately trying to create different games, different activities, …</span></p> <p><span id="s520">[RJ] Occupy your mind, more than anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">[DL] Why did you think you had to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">[RJ] Because if you didn’t then you would be lying on your bed dreaming about home – we used to talk and if we were chatting then it was always about what food you’d have when you get home, what restaurants you’d go to when you got home all those kinds of things so it was better that you had something to do</span></p> <p><span id="s523">[DL] And did people chat about what was happening to the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">[RJ] Yes, we were absolutely appalled.</span> <span id="s525">We just couldn’t believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">[DL] So what did people talk about when you did talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">[RJ] How disgusting it was.</span> <span id="s528">Terrible.</span> <span id="s529">Sometime you just couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s530">It just didn’t make sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">[DL] How common was the knowledge of mass murder and the gas chambers?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">[RJ] Everyone knew about it because we used to talk about it and another thing we used to see because the Jews in Monowitz who used to work in the works were on the other side of the football field when their life in the factory was over, we used to see a lorry go up the road with them all standing up in there and we used to say, “Oh there’s another load going up to the gas chamber.”</span></p> <p><span id="s533">[DL] And how often would you see that?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">[RJ] Once a week.</span> <span id="s535">I forget know.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">[DL] And how many people would you say in that lorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">[RJ] Oh, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s538">40?</span> <span id="s539">Maybe 50?</span> <span id="s540">Something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">[DL] And were these all men?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">[RJ] All men.</span> <span id="s543">It was men that worked in the works.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">[DL] Did you see any women in the works?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">[RJ] No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">[DL] So it was just men?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">[RJ] We never saw any women working in the works.</span> <span id="s548">The only women we saw working in the works was Ukraines and Poles.</span> <span id="s549">People like that.</span> <span id="s550">There was no Jewish women.</span> <span id="s551">I never saw a Jewish woman in the works.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">[DL] How were the Jewish women, sorry, the Ukranian women treated in the works compared to the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">[RJ] Well, we used to try to get in touch with them naturally (laughs).</span> <span id="s554">I have heard of one fellow, I don’t know who it was, made a big friend of one of the Ukrainian women and actually went and visited her after the war and they got married.</span> <span id="s555">I don’t know how true that is but I did here about it that they had got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">[DL] How far away from the crematoria would you say you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">[RJ] I would say about two and a half kilometers, two to three kilometers.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">[DL] And, upon occasion you could see the smoke?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">[RJ] We could see the smoke.</span> <span id="s560">Another thing we could do.</span> <span id="s561">I remember being up on top of one of those kramers one day and you could look down into the works in the crematorium area.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">[DL] Could you see transports arrive?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">[RJ] I thought I saw a train but I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">[DL] In terms of, just going back to the football matches briefly.</span> <span id="s565">You were the goal keeper in the Welsh team.</span> <span id="s566">What was the actual atmosphere like during those games?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">[RJ] Great.</span> <span id="s568">You used to forget everything and just play football.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">[DL] In terms of the actual duration, and I know we touched upon this earlier, how long do you think the games lasted for?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">[RJ] Oh, about, I can’t remember, you used to get tired quick.</span> <span id="s571">I should think about half an hour each way.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">[DL] And the reason for you getting so tired so quickly?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">[RJ] Malnutrition, wasn’t it.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">[DL] You wore a Welsh playing badge and obviously the kit came from the Red Cross but where did your Welsh playing badge actually come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">[RJ] I had a fellow, draw.</span> <span id="s576">If our socks wore out they’d give us squares of cloth around 12 inches square</span></p> <p><span id="s577">[DL] This is the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">[00:55:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s579">[RJ] I took a piece off one day and I can’t remember his name, Aiden John I think it was from Pontypridd and he drew the Prince of Wales feathers on there and I embroided it with some of the old socks that we threw away.</span> <span id="s580">I made eleven of them whether the other fellows brought them home or not I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">[DL] And you still have that today?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">[RJ] I still have it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">[DL] There were photographs that were actually taken of the team – of the Welsh team.</span> <span id="s584">How were those photographs done?</span> <span id="s585">The photographs, who took the photographs?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">[RJ] The Poles used to come into our camp, repairing and all sorts of things so we used to give them a packet of cigarettes, all sorts of things, a bar of chocolate.</span> <span id="s587">And they used to take photographs.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">[DL] Did it ever surprise you that the Nazis and their plans for mass murder were obviously authorized in secrecy and yet you were so aware of what was going on around you and certainly allowing Poles into the camp to take photographs of yourself and from what you were saying about ordinary members of the German Army being your guards.</span> <span id="s589">Does that surprise you in terms of the lack of security around you, the openness with which murder was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">[RJ] If the Poles came into the camp to do anything then a guard always came with him.</span> <span id="s591">He was never away from him so he couldn’t talk.</span> <span id="s592">But if he brought a camera in, I think it was done once and then it just caught on.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">[DL] But does the openness of the nature of the abuses that were happening around you, does that surprise you when you look at how secretive the Nazis were?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">[RJ] Yeah, but the guards weren’t like that.</span> <span id="s595">They used to help you more than hinder you.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">[DL] These were the German Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">[RJ] The German guards were alright – no problem.</span> <span id="s598">We never had any problem with the German guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">[DL] But it would only be the SS if you were to have a problem?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">[RJ] Oh, the SS, that’s a different kettle of fish.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">[DL] And did you ever have problems with the SS?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">[RJ] No, I didn’t but I know several who did.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">[RJ] In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">[DL] Well, they used to search and if they found anything then they just accepted it, took it - which annoyed some fellows of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">[DL] So, were there any punishments given by the SS to the British?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">[RJ] No, I know a couple of chaps who got caught with stuff, like I did with my eggs, and they stuck them in a civilian prison for a couple of days.</span> <span id="s607">I’ll tell you one thing that happened.</span> <span id="s608">Don’t forget the perimeter of the works enclosed the village so evidently one of the boys found like a bit of a small duck, or whatever it was, so he killed it as it was around Christmas time and he brought it back in.</span> <span id="s609">He tied the legs around his waist and he had the neck down where his old boy was and the guard found it, touched it, he thought he was looking for women.</span> <span id="s610">Anyway, he found it and he took him into the guard room and he come back laughing as even the Verlthere was laughing about it and let me keep it so he brought it home.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">[DL] Just going back to the way in which the Jews were actually treated, did you ever discuss their conditions once you played your football, had cards, or during rehearsals in the play, did you discuss at that point how you felt they were being mistreated.</span> <span id="s612">What sort of discussions did you ever have on the subject?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">[RJ] I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s614">I just don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">[DL] How many men were there at E715 Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">[01:00:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s617">[RJ] I always understood that there were 280 of us who went out to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s618">But of course when they bombed the factory one day, a bomb dropped in our camp and killed about 30 or 40 of our men.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">[DL] The bombing raid at E715 Auschwitz, when did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">[RJ] One Sunday morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">[DL] Do you remember the year?</span> <span id="s622">The date?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">[RJ] It must have been during forty four.</span> <span id="s624">I can’t remember dates.</span> <span id="s625">It must have been around forty four.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">[DL] And what actually happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">[RJ] Well, we used to hear the sirens going off.</span> <span id="s628">Oh, one day, it happened when we were down in the works and a few of us jumped into a trench.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">[DL] And the actual bombing raid?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">[RJ] Now, if I remember rightly, we were injured when we were in that trench and we had blood coming from our mouths and our bottoms and I was taken into hospital for three or four days, civvy hospital.</span> <span id="s631">Who was with me I can’t remember.</span> <span id="s632">When you talk about these things memories come back don’t they?</span> <span id="s633">I can’t remember any more than that?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">[DL] And the bombing raid of forty four?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">[RJ] During forty four, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">[DL] What happened and where were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">[RJ] It’s only once I remember when I was put in hospital.</span> <span id="s638">But basically it was always on a Sunday morning when there was no one working there and then they used to get us in on Monday to get everything right again.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">[DL] You talked about, earlier, before we started the interview about the carpet bombing – could you talk us through that again?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">[RJ] When the sirens went off we used to watch the planes – they weren’t very high they used to come in from four quarters and we used to say, Hello, Number one shovel ready and they used to come down all at once.</span> <span id="s641">They called it carpet bombing, I think.</span> <span id="s642">But the sky was full of these little bombs.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">[DL] And on the Sunday when the air raid shelter was hit – what actually happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">[RJ] Well they used to drop into the works and on one occasion, I think there was a bombing raid about three or four times whilst I was there.</span> <span id="s645">They used to get us to work the following morning to rectify all the problems which had happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">[DL] You were in a depression, a small grove?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">[RJ] Yes, yes, when the bomb dropped on our camp.</span> <span id="s648">The Germans allowed us to dig a trench and put some tin sheets over the top and then the earth would be put over it.</span> <span id="s649">Now I’m a bit claustrophobic, luckily, and I didn’t go in there.</span> <span id="s650">I wasn’t the only one mind, there was quite a few of us who didn’t go into the shelter.</span> <span id="s651">We just lay on the ground outside and, of course, a bomb went right into the entrance of the shelter, chaos, chaos.</span> <span id="s652">I think there was about thirty or forty killed there and they were buried in the cemetery up in the village but when I went back there to look they’d been taken from there and put into a proper cemetery for British soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">[DL] What was the feeling amongst British soldiers afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">[RJ] Oh, terrible.</span> <span id="s655">Terrible.</span> <span id="s656">Hard to describe.</span> <span id="s657">We were all upset, of course we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">[DL] What about the experiences the Jews would tell you about?</span> <span id="s659">Did the Jews talk about their experiences with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">[RJ] No.</span> <span id="s661">No.</span> <span id="s662">You wouldn’t get near enough to a Jew to talk about.</span> <span id="s663">At least I didn’t.</span> <span id="s664">I have heard that others did but I didn’t get near enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">[DL] Why was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">[RJ] There wasn’t any Jews working in my area.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">[DL] So your working party at IG Farben?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">[RJ] Was in a little section.</span> <span id="s669">There were Jews out in the front like where we saw them digging trenches and all they were but….</span></p> <p><span id="s670">[01:05:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s671">[RJ] …we were in an area with machinery you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">[DL] Were any of the British POWs subjected to cruel, harsh or degrading treatment?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">[RJ] Apparently so, apparently so, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s674">I have heard of meeting somebody after the war and all this business but I don’t know about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">[DL] And in terms of conditions for people like yourself who worked at IG Farben, what were conditions like for yourself there?</span> <span id="s676">Also, there was the story of the Rolex watch and you swapping of cigarettes for the Rolex watch.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">[RJ] How I come to have the Rolex watch, the Poles used to come bartering with us, of course, they wanted cigarettes.</span> <span id="s678">One day a Pole came with a little box and he opened it up and there was a Rolex oyster watch in there.</span> <span id="s679">He wanted some cigarettes.</span> <span id="s680">So, the following day, I took down, I think, something like a couple of hundred cigarettes, a parcel for the Rolex oyster watch.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">[DL] And what happened to the watch?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">[RJ] Well, you know we left Auschwitz in January 1945 and we were on that march and I had it on my wrist, of course, but you have your hands on your haversack and a German officer spotted this Rolex Oyster watch and he kept on pestering me and I thought he would take it but in fairness he didn’t but he did say to me, one day, he says “you may as well give this to me as your going to die one day anyway.</span> <span id="s683">You’re not going to complete this march.”</span> <span id="s684">That kind of thing but I don’t think they knew where we were going or what was happening.</span> <span id="s685">Anyway, after a couple of days he came with a sack of bread.</span> <span id="s686">I don’t know where he got it from, Well, I couldn’t get the watch off quick enough, could I?</span> <span id="s687">There was a gang of us there and we had a good feast for a few days.</span> <span id="s688">It was plain bread but it was food.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">[DL] And do you know where the watch came from, the Pole who gave it to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">[RJ] I haven’t a clue.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">[DL] There were various stories after the war from men who had been at E715 Auschwitz who claimed to have swapped places with (interruption from camera operator and clap for sync at 01:07:41)… so the stories that came out after the war from individuals at E715 Auschwitz who claimed to have swapped places with….</span></p> <p><span id="s692">[RJ] Denis Avey</span></p> <p><span id="s693">[DL] Denis Avey and Charlie Coward being two among them.</span> <span id="s694">Firstly, what’s your views on Charlie Coward’s story?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">[RJ] Oh, absolutely a lot of lies.</span> <span id="s696">Definitely.</span> <span id="s697">What he says he done in the works is just plain stupid.</span> <span id="s698">In one instance, he says he had a hard cart and he went down into the works with a handcart.</span> <span id="s699">He never come out of E175, I never see him in the works and where did he get the handcart from?</span> <span id="s700">I never saw any hard cart.</span> <span id="s701">And he used to go around the works and get the dead Jews out – what for?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">[DL] So Charlie Coward who was the POW liaison officer for the Red Cross, what you’re saying is whilst he claimed to get radio parts as well…</span></p> <p><span id="s703">[RJ] Whether he got the parts.</span> <span id="s704">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s705">Someone else got the parts and then he looked after the wireless, he knew where it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">[DL] Fine.</span> <span id="s707">So he was the one</span></p> <p><span id="s708">[RJ] As far as I know</span></p> <p><span id="s709">[DL] But as far as him being down in the works, you never saw him there… so his story of the handcart…</span></p> <p><span id="s710">[RJ] It’s all poppycock.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">[DL] So, his story about finding…</span></p> <p><span id="s712">[RJ] And I’ve talked to Dougie Bond and he says the same thing.</span> <span id="s713">He says it was all lies.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">[DL] So Charlie Coward whose affidavit was presented to Nuremberg after the war and in his book where he talks about how he swapped places with someone in the Jewish concentration camp there.</span> <span id="s715">In your mind that isn’t possible?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">[RJ] From my point of view, yes, I couldn’t see it happening, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">[DL] More recently, Denis Avey (Jones: He said the same thing) has gone on to write alongside a British journalist…</span></p> <p><span id="s718">[01:10:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s719">[DL] …a book called The Man Who Broke into Auschwitz, what’s your view on Denis Avey’s story?</span></p> <p><span id="s720">[RJ] A lot of his book is authentic but as far as he said that he would change places with this Jew.</span> <span id="s721">I just can’t believe it.</span> <span id="s722">I just can’t.</span> <span id="s723">If you could see the situation you’d say the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">[DL] What makes you believe that he couldn’t do what he claimed to have done?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">[RJ] Well.</span> <span id="s726">For instance, when we walked into our camp in the evenings, we always walked in with our hands up stretched.</span> <span id="s727">If a Jew had done that, he just couldn’t.</span> <span id="s728">You should have seen the state of them.</span> <span id="s729">They used to shamble about.</span> <span id="s730">They didn’t walk, they just shambled about with their heads bent, shoulders bent, they just couldn’t straighten up, they just couldn’t have held their hands up.</span> <span id="s731">Impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">[DL] What changes actually occurred in the camp towards the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">[RJ] Not a lot really.</span> <span id="s734">We noticed that the guards weren’t as keen as they used to be.</span> <span id="s735">They were more friendly, put it that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">[DL] When you say they weren’t as keen as they used to be?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">[RJ] Well, they’d talk to you.</span> <span id="s738">They wouldn’t have talked to you before.</span> <span id="s739">On that march, for instance, alright they controlled you but not in the same sense as guards would normally do.</span> <span id="s740">They used to stick us in barns and leave us overnight.</span> <span id="s741">I think they would go to the farmhouse for a meal where as we were shut in barns.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">[DL] In terms of changes towards attitudes towards the Jews.</span> <span id="s743">What changes did you notice in their treatment?</span> <span id="s744">Did you notice any different changes?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">[RJ] No, no.</span> <span id="s746">The only thing that I saw at the end of the war is that they let a lot of the Jews out when they could hear the Russians fighting and when we were marching through the Carpathian mountains we saw Jews dead on the side of the road.</span> <span id="s747">Loads of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">[DL] So, how did the march actually start?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">[RJ] About the second week of January 45 and we were hoping that the Russians would release us because we could hear them fighting up the road, several miles away of course, Jerry walked into the camp and told us to pick up what gear we could carry as “we are marching you out.”</span> <span id="s750">They stuck us on the road and, apparently, it was one of the worst winters they had had for fifty years.</span> <span id="s751">The temperature was around 15 to 20 degrees below, they marched us through the Carpathian mountains and down through Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s752">We were 17 weeks.</span> <span id="s753">I wrote it all down on the back of one of Gladys’ photographs.</span> <span id="s754">We were 17 weeks on the road and we marched something like 9000 miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">[DL] 900 miles?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">[RJ] About 900 miles.</span> <span id="s757">We had no food and even the guards themselves didn’t have any rations to give us.</span> <span id="s758">All we ate, they used to put us in barns at night time, all we ate was what the animals ate or what was in the barns: carrots, Swedes, mangoes.</span> <span id="s759">I remember kicking a pig out of the way once and pinching the potatoes he was eating.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">[DL] In terms of the route (interruption by camera operator and additional clap for sync at 01:14:03).</span> <span id="s761">When you started the march, what evidence was there for the Jews taking the same route as you were now taking?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">[RJ] We saw them died on the side of the road, they just couldn’t take it.</span> <span id="s763">I didn’t count them but I saw dozens and I mean dozens of dead bodies on the side of the road in the snow.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">[DL] In terms of yourselves, how bad were conditions on that route?</span></p> <p><span id="s765">[RJ] Terrible, absolutely appalling.</span> <span id="s766">Don’t forget there were thousands on the road getting away from the Russians but the guards took us around country lanes – that’s how we come into the barns.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">[DL] Were there abuses?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">[01:15:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s769">[DL] Did prisoners of war die on this march?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">[RJ] Yes.</span> <span id="s771">We tried to couple of them.</span> <span id="s772">I tried to help a couple of them.</span> <span id="s773">There was one fellow from Jersey, I remember he lost part of his nose from frostbite.</span> <span id="s774">I tried to pick him up.</span> <span id="s775">I just couldn’t.</span> <span id="s776">I was in a state myself.</span> <span id="s777">I just left him there.</span> <span id="s778">I just presume he died, I just don’t know.</span> <span id="s779">As far as I know when we got to Regensburg in Austria, there was about 150 of us so there was close to 80 or 90 that had died on the side of the road.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">[DL] How did you fair during the course of this march?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">[RJ] Shattered, knackered.</span> <span id="s782">I shambled.</span> <span id="s783">I was in a terrible state and I think what kept me alive was my Rolex Oyster watch.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">[DL] Because you swapped it for food?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">[RJ] I swapped it for food.</span> <span id="s786">But don’t forget that I was an extremely fit young man when I joined the army.</span> <span id="s787">I was thirteen stone two and as fit as a fiddle.</span> <span id="s788">I belonged to the Oxford boys, I was weight lifting.</span> <span id="s789">I was extremely fit.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">[DL] When you finished the walk, what weight were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s791">[RJ] When I finished the march, I ended up in Regensburg.</span> <span id="s792">I didn’t know it was Regensburg.</span> <span id="s793">They put us in a barn and the following morning they didn’t open up and someone said, “Hey, the guards are gone.”</span> <span id="s794">So we got out.</span> <span id="s795">We heard rumours that the Americans were close, mind.</span> <span id="s796">To give you an idea what happened, some of the boys found a cellar in the barn and he found some joints of pork and all which the farmer had hung up and naturally it disappeared didn’t it?</span> <span id="s797">And then the guards said that they were going to line us up and shoot us all as the farmer had created a fuss over the missing meat but the next morning and the guards were gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">[DL] So, what month was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">[RJ] This was April forty five.</span> <span id="s800">The end of April.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">[DL] And how were you actually freed?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">[RJ] We got out of the barn and loads of us and don’t forget that we were covered in lice, I lost my boots and we walked down into the town and found the town was Regensburg and we found a hotel called the Gruener Kranz and we realized that the Americans had been billeted there.</span> <span id="s803">The Americans in those days were issued with what was called Compo parcels so, of course we found a lot of them with food in, some had cigarettes in, some had gum in.</span> <span id="s804">We made pigs of ourselves and then the Yanks came out and I don’t know how many of us but I know the Yanks came and took us up to a place called a delousing centre and they took us in there and they deloused us and then they took a crowd of us to what I would call a rest centre.</span> <span id="s805">It was just, I can’t remember really, but I would describe it as a rest centre and there, they took all of our clothes and burnt them.</span> <span id="s806">I came home, dressed as a Yankee soldier, they kitted us out as a raw recruit.</span> <span id="s807">I still have the two blankets upstairs and I have the knife and fork in the draw.</span> <span id="s808">I came home dressed as a Yankee soldier.</span> <span id="s809">I was in this rest centre for close on a fortnight.</span> <span id="s810">By this time I was getting better, of course, but by this time I was only just over seven stone when the Yanks picked me up.</span> <span id="s811">Then they put us on the Red Cross train and took us to Le Harve and there there was a fleet of Dakotas.</span> <span id="s812">I landed at Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire.</span> <span id="s813">They had long tables there with telegrams all written out and we just filled our name and address and what was on the telegram was “Arrived in England.</span> <span id="s814">See you soon.”</span></p> <p><span id="s815">[01:20:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s816">[RJ] Then we had a medical and a shower and the following morning we got on trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">[DL] And…</span></p> <p><span id="s818">[RJ] When we got home, I think it was the first week of May.</span> <span id="s819">The first week in May…</span></p> <p><span id="s820">[DL] When you arrived back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">[RJ] When I arrived back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">[DL] When you returned back to South Wales, what was people’s attitudes towards you?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">[RJ] Well, of course, I got invited to all sorts.</span> <span id="s824">I used to be called down and I never told anybody about Auschwitz though.</span> <span id="s825">I told my family but I never told anyone else.</span> <span id="s826">They just thought I was a German prisoner of war for three and a half years and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">[DL] Why didn’t you tell anyone?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">[RJ] It just didn’t dawn on me to tell anyone about Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s829">It was just a wartime experience best forgotten and since then, you ask Bishop and all, and I bet you they’ll tell you the same thing: they never told anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">[DL] Why was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">[RJ] I just don’t know.</span> <span id="s832">To me, it was just a wartime experience and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">[DL] What was your state of health like when you got back?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">[RJ] By the time I got home I was still under eight stone.</span> <span id="s835">I remember Gladys, my wife, put me in the bath on the first night and she started crying.</span> <span id="s836">I said “Love, don’t cry.</span> <span id="s837">I’m here in one piece.</span> <span id="s838">I left men out there who will never come home.”</span> <span id="s839">That sobered her up a bit but she was upset, of course, the state I was in.</span> <span id="s840">Another thing was that I was covered in boils for 18 months to two years.</span> <span id="s841">For eighteen months I had them everywhere and when I say everywhere, I mean everywhere, and then one day, a local doctor, Dr Desmond Hull said, “Come over to the surgery, Ron.”</span> <span id="s842">I knew him from school, of course.</span> <span id="s843">He gave me a little tiny bottle of tablets.</span> <span id="s844">There was no label on it, just a little bottle of little tiny tablets and he astonished me.</span> <span id="s845">He said, “Take 14 on the first day then 12 then 10 until you’ve taken the whole bottle and I took them and I’ve never had a boil since.</span> <span id="s846">Not even a pimple.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">[DL] And, your mental state of health?</span></p> <p><span id="s848">[RJ] I was in a shocking state.</span> <span id="s849">If a plane went overhead then I was under the bed, straightaway.</span> <span id="s850">No problem.</span> <span id="s851">Gladys used to coax me out but she wouldn’t get me out until that plane had gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">[DL] In terms of nightmares?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">[RJ] I used to get terrible nightmares.</span> <span id="s854">For instance, when I went back to work I occasionally worked night and she was in bed, naturally.</span> <span id="s855">I used to walk upstairs backwards, I used to look behind me all the time.</span> <span id="s856">Nerves, I was a bag of nerves.</span> <span id="s857">I used to lose my temper, I was in a terrible state.</span> <span id="s858">I should say that it took me all of about five years at least to get back to what I would call a normal man.</span> <span id="s859">I’ve never ever weighed 13 stone again – I’ve got to twelve but I’ve never been bigger.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">[DL] When you realized the extent of The Holocaust and the numbers involved at Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">[RJ] Terrible, terrible, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">[DL] Did you ever realize that it was that bad at Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">[RJ] Yeah, well, we learnt then that different people would talk to us.</span> <span id="s864">I learnt then that it wasn’t only Jews who were put to death there.</span> <span id="s865">I think there was about 30,000 Jehovah’s Witnesses, there were 29000 gypsies, there were Russians, there were all sorts apart from the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">[DL] But being so close to what was happening, what psychological effect did that have on you after the war when you realized what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">[RJ] Oh, I don’t know, I forget now.</span> <span id="s868">I never told anybody.</span> <span id="s869">I never spoke about it.</span> <span id="s870">It wasn’t until Schindler’s List when it first came on the television.</span> <span id="s871">But nobody talked about Auschwitz in those days.</span> <span id="s872">It just wasn’t discussed, I never talked to anybody about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">[DL] Why, why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">[RJ] I don’t know.</span> <span id="s875">And I’ve spoken to several.</span> <span id="s876">Dougie Bond.</span> <span id="s877">He never told anybody.</span> <span id="s878">Denis Avey – he never told anybody until recently.</span> <span id="s879">I just don’t know.</span> <span id="s880">It was just one of those things which happened during the war and you just forgot about it</span></p> <p><span id="s881">[01:25:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s882">[RJ] and then you just started to put it on the television and then, of course, all your memories come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">[DL] Did you go back to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s884">[RJ] Yes, in 1999, my nephew said to me one day, “Like to go back to Auschwitz, uncle Ron?”</span> <span id="s885">I said, “Yeah, I wouldn’t mind, why?”</span> <span id="s886">“I’d like to go,” he said.</span> <span id="s887">So he booked the plane to go and on the Wednesday, he rang me up and said, “Come into the office,” he was an estate agent, you know.</span> <span id="s888">So I went to the office and put a tie on and when I went there, the local paper, the Argus was there, with a photographer and took my story.</span> <span id="s889">That was the first time I’d told anybody about it.</span> <span id="s890">Then on the Thursday, I had a telephone call from HTV, they understood I was going back to Auschwitz on Friday and could I have the number of your flight.</span> <span id="s891">I think they were willing to send a photographer with me.</span> <span id="s892">Anyway, there was no room on the plane apparently and so when I came back I came home on the Monday.</span> <span id="s893">On the Tuesday, I had another phone call from HTV and they said, “Can we come and see you?”</span> <span id="s894">So they came here and, of course, I was on the television a couple of days after.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">[DL] In terms of your experience at Auschwitz when you went back, what memories did that create?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">[RJ] Oh, terrible.</span> <span id="s897">I couldn’t sleep.</span> <span id="s898">I could see them Jews walking about again.</span> <span id="s899">Proper nostalgic.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">[DL] When you talked about the Jews walking about, obviously this is something which has stayed with you.</span> <span id="s901">Why has that been such an overwhelmingly powerful memory for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">[RJ] Well, when I came home and HTV found out about it, a local Argus came to see me and I had a big write up in the local press and the local headmasters saw it and could I come along and have a chat with the children.</span> <span id="s903">I’ve been down to three or four schools and then groups of people asked me to come and so I called it “The Soldier’s Story.”</span> <span id="s904">Then when they found out about me, the ASA film company, Steven Saunders, phoned me and said could he have an interview.</span> <span id="s905">So he did and they came here and, I don’t know if you’ve seen it, they made a film called “The Long March to Freedom.”</span> <span id="s906">It was on the Yesterday programme and I still have a DVD of it if you’d like to borrow it.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">[DL] You were talking about your memory…</span></p> <p><span id="s908">[RJ] And then my memory started to come back but I couldn’t remember then and how but the more I talk about it then little things come back to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">[DL] Were you interviewed after the war at all for your experience at Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s910">Did any war crimes investigators interview you?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">[RJ] I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s912">No, it was mostly newspapers, magazines, that kind of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">[DL] That would have happened in the latter part of your life as opposed to after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">[RJ] Yes, since “The Long March to Freedom” was on the television and people saw that and people wanted to know about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">[DL] But, in terms of actual war investigators or war crime investigators?</span></p> <p><span id="s916">[RJ] No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">[DL] Because Reynolds, Corporal Reynolds’ shooting was investigated</span></p> <p><span id="s918">[RJ] I never heard anything about it at all.</span> <span id="s919">Nobody asked me.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">[DL] Did you stay in the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s921">[RJ] No.</span> <span id="s922">When I came home, of course, as I told you, I had a reserve occupation and my father was a blacksmith in the same firm as me and the personnel manager said “I hear Ron is home, I expect he’d like to come out, wouldn’t he?”</span> <span id="s923">My father said, “I should think so.”</span> <span id="s924">So while I was home, they gave me ten weeks leave.</span> <span id="s925">While I was home on that ten weeks, Birchall, the personnel manager came to see me and said, “Are you ready to come out?”</span> <span id="s926">And I said, “Of course I would.”</span> <span id="s927">He took all my particulars and while I was home</span></p> <p><span id="s928">[01:30:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s929">[RJ] I had to go to the pensions place in Cardiff and I think, if I wanted, that I would have got a pension but I didn’t want a pension because you had to lose time at work if you’d keep your pension.</span> <span id="s930">I heard rumours about this but they regarded me from B1 to B4 and then they said when you go back, I had a War Office letter, when you go back you’ll go back to the engineers at Pangbourne, near Reading.</span> <span id="s931">So, I was there for about three to four weeks and I came home for a weekend’s leave we were allowed to go back on the midnight train and we were allowed to go onto the parade ground the following morning.</span> <span id="s932">So, I got there and went onto the parade ground and the Sergeant Major said to me: “Corporal Jones, what are you doing here?”</span> <span id="s933">I said I had just come off from weekend leave, I thought I was in trouble.</span> <span id="s934">“There’s a letter in the office for you.”</span> <span id="s935">I went in there and there were my release papers.</span> <span id="s936">My personnel manager had got me out so I was only in the army for ten weeks and four days.</span> <span id="s937">I got out.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">[DL] What did you go on to do and how long did you stay in that job for?</span></p> <p><span id="s939">[RJ] I came home then and my father took me down to see Mr Birchall and he said, “you can start work whenever you like, Ron.</span> <span id="s940">I’ll give you a light job to start with.”</span> <span id="s941">So I did a light job for approximately a month and then went back to my old job so I didn’t have any trouble, like a lot of these people who write books who have problems, I didn’t have any problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">[DL] But did you have any nightmares?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">[RJ] I had nightmares for years.</span> <span id="s944">Ages.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">[DL] And what did those nightmares consist of?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">[RJ] Things like I was running away, I was climbing a fence.</span> <span id="s947">I was slipping back or climbing a path and then, all of a sudden, someone would put a hand on my shoulder and I would start to scream.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">[DL] Did you have nightmares about the Jews and the gas chambers?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">[RJ] No, no.</span> <span id="s950">Not the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">[DL] Looking back now, what key memory determines your time at E715 Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s952">[RJ] I’ve forgotten it, really.</span> <span id="s953">Until people started to talk to me about it about it I just don’t bother about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">[DL] Why do you think you have forgotten about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s955">[RJ] Well, I suppose it was just a war time experience that was best forgotten.</span> <span id="s956">Loads of people have wartime experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">[DL] How did it your experience at E715 affect you during the course of your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s958">It has definitely, I am not the man that I was.</span> <span id="s959">As a matter of fact, before the war I was a shy, quiet, timid man and, of course, I met Gladys when I was 15 and I had a lovely life, no problems, but since then I used to lose my temper quick.</span> <span id="s960">I’d argue now and I wouldn’t accept things that I would of before the war.</span> <span id="s961">I’m a different man now, definitely different.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">[DL] Would you say that that was because of your experience at Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s963">[RJ] At Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">[DL] So what caused that change at Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">[RJ] Being pushed around, being told what to do.</span> <span id="s966">I’ve never been in my life been told what to do before.</span> <span id="s967">I had my own job my own life, I’ve been my own boss and nobody’s told me what to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">[DL] And, did witnessing abuse at Auschwitz, or being aware of abuse, as I appreciate your workplace was away from the main factory, but hearing of the abuses there, the knowledge of the gas chambers, did that also change you?</span></p> <p><span id="s969">[RJ] It must have.</span> <span id="s970">It must have.</span> <span id="s971">I must have taken notice of it, more than what you realize.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">[DL] You mentioned about the memory of how the Jews walked.</span> <span id="s973">Why is that an important memory for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s974">[RJ] They were dying on their feet from lack of food.</span> <span id="s975">They’d walk about like people dying.</span> <span id="s976">Shambles.</span> <span id="s977">Shambles.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">[01:35:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s979">[DL] Is there anything else you want to add, is there anything else that you feel we haven’t touched upon.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">[RJ] No.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">NOTE: 01:35:10 – 01:43:10: Separate shots of photographs from E715 Auschwitz together with other items from his time as a POW.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">ENDS The
