Let's start with your telling me how everyday life changed as of 1938 in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">As of 1938, well life had changed before 1938, but we didn't really acknowledge it--we didn't want to know, we looked the other way.</span> <span id="s13">We always said that it will pass, but it didn't, and life really, really changed.</span> <span id="s14">We were no longer allowed, uh, to go to parks to go to movies, have businesses, and to uh, go to school, uh, no kind of education, um, we uh, uh could not buy uh, uh food or, or anything in stores, we had to wait till the last one was served before if ever we did get it that we could ask for something.</span> <span id="s15">And, uh, the big change really came uh, uh what you call Kristallnacht, the 8th to the 9th of November, 1938.</span> <span id="s16">That was when the storm troopers uh stormed your house, destroyed your furniture, uh threw everything out the window, crushed your dishes, whatever you had, beat everybody up, arrested everybody uh, that they lay their hands on.</span> <span id="s17">Take them to Buchenwald--concentration camp, and uh, drive people through the streets, beat them, rape them, burn their synagogues uh, uh down, and uh it was truly horrible at 4 o clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s18">It was a horrible uh situation.</span> <span id="s19">Uh, uh Jewish people were running uh, uh from one house to another, didn't know where to go what to do, whom to ask for help, there was no help, there was no place to go, and there was no place to run.</span> <span id="s20">My brother, Paul, that time, he was taken to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s21">Uh, my brother, Bernie, the oldest one, he was hiding in a neighbor’s house, uh, uh, my 3 little sisters were hiding under the beds, and I was hiding under the kitchen table, uh, and uh, uh, uh, we were so scared half to death.</span> <span id="s22">We didn't know what was happening.</span> <span id="s23">We didn't understand it.</span> <span id="s24">As it passed, my uh, I saw my, my mother and uh, uh my father, they would go, they would be scared every day.</span> <span id="s25">They would be afraid to go outside, wouldn't let us go outside to play or whatever.</span> <span id="s26">And, my father no don't go work at that time--he was taken to Sachsenhausen, was picked up, taken to Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s27">And uh, my other cousin was taken to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s28">It was just my 3 sisters and myself.</span> <span id="s29">Somehow they didn't take me, but uh, that was the -----, because uh, in about February, of 1939, my mother told me to go out and buy a loaf of bread and come right back.</span> <span id="s30">I went out, I bought a loaf of bread, and a kapo was out, uh, "You a Jew?</span> <span id="s31">Jew boy!</span> <span id="s32">Get in the car!"</span> <span id="s33">I didn't know any better, I was 16 years old, I went into the car, and they threw me in jail, in my hometown of Leipzig.</span> <span id="s34">Uh, about in April, must have been about 6 to 8 weeks I was in prison, no eh, uh, uh explanation was given, none was asked.</span> <span id="s35">This was the way it was.</span> <span id="s36">Suddenly I heard them call my name, and I, I remember the cell, cell #10, and I was taken downstairs, and I was told to sign a paper, that I will leave Germany within 24 hours.</span> <span id="s37">I was told to sign, I signed.</span> <span id="s38">I went home.</span> <span id="s39">And that is when I really understood the whole situation.</span> <span id="s40">It really hit me then.</span> <span id="s41">I went home and my mother stood at the door of our house, and she said to me, "Here is 10 marks and here is a change of clothes.</span> <span id="s42">Go to the railroad station, and take a train, and go to Italy, Milan."</span> <span id="s43">And she had my little sister, the little, the littlest one, in her arm.</span> <span id="s44">I said, "Where are the other two?"</span> <span id="s45">She says, "I sent them away with some people, to Poland.</span> <span id="s46">Maybe they'll be safe there for a while.</span> <span id="s47">And as soon as you leave, I will take Tony with me, and we will also go."</span> <span id="s48">I said, "What am I going to do in Italy?"</span> <span id="s49">She says, "Go.</span> <span id="s50">Here's 10 marks and go.</span> <span id="s51">You’ll find something to do there, just get out of Germany.</span> <span id="s52">You have to leave!"</span> <span id="s53">Well, we said goodbye, and that was the end of that.</span> <span id="s54">I went to the railroad station, and I took a train to Milan, and that's where I went.</span> <span id="s55">She said to me, the last words, I remember her last words, my mother's last words, she said to me, "Look forward, don't ever look back...Run boy run, don't ever look back and may God be with you."</span> <span id="s56">And that was the time when I really understood the significance of the situation.</span> <span id="s57">I never seen my sisters my brothers my mother, my father, never see anybody anymore.</span> <span id="s58">You mean, I'm all alone now?</span> <span id="s59">Going someplace, I don't know where?</span> <span id="s60">Being somewhere I don't want to be?</span> <span id="s61">Oh it was, got into Italy, to Milan, and I found I wasn't alone.</span> <span id="s62">They got hundreds and hundreds--you see, Italy was the only country where you could go to because Mussolini was Hitler's friend, that opened borders.</span> <span id="s63">I might add that there were no open borders anyplace else.</span> <span id="s64">Which gave me to understand that nobody wanted me.</span> <span id="s65">That I couldn't go anyplace else.</span> <span id="s66">That I was, I had the feeling of being trapped.</span> <span id="s67">But at least I was out of Germany.</span> <span id="s68">That was...a step in the right direction.</span> <span id="s69">I did what the others did, I slept on park benches, I slept in doorways, I slept underneath bridges, and we stole the food that we needed, we didn't know where we're going, or, or what we're going to do, or where, or where the next piece of bread was going to come from.</span> <span id="s70">So the Jews in Milan saw the plight of all these--these are people that are mothers with children--little babies, little children.</span> <span id="s71">And fathers and sick people, and old people.</span> <span id="s72">They had to give these people something to eat, they opened up soup kitchens, so one, one time a day we had a meal, so they saw to it that we had a meal.</span> <span id="s73">So, uh, the Nazis of course found out about that, that the Jews were treated humanely, in Milan and some other cities, and they said, uh, this cannot be, that cannot, we cannot allow this to happen.</span> <span id="s74">So then the Italian authorities came out and said, uh, "You claim you are tourists."</span> <span id="s75">That was the only way we could get in, was to say we are tourists.</span> <span id="s76">"You can't be a tourist.</span> <span id="s77">If you're a tourist, you gotta have money.</span> <span id="s78">And if you have money, you have no food, then you're not tourist, and we have to send you back...where you came from.</span> <span id="s79">And we have to close the soup kitchens up.</span> <span id="s80">And that was that, they closed up the soup kitchens, and we were right back where we started from.</span> <span id="s81">Suddenly they worked it out, after all, about 2 or 3 weeks, they worked it out that the French embassy is giving out visas.</span> <span id="s82">They're good for one day.</span> <span id="s83">All the men have to join the French army because war was imminent.</span> <span id="s84">You join the French army, and all the woman and girls have to join the French Red Cross.</span> <span id="s85">Uh, we figured that's the way out.</span> <span id="s86">To get out of Italy now.</span> <span id="s87">So we did.</span> <span id="s88">We all piled into the French Embassy, we all go that one, they called it a one day fly, was called a one day fly because everybody, had just asked to this embassy that we are flying, we are flying there, and we all got the stamp, all got the piece of paper.</span> <span id="s89">And now was the uh, uh, thing to get into France.</span> <span id="s90">Here we are, we are in Milan, we have to take a train to get into France.</span> <span id="s91">There was only one last train going because since war was imminent, there was only one last train going to Saint Vemo.</span> <span id="s92">Saint Vemo -------------------, this is the French Border, the next one is Montor Nice.</span> <span id="s93">It's right on the French/Italian------.</span> <span id="s94">So we had to get on that train.</span> <span id="s95">There were hundreds of us.</span> <span id="s96">It was pathetic.</span> <span id="s97">It was a pathetic view.</span> <span id="s98">Woman, children, people were fainting, people were, were getting sick.</span> <span id="s99">They were lying all over, uh, people got had strokes, it was just terrible.</span> <span id="s100">The excitement and the and the running and squeezing into these trains, these trains, and, and the pushing and the shoving and, and the fighting to get a space on that train.</span> <span id="s101">It was the last one out.</span> <span id="s102">I managed to get on.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">We have to stop.</span> <span id="s104">We have to reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Let's back up to getting a one-day visa and leaving on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">All right.</span> <span id="s109">Yeah?</span> <span id="s110">Uh, you have to understand that here is a train.</span> <span id="s111">We are talking about a train, that is maybe made for 200 people, maybe.</span> <span id="s112">Here must have been 8, 900 people.</span> <span id="s113">Now I don't have to tell you what that train looked like.</span> <span id="s114">They're hanging out windows, on top of the roof, on the sides, on the exits, the entrances, the doorways, the doorknobs, they were, they were hanging by their fingernails.</span> <span id="s115">And here we're talking about little children.</span> <span id="s116">The father and the mother maybe took the children, or three.</span> <span id="s117">It wa, it was a sad sight, but yet, we got on it.</span> <span id="s118">The train started moving.</span> <span id="s119">the train conductor couldn't go very fast.</span> <span id="s120">He was going slow because he was afraid that the condition of the train, and the people, they were falling off, they can get killed.</span> <span id="s121">Was dangerous.</span> <span id="s122">When we got to Saint Vemo, train, we got there too late.</span> <span id="s123">We went up to the French border.</span> <span id="s124">They had closed, already closed the border.</span> <span id="s125">Now the French, you have to understand this, the French wouldn't let us in, the Italians wouldn't let us back.</span> <span id="s126">On one side we had the mountains, which most of the people never saw a mountain in their life, like me.</span> <span id="s127">And on the other side, to the front, you had the ocean, with those big breakers, and in order to get into France, only two ways to do it in this kind of situation.</span> <span id="s128">You had to either go climb the mountain, which had was snow covered mountain, which we could never make, or you had to go, to go around the bend of the mountain into the beaches of France.</span> <span id="s129">We were now on the beach of St. Vemo, ------, but we had to go to the beach of France.</span> <span id="s130">There was a big mountain there.</span> <span id="s131">We had to go around that mountain, swim or boat whatever, and go around to the beaches of France.</span> <span id="s132">Now, this is now what they call the St. Vemo incident.</span> <span id="s133">In this situation I'm now to talk about, became later known as the uh, uh, uh, as the St. Vemo incident.</span> <span id="s134">Now, here's the incident.</span> <span id="s135">There were, there were, St. Vemo at that time was a small fishing village.</span> <span id="s136">Old fishermen with old boats, rotten old boats, people, impoverished people, never saw a dollar in their life.</span> <span id="s137">These people saw a chance now, to make money.</span> <span id="s138">They knew that we couldn't get back into Italy, they had their guns pointed at us.</span> <span id="s139">The French had their guns pointed at us the other way, the mountains we couldn't make, the ocean was the only answer.</span> <span id="s140">And we couldn't stay because we would starve to death.</span> <span id="s141">We, we laid on a piece of land called the no man's land.</span> <span id="s142">It didn't belong to Italy, didn't belong to France, it was just a little tiny stretch of land that belonged to no one.</span> <span id="s143">Little tiny stretch of beach.</span> <span id="s144">We laid there for 4 days.</span> <span id="s145">In those four days, the fishermen saw the plight of the people.</span> <span id="s146">And they said, "I tell you what, If you give us all you have, we take you around with our boats.</span> <span id="s147">Around the bend onto the beaches of France.</span> <span id="s148">And from there you have to make your own way.</span> <span id="s149">Now a lot of people didn't have much of a choice.</span> <span id="s150">We couldn't stay, we couldn't go the other way, What choice did we have?</span> <span id="s151">There were children with us.</span> <span id="s152">I'm hungry!</span> <span id="s153">I'm thirsty!</span> <span id="s154">I need this, I need that!</span> <span id="s155">People needed medication.</span> <span id="s156">So, they said, "Let's take a chance.</span> <span id="s157">At least we have friends.</span> <span id="s158">At least, maybe they will give us some help.</span> <span id="s159">Give us something to eat."</span> <span id="s160">You have to understand also there were two gunboats there--one Italian gunboat on one side, and a French gun boat on the other side--looking at each other.</span> <span id="s161">And there were people there, it's not like it was isolated.</span> <span id="s162">The fishermen said give us all you have, your money your jewelry whatever, and we'll take you on to the beaches of France.</span> <span id="s163">And it was fine, the people gave whatever little they have, an earring, a ring, a wedding band, whatever little they had.</span> <span id="s164">They put them on the boat, there were about 8, 10 boats, they go out, they overloaded the boats, they had to go out about a half a mile or so to get around that bend.</span> <span id="s165">The boats cracked in two.</span> <span id="s166">People fell into the ocean, the breakers are very high there, and all you could hear was screams, "Help me!</span> <span id="s167">I'm drowning!</span> <span id="s168">Help me!</span> <span id="s169">Help my wife!</span> <span id="s170">Help my Children!</span> <span id="s171">Save my children!</span> <span id="s172">Save us!"</span> <span id="s173">And there were, it was a bad situation, they lifted their hands, I, I saw from shore, they were lifting their hands up to the gunboats, like this, to the gunboats, "Please save us!</span> <span id="s174">Save my children!"</span> <span id="s175">Who do you save when you wife drowns and your son drowns and your daughter drowns?</span> <span id="s176">Who do you save?</span> <span id="s177">They say, "Papa help me."</span> <span id="s178">And you can't swim.</span> <span id="s179">Who do you help?</span> <span id="s180">...The, uh, navy people on those ships, they looked down, they saw everything, there were dozens and dozens of people trying to paddle their way through the waves, going down never coming up, children.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Let's stop and wait ......</span></p> <p><span id="s182">30 seconds of room tone with the heat on.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">End room tone.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">I want to redo that story.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Where do you want me to start from?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">I want you to start from being on no man's land...</span></p> <p><span id="s187">and the fish, and hiring the fishermen to take you around the bend.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Well, there, there were people, I had nothing to give to these fishermen, so I was out.</span> <span id="s189">But, there were people that had their wedding band, earrings, uh little things, a few lire, a few marks, a few whatever they had, they gave it to them.</span> <span id="s190">They took them out their rotten boats there, overloaded, they were greedy, now, not just taking, they were greedy!</span> <span id="s191">They want too many people on that boat!</span> <span id="s192">As much as they could get on it.</span> <span id="s193">And, went out to the ocean, boats cracked, I saw it from shore, and the people fell into the water into the ocean.</span> <span id="s194">Was a heartbreaking sight...because you had families that were drowning, you had brothers and sisters, you had parents, you had wives and husbands, young and old, and they were all screaming for someone to save them.</span> <span id="s195">The breakers were hard, the waves were very high, the ocean was very hard, very tough.</span> <span id="s196">And, uh, these two gunboats there, the Italian and the French, their navy personnel were looking out, they were looking down, and I saw they had grins, they were grinning.</span> <span id="s197">And they were pointing fingers at the drowning people.</span> <span id="s198">I saw that.</span> <span id="s199">The screams from these people, from the children and from the husbands and the wives, the people there, to this day, I have those screams in my ears, "Papa save me!"</span> <span id="s200">The wife would yell, "Save our daughter, save our son!"</span> <span id="s201">And then they would disappear beneath the waves--wouldn't come up anymore.</span> <span id="s202">It was all over.</span> <span id="s203">The fishermen, of course, they know how to swim uh these uh, uh waves, and they been swimming since they're maybe 2 or 3 years old--they made it back to shore.</span> <span id="s204">Walked away.</span> <span id="s205">The next day, the bodies came washing ashore.</span> <span id="s206">Children, small, bigger ones, man, woman, nobody cared.</span> <span id="s207">So we pulled them out of the water, we put them down on the------.</span> <span id="s208">We didn't know what to do with them.</span> <span id="s209">And that is when I really realized, I know there's going to be a problem here.</span> <span id="s210">There's gonna be, we're going to have problems.</span> <span id="s211">We're going to have big problems.</span> <span id="s212">Was a little boy that hung on to me, must have been about 12 yrs old, 11 or 12, Heinz was his name, I remember his name.</span> <span id="s213">He lost his family running for Europe, somehow he got lost.</span> <span id="s214">He hung on to me.</span> <span id="s215">So I took him aside, I said, "Look, we're here 4 days, going 5 days, there's no food, there's no water.</span> <span id="s216">We're going to die here.</span> <span id="s217">Unless we're going to do something very drastic, we're going to die.</span> <span id="s218">There's nobody coming to help."</span> <span id="s219">The only people that came to help us, monks, and few nuns, that would bring some, little bit, something for the children, but not for the adults, you know, they couldn't do a great deal, because there were too many people.</span> <span id="s220">How much could 3 or 4 nuns do?</span> <span id="s221">Or 3 or 4 monks or brothers, whatever you call them.</span> <span id="s222">So I took him aside, I said, "I'll tell you what.</span> <span id="s223">If you want to chance it, we can't go back to Italy, we look at guns, we can't go into France, we look at guns, we can't go over mountains, we, we'll die, we'll freeze to death up there, we'll never make it.</span> <span id="s224">We can't swim because we'll drown, and nobody is helping us.</span> <span id="s225">Italy knew about it.</span> <span id="s226">France, France, French authorities knew about it, that we were there, that we are coming, and the Italian authorities know that we just left the train.</span> <span id="s227">So everybody knew about it.</span> <span id="s228">But, we're going to die right here.</span> <span id="s229">Nobody's going to lend us a hand.</span> <span id="s230">So, I tell you what we're going to do.</span> <span id="s231">We're going right up to that barbed wire there on the French border, they had some barbed wire there, and walk right up to it, and crawl through it.</span> <span id="s232">We'll do the impossible thing, we'll do the stupid thing, that nobody expects us to do, walk right into it.</span> <span id="s233">Just walk.</span> <span id="s234">He says, "Well, you know better.</span> <span id="s235">I was the leader now.</span> <span id="s236">All of 17, 16, I was the leader.</span> <span id="s237">Nightfall came, so, I said, "Tell you what, we go in the early, early morning hour.</span> <span id="s238">Sure enough, dawn, we went to the barbed wire, I said, "Let's crawl through it."</span> <span id="s239">Okay, we have to reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">4 second sticks -------------establish that you were with Heinz and...</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Yeah, uh, I decided to do the thing that people would not think of doing--was go back to the barbed wire.</span> <span id="s244">I told Heinz that, I said, "Do you realize we're going to get shot, we can get killed, uh, we'll never make it, but that's the only chance we have.</span> <span id="s245">Well, maybe in 100, maybe the...God will look over here, maybe there is no God, maybe we'll make it, maybe do it.</span> <span id="s246">He says, "Fine."</span> <span id="s247">So we did it.</span> <span id="s248">Crawling half way through the barbed wire, I heard a noise, I looked up and I saw, I looked into the barrel of shot of a gun, and this border guard is looking down at me.</span> <span id="s249">Well, Heinz being a young boy started to cry.</span> <span id="s250">And I looked at him, I said, "This is the end of the line.</span> <span id="s251">At least we tried."</span> <span id="s252">I said, "Look," and he spoke, he spoke in broken German--he must have been from Alsace Lorraine--or something, he must have spoke some German, he says, "So, what you think you're doing there?"</span> <span id="s253">I said, "I'm trying to get into your country."</span> <span id="s254">Uh, I tell you what, "If you have to shoot, let him go, he's only 12 years old.</span> <span id="s255">He's only a kid."</span> <span id="s256">So he says, "Get through."</span> <span id="s257">And there was a voice from another guard, and he says, "C'est ne rien---."</span> <span id="s258">That means, "There is nothing here, no, no, no nothing, no noise."</span> <span id="s259">I remember those words, although I could not speak French, but I remember those words because they saved my life.</span> <span id="s260">And some things just stick into your head.</span> <span id="s261">He said, "Is your train over there?</span> <span id="s262">There was one train standing in Monton, on the, on the border."</span> <span id="s263">He said, "Yeah, get in it.</span> <span id="s264">It's going to take you into France, into Nice."</span> <span id="s265">So we run for it.</span> <span id="s266">Totally empty train.</span> <span id="s267">This must have been the train they had ready for us when we arrived to take us into France, but I didn't realize it at that time.</span> <span id="s268">When they did, suddenly the train started moving, we ended up in Nice.</span> <span id="s269">Now you have to understand something, here we have no papers, no money, we have no knowledge of French, we have no place to go, we were hungry, we were dirty, we were bloody, cold and tired.</span> <span id="s270">So we ran into a doorway, we said, you know, "Let's go to sleep."</span> <span id="s271">And we slept, and we were arrested, of course, the concierge came out and uh, saw us sleeping in the door, we arrested and uh, and I never knew anything about the French or about France, but I now felt a brunt of, of the French cruelty and, and, and barbaric behavior.</span> <span id="s272">Believe me, the cruelty of the French police, and the garde-----------, and authorities, was next to nobody.</span> <span id="s273">I mean, they were brutal.</span> <span id="s274">The brutality and cruelty of these people.</span> <span id="s275">And, and, and the, and the meanness of these people was next to nobody.</span> <span id="s276">We thought we had escaped the cruelty of the Nazis.</span> <span id="s277">Ha, ha, ha, we got into the cruelty of the French.</span> <span id="s278">They grabbed us, they put chains on us, and they throw us in prison.</span> <span id="s279">No food, no water, no nothing.</span> <span id="s280">Well, we later found out that everybody who crosses the border illegally and has no papers has to spend one month in Prison before they even talk to you.</span> <span id="s281">Now spending, in, in the French jails, you have to understand you have company.</span> <span id="s282">You know you have rats the size of cats.</span> <span id="s283">You have bugs and roaches on the walls.</span> <span id="s284">Ants.</span> <span id="s285">The filth is un, is indescribable, that is in the French prisons.</span> <span id="s286">Well, we, we found that out very soon.</span> <span id="s287">They took him out, and I never, I never saw Heinz again.</span> <span id="s288">Now I was alone.</span> <span id="s289">Now, once a day, they would throw a piece of hard bread in there which was full of ants--I felt it crawling when I touched the bread.</span> <span id="s290">Of course, the rats came, so we, I had to break off a piece of the break off a piece of the bread, throw it in the corner of the cell so the rats would fight over it and let me eat the other piece.</span> <span id="s291">Before I ate, I had to knock it out, I had to knock the ants out, the hard, the bread was hard as nails.</span> <span id="s292">But if you have nothing else, you chew on it.</span> <span id="s293">After a month, they took me out, I was never allowed to leave the cell.</span> <span id="s294">No walking, no exercise, no nothing.</span> <span id="s295">They took me out and no explanation was given.</span> <span id="s296">They put chains on my legs, and chains on my hand, on my arms, and they had a car, an open car waiting for me with 8 guard mobile.</span> <span id="s297">The guard mobile, the gendarmes, are the worst kind of police, the, the most brutal, the most uh, uh, the meanest people that they had, they put into the guard mobile.</span> <span id="s298">They threw me in there, chains on my arms and legs, and took me to a camp call Antibe.</span> <span id="s299">That was what they called an internment camp, but don't believe it, that was a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s300">There were hundreds of people there.</span> <span id="s301">They took the chains off, and they took me out, and they threw me into the camp, I fell right flat on my face into the camp, I'll never forget it.</span> <span id="s302">And that was that, I was in that camp.</span> <span id="s303">Nothing to do there.</span> <span id="s304">Just stay there.</span> <span id="s305">Barbed wire.</span> <span id="s306">Not much food, not much water.</span> <span id="s307">It ------- it was used to be an old stadium, a football stadium, so we slept on the cement.</span> <span id="s308">There were all kinds of people there.</span> <span id="s309">One didn't know the other.</span> <span id="s310">All kind of people that they picked up here and there.</span> <span id="s311">After 2 months, we were put on trucks, we were taken to Le Mille ---- Provence.</span> <span id="s312">Pres to Marseilles, next to Marseilles, to a brick factory.</span> <span id="s313">They put us to the catacombs, and lock the door, the iron door.</span> <span id="s314">The catacombs used to be little hallways, little tun, tunnels, how they say, tunnels, where they used to dry the bricks with heat.</span> <span id="s315">There was straw on the floor, no light, and no sound and no nothing like you're buried alive.</span> <span id="s316">We had a few candles flickered in the dark and that was it.</span> <span id="s317">After some months, they took us out, and they made a transport into a place called Manosk.</span> <span id="s318">That used to be an old movie house.</span> <span id="s319">They put barbed wire around it.</span> <span id="s320">Put us there.</span> <span id="s321">I wasn't supposed to be there, but I met a boy, a guy named Willie, and uh, he came from my hometown, and so we got friendly in Antibe, and we stuck together.</span> <span id="s322">He used to keep an eye out for me because uh he was 10 years older.</span> <span id="s323">And we had uh, uh a lot of homosexuality in the camp, and I was all of 17 and a half, and I fell prey to a, they tried a lot of things and he sort of, uh chased them, and I didn't understand what it was all about, I never knew about homosexuality, I never heard this word, I never knew what it was.</span> <span id="s324">But he was the smart one, and he never would really answer my questions, just said, "Just stay away from this one, stay away from that one," that's what I did, and I went with really this transport.</span> <span id="s325">That night, he came to Manosk, they called out the list of prisoners, and I wasn't on the list.</span> <span id="s326">They found out that I wasn't supposed to have been on the transport, so he says, "You got to get back--you can't--.</span> <span id="s327">I said, "I want to stay with my friend," they say, "You can't.</span> <span id="s328">We have to take you back on the truck."</span> <span id="s329">So they put me through that truck, I remember it was cold.</span> <span id="s330">It was so cold.</span> <span id="s331">And uh, I went back, I said goodbye to Willie.</span> <span id="s332">And I went back on the truck.</span> <span id="s333">And there was about a 3-4 hour drive to go back to where we came from.</span> <span id="s334">And it was an open truck.</span> <span id="s335">The back was open, but there was no guard in the back, they just throw us in the back because the guy that was supposed to guard us, he was too cold, he stuck with the driver up front.</span> <span id="s336">We drove through the night, and the truck wasn't going very fast, and, when they're on a bend, they slowed down quite a bit.</span> <span id="s337">And I saw a, a, like a ravine down, going down like.</span> <span id="s338">So I said, there ever is a time to get the hell out of here, this is it.</span> <span id="s339">I had no idea where I was, I had no idea where I was going, I had no idea in the dark of the night where that truck was.</span> <span id="s340">I got out.</span> <span id="s341">And I jumped.</span> <span id="s342">Was pitch dark, the------------------.</span> <span id="s343">And I fell down that, that ravine, and I laid there still.</span> <span id="s344">I was afraid, I was scared.</span> <span id="s345">My heart was pounding and I was so scared.</span> <span id="s346">Nothing.</span> <span id="s347">Still.</span> <span id="s348">Quiet.</span> <span id="s349">And I thought I heard the backlights of the truck disappear on the horizon.</span> <span id="s350">I said, uh, they'll never know.</span> <span id="s351">And I start walking.</span> <span id="s352">I got up, I was hurting, but I start walking.</span> <span id="s353">And I stayed there a few days and a few nights in the woods there.</span> <span id="s354">I was afraid to talk to anyone--if a farmer would pass, I was afraid to talk to him.</span> <span id="s355">---------------------that October I couldn't speak French.</span> <span id="s356">What am I going to tell them I'm German, they, they, they take a pitchfork and kill me because they hated the Bosch, they hated the, the Germans.</span> <span id="s357">They'd think I'm from the 5th Column or something.</span> <span id="s358">So, I hid up on a group of people, I heard voices, and I sneaked up.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Wait, we've got to reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Why don't you just back up I'm sorry that was take 4, ---------- I saw the opportunity to jump off the truck.</span> <span id="s364">The truck had slowed down, and here was my chance to get away.</span> <span id="s365">I didn't know whether it was smart of dumb, but I did it.</span> <span id="s366">And I jumped.</span> <span id="s367">Of course I fell down the ravine there, and, and uh, I saw the truck disappear, there, the backlights uh over the horizon, I knew I was safe now, at least from them, they wouldn't notice whether I was missing.</span> <span id="s368">Not now.</span> <span id="s369">By the time they will know this, I'll be gone.</span> <span id="s370">After a few days in the woods, and a few nights, I, I hid up on a group of people, on the run just like me.</span> <span id="s371">Young ones, old ones.</span> <span id="s372">Children from 12 years, 10 years on up to old men.</span> <span id="s373">They asked me if I was hungry.</span> <span id="s374">By that time, I could have eaten a cow, I was so hungry.</span> <span id="s375">They gave me food.</span> <span id="s376">And we stayed in the woods for a little while longer, a few more days, and then we got a, uh, message to join a group of assistant fighters, more south, in a place called Langlad.</span> <span id="s377">Langlad is next to Nime, that is in the South of France about 40 miles from Nice.</span> <span id="s378">We made our, our way, they were walking at night, and hiding during the day, eating whatever we could find, or we stole bread in the little villages that we passed through, in front of the baker, uh bakeries, and we stole fruit, and we went into backyards and stole figs, and, and, and grapes in the fields--whatever we could lay our hands on it.</span> <span id="s379">We made it to Nime.</span> <span id="s380">To Langlad.</span> <span id="s381">Now you have to understand, Langlad is a small village which was uh, at that time, evacuated, totally deserted.</span> <span id="s382">So we had our camp there.</span> <span id="s383">After a week or two, seems that somebody gave us away.</span> <span id="s384">The guard mobile got wind of it.</span> <span id="s385">They surrounded the camp and asked us to give up.</span> <span id="s386">And, and, so and, we knew what it meant.</span> <span id="s387">To surrender, then we're going to be shot, or we're going to be handed over to the Gestapo, or they're going to throw us in their filthy jails--we knew what that was, this was not good news.</span> <span id="s388">This was bad news.</span> <span id="s389">So they got together, and they said, "Look, we were quite a few of us, 18, 20 uh boys that were under 21.</span> <span id="s390">14 year olds, 15 year olds, 16, 20, 18--so you kids, get out, we're going to engage them with a little bit of shooting, and uh, you, while when we do it, we'll cover you.</span> <span id="s391">You run over the field and make your way to Nice.</span> <span id="s392">So we said, what's going to happen to you, they said, "Look we're in our 40s, 50s, 60s, maybe we'll get away too, maybe not, maybe it's the end of the line for us, but you're too young to die here.</span> <span id="s393">We did.</span> <span id="s394">We heard shooting from far on.</span> <span id="s395">They covered us, we made our way to Nice.</span> <span id="s396">Everyone for himself.</span> <span id="s397">There was no time to, to help anybody else, or to do it, or to go back and carry anybody.</span> <span id="s398">We were so hungry and, and thin and skinny and tired, that we, there was just no way that we could have helped anybody.</span> <span id="s399">I mean, we had enough of a job to help ourselves.</span> <span id="s400">So we got into Nice.</span> <span id="s401">Now, you have to understand something that the French did at that time.</span> <span id="s402">The French would go and they would come with a few trucks, and they corded off a part of the town, and go into that part of town, nobody could get out, like, like a trap, like, like a rat in a trap.</span> <span id="s403">They go in now by uh maybe two, three dozen automobile, and ask everybody for papers.</span> <span id="s404">Now if you had no money you were a vagrant.</span> <span id="s405">You go to jail.</span> <span id="s406">If you had no papers, you were a spy.</span> <span id="s407">If you couldn't prove that you lived there, in that area, you were also a spy.</span> <span id="s408">No matter which way you would turn, you lose.</span> <span id="s409">No matter which way, you lose.</span> <span id="s410">Naturally, we didn't know all these things that they had in store for us.</span> <span id="s411">We had no place to go, we had no place to hide, we had no money, we couldn't speak French, and we had no passport.</span> <span id="s412">Of course, we got caught.</span> <span id="s413">And, back to jail we went.</span> <span id="s414">Now they put me, luckily, into the -------------, that was an, a barracks, called the Barracks, ------------, an army barrack.</span> <span id="s415">And they had a jail in front, right where the street is, they had a jail where they would put the soldiers that go AWOL, or the, that had been in -------------- with the rules they would put ‘em there for a day or two or a week.</span> <span id="s416">And there were 5 cells there, and they threw me in one of the cells.</span> <span id="s417">And here I was.</span> <span id="s418">I didn't know what's happened to me.</span> <span id="s419">After about a week, the guard came to me and he says, "You know, all your people, in the other cells too, you're all going to be handed over in 2 days to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s420">And you know what they're going to do with you."</span> <span id="s421">Seemed that he enjoyed that.</span> <span id="s422">And I look around.</span> <span id="s423">I was lucky.</span> <span id="s424">You see, where they had little trap door on the cell, I noticed it.</span> <span id="s425">I learned by now to notice things.</span> <span id="s426">To see things to look around, wherever I go I look around.</span> <span id="s427">I start to notice.</span> <span id="s428">They had a little trap door where they put that little pail in there, where you urinated, in and out.</span> <span id="s429">And that little pail, that little door, trap door was only hold together with a wire.</span> <span id="s430">The cell door had a bolt.</span> <span id="s431">this only had that little wire.</span> <span id="s432">I said, "Well, in the morning I'm going to get out."</span> <span id="s433">Sure enough, I worked all night, taking the wire back and forth, back and forth till it broke.</span> <span id="s434">And, oh you put wire back and forth, eventually it will crack.</span> <span id="s435">In the morning I, and I counted the uh minutes when the guard used to come around and check.</span> <span id="s436">I knew I had about 8 minutes between checking.</span> <span id="s437">I went out the moment the guard left I went out, I got out, over the trap door and out.</span> <span id="s438">Opened up all the bolts, and I looked, I saw, a half a dozen people in each one of the cells supposed to hold one person.</span> <span id="s439">They were all Jews like me, on the run, that they caught.</span> <span id="s440">I said to them, "Look fellas, you have 8 minutes.</span> <span id="s441">The wall is over there, ------------, go for it."</span> <span id="s442">You know what they said to me?</span> <span id="s443">"Where are we going to go?</span> <span id="s444">We have no papers, we have no money, we have no place to stay, we have no food, we have nothing.</span> <span id="s445">We have no coats, no wear no clothes.</span> <span id="s446">Where are we going to go?</span> <span id="s447">We are hunted by everyone.</span> <span id="s448">We're like, we are less than animals."</span> <span id="s449">I said, "Look, I haven't got time for debate here.</span> <span id="s450">You want to go, go."</span> <span id="s451">Of course, I was the youngest of the bunch there.</span> <span id="s452">They were all older people.</span> <span id="s453">And I went over the wall.</span> <span id="s454">They had a little piece of glass on the wall, I remember, I cut myself.</span> <span id="s455">There was a lamppost.</span> <span id="s456">I looked down, I saw the guard with a gun going back and forth.</span> <span id="s457">When he turned around, went the other way, I jumped on to the lamppost, down I went, and I walked immediately, I didn't stand there.</span> <span id="s458">Guy comes back, he looked me, he seems says, "Oh, just 2 minutes ago there was nobody here, now I see somebody walking," but he didn't say anything.</span> <span id="s459">I smiled.</span> <span id="s460">Hi.</span> <span id="s461">And I walked, and I went into Nice.</span> <span id="s462">There 2 guys stopped me.</span> <span id="s463">I was going rather fast, I was running.</span> <span id="s464">They said, "Hey, if you're on the run, there's a place that's cool down there, there are 3 basements.</span> <span id="s465">You can get a night's sleep and a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s466">Go down there.</span> <span id="s467">I said here is a good idea.</span> <span id="s468">I went down there.</span> <span id="s469">I stayed 2 nights.</span> <span id="s470">They gave me something to eat.</span> <span id="s471">They gave me a place to sl--You see, just to get a place to sleep, to lay your head down, a piece of bread to eat was something that was so big to us because we were always so hungry, so cold, so tired.</span> <span id="s472">Just to be able to sleep without having to worry that someone puts a gun into your head or somebody puts the chains on your, on your arms and, and feet and, uh, uh, somebody beats you up with a, with a stick.</span> <span id="s473">To us, that was heaven.</span> <span id="s474">After 2 days, I left.</span> <span id="s475">Well.</span> <span id="s476">We were running here, we were running there, hiding here hiding there.</span> <span id="s477">There was no place to go.</span> <span id="s478">There was no place to go.</span> <span id="s479">By now, I was suppose, I was considered dangerous subject, because of the prison break, they had my dossier, and there I was already you know, hunted.</span> <span id="s480">Now I was really hunted.</span> <span id="s481">Now, between the Gestapo and between the Guard mobile, and between really having had no chance.</span> <span id="s482">I mean, I didn't even have a fighting chance.</span> <span id="s483">I knew it.</span> <span id="s484">I had no fighting chance.</span> <span id="s485">That was it.</span> <span id="s486">Today I slept on this doorway.</span> <span id="s487">Tomorrow I slept underneath the bridge, and the next day I, I hid in a, in a backyard someplace like a rat.</span> <span id="s488">I got caught, and by the way, this time, it was late.</span> <span id="s489">They put chains on my legs, and chains on my arms, and I was transported into a concentration camp called ----------------------, they were right next to the ocean.</span> <span id="s490">There I say about 30,000, 40,000 men, woman and children behind barbed wire.</span> <span id="s491">When the let me in in chains, and a few others.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Let's reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">We left off at the camp of 30,000.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">I see, Camp Di Agilis (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">So why don't you describe to me that camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Well, it was a rather large camp, and uh, it's called, was called an internment camp, but it was a concentration camp, that's just a fancy name for a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s501">Really, especially by the French.</span> <span id="s502">They put into that camp anyone they could scoop up that was hiding, that was running, that had no place to go, that was called a vagrant, that was uh, uh had no papers, no money whatever, and they scooped them up and that's where they throw, that was one of the camps.</span> <span id="s503">Camp di Vernay (ph) was another camp.</span> <span id="s504">Uh, that was not far from their county called Condivernay, it was, is a terrible, that that was a nasty place, Condivernay.</span> <span id="s505">Uh, Agilis wasn't much better, but was a little, little better.</span> <span id="s506">In Camp di Vernay they had no children.</span> <span id="s507">Here they put the people with children.</span> <span id="s508">It was...they didn't really know what to do with these people.</span> <span id="s509">It was, there were so many that were running away uh, uh, uh from Germany and from other places that they just had no place to put them anymore.</span> <span id="s510">They were thousands.</span> <span id="s511">So they put us in there, and they, inside the camp, they had one tent that they put barbed wire around, that's where they put the most dangerous people.</span> <span id="s512">In other words, people that they would shoot the next day.</span> <span id="s513">They, into that little tent.</span> <span id="s514">And that's where they put all the kids.</span> <span id="s515">They put us all, kids, no, none older than 20, 21, no they were 14 year olds, 12 year olds, 13, children.</span> <span id="s516">And as we were marched in chains into that little tent, everybody was clapping their hands, all the people in the camp.</span> <span id="s517">We stayed in there, and they told us that in a few days they will dispose of us.</span> <span id="s518">We didn't know how.</span> <span id="s519">And after about 3, 4 days, and it was dark in there, they gave us a few candles that flickered in the dark there, and we were singing uh little Jewish songs in the dark.</span> <span id="s520">He'd give us, to give us courage.</span> <span id="s521">Even though we were singing to give us something you know, so we wouldn't cry.</span> <span id="s522">And the minute the kids cried, you know, you have to understand that, and next morning they took us out, and they said, "Now you go, all going to be shot."</span> <span id="s523">We didn't really comprehend being shot, what it mean, we didn't understand really, you know, the the significance of uh being shot, you know.</span> <span id="s524">They had a few people lined up with their rifles, and the said "Les guns, aim, fire!"</span> <span id="s525">But, uh, they were firing over our heads, they weren't going to shoot us."</span> <span id="s526">And the little kids were crying, they were hysterical, they were holding on to each other, you know.</span> <span id="s527">Just get back into the tent.</span> <span id="s528">A few hours later, we are taken out, and taken down to the, it was a boat.</span> <span id="s529">And, we had to go into the boat.</span> <span id="s530">So the Guard mobile had another job to do.</span> <span id="s531">They had whips.</span> <span id="s532">And chains.</span> <span id="s533">And they stood a line on one side, a line on the other side, going on to the, well we had to go between the lines to go onto the boat, and we all chained together, you know, we were all chained one to another.</span> <span id="s534">And we had to drag ourselves, on the legs and on the arms, on the wrists, we had to go on that boat, and they were beating us as we walked through the line, they were beating us with chains and whips.</span> <span id="s535">Some fell down.</span> <span id="s536">We had to drag them with us because we are chained together.</span> <span id="s537">And finally the captain came out of the, the ship, it was a freighter.</span> <span id="s538">And he said, "This has to stop.</span> <span id="s539">They are under my jurisdiction now, and you better stop this beating.</span> <span id="s540">You don't, nobody gets beaten when under my command."</span> <span id="s541">And he was, he was a good man.</span> <span id="s542">We got onto the boat, and we realized the hopelessness and the desperation of the situation.</span> <span id="s543">We are now on a boat.</span> <span id="s544">We don't know where we're going, we're all chained together, we don't know what's going to happen to us.</span> <span id="s545">We run away from the, the Germans wanted to gas us in the gas chambers, and hang us.</span> <span id="s546">The French wanted to beat us to death.</span> <span id="s547">So we don't know what's going to be with us now.</span> <span id="s548">Who are we going to see now that wants to exterminate us?</span> <span id="s549">So people said they're going to put us out into the ocean and use us as target practice.</span> <span id="s550">The Germans with their planes, they're going to blow up the ship as target practice.</span> <span id="s551">They have done it.</span> <span id="s552">So we said, "Well, this is the end of the line now.</span> <span id="s553">There's no place we're going to go."</span> <span id="s554">But somehow I felt that this captain, the way he saved us from the beating would not do this to us, would not allow that to be done to people.</span> <span id="s555">So, I had a little flicker of hope there.</span> <span id="s556">The ship took off, we were all in the belly of the boat.</span> <span id="s557">The only opening was on top on deck, there was a big machine gun mounted, looked down, so there was no way you could ever get out of there.</span> <span id="s558">And, we passed the coast of Spain.</span> <span id="s559">We could look through the openings on the belly of the boat, there was some little openings there that we could look through, and one guy said, that's the coast of Spain.</span> <span id="s560">And, as long as we were moving, we wouldn't be target practice because you don't take a moving ship as target so we reasoned looking for a way to assure ourselves that this is not going to happen to us.</span> <span id="s561">And, uh, guy said, he's go, we are going to go to Africa, North Africa.</span> <span id="s562">That's where we went, to Algiers.</span> <span id="s563">We docked in Algiers, and they took us out and put us into the prison in Algiers.</span> <span id="s564">Later we found out that they had to wait for a big transport to come to get us, so they can make one big freight train and take us out to the camp, to wherever we were going to go.</span> <span id="s565">Sure enough, it took about, quite a long time, about 2 months, and they put us in solitary confinement.</span> <span id="s566">Now, you have to understand, a prison in Algiers in Solitary confinement, uh, is a little cell, no light, no blanket, uh, nothing, just plain cement, and that is solitary confinement.</span> <span id="s567">The only way we kept our sanity in the cell, and we didn't know how long we were going to be there.</span> <span id="s568">The only way we kept our sanity, we knocked on the wall, and the other guy knocked back.</span> <span id="s569">Just to hear the knocking and the sound of somebody else to give us, kept me, that's how we kept our sanity.</span> <span id="s570">Once a day they put some water and the food, whatever the garbage that they put in there, and we lose complete track of time.</span> <span id="s571">We didn't know what day of the week, what month, what year, what time it was, winter, summer, we lost total track of time, we just stayed in the dark trying to not to go crazy in that cell.</span> <span id="s572">Was a, was a very long time that we were in there.</span> <span id="s573">They took us out, then finally we got the rumor, there's always rumors, when you have people, always rumors going around, one, one, one always knows more than the other guy.</span> <span id="s574">And he says, "We are going to a camp in the middle of the desert."</span> <span id="s575">Nobody can escape from there.</span> <span id="s576">There is no escape.</span> <span id="s577">Now you have to understand something, that in North Africa, they had about a hundred different concentration camps, they had Colubushe, Breeda, City Belepest, they had uh, uh Joffa, had uh, Whatchamaka, Whatchamake, something like that.</span> <span id="s578">And these were all slave labor camps, these were bad, these were bad places.</span> <span id="s579">And that's where your ---------- go to die.</span> <span id="s580">They put us into a cattle, to a train, a freight train, where they transport camels.</span> <span id="s581">About 50-60 people in one, in one of these wagons there.</span> <span id="s582">We couldn't sit down, we had to stand up, people died standing up!</span> <span id="s583">Uh, no facilities to go to a bathroom or anything like this.</span> <span id="s584">And we travelled for about 3-4 days, and you had to also know that the, the heat that goes over 100 degrees, 110, 120, during the day, at night it's very, very cold.</span> <span id="s585">Because we were to at the Atlas Mountain, the foot of the Atlas Mountain in the, in the Sahara Desert.</span> <span id="s586">Once a day they would open the door, throw a bread in, and throw a couple of bottles of water in, and close the doors again.</span> <span id="s587">People died standing up.</span> <span id="s588">You couldn't fall.</span> <span id="s589">We finally got there, and the railroad station is about 2-3 miles from the camp, and we had to walk through the sand through the desert to, toward the camp.</span> <span id="s590">And these Bahis, now we have someone new to deal with.</span> <span id="s591">We had to deal with this Bahis.</span> <span id="s592">But you have to understand that this Bahis is an elite Arab troop, they're on horses.</span> <span id="s593">They're very cruel people.</span> <span id="s594">We were horse whipped all the way to the camp, walking 3 or 4, 2 or 3 miles to the camp through the sand, through the hot sand, we were beaten all the way down there, and people that fell down we had to drag them along because with the chains.</span> <span id="s595">Then we saw the camp.</span> <span id="s596">We saw tents in the middle of the desert, surrounded by barbed wire, machine guns on the end, on the corners.</span> <span id="s597">That was Jaffa.</span> <span id="s598">Jaffa was known as having been the worst concentration camp in all of North Africa.</span> <span id="s599">The cruelest and worst.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Let's wait and reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Uh, the trip, as I said, took about 3 or 4 days on the freight train, and the water that they threw in was 1 or 2 bottles of water for about 50 60 people, was quite inadequate, especially when the heat outside was 110, and who knows what the heat was inside that, that uh, uh wagon there.</span> <span id="s605">I can't say this, what people did there was.</span> <span id="s606">The first was so bad, the hunger, see hunger pang goes away after a while, but thirst makes your tongue swell up, and eventually you choke to death on your own tongue.</span> <span id="s607">The thirst was so bad.</span> <span id="s608">People would try to drink their urine.</span> <span id="s609">As we went along, all kinds of strange things happened there, and, and, and people went crazy.</span> <span id="s610">Inside that wagon there, start screaming and hollering and fighting about the room.</span> <span id="s611">We were so crammed in that you could hardly breathe during the day.</span> <span id="s612">At night it was better because was cold, was cold.</span> <span id="s613">During the day you could hardly breathe.</span> <span id="s614">And I tell you it was like a, the rite of torture, believe me.</span> <span id="s615">That's what it was, and how, people, many people died in that train, and, and, and, that not more died was a miracle.</span> <span id="s616">It's amazing what a human being can endure...without losing their lives.</span> <span id="s617">When we got out of the train, they gave us some water.</span> <span id="s618">And then we walked up to the camp.</span> <span id="s619">Now we knew the situation was now hopeless.</span> <span id="s620">There was no escape, there was no getting away, there was, this, this was the kind of situation that was really, really bad.</span> <span id="s621">We never knew really what hell was but when we got into that camp, and saw the camp and stayed there awhile, we really found out what hell was.</span> <span id="s622">If this wasn't hell, it sure came close to it.</span> <span id="s623">Believe me.</span> <span id="s624">We stood on attention for the camp commander.</span> <span id="s625">And he came, and he says, and I've never forgotten what he said to me, to us, he says, "You all came here to die.</span> <span id="s626">You are the scum of Europe.</span> <span id="s627">You are the garbage of the world.</span> <span id="s628">My job is to see to it that you all die here.</span> <span id="s629">It's just a matter of time.</span> <span id="s630">If you behave yourselves, and do as you're told, you may live a little longer.</span> <span id="s631">If not, you're going to die sooner.</span> <span id="s632">This is my job.</span> <span id="s633">And I'm good at what I'm doing."</span> <span id="s634">That was his speech.</span> <span id="s635">"Now get into the tents."</span> <span id="s636">Now you have to understand something--these, the camp consisted of tents, a row, a few rows of tents.</span> <span id="s637">The tents called Maribou.</span> <span id="s638">It had a post in the middle and on the sides was tied down with, with a piece of rope and some pieces of wood.</span> <span id="s639">And, there were 40 persons to a tent.</span> <span id="s640">40 to 50 persons to a tent made for 8.</span> <span id="s641">The day consisted of working ten hours a day, one day you didn't have to work, that was Sunday.</span> <span id="s642">Six days you worked.</span> <span id="s643">The French tried to build a transaharan through the desert.</span> <span id="s644">That means that they tried to build a railroad through the desert.</span> <span id="s645">And in order to do that, they had to remove the dunes, because there are dunes in the desert, and the mister comes, the mister is a sandstorm, and, and, comes there for about 15 or 20 minutes, what you just cleaned out, the dune is back again, so you have to remove the dune again to, the tracks are covered now with sand again.</span> <span id="s646">They'd never do it, they never did do it, but that, that's what they tried to do because they are cheap labor.</span> <span id="s647">So they said "What the hell, we'll try to do it."</span> <span id="s648">That is what we had to do, work on the Transaharian on the railroads.</span> <span id="s649">To work on the railroads, they gave you a sack made out of desert grass, that, it had 2 sacks that you put over your shoulder, you had one in the front and one in the back.</span> <span id="s650">One wasn't heavy enough, you had to have one in the front too.</span> <span id="s651">And we had to clear the sand from 3 or 4 miles down the road, and put it in there and then bring it back, and then go back again for some more sand.</span> <span id="s652">Sand is heavy, and the desert is sand, and when you have a heavy load of sand, you sink into the sand, it's hard to walk.</span> <span id="s653">You go to your knees, you sink into your knees.</span> <span id="s654">During the day, I might add, they had about, must have been 110 or more.</span> <span id="s655">At night it would be so cold that your teeth would chatter because the cold icy wind from the uh, mountain would come down on you.</span> <span id="s656">And it was bitter, bitter cold--the Atlas mountain.</span> <span id="s657">Now this wasn't the only thing we had to contend with.</span> <span id="s658">The food consisted of uh, one cup of water a day, uh one cup of coffee, that they called coffee, it was black water, in the morning, and uh, half a liter of soup at lunchtime, and a half a liter of soup at night.</span> <span id="s659">A liter of soup, well, used to be hot water.</span> <span id="s660">But if you lucky you found a rotten potato, or rotten but uh, uh whatever piece of meat, there was uh rotten stuff, if you're lucky, you found a rotten onion in it.</span> <span id="s661">The work was ten hours a day.</span> <span id="s662">If you could not work, they would open up, if you could not get up anymore, they would open up your veins in your arms and bleed you to death.</span> <span id="s663">And get the blood out of there.</span> <span id="s664">Whatever little blood you had left.</span> <span id="s665">The punishment, let me talk about some of the punishment.</span> <span id="s666">For the slightest infraction of the rules, they would bury you in the sand up to your neck.</span> <span id="s667">And the Arabs would urinate on your head.</span> <span id="s668">And if you moved your head, they would take a big stone and smash your head.</span> <span id="s669">You weren't supposed to move.</span> <span id="s670">If a scorpion or a viper (little poisonous snakes), or ants or whatever there was bugs would bite you, you could not move.</span> <span id="s671">You didn't get any kind of rationed??</span> <span id="s672">foods.</span> <span id="s673">That was one of the punishments.</span> <span id="s674">The other one, the camp commander would come in every morning.</span> <span id="s675">He would take 8 to 10, 8 to 10 inmates out, strip them naked, tie them to a post and beat them.</span> <span id="s676">And where would they beat them mostly?</span> <span id="s677">On their sex organs, where it hurts the most.</span> <span id="s678">And they would stand there and laugh.</span> <span id="s679">They would just pick anyone at random.</span> <span id="s680">That was fun for them.</span> <span id="s681">If you didn't look right to the camp commander when he passed by or you didn't work hard enough, or this bahis didn't beat you hard enough while you were drag in the sand through the desert, he would take you at the end of the day, and he would say, "Quinze jours---------------------."</span> <span id="s682">That means fifteen days in the, at the fort.</span> <span id="s683">They would tie your arm in the back and hang you on your arms naked for about 2, 3 days you would hang on your arms, and every night they would come in, when it's the coldest, and hose you down with ice cold water, and beat you about, and that was fun for them, they would laugh when they did it.</span> <span id="s684">When you got through hanging there, and when they cut you down, you were not able to walk, in fact you were lucky to be alive.</span> <span id="s685">I went there twice.</span> <span id="s686">And I was lucky they didn't beat me that hard anymore.</span> <span id="s687">But after a while you don't feel the beatings anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">How did all of you decide to resist that?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">There was one day we had to decide, we, we, we knew we were going to die there because there was really no hope, really, we didn't fool ourselves.</span> <span id="s690">All along you fooled yourself, take a beating, not eating, not drinking, no sleep, worrying for your life.</span> <span id="s691">We fooled ourselves there is uh maybe, maybe a little light at the end of the tunnel, maybe somebody will, we'll -----------somebody that will help us, maybe is a place that we can hide, maybe there is something that we, that they won't catch us or find us or, or beat us or.....in this camp we realized, we really, this is really the end of the line, I mean, how much can you absorb, how much beatings, how much hunger, how much thirst, how much lice, we used to kill the lice every morning on the rags we wore, how we walked around naked, we had no...</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Let's stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Let's go back and talk about the punishments and how you decided to resist, like, by, by not screaming, by not giving them the satisfaction of killing you.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Yes, uh, screaming and crying, while you absorb punishment, was a no-no, by all of us.</span> <span id="s696">The only way we could fight back, the only way we could protest this, this cruel treatment, was by not giving in to their punishment.</span> <span id="s697">There can, there could beat us all they want, they could inflict any punishment they wanted to us, we would quietly and silently absorb it without a peep.</span> <span id="s698">We would not even make a, a sound, a noise.</span> <span id="s699">It would hurt.</span> <span id="s700">It would bleed.</span> <span id="s701">You would be in, in excruciating pain.</span> <span id="s702">And as more we defied them in our own way as what they would beat us.</span> <span id="s703">They said, "We are going to make them scream in pain, and they couldn't do that.</span> <span id="s704">And that got them very angry.</span> <span id="s705">And that made them figure out more punishments, and bigger punishments, and longer punishments, and more beatings, and no water for the day, and no food for 2 days, and, and, and standing naked being tied to a post in the sun all day, in the hot African sun, and, and putting a bucket of ants over your head, and burying you in the sand to your neck and urinating on your head, and beating your head open, and nothing they did could make us make a sound.</span> <span id="s706">Oh, we wanted to, but that was the only way would, we could get back at them.</span> <span id="s707">If you going to kill us, then you can beat us to death--go ahead and do it, that's the way it's got to be.</span> <span id="s708">We expect it.</span> <span id="s709">We have no hope anyhow.</span> <span id="s710">This is a living hell anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Talk about how the younger men helped the older men.</span> <span id="s712">They younger men took some of the load off the older ones, but the older ones died very quickly.</span> <span id="s713">They couldn't take it.</span> <span id="s714">That, you see, there was many ways you could die in that camp.</span> <span id="s715">You could die, you had dysentery, you had malaria, a lack of food, a lack of water, uh, bitten, bitten by scorpions, bitten by vipers, the poisonous snake, you're dead in an hour.</span> <span id="s716">Uh, uh, died by beating, actually beaten to death.</span> <span id="s717">You died of, of, of sunstroke by, by being buried in the sand.</span> <span id="s718">Uh, there were many pla, uh people really run to the barbed wire to be shot by the guard.</span> <span id="s719">You had to stay away 10 feet from the barbed wire.</span> <span id="s720">If you run too close to the 10 feet, they have the right to shoot you dead, and that's what they did, the people just did that.</span> <span id="s721">They did just that.</span> <span id="s722">Every other night we heard the shots going.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Was that resisting, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">You know, under tho--under the conditions that we lived under, it was hard to co, to, to, to live, you know, how, how much can you take?</span> <span id="s725">I mean, really, how much can you take?</span> <span id="s726">How much is much?</span> <span id="s727">How much is enough, that you say this is it, I'm giving up.</span> <span id="s728">But there were many that didn't give up, and, although there 4000 of, approximately 4000 people in that camp.</span> <span id="s729">And on, only about 300 came out at the end.</span> <span id="s730">And the rest perished.</span> <span id="s731">They did a pretty good job.</span> <span id="s732">And if anybody tells you now today, "There was no Holocaust, believe me, I was there, I was there, there was a Holocaust, don't let anybody tell you different.</span> <span id="s733">It was a living hell.</span> <span id="s734">We spent 2 years there.</span> <span id="s735">The Red Cross would sometimes send us a little food.</span> <span id="s736">Well, of course, they sent us the kind of food you had to cook.</span> <span id="s737">So cooking was a no-no in the camp.</span> <span id="s738">You weren't allowed to make a fire.</span> <span id="s739">Where would we get the water from?</span> <span id="s740">So we did a little bit at a time--our ration of water we put into an old pot there, we had, we cooked a little, we gave it to the sick ones that couldn't work and couldn't get up anymore.</span> <span id="s741">We gave a piece of our bread to the wor, because, once you don't work, you're sick, you can't get up, and you can't move, they would give you no food, no water, you just have to die, that's it.</span> <span id="s742">So we would share our rations with them, our water ration, our food.</span> <span id="s743">We would carry their load.</span> <span id="s744">In other words instead of making uh ten uh walks a day, we did uh 12 or 14, we walked faster, and so we had a right quantity of sand, and they didn't know, they didn't come out.</span> <span id="s745">As far as medication or, or, or doctors or anything, there was nil, there was nonexistent.</span> <span id="s746">You got sick, you died, that was the end of it.</span> <span id="s747">Uh, yet we stuck together.</span> <span id="s748">We got organized.</span> <span id="s749">One day I was the one to make the fire.</span> <span id="s750">We used alpha grass.</span> <span id="s751">Alpha, that was desert grass, to make a little fire.</span> <span id="s752">Because we have no wood there.</span> <span id="s753">There were supposed to be guys looking out for the camp commander.</span> <span id="s754">Somehow they didn't look.</span> <span id="s755">He stood in front of me.</span> <span id="s756">He says, "What are you doing?"</span> <span id="s757">I said, "Nothing."</span> <span id="s758">He says, "I see your fire there."</span> <span id="s759">I said, "I don't see a fire."</span> <span id="s760">He said, "You're cooking food."</span> <span id="s761">I said, "I'm not cooking food."</span> <span id="s762">"Then what are you doing?"</span> <span id="s763">"I'm just standing here."</span> <span id="s764">"Why aren't you working?"</span> <span id="s765">"I'm on my break."</span> <span id="s766">I took out a few minutes.</span> <span id="s767">I said, "Do you think I'm stupid?"</span> <span id="s768">He said, "Well, you said it, I didn't."</span> <span id="s769">Because we didn't care anymore, uh, uh, nothing good anymore so what the hell, might as well tell him.</span> <span id="s770">----------------------- -----------------------: Get your garbage together.</span> <span id="s771">That means, on the hook again, you know that.</span> <span id="s772">Then suddenly I found the whole camp, and all the workers, everybody went in front of the gate, and said, "This man isn't going anyplace.</span> <span id="s773">He's going to stay right here.</span> <span id="s774">You want him, you got to get him."</span> <span id="s775">This was the first defiance, open defiance, the first outrage of the camp.</span> <span id="s776">After about a year and a half of absorbing all that punishment.</span> <span id="s777">Well, he, an hour later he called his bahis in on horseback, and there must have been a whole, like the cavalry they're coming, riding into the camp with their sabers drawn, and all we had we had was stones, stones and sand to throw at them.</span> <span id="s778">And it was a bloody fight.</span> <span id="s779">Somehow was a bloody fight.</span> <span id="s780">And there was, the reason was twofold.</span> <span id="s781">They didn't.</span> <span id="s782">They knew I was going to die if I go in the rack once again.</span> <span id="s783">That was it.</span> <span id="s784">We were skin and bones as it was.</span> <span id="s785">And the second thing they wanted to go out in the world somebody should, the message should go out, maybe somebody will help us.</span> <span id="s786">Because we're in the middle of a desert, nobody knows we're there.</span> <span id="s787">That's why they put us there.</span> <span id="s788">They don't want the world to know.</span> <span id="s789">And maybe the message will go out because they had these wandering Bedouins, these wandering Arabs, they go to another town, they say, "Hey, there was some bloody fight up there, way in Jaffa."</span> <span id="s790">The word gets out somehow.</span> <span id="s791">There was a bloody fight, and we lost quite a few people, and they lost quite a few people.</span> <span id="s792">We used to knock ‘em down off the horses, and with the stones, we used to beat them to death.</span> <span id="s793">It was a desperate fight for your, it was just desperate, last ditch stand, whatever you may call it.</span> <span id="s794">After it was all over, they took off with their horses.</span> <span id="s795">It was all over, there was no food no water, beatings every day, that we were used to, we endured it, and 2 years passed.</span> <span id="s796">The Allied, the Allied army landed in Algiers in September of 1944, 43, in 1942.</span> <span id="s797">When they were dancing in Algiers and having a good time, they still didn't know there was a camp in Jaffa in the middle of the desert, and we are still dying, still suffering at the hands of these barbarians.</span> <span id="s798">Finally, I know somebody comes.</span> <span id="s799">A few trucks came down the dunes--British army trucks with machine guns.</span> <span id="s800">There was a plane coming overhead somehow, and the plane must have noticed some tents, a camp, and they didn't know what it was.</span> <span id="s801">Could have been German army or something.</span> <span id="s802">So they gave the message up to headquarters, and these tanks, these, uh, armored cars, uh trucks, half trucks came down, and they surrounded the camp.</span> <span id="s803">There was, suddenly there was no guard, no commander, nobody and the gate was open.</span> <span id="s804">So we thought that that gate open for us to escape, so they can shoot us in the back trying to escape.</span> <span id="s805">That would be an excuse before the world uh community to say they tried to escape and we had to shoot them.</span> <span id="s806">So we said, nobody moves, nobody gets up.</span> <span id="s807">We didn't know what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s808">Nobody runs.</span> <span id="s809">This was from 1941 to 1943, 2 years in that camp.</span> <span id="s810">And we waited for them, they surrounded the camp, they said, "Who are you people?"</span> <span id="s811">You have to understand we were only about 300 and some left out of 4000.</span> <span id="s812">Naked.</span> <span id="s813">No haircuts for 2 years.</span> <span id="s814">No bath for 2 years.</span> <span id="s815">Non-stop.</span> <span id="s816">Emac, emaciated.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Let's stop.</span> <span id="s818">We have to reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Why don't you start by describing what you looked like.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Yes.</span> <span id="s822">What did we look like?</span> <span id="s823">And how did we feel...when we saw freedom so close?</span> <span id="s824">Well, you looked awful.</span> <span id="s825">After 2 yrs of that kind of treatment, of this kind of cruelty, this kind of beatings, starvation, thirst, cold, heat, rat bites--when we are heavy we have rat bites because there were rats around, and around--we used to eat rats to keep our, to keep alive, we used to eat dogs, rats and snakes.</span> <span id="s826">That was how we supplemented our, our food ration.</span> <span id="s827">Desert rats.</span> <span id="s828">Without that we wouldn't have survived, without uh, eating these things.</span> <span id="s829">We looked just about...(phone rings).</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Let's stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">By now we looked really bad.</span> <span id="s833">Skin and bones.</span> <span id="s834">Our skin used to be like leather because of lack of food and, and the, and the heat beating out.</span> <span id="s835">It got hard like leather.</span> <span id="s836">Uh.</span> <span id="s837">Because we had no clothes, uh, sick, we were dragging ourselves by now--we could hardly walk anymore.</span> <span id="s838">We didn't bother even fighting off the bugs anymore or the, or the lice that we had on the rags that we wore.</span> <span id="s839">And we couldn't believe that we were going to be free.</span> <span id="s840">We just couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s841">The day has finally come when we saw light at the end of the tunnel.</span> <span id="s842">They pointed the guns at us, then they looked at us, says, "Do we look like fighters?</span> <span id="s843">Like fighting people?</span> <span id="s844">Look at us.</span> <span id="s845">We are the remnants of a persecuted, beaten, starved people.</span> <span id="s846">Have you no pity?</span> <span id="s847">You too, have you no compassion?"</span> <span id="s848">He said, "Take away the guns," uh, Captain said, "and get these people on to trucks, and take them down to Algiers to the hospital."</span> <span id="s849">And that's what they did.</span> <span id="s850">We got out of the camp, we looked around just once more, on to the camp, and the bodies that we left there, that died there, and we just said goodbye to the camp, got on to the trucks, and they took us into the hospital, to the 96th General Hospital in Maison Carre.</span> <span id="s851">I never forgot it.</span> <span id="s852">We got there, the order came out, these people are not to get any food or any big amount of water, and these army nurses came and they apologized for not giving us food, they said, "You're going to die if you eat food now.</span> <span id="s853">You can't eat anything.</span> <span id="s854">Very little."</span> <span id="s855">They are people.</span> <span id="s856">Some of these soldiers had pity and they gave us, "Here take a loaf of bread and you take a loaf of bread."</span> <span id="s857">They ate it, their stomach busted and died.</span> <span id="s858">Even afterwards.</span> <span id="s859">And after about 4 or 5 weeks in the hospital--they were good to us, uh, they said, "Now what are we going to do with you people?</span> <span id="s860">You can go anywhere in the free world.</span> <span id="s861">You're free now."</span> <span id="s862">It's over.</span> <span id="s863">I was very angry.</span> <span id="s864">And that was the time when I said, "I don't want to be free.</span> <span id="s865">Now I don't want to be free."</span> <span id="s866">When I wanted to be free, the world wouldn't let me.</span> <span id="s867">When I wanted to live in peace, I was hunted.</span> <span id="s868">I was beaten, I was persecuted.</span> <span id="s869">Now I don't want to be free."</span> <span id="s870">So these Italians always looked at me.</span> <span id="s871">He says, "You're 21 years old, you've had enough."</span> <span id="s872">"No," I says, "I didn't have enough.</span> <span id="s873">Now I'm angry.</span> <span id="s874">And I don't want to be free.</span> <span id="s875">I don't want to continue this, this game.</span> <span id="s876">You give me a gun.</span> <span id="s877">Now I want to get back at them."</span> <span id="s878">He said, "Why, why, would you, you had enough fight now?"</span> <span id="s879">I said, "I want a gun."</span> <span id="s880">That's what they did.</span> <span id="s881">They said "Train this man."</span> <span id="s882">Give me uniform, give him a machine gun, and train--couldn't speak a word of English--train him.</span> <span id="s883">That's what I did.</span> <span id="s884">We went back ----------------------------.</span> <span id="s885">We did some fighting there, then they sent me to England to London to the wars.</span> <span id="s886">And they gave me a course in army intelligence, they transferred me to army intelligence, and then they transferred me to Germany, to army of occupation, and my job was to look for war criminals.</span> <span id="s887">People that they wanted for war crimes.</span> <span id="s888">He says, "We need (phone rings), He says, "We need you more to hunt these people than we need you fighting with your gun (background noise) in, in, in Africa.</span> <span id="s889">So, I says, "Fine."</span> <span id="s890">Then I spent 18 months uh, I spent another year or 2 in Africa, then I said, "Okay, fine."</span> <span id="s891">Cut.</span> <span id="s892">Have to wait for...</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Yeah....</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Ten is up.</span> <span id="s895">Sync take 10 is up.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">I want you to talk to me a little bit about choices.</span> <span id="s898">The choices that Jews had, and also, I want you to compare it to the choices that you feel various guards had.</span> <span id="s899">I mean, were they just following orders?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">No, no, no!</span> <span id="s901">The the, the, the cruelty, and the, and the, and the barbaric manners of the guards uh, uh, uh, that came out by themselves, nobody told them to beat us all the time, nobody told them to chain us together, nobody told them to beat us up in chains, and whips, and whip us and, and, and, that camp commander in Jaffa in Africa, nobody told him to deny us water or deny us a piece of bread, or, or not to give us uh, not to have us work uh, uh so much in the hot sun.</span> <span id="s902">Nobody told them, not, nobody told them to tie us naked to a post and beat us, and to hang us by our arms and hose us down, to bury us in the, in the sand so our heads should look up and, and, and, and bash their brains in and urinate on their heads, nobody told them to do that.</span> <span id="s903">They told us to keep us there until, until uh, we, we're supposed to be confined and work on the Transaharian.</span> <span id="s904">But nobody told them how much or how hard or how, or what time of day.</span> <span id="s905">They could have given us off the hottest part of the day, say for 2 hrs and, and let us go into the tent uh, and then give, take us out to work again.</span> <span id="s906">No, the, they took this into their own hands, and they enjoyed what they did.</span> <span id="s907">You could see it on their faces, they enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s908">As more they would beat you as more they were laughing.</span> <span id="s909">As more they hosed you out, as more they were laughing, as more they beat you with the back of a rifle into the small of your back, the more they were laughing.</span> <span id="s910">As more they saw you writhing in pain, as more they laughed.</span> <span id="s911">Nobody told them to do that.</span> <span id="s912">They enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s913">Take the guard mobile.</span> <span id="s914">In France.</span> <span id="s915">Well, they could have showed more pity, more compassion, more understanding.</span> <span id="s916">The way they treated the people that came there is un, unbelievable.</span> <span id="s917">I mean the cruelty and the, and the, and the meanness, uh, that they, that they, that they displayed by beating woman and children, throwing them on trucks that they rounded up, and throw them into camps and starving them to death.</span> <span id="s918">Nobody told them to do that.</span> <span id="s919">The high command couldn't care less.</span> <span id="s920">They have other problems.</span> <span id="s921">They couldn't care less how they treated us, it was the little guy, the little guard that, that we, the, the perverts, the scum, the garbage of humanity!</span> <span id="s922">Those were the ones that did--the ex-convicts, the murderers, the killers, that's what they let on us, like vicious dogs, and they enjoyed what they did.</span> <span id="s923">And that is something I can't understand to this day.</span> <span id="s924">If a man is helpless, if a person is helpless, and, and, and cannot fight back and is suffering, you don't have to add to it.</span> <span id="s925">They tell, "Put him in jail," put him in jail, you don't have to beat him with chains.</span> <span id="s926">They said, "You have to put him on the boat," put him on the boat, get the ---- on the boat.</span> <span id="s927">You don't have to beat them with whips or spit at them.</span> <span id="s928">Or urinate on them.</span> <span id="s929">That isn't necessary.</span> <span id="s930">Nobody told them to do that.</span> <span id="s931">Because, uh, you have to understand that even in the high command, there were people that were civilized.</span> <span id="s932">I mean, there people with uh, with uh, addicts, and people with uh, you know, that would not do these things.</span> <span id="s933">You know, it's, it's, it's the underlings, you know, the, the, the little guys that "Ah, let's have some fun."</span> <span id="s934">They're the ones that did it.</span> <span id="s935">And they did a good job, believe me.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Let's cut for a minute.</span> <span id="s937">All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Well, what was the other question?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Okay, how do you feel that you were able to survive, what you think worked?</span></p> <p><span id="s941">I don't know, the will to live.</span> <span id="s942">The hope of seeing my family again, that they would be still alive, somehow they would have escaped.</span> <span id="s943">Uh, determination.</span> <span id="s944">Stubbornness.</span> <span id="s945">Call it what you may.</span> <span id="s946">There's one thing I didn't want to do.</span> <span id="s947">I didn't want to die.</span> <span id="s948">Not at age 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Talk about why you chose to fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">I had no choice.</span> <span id="s951">I wasn't taught to fight, I wasn't born to fight.</span> <span id="s952">But, I knew I had a fight on my hands, a fight of survival against all odds.</span> <span id="s953">I knew I had to fight or go under.</span> <span id="s954">Fight or die.</span> <span id="s955">Swim or sink.</span> <span id="s956">I knew that.</span> <span id="s957">I realized that when I left home.</span> <span id="s958">And I just, and I wouldn't give them the satisfaction of having taken my life, if I could possibly help it.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Could you talk a little about your mother, and the choices you feel that she faced, and how she maybe rescued you in a sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">My mother rescued me, I know that.</span> <span id="s961">You see when I was in prison, in --------------, my hometown, there, had a, they had a transport that they put together to go to Buchenwald, and they put us in prison to wait till they had enough people together to make a transport to Buchenwald concentration camp.</span> <span id="s962">My mother got me out in time.</span> <span id="s963">How she did it, I will never know.</span> <span id="s964">How I got out, I will never know to this day.</span> <span id="s965">I know she must have bribed a lot of people.</span> <span id="s966">She must have paid off a lot of people with a lot of uh, diamonds, we, we were upper middle class people, we were well-to-do people back at home.</span> <span id="s967">My father was a chemical engineer, and uh, we had 3 factories, and we had uh, 9 stores, 9 businesses, we were very, quite well-to-do people and she had quite a lot of things.</span> <span id="s968">As you can see on her picture, she has 4 or 5 fur coats, and that was a, a sign of uh, you know, you have it.</span> <span id="s969">We had a live-in maid, we had a beautiful home, and she must have, she got me out, I know that.</span> <span id="s970">And I only feel very, very bad.</span> <span id="s971">She was there when I needed her.</span> <span id="s972">I wasn't there when she needed me.</span> <span id="s973">And you have to live with this for the rest of your life.</span> <span id="s974">So how can you live with?</span> <span id="s975">I live with this for so many years.</span> <span id="s976">It's hard...It was a nightmare...the cruelty and brutality of so many people to so few...and I wonder many times, wouldn't it be better if I would have uh, died with them...they just got killed...(cries)...killed...(crying)...they didn't make it.</span> <span id="s977">I wished I had been able to help them, but I wasn't there.</span> <span id="s978">I guess...I guess we all got damaged by this.</span> <span id="s979">We didn't really come out alive, because, uh, we weren't really spared.</span> <span id="s980">We are marked.</span> <span id="s981">Like the one guard said, when we said, "Why don't you kill us, you dog?"</span> <span id="s982">He said, "No, we want you to live with it."</span> <span id="s983">And we are living with it, he's right, we are living with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Let's go back and talk about how when you had a chance to take a little revenge.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">This is, was it really revenge?</span> <span id="s986">So what.</span> <span id="s987">So we caught a few, uh war criminals.</span> <span id="s988">So what.</span> <span id="s989">What did it help us.</span> <span id="s990">So we shot a few Nazis.</span> <span id="s991">So what.</span> <span id="s992">While I was in Africa, so we laid the ditches, and they came at us and we shot them down like dogs.</span> <span id="s993">So what.</span> <span id="s994">Did not help me.</span> <span id="s995">Did not take away my pain, my suffering.</span> <span id="s996">Did not bring back the people back to life.</span> <span id="s997">Did it bring my 3 little sisters?</span> <span id="s998">How about my, uh, my brother's wife, and, and the baby, they hang them with piano wire on a tree.</span> <span id="s999">It took them a half an hour to die.</span> <span id="s1000">Does this make it all good.</span> <span id="s1001">So what.</span> <span id="s1002">Your rage, you have rage in you.</span> <span id="s1003">You have hate and rage.</span> <span id="s1004">Believe me, it hurts you more that it hurts them.</span> <span id="s1005">It's still there.</span> <span id="s1006">You're living with it all the time, day and night.</span> <span id="s1007">There wasn't one day in the last 40 something years that I don't think of it, that I don't think of my family, or what they have done to me, what we had to endure, the guys that had to die, the people that died.</span> <span id="s1008">So.</span> <span id="s1009">We are living with it, every one of us, all these years.</span> <span id="s1010">And the only way that's going to stop, only way that pain is going to stop, when we die.</span> <span id="s1011">That's the only time.</span> <span id="s1012">What else can I say.</span> <span id="s1013">I couldn't even begin to tell you the cruelties that they did on us.</span> <span id="s1014">It would take me all day.</span> <span id="s1015">I can't even begin to tell you the things they have done, the things I have seen, and the pain and the suffering that we had to endure, and the hopelessness, and the despair.</span> <span id="s1016">I can't even begin to tell you that.</span> <span id="s1017">You have to feel it.</span> <span id="s1018">That can't be told, has to be felt.</span> <span id="s1019">And then you ask yourself, "Why?</span> <span id="s1020">Why did it happen?</span> <span id="s1021">Why was it allowed to happen?</span> <span id="s1022">Why did nobody help us?</span> <span id="s1023">Why was it just such an unjust world?"</span> <span id="s1024">We harmed no one.</span> <span id="s1025">We did nothing to anybody.</span> <span id="s1026">Why?</span> <span id="s1027">Here is a people of 60 million, the German people of 60million, consists of 60 million, 60 million people, tried to wipe out a people, a whole people, and nobody helped.</span> <span id="s1028">Why is that?</span> <span id="s1029">And you ask yourself same question over and over again.</span> <span id="s1030">The rabbi came to my house.</span> <span id="s1031">He says to me why, why I don't come to the shul.</span> <span id="s1032">You donate money, you light candles, but you don't come.</span> <span id="s1033">I said to him, "When you can tell me where God was when I suffered, where God was when they killed my 3 little sisters and my mother, and my brothers, and where was God when they threw 200 thousand on open fire and burned them alive?</span> <span id="s1034">Where was God when they killed 6 million people, like, like savages?</span> <span id="s1035">Where was God?!</span> <span id="s1036">You tell me where God was and why he didn't help us and I will go to shul, I promise you.</span> <span id="s1037">He says nobody has the answer.</span> <span id="s1038">I know, I've been looking for the answer for many, many years.</span> <span id="s1039">And somehow I didn't come to terms with my life.</span> <span id="s1040">It's a very difficult thing to come to terms with your life after you have gone through the kind of, of, of brutality that I have gone through, and I cannot come to terms.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">I want to reroll.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Change film.</span> <span id="s1043">CR-10, Sync take 12 is up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Now I want you to talk to me about any of the times that in all those horrible experiences, all of you supported each other by making jokes, however, strange they seemed to be.</span> <span id="s1046">I want you to talk about how you guys stayed together and kept your spirits up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">It was very difficult.</span> <span id="s1048">First of all, not everybody knew everybody.</span> <span id="s1049">But there was always a joker here and there.</span> <span id="s1050">In all that misery he cracks a joke, and you can't help but smile.</span> <span id="s1051">You know, like I said before, we were hanging on our arms in -------- and they were hosing us down with cold water and beating our, the small of our backs with the back of their rifles, and laughing, and it was dark in there, and we were freezing, we were hungry, we were thirsty, hanging by our arms.</span> <span id="s1052">We felt the blood going down our faces and our bodies.</span> <span id="s1053">After the beating was over and everything, suddenly you hear that little voice, over to the right there, which says, "I don't know, I'm trying very hard, I just can't get used to this kind of treatment.</span> <span id="s1054">I wish they would stop."</span> <span id="s1055">He know, they, this wouldn't stop.</span> <span id="s1056">He says, "I just can't get used, I'm trying!"</span> <span id="s1057">he says, "I'm trying, but I can't get used to it."</span> <span id="s1058">The next morning he was dead.</span> <span id="s1059">He had internal injuries.</span> <span id="s1060">They beat him so bad that he had internal injuries, he was hanging there by his arms dead, and the night before he made a joke.</span> <span id="s1061">Yes, we got together, there was always someone that could sing, that had a voice, and he would sing.</span> <span id="s1062">Somebody else would tell a joke.</span> <span id="s1063">There was somebody that would, you know, in cases like this when you got thrown together with so many people in a small area, and you locked in and you can't get out, there was someone that says, "I just got the news."</span> <span id="s1064">What's the news?</span> <span id="s1065">"We're all going to get free tomorrow morning.</span> <span id="s1066">We're going to join the French Foreign Legion."</span> <span id="s1067">Everybody was laughing.</span> <span id="s1068">You know, there's always, there was always a joker, always one that tried to lift your spirit a little bit.</span> <span id="s1069">A, a guy was laying next to me.</span> <span id="s1070">I said to him, "You know, how long do you think we, they're going to keep us here?"</span> <span id="s1071">And he would say, "------------------------------------------------------," that means, "Everything passes even life."</span> <span id="s1072">That doesn't tell me anything.</span> <span id="s1073">He said, "Well, you asked me a question, that's the only answer I have.</span> <span id="s1074">Who knows?</span> <span id="s1075">Who knows what's going to happen to us."</span> <span id="s1076">You see, the, we never knew what was going to happen to us, where it's going to happen, or how it's going to happen.</span> <span id="s1077">And that was so bad.</span> <span id="s1078">You see, we never knew from one day into another (phone rings) that our life would be ending, whether they're going to take us out to be shot, whether they going to use for target practice, whether they going to somebody over one, and, they take us into an army, or they want to uh, want us to join the French Foreign Legion, which we didn't want, they tried, we didn't want it.</span> <span id="s1079">Uh, we never knew.</span> <span id="s1080">And we never knew how long anything is going to take.</span> <span id="s1081">I was young and never needed a doctor--thank God I was healthy, and but there were people that needed uh, illnesses, sicknesses.</span> <span id="s1082">They had to live with it.</span> <span id="s1083">And we found them dead the next day, or the day after, or the day after that.</span> <span id="s1084">And that was it.</span> <span id="s1085">But there was always somebody, we supported ourselves uh, uh, we used to sing songs to keep our spirit up.</span> <span id="s1086">One started a song and everybody got in with it.</span> <span id="s1087">The song was over, we did something else.</span> <span id="s1088">Uh, some, we exercised.</span> <span id="s1089">How did we exercise?</span> <span id="s1090">We just uh, uh did uh little things on the, on the spot, you know, uh, uh, we lay on our backs and jumped up or whatever we did and there was always something doing.</span> <span id="s1091">There wasn't really much, we were so restricted in our activities.</span> <span id="s1092">Restricted in our thinking, our thoughts, how much can you think you're going to get out?</span> <span id="s1093">---------------------------And then what?</span> <span id="s1094">Then you went out of it.</span> <span id="s1095">And you had to get something else to hang onto.</span> <span id="s1096">"Heinz, sing a song!"</span> <span id="s1097">or "Marx, tell us a story."</span> <span id="s1098">And that would end, and then what?</span> <span id="s1099">Confinement is day and night and day and night, and there was nothing to distract us from anything.</span> <span id="s1100">We had no quality of life of any kind.</span> <span id="s1101">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1102">Nothing to do, nothing to say, nothing to read, nothing to listen to.</span> <span id="s1103">Back in Jaffa, we had no music for 2yrs.</span> <span id="s1104">We didn't know what music was.</span> <span id="s1105">We knew it was nighttime because the sun went down.</span> <span id="s1106">It was daytime because the sun came up.</span> <span id="s1107">That was all we knew.</span> <span id="s1108">We lost track of everything.</span> <span id="s1109">We were totally lost in space, and that's what they wanted us to be.</span> <span id="s1110">See, see he's dead, that's what's going to happen you tomorrow.</span> <span id="s1111">And there was just nothing, this feeling of helplessness, despair, no hope, this is a very depressing feeling, and that is what we had, that's what we had to live with.</span> <span id="s1112">And then once in a while, you would think of your family.</span> <span id="s1113">I wonder.</span> <span id="s1114">I wonder what's happened to them.</span> <span id="s1115">You see, I wonder how they died, if they died, I wonder how they died, I wonder where they're buried.</span> <span id="s1116">I wish I could lay a flower on their grave.</span> <span id="s1117">I wished I could do something for them.</span> <span id="s1118">Whatever little I could do, I would do.</span> <span id="s1119">I wish that I could kneel on their grave and tell them that I'm so sorry, that I'm alive, and they're not.</span> <span id="s1120">I wish I could tell them that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">People cling to the idea that surviving is heroic.</span> <span id="s1122">What is your opinion about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Yes, uh, surviving is something that you have in you.</span> <span id="s1124">Nobody wants to die.</span> <span id="s1125">Everybody wants to survive.</span> <span id="s1126">Whether heroic or not, everybody has that will, the will to survive.</span> <span id="s1127">No one wants to die, and if anybody tells you different, they're liars.</span> <span id="s1128">You can do it any which way, you can do it in a heroic way, or you can do it in any other way, any way you can do, you survive any which way, but you survive, that was our motto, to survive, any which, any way we can.</span> <span id="s1129">Absorb beatings, starvation, thirst, bugs, scorpion, anything that you can surv, any way you can, you survive.</span> <span id="s1130">No matter how difficult, no matter how complicated, no matter how hopeless things look, no matter how bad things look, you want to live.</span> <span id="s1131">That's all there is to it.</span> <span id="s1132">And that's in every human being, the will to live.</span> <span id="s1133">Every human being has that.</span> <span id="s1134">You don't give, you don't lay down and die.</span> <span id="s1135">Nobody does that.</span> <span id="s1136">You want to go on.</span> <span id="s1137">And that's what it's all about.</span> <span id="s1138">Go ahead, hit me some more.</span> <span id="s1139">Go ahead, don't give me any food, I don't care.</span> <span id="s1140">You, you come to a point in your life with all this cruelty and uh, and uh viciousness that you say some, you say "I don't feel that anymore.</span> <span id="s1141">Let them not give me food, I don't care."</span> <span id="s1142">You, you don't care anymore, but you still want to live.</span> <span id="s1143">You don't worry about the beatings anymore.</span> <span id="s1144">One more, one less, what's the difference.</span> <span id="s1145">So they bury me in the sand, so what.</span> <span id="s1146">So, so they spit in my face, so what.</span> <span id="s1147">I'm still going to come out of in a, in spite.</span> <span id="s1148">Can you understand that...philosophy?</span> <span id="s1149">That's what we had to adopt, that kind of philosophy.</span> <span id="s1150">No matter what they do to us, I'm not going to allow them the ultimate as to kill me, I'm not going to allow them to do that to me, if I can help it.</span> <span id="s1151">If my body and my spirit, uh, will keep me going.</span> <span id="s1152">Don't allow them to break your spirit, that's what they try to do.</span> <span id="s1153">That's the reason I'm sitting here now.</span> <span id="s1154">Many times I stood at the barbed wire, close to the barbed wire and I said to my friend, Max, "Max, do you think we'll ever get out of here, ever?</span> <span id="s1155">It is so long.</span> <span id="s1156">You think we'll make it?"</span> <span id="s1157">His answer would always be "Tomorrow...tomorrow we'll be free."</span> <span id="s1158">And after we got free after 2 yrs we couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s1159">I said, "Max, are we really free?</span> <span id="s1160">Is it really happening?</span> <span id="s1161">We walk and no guard in the back of us?</span> <span id="s1162">We're not going get beaten today?</span> <span id="s1163">We're going to get some, what, is it, is it really true?</span> <span id="s1164">We couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s1165">We cried.</span> <span id="s1166">We couldn't believe that we are actually, got something that it was rightfully ours in the first place--that nobody had a right to take away from us in the first place.</span> <span id="s1167">Can you understand that?</span> <span id="s1168">This is, this is the feeling you have.</span> <span id="s1169">You start a whole new life.</span> <span id="s1170">You're born again.</span> <span id="s1171">But then you get a setback: but my family hasn't made it.</span> <span id="s1172">I made it now, but they haven't.</span> <span id="s1173">And then you wish that...tell them you're sorry, tell them anything, talk to them, talk to a piece of ground, talk to anything, we don't even have that, we can't even do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">We need to reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">-----------------------------(Sandy's question--couldn't hear) In 1947, no 1937, in 1937 Hitler had a speech, for the world, for the whole world.</span> <span id="s1177">I heard the speech, and he said, "We don't want the Jews."</span> <span id="s1178">He said to the world, "Either you take them out, or we will kill them.</span> <span id="s1179">We don't want them."</span> <span id="s1180">Simple as that.</span> <span id="s1181">Send ships and planes, do whatever you want, take them out, and uh, distribute them wherever you want to do, but we don't want them here in Germany, although Jews have lived in Germany for generations.</span> <span id="s1182">There was no answer.</span> <span id="s1183">The only answer was from the outside was from the outside world like France, Belgium, Holland, whatever countries, Switzerland, they're all, not only did they not take Jews in, they closed the borders.</span> <span id="s1184">Now, the Jews were really trapped.</span> <span id="s1185">They couldn't even get out.</span> <span id="s1186">On top of that, the Germans, the Nazis, had confiscated everything the German Jews had, all their money, all their bank accounts, they have closed their homes, they left them nothing.</span> <span id="s1187">If you wanted to buy a pair of shoes, you had to make an application.</span> <span id="s1188">So they would give you your own money, uh, uh x amount of dollars so you can buy a pair of shoes and that was at the beginning, later on they wouldn't even do that anymore.</span> <span id="s1189">So everything was confiscated.</span> <span id="s1190">Not only did the Jews have no place to go in the world where nobody would take them in, but now they took away the means for them to leave.</span> <span id="s1191">If you have no money, you can't buy a train ticket.</span> <span id="s1192">If you have no money you can't buy a bus ticket.</span> <span id="s1193">They took the cars away--if you had a car, what way you going to, supposing you have 4 children, and there's a mother and a father, and the children are little.</span> <span id="s1194">Where you going to walk the, uh, walk on the, on the, on the highways?</span> <span id="s1195">Could they walk to Belgium?</span> <span id="s1196">Whose got point, who has guns pointed at you?</span> <span id="s1197">You going to walk to France?</span> <span id="s1198">Who's going to beat you to death?</span> <span id="s1199">You going to walk into Italy that's going to throw you back into Germany?</span> <span id="s1200">Where were you going to go?</span> <span id="s1201">There was no place to go and no means to do it with.</span> <span id="s1202">It just was no, they just took every means of transportation away from them, and countries didn't help.</span> <span id="s1203">Where was the vatican?</span> <span id="s1204">There wasn't anybody.</span> <span id="s1205">They couldn't go anyplace.</span> <span id="s1206">Where were you going to go?</span> <span id="s1207">You have a household, you maybe have a baby, where you going to run?</span> <span id="s1208">Children saying, "I'm hungry Ma.</span> <span id="s1209">I'm thirsty Ma.</span> <span id="s1210">I'm tired Ma."</span> <span id="s1211">Where you going to go?</span> <span id="s1212">Lay on the highway?</span> <span id="s1213">And if you had a ----------- they would beat you to death.</span> <span id="s1214">Don't make no, make no mistake about this, they said 60 million Germans, there were only 1 million Nazis.</span> <span id="s1215">Make no mistake.</span> <span id="s1216">There were 60 million Germans, there were 60 million Nazis.</span> <span id="s1217">Make no mistake about that.</span> <span id="s1218">Because you can't tell me that 1 million Nazis could have done all that harm and hurt, and 59 million righteous Germans would not interfere, could not, could not have interfered.</span> <span id="s1219">Could not have stopped it.</span> <span id="s1220">Nobody can tell me that.</span> <span id="s1221">Oh, they try to, but they can't because I don't believe it.</span> <span id="s1222">You go on the street, people, civilians, they would beat you to death, they would beat you up, they would break your windows, they, they would rob you and steal from you, and rape your daughters.</span> <span id="s1223">That was hard.</span> <span id="s1224">They were Germans, after all.</span> <span id="s1225">And as far as, uh, the Jew went to the slaughterhouse like sheep, well, I don't know what you could have done when you suddenly got torn out of your household, put into a concentration camp, guarded with heavy machine guns, and, and, and, and, under the most brutal and barbaric circumstances, you tell me what you could have done.</span> <span id="s1226">Against the well-armed and well-prepared German Nazi Party.</span> <span id="s1227">You tell me what you could have done.</span> <span id="s1228">How you could have fought back.</span> <span id="s1229">You have a baby in one hand, and you take a spoon and hit them over the head with a spoon.</span> <span id="s1230">What, what could you have done?</span> <span id="s1231">What could you have, your husband do?</span> <span id="s1232">He just looks at them crooked and they shoot him down like a dog.</span> <span id="s1233">Mothers who had little babies in their arms, the guards went up to them and blew the kid's brain out.</span> <span id="s1234">They would play with them.</span> <span id="s1235">The little baby play with it, and then they would pull the trigger on it.</span> <span id="s1236">Why the mother hold the baby in the arm, and tell the mother, "We want you to live with it.</span> <span id="s1237">We're not going to kill you, we want you to live with that.</span> <span id="s1238">We want you to have nightmares for the rest of your days."</span> <span id="s1239">How would you fight back?</span> <span id="s1240">How could you fight back?</span> <span id="s1241">My mother had 7 children.</span> <span id="s1242">She was a housewife.</span> <span id="s1243">Not knew nothing about politics.</span> <span id="s1244">She knew how to cook dinner, and clean a house, but she knew nothing about politics.</span> <span id="s1245">What would my mother have done?</span> <span id="s1246">My father was a chemist.</span> <span id="s1247">What could he have done?</span> <span id="s1248">They put you into a place, they put barbed wire around it.</span> <span id="s1249">All it takes is 2 Nazis with machine guns, that's all.</span> <span id="s1250">How you fight these people?</span> <span id="s1251">You ------ them?</span> <span id="s1252">You want your little son to be fatherless?</span> <span id="s1253">Or you want your little daughter to have no mother?</span> <span id="s1254">Can you take that chance.</span> <span id="s1255">Maybe, there's always that maybe they won't kill you.</span> <span id="s1256">Maybe they won't put your children in the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1257">Maybe they won't hang your wife.</span> <span id="s1258">Maybe, just maybe.</span> <span id="s1259">But you hang on to that maybe.</span> <span id="s1260">You clutch to it.</span> <span id="s1261">Maybe they won't see me.</span> <span id="s1262">Maybe they have a change of heart.</span> <span id="s1263">But there was no maybe there.</span> <span id="s1264">But you hung on to it.</span> <span id="s1265">How're you going to fight back?</span> <span id="s1266">Got to have these, these barbarians with heavy guns.</span> <span id="s1267">How do you fight them?</span> <span id="s1268">Here, you see, you have 2 opposing armies, they're both armed, they're both trained to fight.</span> <span id="s1269">Okay, let them fight.</span> <span id="s1270">What army did you have here.</span> <span id="s1271">You had a Jewish people, working people, that raised families, they were housewives, the husbands went to work in the morning, the children went to, to the, to the, school if there was a school.</span> <span id="s1272">What army?</span> <span id="s1273">What prepared them?</span> <span id="s1274">They prepared from 1933 to 1936-37, they prepared, they were marching with their boats and with their guns and with their knives, and prepared, they, they were prepared to slaughter a people.</span> <span id="s1275">And the Jewish people be-, refused to believe it.</span> <span id="s1276">They said, "Nobody would do such a, such a outrageous thing!</span> <span id="s1277">After all, we've been living here for generation, nobody would do that to another people."</span> <span id="s1278">Can you understand that?</span> <span id="s1279">Nobody believed it, nobody, nobody would think that such a thing would possibly happen.</span> <span id="s1280">What kind of opponent was the Jewish man or the Jewish child or the Jewish mother?</span> <span id="s1281">What kind of opponent.</span> <span id="s1282">Well, they prepared for 6 years to make war to slaughter people.</span> <span id="s1283">They were marching with their boots since 1933.</span> <span id="s1284">And now they're big men.</span> <span id="s1285">They're big strong men, they're going to take care of everything.</span> <span id="s1286">And take a little ------, and throw it in the door, and fire, burn it alive.</span> <span id="s1287">They're going to, they're going to show you what heroes they are.</span> <span id="s1288">They are mighty, mighty men!</span> <span id="s1289">No, I don't think they went to the slaughter like sheep.</span> <span id="s1290">I think they showed a lot of heroics.</span> <span id="s1291">They showed a lot of, of courage.</span> <span id="s1292">They didn't beg for their lives.</span> <span id="s1293">They didn't ask for pity.</span> <span id="s1294">They went like a proud people.</span> <span id="s1295">They saw they had no choice, they kept their dignity and their pride, and that's how they died, with dignity and pride, and that is how we tried to endure our punishment, with dignity and pride, as best as we could.</span> <span id="s1296">They used to take a little girl, to put, to hang her with piano wire and the mother says goodbye to her little daughter, 10 years old or 9 years old, may God be with you darling.</span> <span id="s1297">Knowing very well I'll never see you again.</span> <span id="s1298">Or the little girl that, the little boy that got lost who was 5 years old, never see Mommy again, and the Mommy gets taken into the gas chambers, and he's walking around, doesn't know what's happening.</span> <span id="s1299">I was 16, 17, I didn't know what was happening, I couldn't understand what was happening.</span> <span id="s1300">You want them to fight?</span> <span id="s1301">No, all they could do was show dignity and pride.</span> <span id="s1302">That's all they could do.</span> <span id="s1303">They could, the died at least with, with that much.</span> <span id="s1304">And the little kids that died, they didn't know why, they said, "Mama, why?</span> <span id="s1305">Why are we here?"</span> <span id="s1306">They couldn't understand.</span> <span id="s1307">What are you going to tell them?</span> <span id="s1308">What would I tell my little grandson who's six years old?</span> <span id="s1309">What could I tell them.</span> <span id="s1310">What could I tell my little granddaughter who is 3 years old, why she has to die.</span> <span id="s1311">Why she has to burn alive in a, in a, in a, in a big flame, in a big pot full of wood, with flaming wood, why?</span> <span id="s1312">To this day, we are asking why.</span> <span id="s1313">Why became a very famous word.</span> <span id="s1314">To this day, why?</span> <span id="s1315">Nobody has the answer.</span> <span id="s1316">Do you have the answer?</span> <span id="s1317">I wish you'd tell me.</span> <span id="s1318">I don't have the answer.</span> <span id="s1319">I think of it day and night, but I don't can't find an answer.</span> <span id="s1320">I can find only pain inside me and hurt and, and, and, the burning, the burning desire to be able to, to uh, to accept this.</span> <span id="s1321">To accept, you have to accept these things, it's so difficult, it's so hard to accept.</span> <span id="s1322">Some things are just, very hard to accept.</span> <span id="s1323">This is one of them.</span> <span id="s1324">Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">What else can I tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">Nothing else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">End of Sound Roll.</span> <span
