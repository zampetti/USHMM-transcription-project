morning, Mr. Krasa.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: Good morning to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: May I call you Edgar?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Yes?</span> <span id="s16">What -- what name were you born with?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: Edgar.</span> <span id="s18">And I always wondered where my German speaking mother came up with Edgar.</span> <span id="s19">And she said it was between Raoul and Edgar, so I said, “I’m glad you picked Edgar.”</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: And your last name?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: Krasa, K-r-a-s-a.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s23">And where and when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: I was born in the German part of Czechoslovakia, in Karlsbad, call it Sudeten, too.</span> <span id="s25">And my upbringing while we were there was in German language.</span> <span id="s26">Grade school started in German, and there was never any animosity among -- that I felt -- between the Czech and the German population, and these were German Nationalists, but Czech citizens, Czechoslovakian citizens.</span> <span id="s27">And there was no friction between the Germans and the Jews until I think in 1930, when Hitler came to power, he started to demand of the leaders of that German Nationals -- of those German Nationals, to start to agitate, and complain about oppression by the Czechoslovakian government, and it -- and demand to be annexed by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s28">And by 1933, it -- three years later, it came to the point where my father as a Jew couldn’t make a living among those Germans.</span> <span id="s29">And he moved to Prague.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: Can I -- can I go back, so we can go just a little bit more slowly?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: What was the date of your birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: February ninth, 1924.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: 1924.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s37">And do you remember growing up -- you -- you moved to Prague in 1933 --</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Is that right?</span> <span id="s40">So do you remember growing up between 1924 and 1933 in --</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: I do remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: -- in Karlsbad?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: My father was born 1877, one of nine children, the oldest of nine children, six boys, three girls.</span> <span id="s44">And I am so sorry that I never -- I didn’t know his parents.</span> <span id="s45">But I never initiated questions about them, and he -- neither did he.</span> <span id="s46">So I don’t know what -- we found out in the archives that his father was a -- had a small store in a -- in a very small town in central Bohemia.</span> <span id="s47">And -- so at age 16, he went to Vienna, to be able to earn some money, and he worked himself up to a tremendous position in a textile factory, to the point where he supported his brothers to go to school, and accumulate a dowry for his three sisters.</span> <span id="s48">So in World War I, he must have been acknowledged by the military as a good administrator, so he became administrator of a hospital in Karlsbad.</span> <span id="s49">And there he then later settled.</span> <span id="s50">My mother, you didn’t ask about her, but I’ll tell you anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: I was going to.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: She was born in -- in the German part of Czechoslovakia, and sh -- that family was religious.</span> <span id="s53">Not fanatically, but Saturday was no work, I couldn’t go to the barber, have my hair cut on Saturday.</span> <span id="s54">I don’t remember, I -- they must have been kosher, but the father’s side, the Czech Jews, they were very assimilated.</span> <span id="s55">They were aware of being Jewish, and if they weren’t aware th -- of, this would have made them aware.</span> <span id="s56">But the Czech -- Czechs were not antisimic -- not aggressively anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s57">I think they handled the Jews in a way that they didn’t know what they are, and how different they are from them, and kept them a little at arm’s length.</span> <span id="s58">And some would be very nice to you, and then when you turned your back they would say, there goes the dirty Jew.</span> <span id="s59">This kind of hidden anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s60">But I never -- I never suffered by it.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Your mother was considerably younger than your father, am I right?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: 18 years younger, and how they met was that she was a born matchmaker, and she wanted him -- I don’t know where she met him, she wanted him for a friend of hers.</span> <span id="s63">And we met that friend later, and we discovered why he didn’t marry her, she was very dull.</span> <span id="s64">And somehow -- he may have been attracted by a younger woman.</span> <span id="s65">I am too, but it’s too late for me.</span> <span id="s66">And so they got married, and settled in Karlsbad.</span> <span id="s67">But what happened with this excellent job that my father had in Vienna, he saved a lot of money, which he lost when Austria lost the war.</span> <span id="s68">The money became devalued, and somehow he could not recover from that.</span> <span id="s69">He --</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: You mean psychologically he could not recover?</span> <span id="s71">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: I don’t know what it was, but -- it’s not nice to talk about your father this way, but this is a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s73">He continued to live in the way he lived while he had the money, to I think show in front of other people that he is -- is still up there.</span> <span id="s74">But he was very, very lower middle class I think I would say, to the point where Mother had to sublet rooms to earn some extra income.</span> <span id="s75">And then in 1933 we moved to Prague.</span> <span id="s76">He went first to look for a [indecipherable] for a jo -- for an apartment, for a job, and then in October, we moved to Prague.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Wh-What was your relationship like with your parents?</span> <span id="s78">Were you close with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Relationship was very good.</span> <span id="s80">I -- I started my memoirs by writing, I want this -- I’m writing this for my kids, not for -- for publishing, and thinking back of the relationship my parents, from what I heard, had with their parents, and what my parents had with me, and the relationship, and how I was bringing up my kids, and how they bringing up their kids, should they laugh, or should I cry?</span> <span id="s81">It was -- it was a respectful relationship.</span> <span id="s82">Mother was the boss.</span> <span id="s83">She was running the family and everybody else.</span> <span id="s84">And -- and she come and I wasn’t there that minute, I had one coming like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: She hit you, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: And the second time I was there when she called.</span> <span id="s87">I know my sons call their kids 10 times, come, come, come.</span> <span id="s88">Then they give up and the kids don’t come.</span> <span id="s89">If my wife is listening, she’s going to kill me for this statement.</span> <span id="s90">So -- and I discussed this with one of our daughters-in-law, and she says, “You cannot touch the kids, because they become abusive parents themselves.”</span> <span id="s91">I didn’t become abusive, and I didn’t become abusive to anybody else, and I still loved my mother, and respected her.</span> <span id="s92">And I think it made me a -- a straight guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Was she warm as we -- I mean, she could be strict, clearly, but was she also warm to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: She was warm and witty, and -- and had many friends, and was liked by others.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: So you liked her, also?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: And was your father, being so much older, was -- was --</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: We had very little -- very little activities together.</span> <span id="s99">He went to work, and in the afternoon he -- some of the people sat somewhere playing cards, he never did this.</span> <span id="s100">Me, what I did with my kids, skiing, swimming, running, sports, o-or other activities.</span> <span id="s101">He was 45 when he got married, and 47 when I was born, and at that time, 47, you were a settled person.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Did you eat dinners together?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Did you eat dinner together --</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: -- did you eat all your meals together?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: And you were an only child?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Only child.</span> <span id="s110">That’s why I’m so spoiled.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: And did you have conversations at dinner, do you remember?</span> <span id="s112">As a little kid?</span> <span id="s113">Did they ask you questions, and -- about school, and your friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: In -- opposite what’s happening in England, we were not allowed to talk with a full mouth.</span> <span id="s115">So while you were eating, and you had the full mouth all the time, there was no conversation at the table.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Interesting.</span> <span id="s117">So it was very quiet.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s119">But I -- I did not have many toys.</span> <span id="s120">I had one -- what do you call this horse?</span> <span id="s121">Rocking horse --</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Rocking hor --</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: -- which also could -- you could take off this rocking part and then it was on wheels.</span> <span id="s124">And we lived on a street that had a slope, we -- I took the horse up, and -- and rolled down.</span> <span id="s125">And I remember at one point one of the children wanted to have it, I don’t know for what reason I wouldn’t give it to him, my mother locked me up in the bathroom the whole afternoon as punishment because I was not generous enough.</span> <span id="s126">And when she had to go to the bathroom, she went to the neighbor’s bathroom.</span> <span id="s127">Very strict, but still lovable.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: And loving.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: Did you -- did you understand when you were young, before you left for Prague, that your f -- your father -- you really didn’t have a lot of money, but he was trying to behave as if he had money?</span> <span id="s131">I mean, did you understand that there was a f -- confusion?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: No.</span> <span id="s133">I found it out later from Mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: N-yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: So did you have a maid?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: We had a maid in the beginning, I remember, and that also had to -- that belonged to the status.</span> <span id="s138">We had to have one, and I remember one summer, she went home, her father picked her up with a horse drawn carriage and I went with them to spend some time there, but I don’t know how long.</span> <span id="s139">It was a short -- and vacations, while we lived in Karlsbad, I spend with Mother’s family in -- nearby, it was 60 kilometers from Karlsbad.</span> <span id="s140">Her father had a liquor production, which her older brother took over, but her older brother was only a half brother from his -- from her father’s first wife, who died.</span> <span id="s141">And then he remarried, and through the second wife he had four daughters.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: And one was a divorced lady, so she can co -- she maintained the household for the older brother, whose wife died on diabetes.</span> <span id="s144">I remember her, she was a wonderful wife, but when I remember now what diet she kept, I don’t wonder that she died early.</span> <span id="s145">I had only one grandmother, of Mother’s -- from Mother’s side, the father died already and she died when I was three years.</span> <span id="s146">And the only thing I remember, she always wore an apron.</span> <span id="s147">And the only sentence I remember that she said -- that I remember, was to my mother, “Don’t beat the boy, he’s such a wonderful child.”</span> <span id="s148">So that means she started to punish me already before I was three years old.</span> <span id="s149">She d -- do it to make a good guy out of -- or a decent person out of me, I don’t know, that was the method, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Do you remem -- do you remember being hit a lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Not a lot, no, not a lot, but I had to obey on the second.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: And mainly she would slap you in the face?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: And the only time Father was hitting me was when I was writing, he insisted on beautiful handwriting.</span> <span id="s156">He had two fingers on the right hand injured -- cut off, and in spite of it, his handwriting was like printing.</span> <span id="s157">And he didn’t know that there will be typewriters, and dictating machines, and computers, so not only should I have a legible handwriting, but he said this is a show of character.</span> <span id="s158">So that was the thinking at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: So how -- so how’s your handwriting now, is it good?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Ah, ah, I can’t -- I can’t consider right now -- I -- I print well, I write legibly.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Even my wife will dispute it, but I write legibly, but I don’t -- I don’t need it much.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s164">Was it a surprise to you that you were going to move to Prague?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: No, no, I understood that among the Germans the -- the political situation is not good, and that -- whether I knew it, it’s because of financial, or economic reasons, or whether it is for political, I couldn’t say now exactly what I knew, that we’re moving because the Germans were not very good to the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: And it was assumed that in Prague it would be better?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: And so you were 11 years old when you moved in 1933?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Was it difficult to adjust?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: ’33 I was nine years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Nine, you’re right, you’re right, it’s nine --</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: That’s -- just figured it out --</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: -- 1924 --</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: -- yeah, no you’re right, I was moving in some other direction.</span> <span id="s177">Was it difficult for you, was the move difficult?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: No.</span> <span id="s179">We moved in October and didn’t -- from September one, I went in Karlsbad, to a Czech school.</span> <span id="s180">That was only -- is about six weeks, but I learned some Czech.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: And when I came to Prague, I adjusted.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Pretty good, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Yeah, I -- it was one talent I had was picking up languages just by hearing.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: But German and Czech are the only two languages I learned formally --</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s188">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: -- in schools, grammar, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Did you like school?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Did you have favorite subjects in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: That I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s194">Favorite subjects, I was good at arithmetics, and -- and gym.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: And gym, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: But -- but I don’t -- no, I couldn’t tell you exactly that I liked any s -- any -- we had music, which meant singing the -- the how is it called?</span> <span id="s197">House -- house -- home -- home teacher.</span> <span id="s198">Home class, or whatever they call it now.</span> <span id="s199">The -- the main teacher, our -- for this particular class.</span> <span id="s200">We also --</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Oh, you mean a homeroom teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Ho-Homeroom, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Homeroom teacher.</span> <span id="s205">And he went with us, he progressed with us, he didn’t stay in one -- at one grade.</span> <span id="s206">He was very nice, and he played the violin, and with him we had the song.</span> <span id="s207">I don’t know how many hours a week, but there were hours of --</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: So you were taught singing?</span> <span id="s209">Or was this -- all students were taught?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: This -- it -- not from -- not -- we weren’t reading music --</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: -- we were just learning it from his -- following his violin.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: And what kind of music were you singing, folk songs, or Czech --</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: No, I think Czech -- Czech -- popular Czech songs.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s216">So did you learn anything about classical music?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: No.</span> <span id="s219">And did you go -- there must have been concerts, and theater, and opera in Prague.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: That was later.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: That was later.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: That -- that was later on, yeah.</span> <span id="s223">We went to the theater and operas for one Czech choral [indecipherable] or whatever it was called.</span> <span id="s224">We’re standing in the National Theater, on the fourth balcony up, standing.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: A-And it looked so huge.</span> <span id="s227">And I don’t know, in ’94 -- 1994 or ‘95, we went there again, and we were -- could afford the orchestra seat, and it looks like it could reach to the last row, it was so small, it was just very high.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Small -- that’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: So all these perspectives have changed since childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s231">Now you were Bar-Mitzvah’d.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: You were Bar-Mitzvah’d in Prague --</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: -- am I right?</span> <span id="s236">So that must have been 1935.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Mother was dragging us -- I don’t know whether every Friday, but definitely Saturday, Father and me to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s238">And seemed like an awful long morning, you know?</span> <span id="s239">And interesting that during Yizkor, the prayers for the deceased, the kids were sent out, cause they didn’t have anybody deceased there, I think.</span> <span id="s240">So we were playing outside, there was a -- a little wooded lawn area in front of the synagogue, and we were sent out, it was a break.</span> <span id="s241">But I never became very religious.</span> <span id="s242">I -- there is a feeling of God that she instilled in me, and when we get later to these various stages of the Holocaust, it varied in several degrees.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: But you said your mother dragged you and your father to the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: Not dragged, she didn’t drag, she said, “We are going to the synagogue.”</span> <span id="s245">And nobody opposed her, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s247">But is it -- it isn’t something that necessarily you would have done on your own, or do you think you might have?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: I -- I don’t think I initiated the -- or had the desire to initiate --</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: -- to go to -- to synagogue, or -- I like the -- I liked Purim because they were throwing candies to the kids, and like -- but I was not especially enthusiastic.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: And who trained you for the Bar-Mitzvah, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: Yes, I remember him, and I remember his daughter, the -- the Cantor in our shule, I went to his house, and he taught me, and later on we were very close with his daughter in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: And did --</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: Shapiro was his name.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Shapiro, Cantor Shapiro.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: And I -- and I don’t have a good memory for names.</span> <span id="s257">I never forget a good looking face, especially on a woman, but the names I do forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: And did you enjoy being trained by him?</span> <span id="s259">Was this something that was interesting to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: You’re asking difficult questions.</span> <span id="s261">I don’t know well -- whether I enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s262">I know I had to go, so I went.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: So you went.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: But it was not, I think a favorite activity that I would had sought on my own.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: Do you remember the service?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: Yes, it was -- was very good, but I don’t remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: You remember your haftorah?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: But I don’t remember whether and where and if there was a -- something like a party or so.</span> <span id="s271">I -- no, there were no parties, there were family members and friends were coming, and I think it was in my mother’s house, some cake she baked, and coffee she made, and that could have been it.</span> <span id="s272">And funny, much later in -- about five, six years ago, I found out -- you must have heard of Arnost Lustig?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: Living in Washington.</span> <span id="s275">He went to the same school, I think two grades lower, and their economic situation was very similar to ours.</span> <span id="s276">And he told me, I never knew that, that my mother gave him my Bar-Mitzvah suit to wear for his Bar-Mitzvah.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: Interesting.</span> <span id="s278">And you didn’t know, or you don’t remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: I didn’t know that she did, and I -- if she -- if I knew I may not have remembered it.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: In -- I remember behind our house in Prague was a sports -- like a stadium, but it was just a fence and some benches around for the workers -- workers -- sports -- workers sports association.</span> <span id="s282">And we played some soccer there, and in winter they poured some water on it, and it was a skating rink.</span> <span id="s283">And there was a big hill behind the house and it was -- kids were roaming there.</span> <span id="s284">So that was a --</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Now, how are things for you in Prague in 1935?</span> <span id="s286">This is two years after Hitler has taken over Germany, and things must be happening in Czechoslovakia, or didn’t you feel that?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: ’35, nothing happened.</span> <span id="s288">I -- as I mentioned, I went to school, and I had no problems anybody, anything, except I said there were very few Jews, and there were no Sunday schools.</span> <span id="s289">The religion was taught once a week, and a rabbi, a priest, and a minister came, and in different classrooms, religious education was conducted.</span> <span id="s290">But I can only speak for the Jewish education.</span> <span id="s291">We learned about the holidays, we learned to read the Hebrew alphabet.</span> <span id="s292">And at the end of the school year, the upper class dropped out -- it was for all the grades, kids of all grades together.</span> <span id="s293">So the upper classes dropped out, a new one came in, and we started from the beginning.</span> <span id="s294">So I knew very well the holidays, and the alphabet, and it was very repetitive.</span> <span id="s295">But this was the -- and the religious [indecipherable] the Catholic, Protestant and the Jewish were state -- the rabbi was a state employee, the state financed, but they did not interfere with -- with religion.</span> <span id="s296">But it was th -- there were no congregations, or in congregations, dues and fees.</span> <span id="s297">You went to whatever synagogue you -- you wanted, but you went to the one nearest to your house.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: And as I said, was state supported, and so I don’t think there was a great pressure for higher education, in the religious --</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Did you have Jewish and non-Jewish friends?</span> <span id="s301">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: Yeah, I had Jewish friends, and I had non-Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s303">There were some favorites in the classroom, and the most favorite one I met 1998 in -- in Prague.</span> <span id="s304">He’s older now, he’s old as I am.</span> <span id="s305">But I remember his face so I could ma -- I would recognize him.</span> <span id="s306">And looking back at the class picture, I recognized several, which means I must have been close, or close with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: The other faces mean nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: We’re going to stop the tape now.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Edgar, are you -- this is 1935, a little after your Bar-Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s313">You were -- you were talking about Arnost Lustig, who had told you that your mother had given him your jac -- your suit for his Bar-Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s314">Are you conscious of what’s going on in Germany?</span> <span id="s315">Do you hear discussions about the Nazis taking over, and what they’re doing?</span> <span id="s316">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: You don’t think so?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: That was -- that was I don’t think it -- I have no read -- I have no read newspapers, and you don’t talk in front of kids about --</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: -- these difficult things, so I --</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: And in school --</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: -- I was sheltered from that part of knowledge.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s327">And in school the kids were not talking?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: No, the only thing -- the only thing that was different in school, after gym, if you took a -- a shower, they all came to look at me, because in Europe, only Jews you get circumcised.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: So they all looked at you?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: They all looked at you?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: They -- no, not all the time --</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: [indecipherable] right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: -- at least until they got a good look.</span> <span id="s335">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: Did they say things, or they just wanted to --</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: No, no, there’s a -- some did say how come you’re different, or whatever.</span> <span id="s338">Said oh --</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s340">What were you like as a kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: What were you like at this point?</span> <span id="s343">How -- how do you remember yoursel -- oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: Oh, I have to go back to Karlsbad --</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: -- does it matter if I go back?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: No, it’s fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: I told you about the economic situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: I did, in addition to running my rocking horse, there were a lot of Jewish stores where I went in the afternoon, helping out.</span> <span id="s351">There was a -- I don’t know for what purpose, right next door in the basement they were washing bottles, recycled bottles, I think for wine, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s352">I was working there, and getting some money.</span> <span id="s353">I was delivering with a two wheeler, like they have on the market, you know, the -- the za -- vegetable people, a two wheeler, deliveries from another store to different people.</span> <span id="s354">I was in a --</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: You mean a two wheel bike with a basket?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: A two wheel bike with a basket, is that --</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: No, no, no, a -- a flatbed with two wheelers, with --</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Uh-huh, oh I see.</span> <span id="s360">Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: And -- and in another s -- I was helping -- this was a leather -- leather store, raw hides, to shelve them and -- and stock -- like a stock boy.</span> <span id="s362">In another textile, it was the cleaning up.</span> <span id="s363">I always got some money, and I remember one store where they gave me some money just to get out of there.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s366">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: But you were a kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: And you were -- wa-was this a typical thing for kids to be doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: I don’t know, I don’t know about any others, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: And you were earning some money?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Did you do this a -- do you remember, did you do this on your own, did you decide you wanted to do this, or did s -- did your parents --</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Yeah, it was -- it was fun for me to go be among other people and do some work.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: So did you continue this --</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: I was -- all my life I was said I’m good with my hand, I was told, use my hand, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: So you kept doing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: So I couldn’t -- I started -- I may have started there.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Did you continue working when you were in Prague?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: And wa -- what’s the difference, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: I don’t think there was a opportunity to that -- in -- in Karlsbad, these were friends of -- friends of my parents, maybe they did it just to let me earn some money, or whether they really needed me, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s385">But I -- I did -- I did work, and I did some active participation in the stores.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: So you’re going on, you’re 13 years old, you’re 14, you’re 15, right?</span> <span id="s387">And life is pretty much the same, I gather.</span> <span id="s388">Now --</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Yeah, the -- I -- there is not -- there were not main -- I can’t remember anything that’s worth mentioning, that happened in those years, until ’38, in -- that would be worth noting down, not the --</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Well when -- when -- when do you become an apprentice cook?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: In 1938, it came so far into th -- the pure remember or [indecipherable] with the help of Britain and France, the -- they supported the Germans, that the Czech government gives up that border area where the majority of German Nationals were.</span> <span id="s392">There was a -- a non-aggression agreement, France and England on this side of Germany, Czechoslovakia on this side, should any -- should one be attacked, the others would assist.</span> <span id="s393">And at that time, Chamberlain and Daladier decided -- I don’t know whether decided, they thought if they give in this little bit to Hitler, they avoid World War II.</span> <span id="s394">So not only was, in September ’38, this border area occupied by the Nazis, they also came beyond the Czech fortifications which they had on the border, against the Germans, so now they were standing there naked, without any fa -- without any safety, security or fortifications.</span> <span id="s395">So it was anticipated that Hitler’s appetite will grow to the point where he will occupy also the Czech lands.</span> <span id="s396">And the parents of Jewish teenagers encouraged their kids to learn a trade, should immigration become necessary, they can support themselves with work of their hands in a country whose language they don’t know.</span> <span id="s397">And then aunt of mine told my mother, “Why don’t you have the boy become a cook, so he never has to go hungry?”</span> <span id="s398">There was no discussion of -- Mother agreed, so that that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: No discussion with you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: No discussion about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Had you been in the kitchen, did you cook at all, at your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: I -- y-yes, I did, when Mother on her Yahrtzeit went to her 60 kilometer distance town, to the -- her parent’s grave, I cooked for my father.</span> <span id="s403">He wasn’t able even to make a cup of tea for himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: And you felt comfortable --</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: I was seven, eight years old, and I --</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: -- was -- simple, preparing the me --</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: But you felt comfortable in the kitchen?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: I feel comfortable in any room.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Some more than others.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: So -- but that -- I don’t think that had anything to do with it, it was -- she suggested it, and I -- her butcher told her about the little buffet, you know, you -- you come in, there’s a counter with those hot meals, and he suggested I should start my apprenticeship in a small place, where I get exposed to everything.</span> <span id="s416">So I got exposed to bringing coal from the bay -- from the cellar, not only to the kitchen, but also to the third floor where his wife lived, where wi -- they lived, and taking down the ashes, and the -- whether they didn’t have yet -- they must have had, but they didn’t use them, vacuum cleaners, so I took the carpet down, and in the yard was a -- a beam, put the carpet over, and by hand you bang it, there was a -- I don’t know whether you ever seen one, it’s a big antique [indecipherable] now.</span> <span id="s417">I beat the dust out of the carpet, and bring it up.</span> <span id="s418">When she went to the market I went behind her with two bags.</span> <span id="s419">And I came back in time to go -- opposite was the police station, a theater, and the director or the whatever you call it, of the railroad.</span> <span id="s420">And in Europe, it’s fanizer.</span> <span id="s421">I remir palladucks.</span> <span id="s422">.</span> <span id="s423">At 10 o’clock you have a gabelfrühstück, a breakfast with a fork, but you eat it with a spoon, because it consists mainly either of goulash soup, or tripe soup, which is a delicacy, I can’t find tripe, they -- they don’t -- I love it.</span> <span id="s424">Anyway, so you had two carriages, and there were little poles -- but they were not poles like this, but they were like -- like a cup, a large cup, and I went to all these three offices, deliver the soups, just in time to come back at noon to wash the dishes, there were three tables in that -- opposite the counter where some workers, or people came and consumed their meal there.</span> <span id="s425">So just came back to wash the dishes, and then clean up the -- the kitchen and the floor, and the -- so that was my exposure.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: But how old are you, 14?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: 1938 --</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: -- you’re doing this, and you’re not going to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Was that because you stopped school, or because you weren’t allowed to go to school at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: No, the school system was such -- there were five grades in grade school, and then you had three compulsory and a fourth voluntary school, it was called -- I don’t know how to translate it, and it was a -- a public school, it would be equivalent of middle school or high school here.</span> <span id="s434">And then there was a Gymnasium where you had to make an entrance exam and pay.</span> <span id="s435">That was private and you had to pay.</span> <span id="s436">O-Of course I didn’t qualify -- I may have qualified with the exam, but I didn’t qualify with the payment.</span> <span id="s437">So I made -- I had the three -- three additional years through the five grades schools, and then came the decision about learning the trade.</span> <span id="s438">And so it reminded me of stories that I read.</span> <span id="s439">The aristocrats in central Europe, the Germans, or -- they had the mansions, or castles, and they had over there cooking staff, including pastry chefs and so.</span> <span id="s440">And every apprentice was stuffed.</span> <span id="s441">Eat, eat, eat.</span> <span id="s442">So he gets -- he gets fed up with it, and then he eats very little, so he won’t be too expensive by consuming a lot of food later.</span> <span id="s443">And this guy tried me on plum dumplings.</span> <span id="s444">Eat, take, eat, eat.</span> <span id="s445">And I ate 79 of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: 79?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: 79.</span> <span id="s448">But there were 79 pits that I had to spit out, so it was less in -- in actual weight and volume.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: In one sitting?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: In one sitting, and he told me right after that, tomorrow you don’t have to come any more.</span> <span id="s451">So -- so I wouldn’t say anything at home, I left at six in the morning, like I will -- would go to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: So he fired you --</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: -- because you did what he said?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: He said eat as much as you want.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s458">And then he saw it’s too expensive, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: I see, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: I left every morning, hunting jobs.</span> <span id="s461">I sat -- till eight o’clock I sat in a park, and by eight I went to different restaurants to ask if they need an apprentice.</span> <span id="s462">And one day I come home, Father sees me in the door, and that’s the other time, besides handwriting that he gave me a shot.</span> <span id="s463">He said, “You were fired, and you didn’t tell us.”</span> <span id="s464">[indecipherable] Luckily on that day I found a job.</span> <span id="s465">Well, how did he find out?</span> <span id="s466">In -- you had to -- I think it was in Germany, it was also before the war, in Czechoslovakia that everybody had to be registered at the police station.</span> <span id="s467">And when you moved, you had to unregister here, and register there.</span> <span id="s468">And we had again, borders, and he went to the police station to register a border, and the waiter’s apprentice came with the soups, and he asked, “How is Edgar doing?”</span> <span id="s469">He says, “I don’t know, he isn’t working a week already, he was fired.”</span> <span id="s470">So that he didn’t tolerate, he thought I did something bad.</span> <span id="s471">And he first hit and then he asked the questions, that was the system.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: He hit first --</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: -- and then he asked.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Then he asked.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: Did that -- did that hurt you -- I -- I mean, physically it may have hurt you a little bit, but did it hurt you --</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: No, it didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: It didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: I -- I felt -- I felt I deceived him by not telling them.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: But I didn’t feel bad because I already had a job in a --</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: -- new restaurant, that’s why they needed somebody, it just opened.</span> <span id="s484">And it was a combination food establishment.</span> <span id="s485">From the street you walked in, and it was the second only in Prague like a semi-self service.</span> <span id="s486">You took the tray, and you paid, and you walked among -- but there are people behind the counter who gave you what you wanted, and you pay at the end of the counter.</span> <span id="s487">And then there was an excellent restaurant, first class restaurant in the -- you walk through a passage, and inside was the restaurant, and up on the -- what here is the second floor, were function rooms.</span> <span id="s488">And I learned everything from slaughterhouse to fine pastry.</span> <span id="s489">It was an excellent restaurant.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: Why did they take you, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: Why --</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: Because they just opened, and they were looking for help.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: And they were looking for people.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Now, was this a typical way for a -- someone to just decide they’re going to be an apprentice, and you don’t necessarily apprentice with one person, you apprentice within an institution of some kind, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s498">I don’t know how others decided.</span> <span id="s499">They may have inclination for cooking, or necessity, or I d -- I don’t know why others started their apprenticeship.</span> <span id="s500">So -- and I moved -- as I said, I worked in the slaughterhouse, I learned to skin cattle, and I --</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: And who killed them?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Who killed the cattle?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: Oh, somebody went around --</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: Somebody --</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: -- with a -- was a -- not a gun, but was something he had in the hand, he pushed the button and shot the cattle in the head.</span> <span id="s507">And it was not kosher, so I learned everything and I don’t know -- now when I pick up a 30 - 35 pound luggage going to the airport, it seems very heavy.</span> <span id="s508">I was carrying whole quarters of beef to -- in the -- in town was a marketplace where in the basement, the whole basement was refrigerated.</span> <span id="s509">And because meat and beef was not as tender as we have here -- now here, beef is fed with corn, and in six months it’s big enough to be slaughtered.</span> <span id="s510">So it means you have tender -- young, tender meat.</span> <span id="s511">There, it took much longer with grass and hay to feed the cattle, and -- so it had to age.</span> <span id="s512">It was hanging three weeks in that uniform temperature.</span> <span id="s513">And when you were able to scrape off the moss from the meat, it was the right age.</span> <span id="s514">And I was on a spiral staircase, I was carrying down whole quarters of beef, I don’t know how I did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: And you were a kid, too --</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: -- you were not an older guy.</span> <span id="s518">Huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: And -- okay, and then the next station was soup, with a soup chef, and then with a vegetable chef.</span> <span id="s520">And I remember for the soup, he was a young guy, but he was -- he was a nasty guy.</span> <span id="s521">But not because I was Jew, he was nasty to everybody.</span> <span id="s522">I had to cut for soup, so there were kettles where they were boiling all the bones, and all the meat that you cut off the ends, and what you didn’t want on the portion to be served, and vegetable, and all the -- the peels of the onion, which gives good color to the soup.</span> <span id="s523">And as a filler for some soups, was a small dice of vegetable, carrots, celery, theirs was the root celery, and parsley and had to cut those in uniform dice by hand, and when I had about this much in a pot, he came and looked through it and if wasn’t uniform, he threw it in the kettle, and I had to start again.</span> <span id="s524">And it -- it is a -- it is a good method, you don’t want to work [indecipherable] while you do it.</span> <span id="s525">You learn to do it perfect.</span> <span id="s526">It’s like this, you know, you remember it.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s528">So how long would you be at each station learning?</span> <span id="s529">When you learned soup --</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: This I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s531">Then the grill, and the roast, and then the -- well, braising, you know, because the meat was not as tender as this meat, and in spite of aging, for steaks, only the tenderloin and the sirloin was used.</span> <span id="s532">The other pieces were not suitable.</span> <span id="s533">So these were -- there’s a goulash and butt roast, you know, braised with -- with gravy.</span> <span id="s534">So that was the station where I worked.</span> <span id="s535">And of course, not just the beef, there were pork and lamb and fish.</span> <span id="s536">Yeah, after the slaughterhouse, I was in the basement working with two butchers.</span> <span id="s537">They were from those quarters preparing a portion size, whether it was a roast, or whether it was steaks to be cut.</span> <span id="s538">I worked there before I got to the soups.</span> <span id="s539">And then the salad department, and then the pastry.</span> <span id="s540">And the pastry was a pastry chef, and a female helper, and she loved me.</span> <span id="s541">I was lucky with women.</span> <span id="s542">No, she was very nice, she covered up for my mistakes, and you know, we were making like a -- a sponge cake, but a little different, from 80 eggs.</span> <span id="s543">So if you spoil 80 eggs, it was -- labor was cheap that time, and food was expensive.</span> <span id="s544">Here it’s different.</span> <span id="s545">So she was nice to me, and -- and on the salad I worked in, they were th -- the salad was not just salad, it was decorative items like fish in -- in aspic, and gelled, and -- a first class place.</span> <span id="s546">And -- yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: About how long did the ho -- the whole apprenticeship last?</span> <span id="s548">Six months, a year?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: No, the whole apprenticeship went on till spring of 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s552">One day a week -- I worked six days, and one day a week I went to vocational school where -- that was compulsory, to learn hygiene, and -- and about the foods, about the [indecipherable] and a description of handling, why this way, why that way.</span> <span id="s553">And when I came from school at four o’clock, five o’clock, I had to change into uniform and help serving dinner.</span> <span id="s554">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: So you worked six days a week?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: Long days.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Long days.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Long days.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: One day a week to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: No, work was five days, plus that evening after school, and I had one day off.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: And you had one day off.</span> <span id="s562">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: So from 1938 until 1941 --</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: From fall of ’38 until spring of ’41 --</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: -- there were two and a half years.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: And you’re still being an apprentice?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Oh yeah, it was a four year apprenticeship.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s571">And as a -- at a certain point do you get a particular specialty that you work on more than others, or you keep working at each of these stations?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: First to learn, you move around, and then if the apprenticeship from the soup post was sick, so they took one [indecipherable] and you moved around, and you were able to substitute in every department.</span> <span id="s573">And there was no anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s574">All the time -- in ’41, the owner -- there were two owners, one was more looking at the kitchen, the other one was looking at the other areas.</span> <span id="s575">And he was very nice, and he came and said he’s under great pressure to let me go, and he didn’t expl -- didn’t have to explain to me why, I knew.</span> <span id="s576">And at that time I couldn’t get a job any more in another restaurant.</span> <span id="s577">Now, we were at ni -- it’s ’41, you pushed me too far ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Yeah, I did -- yes, I was going to go back now.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Six months after the occupation of --</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: [indecipherable] 1939 March</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: -- the Sudeten, they occupied -- came and occupied the Czech lands.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: And [indecipherable] ends, it’s the area of today’s Czech Republic.</span> <span id="s584">The Slovaks had a -- at that time already, a Fascist government, which cooperated with Germany, and were not occupied.</span> <span id="s585">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: When does occupation happen in --</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: When does occupation happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: March 15th, 1935 -- ’39.</span> <span id="s590">And immediately thereafter they started to apply the -- what they call the Jewish laws, which were actually anti-Jewish laws.</span> <span id="s591">I think you have knowledge about them -- about those --</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: Tell me -- tell me what you remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: The first thing was to identify the Jews, although they ar -- physically identify, and physically and visibly identify, because they had at the police records they had all the Jews, because at the time you had to give your religion -- I don’t know for whatever purpose, but to -- at the police station your registration was your religion known.</span> <span id="s594">So the first thing came this yellow star to wear.</span> <span id="s595">And you had to wear it on every piece of outwear, so if you took your jacket off, you had to have one on your shirt.</span> <span id="s596">And then, turning in all the valuables, including wedding rings, which I guess the Germans used to finance their war efforts.</span> <span id="s597">Then a radio, so you can’t listen to BBC.</span> <span id="s598">Everything was dual intent, for the Germans to enrich themselves with those items, and the second purpose was to deprive the Jews of whatever gave them pleasure or resistance.</span> <span id="s599">So the radios, so you couldn’t listen to BBC, and then musical instruments had to be turned in.</span> <span id="s600">And then came restrictions to travel, you couldn’t go out, get out of your town.</span> <span id="s601">[indecipherable] You could not enter public areas like movies, theaters or parks, playgrounds.</span> <span id="s602">And Jews could travel in the streetcar only in the last car, on the last platform standing.</span> <span id="s603">And there were many more -- oh, ration tickets were issued.</span> <span id="s604">There were three kinds of -- for the Germans, they were -- we were already somewhat restricted because was a war economy.</span> <span id="s605">The Czechs got less, and the Jews got almost a blank paper.</span> <span id="s606">And if you were caught with something that you could not have -- that was not on those tickets, it was -- this was punishable.</span> <span id="s607">So my parents had my food ration ticket, because I ate at the restaurant.</span> <span id="s608">And they get -- had 50 percent more of almost nothing, that’s -- how much that is, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s609">Mathematician has to figure that out.</span> <span id="s610">But they were better off than some other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: We -- we’re going to need to --</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: We’re going to need to take a break and stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: Again?</span> <span id="s615">I didn’t see him touch you.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Again.</span> <span id="s617">Ah, he didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: We were talking about the fact that your parents had your r-ration, and you were saying --</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: Food ration tick -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: -- food ra -- yes, which was 50 percent of nothing, right?</span> <span id="s623">But let me -- let me -- let me go back before we go forward a little bit.</span> <span id="s624">Do you remember the day that the Germans marched in to Prague?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: Yes, I was standing in the sidewalk in my cook’s uniform, horrified to see them.</span> <span id="s626">They -- that restaurant was on the main --</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: -- through road in Prague, and that -- approaching through there.</span> <span id="s629">Everybody was -- people were crying, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: So the Czech -- the Czechs were not like the Austrians?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: No, definitely not, but there were some who very soon adapted themselves to raising the arm, and -- yeah, you know, I think the Czechs had the -- I don’t want to sound im -- missing the right word, but it doesn’t matter.</span> <span id="s632">They were not deeply involved in anything spiritual, I mean, they were 400 years under the Austrians, under the Hapsburgs before World War I, then for 20 years -- and they tolerated it and cooperated, and they had to live -- make a living.</span> <span id="s633">Then for 20 years they were free, from eight -- 1918 till ’38, and there were great Czech patriots.</span> <span id="s634">And when the Germans occupied, many became sympathizers, and collaborants -- collaborators.</span> <span id="s635">Then there were again great Czechs after ’45.</span> <span id="s636">There were fighters for Czech freedom 10 minutes before the war ended, and -- not 10 minutes, two days.</span> <span id="s637">And then the Communists took over, they became the great Communists.</span> <span id="s638">And in 1989, the biggest Communists, who were Etta Truff, and -- made all the money and stole all the money, they were the ones, the first ones who privatized state enterprises.</span> <span id="s639">And with their Communist connections, they got it for almost nothing, and today they’re millionaires.</span> <span id="s640">So they can adjust in the [indecipherable] so, any condition.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: And were you frightened when you saw the Germans come in, the Wehrmacht come in?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: I didn’t know the full future impact of -- you know, the Germans now occupied the Czech lands, that -- that I knew is -- isn’t good.</span> <span id="s643">But the full range of impact on the Jews, I did not know, I didn’t -- I knew that Jews in Germany are persecuted and all that, but it somehow didn’t sink in immediately, I am in danger.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: And in fact you’re -- from ’38 until ’41, you’re still in the same place.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: I what?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: You’re still in the same place --</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: -- between ’38 and ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: So in a certain way, a lot doesn’t change.</span> <span id="s651">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: For me, no.</span> <span id="s653">For me, not much has changed, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: Do you think that things changed for your parents more than they changed for you during that period?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: I -- I am sure now -- shopping hours were I think twice a week, or three times a week from five PM till six, or from four PM till six, when everything was already sold out.</span> <span id="s656">So there were the --</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: You mean shopping hours for Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: For Jews, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: So what did you think, as this young boy, being an apprentice, watching the different restrictions being made, and have to wear -- did you -- you have come to work with a Jewish star --</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s661">But nothing else affected me, because I didn’t have time to go to movies, and -- and I didn’t have time to listen to the radio, and I did not have a musical instrument that I had to give up.</span> <span id="s662">So I was not -- I didn’t feel affected negatively.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Did Germans come into the cafeteria?</span> <span id="s664">Soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: Th-They must have, they -- I wasn’t out there --</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: You weren’t out in front --</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: -- I -- I was in --</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: -- you were in the back.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: -- the kitchen.</span> <span id="s670">And if they were, I didn’t wear the star on the uniform.</span> <span id="s671">Only on the streetcoat.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: Only on the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s675">And did you begin to feel something in -- when you were in the back, working with the other pe -- were there other Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: No, no, the --</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: You were the -- were the o --</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: No, I was the only Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: You were the only Jewish person?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: And they didn’t look at me, and -- because we didn’t go to the gym.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: But they knew you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: But they knew I am Jewish, and they didn’t treat me worse than the others.</span> <span id="s683">There was a tough -- tough apprenticeship.</span> <span id="s684">I could show you but is showing only up to here, these two prong forks that the cooks use?</span> <span id="s685">I have several marks on my behind, when I wasn’t moving t -- fast enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: They would --</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s688">So, but not just me --</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: Was everyone?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: -- all -- all the apprentices.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: And how many apprentices were there by the way, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: Oh, there were quite a fe -- they -- on every post was one, at least one, and then there were some who replaced you when you went to school, and there were some additional ones that were needed at time of serving and y -- lunch and dinner.</span> <span id="s693">And there were functions also.</span> <span id="s694">So there were at least eight, nine apprentices.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: But I thought you said you did serve sometimes, when you -- when you went back after school in the evening.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: Yeah, at the -- me -- me -- at the counter where the waiter brought his -- his order, we assembled the -- the plates, or that --</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: Oh, I see, not at -- you didn’t serve the -- the plates at --</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: No, not sit -- no, no, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: -- uh-huh, I see what you mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: -- no, that was -- that was the service --</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: -- the cooks provided --</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: -- for the waiters.</span> <span id="s705">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Did your father --</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: I am glad you qualified that.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: Yes, cause I wasn’t quite sure what you meant.</span> <span id="s709">What was your father working at when he was in Prague, what was his job?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: In Karlsbad he was a salesman for textile because that’s what he knew from Vienna, from before.</span> <span id="s711">And I guess he couldn’t find anything in that line in Prague.</span> <span id="s712">So once a salesman, always a salesman, he started to sell coal.</span> <span id="s713">And I don’t know whether to individual home owners because the truck came and every house had a -- a cellar, with through the window they put the coal down.</span> <span id="s714">I do not know if there were several tenants in the house, whether each one had his own storage for the coal.</span> <span id="s715">Wa -- he was -- he was selling coal, and it’s cold only half a year, so it’s only about half the income, the yearly income.</span> <span id="s716">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: So things were not easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: I think -- I think he also delivered to fact -- sold to factories and so, which were running on coal.</span> <span id="s719">Oil was not at that time in use for production.</span> <span id="s720">I don’t know what electricity was made from, but I’m sure it was from coal, because it was cheap and abundant in Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: And did he keep his job till ’41, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: No, I don’t -- don’t remember.</span> <span id="s723">I -- I --</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: You don’t remember.</span> <span id="s725">You didn’t own the apartment where you were living?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: You rented the apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: Rented it.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: So, were you getting paid as an apprentice, so that you could --</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: Yes, I did get -- I did get 60 crowns a month, which is two crowns a day, which allowed me to go twice to the opera.</span> <span id="s731">It was a contribution, was little, small.</span> <span id="s732">I think at later years I got little more, but that 60 initial, stayed in my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: And did you give most of this money to your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: All of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: All of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: I didn’t have time to spend it.</span> <span id="s737">So after he told me that he can’t keep me, I know I took off my star and I found a job in a resort hotel on the Czech-Bohemian Highlands.</span> <span id="s738">I don’t remember how I got it, I don’t remember how I got there, I don’t remember the name or location.</span> <span id="s739">I do remember having work there, and what impressed me in my memory is that one day a man came from -- came in and asked me, “Are you a Jew?”</span> <span id="s740">I said, “Why would you want to know?”</span> <span id="s741">And he said, “I just was at the police station and I heard them say that at this hotel works a Jew, and they come to pick him up.”</span> <span id="s742">So I dropped everything, changed my clothes, went to the railroad station and went home.</span> <span id="s743">I didn’t even pick up the money for -- for -- for that period that I didn’t get paid.</span> <span id="s744">So that was my -- but I -- I don’t remember many details.</span> <span id="s745">And I have many such empty windows in my memory.</span> <span id="s746">Some -- some unbelievable ones.</span> <span id="s747">So then the only job I could get was at the -- at a --</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: Tell me something, what is it you think you’re -- you’re not remembering?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: I don’t remember the town, I don’t remember the hotel, the name.</span> <span id="s750">I don’t recall like how the kitchen looked.</span> <span id="s751">But I know that where I was standing when this man came in and told me that they coming to get the Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: Maybe the shock of what he said was so great that it blocked out --</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s754">Like people remember when Kennedy was shot, or when 9-11 happened, where they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s756">So you went back --</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: I di --</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: -- right di -- did -- you obviously are not wearing the Jewish star.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: Not wearing the -- the star on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: Do you look Jewish, in terms of what people --</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: Do I?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: Well, I have no -- I have no idea what that means.</span> <span id="s763">I never knew that that meant.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: No, I think -- I think the Europeans categorize the people, they -- they recognize the Jews by the nose, or other features, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s766">So were you suspicious looking then?</span> <span id="s767">Did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: I didn’t act suspiciously, and -- I acted as if I belonged there, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: Now there’s obviously -- well, this is 1941, have -- have the Germans attacked the Soviet Union by then?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: Oh yes, in -- in ’39, in the end of ’39 they attacked Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: Poland, right, but the Soviet Union wasn’t coming --</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: And as soon as they had Poland, they broke their pact with the Soviets, and they went on.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: The -- the only job is that -- I could get was at a dining hall that the Jewish community -- commu -- not the community at large, the community center you would call it, the keela --</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: Keela, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: -- is -- is maintained for immigrants from Poland, because they couldn’t get the working permit, or not to endanger the Czech’s jobs.</span> <span id="s777">So the community at large, plus the keela, had to take care of them.</span> <span id="s778">Clothes is -- was collected, bedding and then other things, and they got a substantial meal at noon at this dining hall.</span> <span id="s779">I didn’t mention, when this aunt told my mother I should become a cook, that many times it will be very beneficial to me, and maybe some those -- some of those related to me.</span> <span id="s780">So the first time was that my parents had my ration ticket and I got a good -- good meal.</span> <span id="s781">Not 79 dumplings, but I ate a good meal.</span> <span id="s782">So I worked there, and thi -- another advantage of it was that I was one of only two Jewish cooks in that whole occupied area.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: Which brought me almost to the social level, or importance level of lawyers.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: No, wa -- one of two Jewish cooks, and they were needed.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: Maybe more needed than lawyers.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: So one was already in that dining hall and I was the second.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: But was he much older than you, or was he --</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: He was older, he was born in 1919.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: But he’s only five years older.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: More -- yeah, but more experienced --</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s796">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: -- more -- I worked until the fall, when the man who managed this dining hall told me that he was designated to become a member of a council of elders in charge of supply and feeding and economy, in a ghetto to be created to hold all the Jews from the Czech lands.</span> <span id="s798">And he would appreciate if I, as a rarity, one of the two cooks, would volunteer and go there with the very first transport to prepare kitchens, train people so they could be fed when they arrived by the thousands.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: And who was this person?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: His name was Karl Schliesser, very nice, very nice man.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: And about how old did you think he was at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: Oh, he was a [indecipherable] person I didn’t judge what he -- he already had kids and I know he had a daughter who was older than I was.</span> <span id="s803">Anyway, he immediately contradicted himself.</span> <span id="s804">He said to ghetto to hold all the Jews.</span> <span id="s805">And then he said if I volunteer and come with him, he would protect my parents from being deported further to the east from that ghetto.</span> <span id="s806">As a member of the Council of Elders, he would protect my parents from -- that means before this ghetto, Terezín, Theresienstadt was created, the officials at the -- at the Jewish community knew that it’s not going to be a permanent ghetto, it’s going to be a transition station for further deportations.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: Did you understa -- did you understand that there was a conflict in what he said, that there was a contradiction?</span> <span id="s808">Or did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: No -- I -- I -- I knew that -- immediately that all the Czech Jews would come there, but not all would stay there.</span> <span id="s810">And my father was vehemently opposed to my volunteering, you don’t volunteer for something like this, unknown.</span> <span id="s811">But I thought -- i-in the first instance he said to hold all the Jews of -- so if my turn would come eventually, and if he will be able to keep his word, I believed if he c -- will be able, that he would.</span> <span id="s812">I’m ahead of the game, and my parents have a chance to stay there -- there was no thought about the concentration camps, and annihilation and then gassing and the -- that was not known until the very end.</span> <span id="s813">Nobody outside the concentration camp knew what’s expecting the deportees upon their arrival in Auschwitz, or wha -- that was not known of Auschwitz -- and people would not have even believed it and have not believed it later on.</span> <span id="s814">There was [indecipherable] always optimistic.</span> <span id="s815">Now -- and there were some people who were arrested for political -- by the Germans, opponents.</span> <span id="s816">And they later got -- the family received a card that he died, that family member arrested six months ago, died in Auschwitz for -- on a heart attack.</span> <span id="s817">So those who came afterwards, and came to Auschwitz, wrote back.</span> <span id="s818">They couldn’t say, I’m in Auschwitz, but they wrote, in these 30 allowed words, I am at Uncle Joe’s, or with Uncle Joe, to let them know he’s in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s819">But these people have interpreted it, Joe is alive, he is not -- you know, always --</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: -- took the optimistic --</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: Optimistic, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: -- part of the situation.</span> <span id="s824">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: T-Tell me something.</span> <span id="s826">Your father was absolutely against it.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: What did your mother say, since she was a very strong person in the family [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: She was less against it.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: She was less against it?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: Less against it, because I said that, what he promised, and she thought there may be a chance.</span> <span id="s832">And nobody expected it to be, you will -- okay, you will be displaced, and replaced somewhere else.</span> <span id="s833">Nobody had an idea, a military barracks that the families won’t be -- there were ghettos before in Poland, but these were voluntary ghettos where Jews have, on their own will, congregated to be away from the anti-Semites, and felt better and safer, and on their own.</span> <span id="s834">So these were voluntary ghettos, and there the Germans just drew a barbed wire around the district, and they had the ghetto.</span> <span id="s835">But people were living together, maybe crammed, maybe, but fam -- so they made up -- the -- the idea was, we were living elsewhere with only Jews, and just the situation of -- of living arrangement will change.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: So was this an easy decision for you in spite of your father’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: Yeah, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: -- or was it a difficult decision?</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: -- I -- no, no, I -- I decided, this time I prevailed.</span> <span id="s840">And I went to the -- on November 24th, 1941, with 342 hand-picked men, and we assembled -- we came from home, directly to the railroad station, assembled there, and it was the last time we traveled in a passenger train.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: Oh, you were in a passenger train for that trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: In a passenger train to --</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: Were you the only cook, o-or that other guy was there --</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: The other one was too.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: -- was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: But he did not volunteer.</span> <span id="s847">He did not volunteer, and he was put in anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: 342 y -- mostly young men?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: No, these were th -- I -- depends what is young.</span> <span id="s852">Today everybody under --</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: -- is young, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: -- 75 is young for me.</span> <span id="s855">But these were accomplished engineers, technicians, plumbers, carpenters.</span> <span id="s856">To transform the town, which was a fortress town, built in 1780, with 12 meter thick walls, built in octagon, you have seen the plan.</span> <span id="s857">And each corner was in a -- shaped in a triangle so you could see the enemy approach, if he did.</span> <span id="s858">And the 12 meter thick walls, and the moat around it, and the moat was filled on the river that was running just by the walls.</span> <span id="s859">And there were only three gates into this town, which is a ideal place to hold someone whom you don’t want to let escape.</span> <span id="s860">Those gates, wh-when we cleaned there --</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: Let me as -- let me go back just for a second.</span> <span id="s862">Are -- is -- is everybody feeling, when you -- when you go to the railroad station and you’re waiting for the train, if you’re waiting, I don’t know if you’re waiting --</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: -- but th -- are people nervous, or they’re fairly relaxed --</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: Yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: -- what is this --</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: -- no, no, they were nervous, they --</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: -- tha -- what’s the sense --</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: -- all those, the others, the 341, they were all called up to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s871">They -- it wasn’t volunteer.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: I was the only volunteer</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: There’s another word for it, it called meshuganah.</span> <span id="s875">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: Yeah, it certainly is.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: But --</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: But you really were the only volunteer amongst all of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s880">And later on people volunteered when the husband was taken with one transport and the wife volunteered to go with the next hoping to be with him, this -- this were only kind -- other kind of volunteerism.</span> <span id="s881">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: So it’s not a calm situation for people, there’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: No, they know -- they -- I don’t know what they thought when they thought they’re going to build something and then they come back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: You know?</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s887">You don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: I don’t know that.</span> <span id="s889">But I was the -- I think the only one who was told it’s going to be a ghetto to hold all the Jews, and -- and so on.</span> <span id="s890">I think, I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s891">It was not a frightful situation, concerned, worried.</span> <span id="s892">I think that the prevailed -- the -- the th-thought prevailed, we are going to do a job somewhere and we come back.</span> <span id="s893">Because there were before groups sent to certain areas where the German a -- the -- the head, or [indecipherable] or wife was residing in a castle and the group was sent there to do the landscaping, and then they came back when it was finished.</span> <span id="s894">And there was another group working in the forest, I’m not sure what they did there, and they came back.</span> <span id="s895">So I think that did example must have been in their mind, because it was not nervous, it -- it was upsetting, taken away from your wife and kids, but so we were allowed to take with us 110 pounds of luggage.</span> <span id="s896">And it consisted mainly, going into the winter, of warm clothing, and everyone had the 110 pounds, and two pair of pants, and two jackets, and another coat, and you know, to -- the -- to --</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: You mean that you were wearing?</span> <span id="s898">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: -- to -- to -- that was not among the weighable luggage, to augment your possessions.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: So you assumed you were not coming back.</span> <span id="s901">You knew that.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: I -- I -- I was sure, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: Did -- did Schlaisser -- is -- is it Schlisser or --</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: Schliesser.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: Schliesser.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: Schliesser.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: Was he with you on the train, or had he gone before?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: No, he came one -- he came about six, seven days later.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: Or four days later, we -- the whole Council of Elders.</span> <span id="s911">And the Council of Elders were the officials at the Jewish community in Prague.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: The same Jewish community where you were in the kitchen?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: Yeah, I didn’t know that when I was in the kitchen, they were in another town -- another par -- ch -- part of Prague, in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: So who accompanied the -- you -- the 342 people on the train?</span> <span id="s915">Did you just go by yourselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s917">That I don’t know.</span> <span id="s918">I was young, I didn’t know the -- what arrangements, how -- whether somebody was in charge or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: But on the railroad station -- the town does not have a railroad station, it’s two and a half kilometers in another town -- nearby town.</span> <span id="s921">There we were, expected by Czech gendarmes.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: And it’s like state police.</span> <span id="s924">And they were -- they accompanied us, and here they were also the ones who guarded the three gates, not the SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: The three gates of Terezín.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: So we were brought in to what was called the Sudeten barracks, and when we entered, the gates closed behind us.</span> <span id="s929">And when we came there, it was open.</span> <span id="s930">We came in, and the gates closed.</span> <span id="s931">So that was the first time suspicion of some prison type accommodation is beginning.</span> <span id="s932">We were assembled on the courtyard, and the commandant was a doctor, I don’t know what kind of a doctor, he was not a cardiologist I know, because he didn’t have a good heart.</span> <span id="s933">But they assembled us and told us everything we are not allowed to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: Was this Sydell?</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: Sydell.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: And there was not much left that we could do, other than our daily work.</span> <span id="s938">And the carpenters went immediately to work -- there was a supply of lumber, making table by table bunks to push as many people into those military wards as possible.</span> <span id="s939">And I didn’t have anybody -- the -- since -- during the Czech re -- Czechoslovakia, in 1938, they kept about 5,000 soldiers of different -- how would you say?</span> <span id="s940">Infantry and Calvary and artillery --</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Different units.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: Each one had it’s own barracks, 5,000 of them, and 3,000 civilian population was living there.</span> <span id="s943">And they were living [indecipherable] and from the military.</span> <span id="s944">And there was some farmers with fields around it.</span> <span id="s945">And we only later found out that the gates closed so those Jews don’t mingle with that other population.</span> <span id="s946">But we didn’t know that that was the reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: So the gates closed --</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: And we --</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: -- in barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s951">And those --</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: I -- I’m going to have to stop you.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: So hold your thought.</span> <span id="s955">Remember where you are --</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: Yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: -- because I’m going to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: -- we closed the gates.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">End of Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: Edgar, I just want to get this picture again.</span> <span id="s963">The 342 of you were brought into the Sudeten barracks, into the courtyard of the Sudeten barracks.</span> <span id="s964">And then the -- the gate that closes is the gate from the barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: The gate from the barracks, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: So that you’re going to be kept from the Czechs who -- and the --</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: The German -- it was mainly Germans.</span> <span id="s968">There is --</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: Mainly Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: -- [indecipherable] on the -- on the border already, the s -- the Sudeten, part of the Sudeten.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s972">So they wanted to separate the Jews from these other people until they --</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: Which we didn’t know, we thought prison bec -- now, those who had to -- who had work outside, like some of the engineers, who had to -- their job was to increase the capacity of the utilities, serving currently 8,000 people, to accommodate 60,000.</span> <span id="s974">So the electricity and the -- and the water and the sewer, all these -- these people were specialists picked for that job, and some of it was outside --</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: -- the barracks, and outside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s977">So they went with -- accompanied by a gendarme.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: A Czech gendarme.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: Czech gendarme.</span> <span id="s980">And some of them were very good, they felt, you know, that one Czech to another, and the re-relation didn’t make a difference.</span> <span id="s981">Some were bad, and some were afraid to be good.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: So there three categories.</span> <span id="s984">You had to know with whom you are dealing.</span> <span id="s985">So you could go out only accompanied by a work detail.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: So you’re really in a -- in a rather small area?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: I was inside the barrack, never got out.</span> <span id="s988">I mean, never, for a certain period --</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: -- until it was filled.</span> <span id="s991">Anyway, I started to say that until 1938, those barracks were used -- occupied and used by the military and since the German occupation, there was no military in those barracks, they were closed.</span> <span id="s992">And of course, they started to deteriorate, a lack of maintenance, and weather, and rusty and dusty, and -- and repairs, the floor, the pipes.</span> <span id="s993">So -- but I couldn’t get anybody to help me to prepare the kitchens, because they had their assigned job.</span> <span id="s994">Until later they got the idea that it’s good to have some relations with the kitchen under the conditions we were living at, and they came and helped, that they did some manual work, and the engineers did some repair.</span> <span id="s995">And they finally got the one kitchen going.</span> <span id="s996">There were two kitchens in the Sudeten.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: Two kitchens in the Sudeten.</span> <span id="s998">So what ha -- how did people eat when you first came?</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: We were told to take a three day something -- for the first day some sandwiches, and then some non-perishable food like a canned food or so, there was no frozen, or whatever --</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: -- prepared meals.</span> <span id="s1002">So for three days we took --</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: Your own food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: -- our own food, and we were able on the third day already to prepare a soup, and -- and bread was delivered for the 342.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: So, did you make the soup because you didn’t have any help?</span> <span id="s1006">Who made the soup?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: That wasn’t difficult to make, the soup, that if you did nothing else.</span> <span id="s1008">That -- that -- the other cook was there, we worked together.</span> <span id="s1009">He was not very enthusiastic about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: And what did you have, huge -- huge pots?</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: Kettle, like you saw in that picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: In picture, huge --</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: Huge, yeah, 400 liter, hundred gallon kettles.</span> <span id="s1014">Some were steam heated from a central steam line, which then had to be augmented, the capacity I mean, of which.</span> <span id="s1015">And some burn coal.</span> <span id="s1016">So there -- you found -- I’m jumping ahead again.</span> <span id="s1017">Okay, we’re in that kitchen and preparing it and we got ready, and six days later, a transport of thousand people came from Brno, that’s the capital of Moravia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: And what -- it was the job of the Council of Elders, and now while -- if the Council of Elder was in Terezín, so there were other officials in Prague, and those big communities, that had to put the thousand people to fill a transport, on German orders.</span> <span id="s1020">This is a terrible responsibility to decide whom you dislocate from their regular life, which was lousy already anyway, but it was something known, and send them away.</span> <span id="s1021">But what they did, they kept families together.</span> <span id="s1022">In my case it was negative, because they wanted me to be together with my parents, so they came three weeks after me, while they otherwise might have, by chance, stayed longer in their accommodations at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: And this principle prevailed also when transports were put together from Terezín to the east.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: They would bra -- keep families together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: Families together, unless one of the family members were -- was in a job -- it could work both ways -- a job that was necessary either for war industry or -- or for maintenance of the town -- functioning of the town, they either kept the one and send the rest, or they kept the whole family back.</span> <span id="s1027">And I don’t know who and why and how these decisions were made, but these were three ways of people staying in Terezín till the end, or being shipped out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1029">Now, Edgar, you’re 17 years old in 1941 when you’re deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: Yeah, 17 and a half</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: Seven -- 17 and a half, that’s right, because in February you’re going to be 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: 17 and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: That’s right, in 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: Almost three quarter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1036">Do you feel as an adult man at this point?</span> <span id="s1037">I mean, how -- what is it -- who -- who are you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: It’s hard for me to say, it y -- sounds like bragging, but my wife wa -- brings that up, whereas that it was unbelievable that age 17 and three quarters, I could organize the setting up of the kitchen, and not only that.</span> <span id="s1039">When that first transport came of -- I don’t remember what the other one did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: The other cook?</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: He was the -- yeah, he -- he worked alone, but he did not initiate anything.</span> <span id="s1042">I think he was mad that he was taken out of his regular life.</span> <span id="s1043">With that first transport, I mention whole families came, so I had somebody staff the kitchen with women who knew about food, who knew about preparation of food, understood food, although they never worked for thousand people, I -- I -- neither did I.</span> <span id="s1044">But at least somebody who knows how to handle food -- food.</span> <span id="s1045">Now, there was flour in -- in the warehouses.</span> <span id="s1046">There was some sugar, there was some margarine, and interestingly, there was plenty of spices.</span> <span id="s1047">Pepper, paprika, caraway.</span> <span id="s1048">I guess that was not a -- an item the Germans were short of.</span> <span id="s1049">But there was no vegetable, there was no fruit.</span> <span id="s1050">There was occasionally some marmalade, and not to jump too fast, we started up one kitchen, and then, or after that first transport, every second day, third day, another thousand people came.</span> <span id="s1051">And I don’t remember how many thousands that Sudeten held, but when it was full, the Germans decided to separate women from the men.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: So at first when they came to the Sudeten, they were together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: Often families together, yeah.</span> <span id="s1054">And I never went up to look how they a-accommodated with a -- a family occupies one of the three sections of the bunk, or above each other, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: And how -- how were the -- do you know how the bunks were set up?</span> <span id="s1056">Is this like a dormitory?</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: Or were there actually separate room?</span> <span id="s1059">There were not separate rooms, it was all --</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: No, no, there was the -- this military barrack --</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: -- was one long --</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: -- one long room, and then they put up the bunks this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: So where are you staying?</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: I was staying in one -- one of -- one --</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: One of these bunks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: One of these bunks, yeah.</span> <span id="s1069">I wasn’t privileged yet, later I had some privileges.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1071">And did you have bunkmates?</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1073">So when they se -- decided to separate the women from the men, they designated the Dresner for the women.</span> <span id="s1074">That other cook went there, and with the women went girls of all ages, and boys under age 15.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">A: Those 15 and older stayed there, and they were assigned jobs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: Stayed in Sudeten.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: Everyone -- everyone had some job designated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: So Sudeten is first, then Dresden is second?</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: Then Dresner, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: Is it Dresden or dres --</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: Dresner.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: Dresner.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: Dresden is the town, and the designation is Dresner --</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A: -- it’s [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: -- barracks, it’s instead of an [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: Did you also have to set up the kitchens in -- in Dresner?</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: In Dresner he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: He did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">A: He did.</span> <span id="s1095">But he stayed there, and when Dresner was full and another barracks was -- the kitchen to be set up, I went.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: So then who took over in Sudeten?</span> <span id="s1097">You -- you don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: I hope by that time people were already capable of running -- what was interesting, most of the so-called head chefs in those kitchens, were former butchers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: Although the -- no meat was handled.</span> <span id="s1101">Oh yes, when the horse died somewhere in the neighborhood, we got it in -- we got it -- we got --</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: You got in the meat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">A: We got the meat.</span> <span id="s1104">And if there was a butcher store originally, for the germ -- yeah -- I’m handling it too fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: That’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: We were isolated and walking from barracks to barracks or to the workplace, accompanied by gendarmes.</span> <span id="s1107">By June 1942, the last of these town inhabitants was evacuated by the Germans.</span> <span id="s1108">I don’t know how they were accommodated, whether they found them, but that wasn’t my problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: Whe -- when -- when in 1942 did this happen?</span> <span id="s1110">Early?</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: June.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: June of 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A: June ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: And from then on, the gates of the barracks were open, and when you finished your job, your work, your assigned work, you could go with that family and move around without being accompanied or guarded.</span> <span id="s1116">So I went from barrack to barracks, and part of just preparing the kitchen, was also training people to -- to -- I did get information of what is in the -- in the warehouse.</span> <span id="s1117">And I got information how many people are already living there.</span> <span id="s1118">So based on that, I made use of supplies for individual barracks, and later on even a sophisticated menu, how many grams of what to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s1120">So how did you figure this out?</span> <span id="s1121">I mean, these are much larger populations than you were ever trained to feed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1123">I told you, there’s one -- there were some women who were able to administer the kitchen, not just the butchers, and that [indecipherable] it’s -- it’s funny that there was no meat, but the butchers seemed to be the best administrators of a kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: Did -- w-were you the person who was in control of the amount of -- of whatever ingredients could be sent, whether it was flour, it was sugar, it would be sent to this barrack, or that barrack, or this kitchen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A: That -- that started out this way.</span> <span id="s1126">Later there were people who were in business, food business, so I had stores at -- and groceries and -- and other related business.</span> <span id="s1127">They became -- they became the warehouse -- o-operating the warehouse, and this -- they didn’t got the information, and without my interference or -- or participation, based on the initial set-up, delivered directly to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: And were there equal rations given to each barrack, or were there different -- differences in the barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: Not in the barracks, the difference was -- and that was -- you know, the Council of Elders had very -- they were, so to say, the town administration.</span> <span id="s1130">They were actually a cabinet, there was a man designated for transportation and for labor and for health and for supply, and -- and other departments.</span> <span id="s1131">But they had very little room for initiative.</span> <span id="s1132">That was all based on strict rules set by the Germans.</span> <span id="s1133">However they, where possible, they applied their own decision making.</span> <span id="s1134">Like for instance for the children, and that was a little bit later, the -- a children’s kitchen was -- was created, that had more of the food a growing child needs, because children were our future.</span> <span id="s1135">And they decided those who had hard labor assignments to get more food.</span> <span id="s1136">Of course, that was taken away from the general population, but the general population was so large, that the few privileged groups -- and it wasn’t privileged, was rewarded appropriately, larger por -- rations.</span> <span id="s1137">But it did not impact tremendously.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: You don’t think it impacted the general population very much?</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: Not much was taken away from all the thousands of the regular population to feed the few -- to improve the ration of the children and the -- those who have hard -- performed hard labor.</span> <span id="s1140">So at -- this way I was hopping from one barrack to another, trying to get the most capable person to stay behind and run it, all while I was 18 - 18 and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: Did you feel --</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: Important?</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: -- important, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: No.</span> <span id="s1147">I -- I don’t think -- I liked to do that.</span> <span id="s1148">I felt good having a responsibility.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: Being trusted and so, yeah, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: Did -- did you have contact with the Council of the el -- Elders, with Schliesser, after you got there?</span> <span id="s1152">Was there meet -- for instance, a meeting?</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: It -- it -- not -- really not, really not.</span> <span id="s1154">He had his jobs to do, and I did mine, and there was no -- he did -- except those, as I said, the instructions as to portion size for the kids, and then the decision to create a kit -- a children’s kitchen and a diet kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: What does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A: What does that mean?</span> <span id="s1157">That was maybe in the small -- I think it was a p-previous restaurant in -- for the civilians of the -- the kitchen was then, for people who had diabetes or gall bladder or stuff, to give more of one item that they can have, and less of something that would be harmful to them.</span> <span id="s1158">You know, a -- a diet within the framework of availability.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: So give me an idea of the kind of food people will have for breakfast, and then for lunch or dinner.</span> <span id="s1160">And I’m assuming now, given your explanation, that most people in the general population, 90 percent or 95 percent of the population, is eating out of these big kitchens.</span> <span id="s1161">Very few people have apartments and cook for themselves, am I correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: That was only very later, and -- and these were only some of the privileged people --</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: -- who had connections to get a room in one of those -- where the -- where the town population was living, they got one room per family, and they had a little kerosene cooker, or so, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: So would you say it was 10 percent of the population --</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: No, much less.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: -- or less -- much less than that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: Much less.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1170">So everybody’s lining up for whatever they’re going to eat, in their -- in their barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A: In the -- except in the -- I -- even -- even in the days when it was snowing, from those kettles the food was transferred into barrels, taken out and in the yard, served.</span> <span id="s1172">And lines were forming, and the -- very soon they made not ration tickets, but meal tickets, which they were printed there somewhere, and all the days of the month on it, and there was one person, called ordnungs Dienst, somebody who kept order with the band, armband, and it’s not a s -- what do you call it, it’s -- made holes into these --</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">A: -- tickets, showing that the person was already there, and to reject him if he came a second time.</span> <span id="s1175">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: So if you lost this ticket, you were in big trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1178">I don’t know what -- what they did if -- they wouldn’t let them starve, but I don’t know what the -- could be only for that month that he was starving, but I -- I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: This -- this organizational part, I -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1181">I didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: And everyone who had a ticket would get something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: Now if the person with the ladle at the barrel was your friend, you had a chance to get like -- you came with a bigger container, and he may give you two ladles full, or may reach lower down to get you some of the sm -- more of the solids.</span> <span id="s1186">This is something that has developed -- you know, a barter system has developed.</span> <span id="s1187">There was no money, so everyone -- it may not sound nice, but that’s what happened, everyone who had access to something, like the carpenter had access to wood, the cook had access to food, there were workshops where they worked for the Germans, so s -- that was a mitzvah to steal from the Germans.</span> <span id="s1188">The other was a little less colorful.</span> <span id="s1189">The cooks were expected to give their family little more, but it was not ethical to steal more and get from a carpenter a shelf, where you put up your shaving stuff, you know?</span> <span id="s1190">Or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: But -- but it happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1193">And it happened in -- in every single department.</span> <span id="s1194">And what is even less ethical was that only those families who had someone involved in -- in one of those trades where you could schleusse something, that was called also, to -- th-they didn’t say steal, they said to schleusse it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: That means what?</span> <span id="s1196">To channel it?</span> <span id="s1197">To -- to go from one person to another?</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">A: To -- yeah, in Auschwitz, it was called organizing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: And here was called, to swipe, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1201">So there was -- there were -- were different categories and levels of -- of f-feeding, and -- and access to the -- you know, you got someone working in the -- in the clothes warehouse, where the clothes was that was either confiscated upon arrival, or if someone died who didn’t have a family, who wanted to retain the goods, went to the warehouse.</span> <span id="s1202">The Germans sent this to Germany for their own people, they needed it, or -- while they were at war so long.</span> <span id="s1203">So if somebody stole their something [indecipherable] so where, everywhere somebody had something that somebody else wanted, he bartered for or something he wanted or needed, or didn’t need, but got it anyway.</span> <span id="s1204">Cigarettes were the most valuable barter item.</span> <span id="s1205">The Germans didn’t know how well they mean to the Jews when they forbid them to smoke.</span> <span id="s1206">Otherwise they would have brought in a lot of cigarettes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: So how did you get cigarettes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: Si -- through some of these good gendarmes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Q: The Czech gendarmes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">A: You pay them, and some did it even without paying.</span> <span id="s1211">They contacted your family in Prague, and the aunt or whoever, came to the gendarmes home, who lived nearby, delivered the stuff, and he brought it in, and you pick it up at the gate, or so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: And why would they do that?</span> <span id="s1213">Were they getting paid also [indecipherable] bribe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: Some did it for payment, and some did it just out of good heart.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: And did cigarettes then become sort of currency inside the ghetto, if you had it, you could then --</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: The -- the most valuable currency.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: And there were people who gave up their food in Auschwitz, people died because they -- the meager ration they gave for a cigarette.</span> <span id="s1219">Couldn’t stop smoki --</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: And this was both men and women, as far as you know?</span> <span id="s1221">Or more men than women?</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">A: I -- not many women were smoking, I -- I -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1223">I couldn’t -- I don’t know about women, but I know men.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: Men.</span> <span id="s1225">So what -- do you know what might have been the -- the -- the biggest currency for women in terms of this bartering system, or y -- or you don’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: I don’t think it was lipstick, but I -- I -- I -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1227">Maybe my wife will be able to tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1229">Well, we’ll ask her tomorrow.</span> <span id="s1230">So would you consider this a kind of black market system as well, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: Just barter -- barter --</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: Just bartering.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A: -- barter economy.</span> <span id="s1234">Bartered with -- with whatever you had, you brought with you, and didn’t use it, and somebody else wanted it.</span> <span id="s1235">All things that you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: -- disappropriated somewhere where you had access to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">Q: Did you smoke?</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: I don’t remember in which grade, kids dragged me into the bathroom in school, I was a young kid still, and gave me a puff of a cigarette, and I coughed so much that I never touched it again.</span> <span id="s1242">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Q: So did that mean that you didn’t have access, or did you sometimes get cigarettes and use it to get other things?</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">A: No, I never got cigarettes, and I never -- I -- I had the -- I had some of the food that I could use, and I tell you how I used it.</span> <span id="s1245">We are already far ahead, and I wanted also to bring out my -- the initi -- the beginning and impact of Schacter on the whole camp, and on me personally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q: Well, we will do that.</span> <span id="s1247">I -- I still wanted to stay with the kitchens for a little bit, if that was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: Yeah, no, but that started -- he came in December of ’41, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">Q: So just a few weeks after you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A: -- we did -- we didn’t have to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1252">Am I correct to say that your first roommate was a lawyer of some kind?</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: Introduced you to various people.</span> <span id="s1255">Was there a lawyer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">A: How do -- yeah, yeah, how do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">Q: There was an interview that you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">A: You -- you have your own --</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">Q: Spies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">A: -- Intelligence network?</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1262">I think we have to stop the tape, but we’re going to start --</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: I couldn’t find anybody of his family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: His wife was a little bit taking advantage.</span> <span id="s1266">She -- she bartered with -- with giving favors to men.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1268">All right, we’ll stop the tape now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">End of Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Tape #5</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: Edgar, before we get on to your roommates, and -- and your relationship with Schacter, I wanted to ask you about what kind of food was -- was served.</span> <span id="s1272">I mean, it’s a little overwhelming for anybody to think of thousands of people being cooked for, under these conditions especially.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">A: That’s why I tried to introduce Schacter, because we have something in common.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: [coughs] Sorry.</span> <span id="s1276">He -- I consider him a psychologist without a certificate, or without a diploma.</span> <span id="s1277">He recognized the -- and I’ll come to your question --</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: -- he recognized immediately upon his arrival, the -- that the prison mentality can sink into the people’s mind.</span> <span id="s1280">That when he came, when the gates were still closed, and he got everybody together and encouraged them to sing.</span> <span id="s1281">And most of the songs were Czech popular songs, which most of people knew.</span> <span id="s1282">And it had a tremendous impact on everybody, not just during the time you were singing, and gathers others who were not singing, were sitting there and listening, to the point that not just that hour, hour and a half, you forgot every -- that the reality of your actual circumstances, but you took with you a little bit of -- like a care package, a -- a spiritual care package to help you carry on i-in -- for the -- until the next time when we sing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Q: So this was -- he did this in the Sudeten barrack when you first came --</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A: The Sudeten in the basement, and not only that, I mentioned to you that the gates were closed, and the women were in another barracks.</span> <span id="s1285">I don’t know how he managed, he appeared in the women’s barracks, and did the same with the women, with the same beneficial impact.</span> <span id="s1286">So I -- why I represented him before answering your question, I knew that the Czechs lived through their stomach.</span> <span id="s1287">Even now, this family, when they come to visit, the sister-in-law and the nephews and nieces, food is so meaningful, they come into the house, and they go right, pick up the covers of the pots and -- and then pinch here, and pinch there.</span> <span id="s1288">I tried with those ingredients we had, to make food that’s mainly a Czech -- Czech food.</span> <span id="s1289">Dumplings -- we had flour.</span> <span id="s1290">I don’t know how, on my request, yeast came into the camp, and we made dumplings, and from this so-called coffee, that was a dark grain, nothing to do with coffee, but it was dark and looked like it, and we cooked it, and let it cool, and at the right temperature, if you put in some margarine and whipped it, it didn’t dissolve completely, and it -- you know it didn’t melt.</span> <span id="s1291">It stayed like little dots of mar -- people thought that’s the best sauce on a dumpling they ever ate.</span> <span id="s1292">And some people asked after the war, said, could you make it for me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">A: So this -- in this way I tried to accommodate or improve their mental state with providing food that is close to the Czech stomach.</span> <span id="s1295">And I say Czech because these people were first Czechs, and then they were Jews, then they were -- if not they, then somebody else made them aware that they are Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: So in this way I mention Schacter first, because in his way he did work on the Czech mind, and I worked on the Czech stomachs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: But I -- I’m still not completely clear on once the kitchens were going in all the different barracks, and I assume that all the barracks had their own kitchen, am I correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1300">And then there was -- and from the nearby neighborhood of those houses where the origin population lived, nearest to each barrack, those people were designated to this particular barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: Right, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: And then the further -- located further away, for those -- sorry, for those a kitchen was built in -- on the main road, and that was only to be delivered to another location, central location where those able of walking could come to.</span> <span id="s1303">And from that kitchen also, the ones who couldn’t come were supplied like meals on wheels, Terezín style.</span> <span id="s1304">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">Q: You mean, the elderly who couldn’t go --</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: -- or the people who were disabled, who couldn’t go.</span> <span id="s1308">So d-do you think people starved in Terezín?</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: Those who had no connection to, or anything to barter with, or had something but were in the attic and couldn’t get down and mingle, those really -- it was -- it’s not starving on the street falling down, but they, of malnutrition, lack of vitamins and -- and s -- lack of appropriate amounts of food, even if it wasn’t the right food, caused them to -- made them susceptible to diseases and we had the best doctors, all the doctors were there.</span> <span id="s1310">There was a operating room that was brought in from a Jewish hospital in Prague.</span> <span id="s1311">And if you only need a doctor’s attention, you had the best attention, but if you needed medication, you were [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1312">I had my hernia operated there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">A: And ne -- didn’t need anything else except a surgeon’s intervention.</span> <span id="s1315">And I healed, and that was okay.</span> <span id="s1316">But if you had something, I don’t know, asthma, that they gave you -- inhale some vapors, hot water or so, hot water vapors, but there was really no medication that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q: Did they put you -- they must have put you to sleep with something, did they have ether?</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A: I think -- yeah, it was, it was ether.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">Q: But no painkillers for after?</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">A: No.</span> <span id="s1321">I didn’t any.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Q: You didn’t need it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">Q: So there were not people who were lying dead on the street, the way they were in other -- in other ghettos, as far as you knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1326">That -- they were dying in the -- in that -- in the infirmary, or -- or where they lived, but it was maybe not direct starving, but starvation induced susceptibility to diseases which put them in pneumonia.</span> <span id="s1327">Dysentery -- dysentery killed the most people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">Q: But you have very few toilets.</span> <span id="s1329">You had th -- at the -- as far as I know, at one time the most was about 50,000 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">Q: But there’s something like 900 or a thousand toilets available.</span> <span id="s1332">So most people --</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">A: I don’t -- I don’t think there were that many.</span> <span id="s1334">Th -- in the barracks --</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: You think there were fewer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A: -- in the barracks -- in the military barracks were not latrines, but the soldiers had there a wall of urinals, and then what do you call it, those booth or separations with a toilet.</span> <span id="s1337">And there were people standing in line.</span> <span id="s1338">In some areas, where it was necessary, some latrines were built.</span> <span id="s1339">And I don’t know how they were emptied, and the stuff carried away, or sanitized I think, with some -- some carc -- it’s calcium, but it’s not calcium like you take for your bones, it’s -- I don’t know how it is particular --</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: Lime, of some --</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: L-Lime.</span> <span id="s1342">Oh, isn’t she wonderful, lime.</span> <span id="s1343">What would I do without you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: So -- but still, it was dysenter -- Hana’s grandparents, both of them -- no, was grandmother and -- and this brother of her grandfather came, he -- he was 80 years old and he worked as a lumberjack, he was splitting wood for the -- starting the fires in those kettles.</span> <span id="s1346">And there was a [indecipherable] six weeks later he was gone, with diarrhea -- the dysentery.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Q: Because they had nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">A: Dehydration, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q: Now, access to water also, was -- was very difficult, yes?</span> <span id="s1350">People couldn’t wash easily, or -- and drink water, or am I [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">A: I don’t know how -- you know, in those houses and apartments of the town population, these were not apartments with two or three bathrooms that -- nobody had two bathrooms except some super rich people in their villas.</span> <span id="s1352">But here, they -- they must have had -- possibly, problems.</span> <span id="s1353">But in the military barracks, there were these -- was these rows of one huge trough or two in the middle of pipe, water pipe, with --</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">Q: With faucets?</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">A: -- with faucets along.</span> <span id="s1356">And I have a picture at home of one of those ladies’ washrooms.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: So Hannover had it?</span> <span id="s1358">Sudeten?</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">A: All the bar -- all the barracks --</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: [indecipherable] they all had it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: -- all the military barracks had washrooms.</span> <span id="s1362">But cold water only.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: Which in winter was not very pleasant, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q: When you said that you had -- your first roommate was a lawyer, I don’t know what his name was, what does that mean when you say roommate?</span> <span id="s1366">Were you actually living in a -- in a separate room?</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">A: I told you I was a big shot.</span> <span id="s1368">In eight -- with 18 or 19 years, and I had -- and I don’t know how and where I got it.</span> <span id="s1369">Could be -- it could have been a part of barter result that some carpenter put a -- a few boards up, separated a bigger -- a smaller room from the rest of the big room, and his wife -- in the Hamburger was a jail for women.</span> <span id="s1370">I didn’t mention yet that there was a -- the gendarmes was -- were watching outside, and inside was a ghetto police, established by the Council of Elders and they looked like -- under the cap and the -- and the yellow armband identifying them as a police.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: Were they in uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">A: They had some -- they wore black -- I don’t know, but everyone had exactly the same.</span> <span id="s1373">But you could recognize that he’s of the police formation.</span> <span id="s1374">The -- how did we get to the police?</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: Well, I’m asking you about the lawyer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: The lawyer, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q: So internally there’s -- there’s ghetto police, and his wife --</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: -- okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Q: -- you said something --</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">A: That’s from the wife we came to the police.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">Q: But also you said something about the wife in the last tape.</span> <span id="s1382">Which was that she seemed to have slept around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">A: Did I say that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">Q: Well, you didn’t use those words, but that’s what you were implying.</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">A: Yeah, okay.</span> <span id="s1386">This is how she -- I think this is how she got the -- either head of the -- the jail mistress, or chai -- jail warden in the Dresner.</span> <span id="s1387">And the jail was the -- when -- it was used by the military, the barracks, there was a guard room, and there was another room where they rested if they -- between shifts, or between the guard duties.</span> <span id="s1388">And there was a -- they put up a [indecipherable] and there was a temporary holding jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: For women?</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: For women.</span> <span id="s1391">And I don’t know why women were being --</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q: You don’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A: -- jailed.</span> <span id="s1394">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">A: My mother was jailed, but that was by the Germans.</span> <span id="s1397">And that was in the Kommandatur, which was in a bank building and down where the vaults were, they had the jails.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">Q: But in male barracks they would also have jails for Jewish men, if they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">A: I think so, I -- I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">A: -- held in one at the moment of weakness.</span> <span id="s1402">I -- just for the short time we know each other you must know I’m a very easy going person.</span> <span id="s1403">And I -- I have tremendous amount of patience.</span> <span id="s1404">But when it comes to the point where I can no longer be patient, I can be a murderer.</span> <span id="s1405">I can kill.</span> <span id="s1406">So, I -- I totally lose presence of mind, and just instinct.</span> <span id="s1407">There were two very young SS men, they would de -- everybody called them kindergarten.</span> <span id="s1408">And they were driving the tractors that were pulling the -- the heavy loads, so they were -- because the Jews, they didn’t want to entrust a Jew, that distracts the Jews.</span> <span id="s1409">And one day they come in front of the Hamburger.</span> <span id="s1410">There’s an old man going, and one of them -- I -- he didn’t see them, he didn’t take his hat off, or whatever, and they went in and started to unload on him, with hitting.</span> <span id="s1411">I went with a friend, I tore loose, and I knocked them both down to the ground.</span> <span id="s1412">A normal person wouldn’t do that, but that’s the condition I get in when it snaps.</span> <span id="s1413">And they started to shoot, but they were drunk, and it didn’t help.</span> <span id="s1414">So they get the police, grab me in, pull me into their guard room, and the other guy went to the head of the Council of Elders to tell him about it.</span> <span id="s1415">And he cleaned it up, because those two were drunk and shouldn’t have been there.</span> <span id="s1416">So somehow I got away.</span> <span id="s1417">I don’t know how, because nobody attacks SS men unpunished.</span> <span id="s1418">So you asked the jail, and I went to sideways in saying I was in there.</span> <span id="s1419">So he was -- he knew about it and he suffered by it, and we consoled each other.</span> <span id="s1420">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">Q: Let me -- I -- I said something s -- a little bit coarsely, and I didn’t mean to say it that way, when I said that this lawyer’s wife was -- was sleeping around.</span> <span id="s1422">And what I really mean to ask --</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">A: But that’s another way of saying it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">Q: It is another way, but I -- but I think it’s a more s -- s -- it’s more serious than that.</span> <span id="s1425">You know, when you were saying that men were smoking, so they could easily use cigarettes as a way to barter, is it possible that women had a currency that became very significant in Theresienstadt, namely sex.</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">A: Could have been there, not many, but under those conditions, and not knowing transports have -- were lea -- were leaving, and you don’t know where they go, or -- or what’s happening.</span> <span id="s1427">So the level of morality sank a little, and people wanted to enjoy as much as they could, and as long as they could.</span> <span id="s1428">And you did not have to be in love just to perform and enjoy.</span> <span id="s1429">So I don’t know whether, or how many, if so, would have used this as a currency.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">Q: But in any way it’s very complicated, because for some -- for some people, their life force is such that before they die, they want to have affection, and sex.</span> <span id="s1431">For others it may be using it as a currency, it would be hard to know [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">A: I think most of it was just sex.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">Q: For itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">A: As long as -- as long as you’re here, you know you -- there are some certain rooms, or you had the roommate, you tell him get out of here, and so -- but I think it was very little.</span> <span id="s1435">Well, there were young people who -- who -- Hana’s sister got -- Hana’s brother made a very serious acquaintance, and before -- on the day he was deported, in the morning, he married this girl.</span> <span id="s1436">So there’s a chance that they -- they can go together and she wouldn’t -- her supervisor wouldn’t let her go, because she worked in the agriculture, which was bringing in harvest for the Germans.</span> <span id="s1437">The agriculture was not for the ghetto, that was for the Germans.</span> <span id="s1438">So the -- these are the -- sure, there were instances where people fell in love with each other, or shared the -- the sorrow, which then became bearable through nice companionship.</span> <span id="s1439">But there was also just this free -- free life before.</span> <span id="s1440">It may not be again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">Q: Was this shocking to you at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">A: No, it was enlightening to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">Q: It was enlightening to you.</span> <span id="s1444">True, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Q: Yeah, yeah -- you -- you mean that, this is not just a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1449">So this was a learning experience in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">A: You’re asking too many questions, I already my --</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">Q: That’s my job</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">A: -- I had already my apprenticeship before I went to -- to Terezín.</span> <span id="s1453">But there, yes, and it was not the barter, it was mutual drive to enjoy as much as possible --</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">A: -- under the given circumstances, which were not very enjoyable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1457">Did -- do you think that people in Terezín after ’40 -- after ’42, when -- there must be rumors of what’s going on, at least, that people have a sense that if they’re sent, they’re not going to return?</span> <span id="s1458">Y -- I mean, and are people afraid, or they s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">A: They may not return to Terezín --</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">A: -- but they may go to another camp and build, and -- and create a new ghetto, or a new labor -- labor camp, and -- and the Germans kept this ver -- that was the best kept secret.</span> <span id="s1462">For instance, they ordered, for one time, a thousand men, age 18 to 55, but only men t- transport, that they go somewhere to build a new labor camp.</span> <span id="s1463">And the next transport, the wives of those men were encouraged to volunteer so they can be with their men, and they’re never -- they were never together, because in Auschwitz, the men went one side, the women the other, and there were men who went to the right and to the left, and women who went to the right and the left.</span> <span id="s1464">So they never were together again.</span> <span id="s1465">But it gave an impression in the ghetto that they go somewhere, and they going to be together, and it’s not so bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">Q: So i -- in -- at the end of ’41 - ’42 - ’43, you have no suspicion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">A: Nobody had, even afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">Q: No -- afterw --</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">A: And when -- when the train opened in Auschwitz, and I saw what Arbeit macht frei in Auschwitz, I still did not believe what it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">A: I think we’ll get there in -- in more detail --</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">A: -- when --</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">A: -- when we get to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1477">So this lawyer, you remember his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">Q: What is his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">A: His name was Otto Freund.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">Q: Freund?</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">A: Freund was a friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">A: And he -- already, before he came to Terezín, he Czechisized it because he thought he will function better as a lawyer under a Czech name, and spelled it f-a -- F-r-a-j-t, Frajt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">A: Frajt.</span> <span id="s1487">That’s a -- that’s not a Jewish name, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">Q: And what kind of a guy was he, was he --</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: What kind of a person was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: A very nice, mild mannered, wonderful guy.</span> <span id="s1492">And I think he suffered knowing what’s happening with his wife, and I think he had no influence, or didn’t want to interfere.</span> <span id="s1493">He just [indecipherable] tolerated it, and he didn’t come back, and I inquired after the war if there are any relatives of his, and couldn’t find anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: And is it the case that he knew artists and musicians and that he introduced you to these people, or is that not a connection?</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">A: This was parallel.</span> <span id="s1496">He knew some, and also I have recognized that the -- through him, that those -- first the artists, the painters, and then about the musicians, that they had a job assigned during the day, the artists were in -- there was a technical office, technical bureau where the artists drew the blueprints for the engineers and the -- the technicians, and made poster f -- propaganda posters for the Germans.</span> <span id="s1497">And in -- at night, they were drawing the -- making the drawings of the real life in Terezín, which you may have seen -- mainly there’s a book, and more books than one.</span> <span id="s1498">And they smuggled some of that through these gendarmes.</span> <span id="s1499">And there was also, in the agriculture department, they had horses that were drawing -- pulling the -- the carts, and the horses produced manure, and they took that manure out, and underneath, they smuggled out letters, and -- and these posters, and so -- so some of those, I don’t know which way they went out, and some were found in Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">Q: And these were taken out by the sh -- the Czech gendarmes, knowingly?</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">A: No, I -- no, the -- the Germans found those in Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">A: And of course, all the painters were immediately arrested.</span> <span id="s1504">Some wound on -- wound up on the small fortress, and some went directly to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1505">And only one of them survived, it was Haas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">Q: Leo Haas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">A: Leo Haas --</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">A: -- and I don’t know that Fritta had this three year old child with him, on the small fortress.</span> <span id="s1510">He was then deported from the fortress, and his wife died inside, from illness, at the fortress, and Haas and his wife took care of this three year old boy, and I don’t know how, in the small fortress, a boy could survive.</span> <span id="s1511">Anyway -- and he calls himself Tomas Haas Fritta.</span> <span id="s1512">Not even frit -- not even Dalzig, Fritta.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: Uh-huh, takes the first name, the first nickname.</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">A: Fritta --</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: No, Fritta’s the last name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">A: Fritta was Fritz Dalzig, and he signed his drawings as Fritta.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">Q: Yeah, Fritta.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">A: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">Q: And that was called the painter’s affair, when they were arrested, is that not [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">A: Yup.</span> <span id="s1521">And Haas survived, because they recognized his capabilities, that can be utilized in a workshop, where counterfeit American and British money was printed, with which the Germans paid their spies in those countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1523">We’re going to have to stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">A: Yeah, I know, I saw --</span></p> <p><span

what’s his first name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">A: Otto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">Q: Otto Frajt.</span> <span id="s1531">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">A: Truly Czech it’s Ota.</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">Q: Ota?</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">A: O-t-a.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">Q: O-t-a.</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">A: Otto in Czech is O-t-a.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1538">So he, as an older person, cause he’s an established lawyer, can introduce you to some of the people who were artists and painters, who were working -- and they were working in Magdeburg, am I correct?</span> <span id="s1539">Is that where they’re --</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A: There was -- some was in Magdeburg, but there was -- also was a technical office -- I’ve never seen it, that was not in a barrack, that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: I -- I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: -- or it was a -- a specially constructed building, I’m not sure that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">Q: But is it -- is it through him that you met these --</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">A: Through him de -- I found out that these people actually doing double duty, and the second duty was even a more important one than the first one.</span> <span id="s1547">So I stealed some extra food to them.</span> <span id="s1548">And this is how we established a relationship, and I still don’t want to create an idea that they were crazy about me, because I was nobody compared to them, these were established people.</span> <span id="s1549">That it could have been because of giving them some extra food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">Q: And why did you decide to give them extra food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">A: Because a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">Q: Because of what they were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">A: -- the hard laborers got extra, the kids got extra, and there were people coming home from --from their eight or nine or 10 hours job, and sit down and started to draw till late into the night, what I thought was important material for the future.</span> <span id="s1554">And I didn’t know even that it’s being exported.</span> <span id="s1555">So I had some -- as I said, sa -- additional emergency rations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">Q: And did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">A: And through Schacter I met the composers.</span> <span id="s1558">So I did the same for them, because they were sitting at night, and composing, writing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">Q: Did you bring the food to the painters and to the composers, yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">Q: And -- and this was dangerous for you, if you were caught.</span> <span id="s1562">Am I right, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">A: I -- I don’t think it -- it would have messed up -- would have messed me up, but it wasn’t dangerous, because the Germans were not inside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1564">There were no guards inside, except for those dru -- two drunk kids.</span> <span id="s1565">But -- and there were no gendarmes inside, just the ghetto police.</span> <span id="s1566">And they didn’t suspect, or -- you carry something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">Q: So they wouldn’t necessarily have checked anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1569">It wasn’t dangerous what I did, it was, I said, maybe inappropriate from the general point of view, favoring some individuals, but there were [indecipherable] six, seven painters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">Q: So would you -- you go to where they were working at night, and give them the food at night, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">A: Some of them were living at very close quarters, cause -- not far from one another, and yes, you we -- the answer is yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">Q: So you e --</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">A: The short answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">Q: It is.</span> <span id="s1575">But you’d go at night, would you cook the food special, or would you simply take what was already there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">A: No, no, no, that was -- that was stuff that -- that was -- I didn’t cook special.</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">Q: And would you stay --</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">A: There was nothing to cook special, there were only the big kettles, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1580">Would you stay with them, or would you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">A: Yeah, I -- there were evenings when I stayed with them, but most evenings I spent singing with Schacter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">Q: In the choir?</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">A: Yeah, we had almost every night the rehearsal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">Q: And was this almost from the beginning?</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">A: The -- from the beginning was the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">Q: When he came in December?</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">A: -- the singing in those basements after.</span> <span id="s1588">And then, after June ’42, when people could move freely, he assembled the men and the women together in the basement of the military headquarters near -- on the right of the church.</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">Q: Uh-huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">A: And that was during the day, a carpenter shop, and at night we put up some boards like this, and the choir stood there and was singing and rehearsing.</span> <span id="s1591">As soon as we could get together, he came up, he had one score of “The Bartered Bride,” as a very popular Czech opera, and started to study with us.</span> <span id="s1592">The singers had nothing to look at.</span> <span id="s1593">There was no written music, there were no way of copying, and no time to copy, and not enough qualified people to copy music.</span> <span id="s1594">So we learned by rote.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">Q: So would he sing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">Q: How -- how would you do it?</span> <span id="s1598">P -- there was a piano?</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">A: First there was a harmonium in -- there was a -- there were certain defi -- different de -- work details, one of them was movers who have moved heavy loads, really where they were needed, when on the town square, the tents and the barracks weren’t up, where more industry roo -- projects were [indecipherable] production was kept.</span> <span id="s1600">So these people were carrying, then loading the trucks with the stuff that was assembled.</span> <span id="s1601">And they were also moving the German -- for the Germans when they -- when some was called off, and the new officer came, the SS or so.</span> <span id="s1602">He was mo -- they were moving their furniture and the luggage, and so.</span> <span id="s1603">And they discovered somewhere in the room, a old harmonium.</span> <span id="s1604">So one night they, when it was dark, no moon, they brought the harmonium to that basement.</span> <span id="s1605">And first we were playing -- Schacter was playing the harmonium, and then they found a piano without legs, and also brought it in, and the carpenters made some legs.</span> <span id="s1606">Until they made the legs and fastened them, the piano was standing on three crates.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">Q: And this was a grand piano?</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1610">What’s a harmonium?</span> <span id="s1611">What does it look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">A: Like a -- like a -- we call it in church, the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">Q: Organ?</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">A: Organ.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">Q: A small --</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">A: A small organ, not with pipes, but you had to pump --</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">Q: With your feet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">A: -- the air --</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">A: -- into th -- the pipes were inside the harmonium.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">Q: We -- we -- let me go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s1622">Ho -- how was it that you met Schacter?</span> <span id="s1623">Did you meet him when he came into the Sudeten barrack?</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">A: No, I -- I was in the crowd of -- of all the others who went to sing with him, whom he encouraged to sing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">Q: And why did you do that?</span> <span id="s1626">You hadn’t had much singing as a kid.</span> <span id="s1627">What -- what --</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">A: I -- at the last three or four months in Prague, before I went to -- you know, this was a lunch job, this -- the Jewish communities had free evenings, first time.</span> <span id="s1629">I -- I joined a barbershop quartet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">A: As a bass.</span> <span id="s1632">And we were singing.</span> <span id="s1633">I don’t think we were singing for money, we were singing I think only for pleasure.</span> <span id="s1634">And so I liked singing, and so I definitely volunteered to participate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1636">But you had been singing more popular music, and now with Schacter, after the popular Czech songs, seeing “The Bartered Bride” --</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">A: Well “The Bartered Bride” is -- is a Czech popular opera --</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">A: -- and almost everybody knows certain parts of it, and it wasn’t difficult to learn the Czech.</span> <span id="s1640">I -- I had a good ear, and a good voice, so it wasn’t difficult to learn, once it was played in -- on the piano, to follow through on the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">Q: The -- the lead singers, were these -- there are a lot of professional artists, singers in Terezín, were the lead singers more professional people, people who [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">A: When you say lead singers, I don’t know what you mean.</span> <span id="s1643">There were -- there were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">Q: Soloists.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">A: -- soloists, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">Q: Soloists.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">A: They were from the Czech National Opera, and from the Vienna Opera, and later even from the Berlin opera.</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1649">So you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">A: They brought in German Jews as well, to Terezín.</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1652">So you were in the -- in the choir?</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">A: Yeah, only in the choir.</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">A: [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">Q: And what was he like in rehearsal?</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">A: Schacter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">A: Schacter is a -- was a lovable, pleasant person, until he sat behind the piano, then he became a tyrant.</span> <span id="s1660">You were not allowed to look at the guy next to you, or even at the girl next to you.</span> <span id="s1661">You were not allowed to whisper.</span> <span id="s1662">You had to focus on his eyes, because he was conducting with his eyes, the hands on the -- on the keys, and his eyes were directing the music.</span> <span id="s1663">And if he noticed you did -- you’re not attentive, if -- once he yelled at you, the second time he threw you out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">Q: So he --</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">A: And -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">Q: -- treated this very professionally?</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">A: -- and nee -- nobody minded it, everybody wanted to be part of it.</span> <span id="s1670">He did nev -- he never had to advertise, people were flocking to him, he had the luxury of auditioning peoples.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">Q: And w-was he auditioning people for the choir?</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">A: Yeah, for the choir, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">Q: So were there people with good voices in the choir, tha -- from what you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">A: Yeah, he -- he -- he makes sure you -- he had the unlimited amount of people were coming to him, who wanted to participate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">Q: And how many people ended up in the choir?</span> <span id="s1676">I know that there were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">A: I don’t know how many were doing these individual opera performances, but I know for the Requiem there were 150.</span> <span id="s1678">He started another Czech opera, and then when German Jews came, and these were -- the German Jews they were not -- there were very few young people, very few.</span> <span id="s1679">Very few young middle class, these were older, upper middle class, and then the -- the prominent ones, the old ones who fought in World War I, with whom the German played a cruel game.</span> <span id="s1680">They promised them -- or told them, leave everything here, your furniture, your money, your belongings, the -- the glass in the showcase.</span> <span id="s1681">We are bringing you to a spa where you will have no worry.</span> <span id="s1682">You will have maid service, and room service, and food service, and laundry service.</span> <span id="s1683">And these guys, after observing three or four or five years, how the Germans treat -- how the Nazis treated the German Jews in Germany, still believed the officer’s word.</span> <span id="s1684">The -- the reason that they came, at a time when the barracks, and the houses of the town population were already filled, and the only place for them was in the attics of the barracks.</span> <span id="s1685">They will put straw mattresses on the floor, and you can imagine the old people going down to the floor to lay down to sleep, and even worse to get up to sleep.</span> <span id="s1686">And if you have heard about it, older people have to go to the bathroom more often.</span> <span id="s1687">So first to get up, and then climb over -- I guess these mattresses were one next to the other, to accommodate as many as possible, climb over the people with a dim light, because the light was dim so the rest can sleep.</span> <span id="s1688">And go down a flight of stairs, and then still the bathroom was not next to the stairs, still go on.</span> <span id="s1689">And if they couldn’t hold it, I don’t have to describe you the hygienic and sanitary conditions that have developed, which contributed to the acce -- accelerated death rate.</span> <span id="s1690">And also, many of them lost will to live.</span> <span id="s1691">They were de -- they were deceived, heartbroken by the German officers and -- to whom they had so much trust.</span> <span id="s1692">And so many suicides among them, among the old people.</span> <span id="s1693">And then, as I said, quick deterioration through lack of sanitation and -- and cleanliness, and that was a very poor sight.</span> <span id="s1694">But Schacter immediately took his Czech Jews, and started to study “Marriage of Figaro,” for the same purpose, to pep up that -- those German prisoners.</span> <span id="s1695">And “Magic Flute,” and the Czech singers were s -- most of the Czechs spoke German, because not only at the -- at the border area, but most Czechs had frequent use for the German language.</span> <span id="s1696">So German was pretty used among the Czech Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">Q: And these were concert versions of the operas?</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">A: Concert versions, yeah -- no, no costumes, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">Q: [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1700">And what did you use when you performed?</span> <span id="s1701">Was that piano that had been given legs --</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">A: Just the piano.</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">Q: Just the piano.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">A: Just the piano.</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">Q: Now, I’m going to go off this topic for just a second, because you mentioned that the old German Jews often committed su -- many committed suicide.</span> <span id="s1706">How did they commit suicide?</span> <span id="s1707">Did they jump out of windows?</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">A: A window, yeah.</span> <span id="s1709">And some may have had the -- the -- taken a excessive dose of sleeping pills, or whatever they still brought with them.</span> <span id="s1710">They deteriorated a very rapid fa -- rate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">Q: Di -- wi -- I want to continue o-on your relationship and the work with Schacter, but I also wanted to ask you, there were -- there were orchestras in Terezín, there are composers, there are other conductors, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">Q: So that there is a lot going on.</span> <span id="s1714">Am I correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">A: How did it come about?</span> <span id="s1716">Now there is a -- a saying going around, and you must have heard it, that the Germans picked Theresienstadt as a town to show off with.</span> <span id="s1717">It wasn’t that way.</span> <span id="s1718">I mentioned it among other things in their hometown, they had to turn in their musical instruments, and some didn’t.</span> <span id="s1719">And some even had the chutzpah, people who will read this may know what that means, had the guts to bring those ins -- smuggle those instruments with i -- within those 110 pounds, instead of food and clothing, into Terezín, because they were so -- such ardent musicians, amateurs and professionals, who loved to play, and because everybody thought it’s going to be over in six months.</span> <span id="s1720">I spoke about the optimism.</span> <span id="s1721">When the six months were over, they gave themselves another six months.</span> <span id="s1722">So they played in attics, and in cellars, to stay in shape for when they come out, they should be in the same performance level as they came in.</span> <span id="s1723">And although there are no -- were no Germans in the ghetto, nothing escaped them, they found out.</span> <span id="s1724">And now a terrific fright and concern gripped everyone in the ghetto, because the Germans -- a few Germans kept all these thousands of Jews in check by imposing corrective punishment.</span> <span id="s1725">So what that means, were two kinds, either right away into the transport, with -- and these people were marked, when they were in the transport, in Auschwitz they know who they are, and they select them -- direct them to the appropriate side, punishing side, or the small fortress.</span> <span id="s1726">So nobody wanted to involve their wife, parents, children, siblings in such a punishment, so there was a big concern.</span> <span id="s1727">The head of the Council of Elders, Edelstein told the camp commander why -- I mean, not in this exact wording, I’m paraphrasing, why would you punish these few people?</span> <span id="s1728">Look at the amount of talent you have accumulated here, why don’t you think of a program where you can utilize them to show the world how well you treat the Jews?</span> <span id="s1729">That’s when this idea came into being.</span> <span id="s1730">It was not a preconceived idea with the Germans before the ghetto was created.</span> <span id="s1731">So not only were these Jews not punished, and could retain their instruments, more instruments were brought in from Prague, and before they determined how they are going to do -- show the world how well they treat the Jews, they already divide -- devised a beautification program in anticipation of that, and a free time activities department was created.</span> <span id="s1732">And in the frame of this orchestras -- jazz has just come to -- to Europe from United States, so we had a five member -- what is it called?</span> <span id="s1733">Ghetto swingers.</span> <span id="s1734">Ghetto swingers jazz team.</span> <span id="s1735">Then there were the two musicians who played in the café.</span> <span id="s1736">One of them was my cousin, the accordionist, he was a piano and accor -- but there he played the accordion, and one was a violinist.</span> <span id="s1737">And -- and other of the quartets, and unbelievable, not the Germans, and not the Council of Elders could have imagined what’s getting news there.</span> <span id="s1738">And not only music, there were theaters -- there were all the actors from -- from all these towns.</span> <span id="s1739">The theater, cabaret, those are very popular because they were throwing these verbal darts at the Germans, in Czech language.</span> <span id="s1740">Maybe some even in German, I don’t know about those.</span> <span id="s1741">And this was very uplifting, and very helping in -- in really reducing the anxieties of the life that was destined for us.</span> <span id="s1742">There were lectures.</span> <span id="s1743">There were 1240 lectures on different subjects.</span> <span id="s1744">This is based on the notes from that -- that they found from that free activity -- free time activity list, by professors, chemists, biologists, rabbis.</span> <span id="s1745">Nobody went to the temple, but they went there to listen to the rabbi.</span> <span id="s1746">And people who had no interest in chemistry and so, went to j -- just to get diversification, and -- and getting away from -- from this dread life of ghetto.</span> <span id="s1747">By the way, they called -- you know, Terezín in German is Theresienstadt, and the Nazis told these prominent people they go to Theresienbath, which is a Theresien spa.</span> <span id="s1748">I didn’t say it when we were on the subject.</span> <span id="s1749">So it is an unbe -- there was more -- more of these cultural activities per capita than in New York or -- or anywhere else, in a day.</span> <span id="s1750">And people after work went, and they -- they shortened their sleeping time, because they were not really strong with the -- with the food they were getting, and I don’t take blame for it.</span> <span id="s1751">I just did what was -- we had.</span> <span id="s1752">But it was -- it was unbelievable, it -- it was -- it grew like mushrooms after the rain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">Q: And was this -- when Schacter came in December and started those little choirs in the men’s barrack, and then the women’s barrack, was -- was that secret at that point, or that’s -- that was okay at that point?</span> <span id="s1754">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">A: Again, there were no Germans in the barracks, and the gendarmes were out at -- outside at the gate, and this was happening in the cellar after work.</span> <span id="s1756">I don’t think it was clandestine or illegal, it was just unofficial and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">Q: So that the permission that was gotten because Epstein said something to the Germans was to bring in the instruments?</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">A: That was only after it was decided that that’s a good idea, we’ll take advantage of it, and we divide -- deci -- devise a program that will help them to project them to the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">A: But I don’t understand, they had occupied all of Europe, America was across the Atlantic, why would they have to care to show a good report card with good behavior or good treatment of the Jews?</span> <span id="s1761">I -- that’s what I was thinking about, who -- for whom did they need this?</span> <span id="s1762">They were the masters of the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">Q: And all of this cultural activity, and intellectual activity started in 1942 as far as you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">A: End of ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">Q: End of ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">A: End of ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">Q: Now did you -- besides -- if -- if you were rehearsing as much as --</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">A: When you say that the -- that -- that [indecipherable] was happening before this okay by the Germans.</span> <span id="s1769">That was still not secret, but was not official.</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1771">And that was performed publicly before it was part of this other plan?</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">A: That was performed in that cellar, and then it was performed in that auditorium of that boy’s home that we circled there, next to the town’s square.</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1774">Did you also go to performances of other groups, as well as being in rehearsals, or did you [indecipherable] too much?</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">A: I -- I did, but not too many, because I was -- I -- I f -- I went to cabarets because that was really important to -- you know, when you are -- when you are under the -- somebody’s thumb, if you can play a trick on him, makes you happy.</span> <span id="s1776">So be -- being part of this -- this verbal dart throwing gave you even more an uplift than -- than -- than the singing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1778">Really?</span> <span id="s1779">Did you -- did you go to lectures?</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">Q: And did you go to chamber music, or the orchestra performances at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">Q: Do you remember anything about those performances?</span> <span id="s1786">What you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">A: No, I went most to piano recitals or sonatas.</span> <span id="s1788">The --</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">Q: The violin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">A: Pardon?</span> <span id="s1791">The violin and piano.</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">Q: And piano.</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">A: And there -- there were [indecipherable] Alice Sommer-Herz.</span> <span id="s1794">She still lives, she is 85 -- 95.</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">A: L-Lives in London.</span> <span id="s1797">And unfortunately lost a son who was a excellent cellist.</span> <span id="s1798">I seen him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">Q: And she was a violinist, or she was a pianist?</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">A: She piano.</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">Q: Pianist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">A: That -- that was -- that was also very uplifting.</span> <span id="s1803">And I think by that time they must have, with these all instruments, have -- one or two additional pianos came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1805">This is going to be an odd question.</span> <span id="s1806">Who tuned the pianos?</span> <span id="s1807">It’s one thing to tune a violin, you can tune it, but were the pianos tuned?</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">A: Oh, there were tuner --</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">Q: There were tuners there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">A: Yeah, the musicians themselves, Gideon Klein tuned our piano.</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1812">So they sounded -- they sounded good?</span> <span id="s1813">These were good pianos?</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">A: Yeah, there wasn’t -- not a -- a -- you know, it’s terrible when you get old, don’t get old.</span> <span id="s1815">What -- what happens to me is I had a perfect command of the English language without ever learning, just by hearing and reading.</span> <span id="s1816">And suddenly in the middle of the sentence, a word -- a simple, regular conversation word doesn’t come to mind.</span> <span id="s1817">And it comes up in Czech and in German, the only two languages I learned formally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">A: It’s a -- it’s embarrassing, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">Q: At least it comes up in some language.</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">A: Yeah, but you can’t explain it in Czech to an American.</span> <span id="s1822">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">Q: We have to stop and change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">End of Tape #6</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">Tape #7</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">Q: Edgar, when you were at rehearsals with -- with Schacter, did he rehearse the soloists separately, and then brought you together with the choir?</span> <span id="s1827">Do you have any recollection?</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">A: Yeah, yeah, no.</span> <span id="s1829">When -- when the choir was little progressed, then he tried the total ensemble, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">Q: So you would rehearse separately from the soloists?</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">Q: Did he --</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">A: They didn’t need as much rehearsing because they were professionals, they have sung these operas several times in their life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">Q: So you guys in the choir needed more rehearsal?</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">Q: But you weren’t singing as much as the -- n-not in these operas.</span> <span id="s1837">In the Requiem you sang more, as a choir than you did the operas.</span> <span id="s1838">Am I correct, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">A: Wherever the part of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">Q: Chorus.</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">A: -- choir comes up, we were singing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">Q: Did he ever kick anyone out because they were terrible?</span> <span id="s1845">Not because they were looking sideways --</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">A: Terrible at singing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">A: First of all he wouldn’t have -- if he had recognized it in the beginning, he would not have accepted person.</span> <span id="s1849">And which a -- which was cruel, because everyone deserved a little uplift.</span> <span id="s1850">But he let people be in during the rehearsals, and then for the performance he said, “You better go in the audience and watch.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1853">That -- that’s -- that’s as much as he did, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">Q: Did people get angry at that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">A: I’m sure they did --</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">Q: I bet they did --</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">A: I’m sure, yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">Q: -- they got angry, yeah.</span> <span id="s1859">But you -- you stayed for the performances?</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">Q: Did you have to get dressed in a particular way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">Q: You just came in whene -- the wa -- any way you were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">A: Then for the performances, you put on your best, and that was the best of the 110 pounds you had brought in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">Q: And you kept the 110 pounds of clothing, they weren’t taken away from you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">A: No, it wasn’t 110 pounds of clothing, there was food --</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">Q: Uh-huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">A: -- and there was bedding, and there was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">A: -- other things, shaving, and it -- whatever I brought, I -- I had with me, whatever wasn’t worn out, so I still had with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">Q: I just realized something.</span> <span id="s1872">So you could bring in shaving cream --</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">Q: -- you could bring in soap, which --</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">A: But what did you do when it ran out?</span> <span id="s1876">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">Q: -- but at some point it ran out, yeah, what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">A: So you were shaving just -- soap -- somehow we had soap, I don’t -- I think there was a issue, or issuing of soap.</span> <span id="s1879">As I told you, I don’t remember many details.</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">A: So you f -- you use regular soap just so the razor slides better, and I was shaving at that time with a straight razor.</span> <span id="s1882">I didn’t have a -- there were -- there were these Gillette double bladed razors, but I remember I was shaving with a straight razor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">Q: And toothpaste?</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">Q: Toothpaste?</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">A: Toothpaste wasn’t important, a toothbrush was important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">Q: Did you brush your teeth every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">A: Was kissing, so I had to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">Q: And how did you keep clean with cold water?</span> <span id="s1892">Did you wash with cold water?</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">A: It was disagreeable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1894">Q: It was di --</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">A: No, I -- I wash --</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">Q: And -- and you -- and you washed your clothes, or was there laundry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">A: There was a military laundry, and my mother, I mentioned, came three weeks after me, and first -- her first job was in a cleaning detail with buckets, and brushes and they were cleaning rooms in the children’s home, and in the offices, and I don’t know where -- where else, where cleaning was necessary, and where the regular inhabitants did not clean.</span> <span id="s1898">So -- and then she was in the laundry detail that was outside of town, that was on the way to the small fortress, was a military laundry from -- used by the military before.</span> <span id="s1899">And once a month you could put all your dirty stuff in a bag, marked, and give to them, and you got it two, three days back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1902">And again I had an advantage my stuff could be washed more often, because my mother took the bag, and I believe she --</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">Q: They actually have hot water there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">A: I tell you exactly, I have no idea.</span> <span id="s1905">I’m sure they did because there was central steam coming from somewhere.</span> <span id="s1906">I’m sure they did, a militar -- today they wash in cold water so the stuff doesn’t shrink or bleed, but at that time, things were washed in hot water.</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">Q: Now, it sounds odd to have thousands and thousands of people giving their clothes in this ghetto, to a central laundry.</span> <span id="s1908">Doesn’t it seem --</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">A: Everyone had it in a bag, and it wasn’t taken out of the bag, it was washed in the bag.</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">Q: In the bag?</span></p> <p><span id="s1911">A: In the bag.</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">Q: And you got it back wet?</span> <span id="s1913">When you got it back -- do you have any idea how the people dried their clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">A: You better ask my wife, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1915">I never --</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">Q: You never hung anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">A: I never had to hang that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">Q: Huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">A: I don’t know, actually my stuff my mother brought, and I don’t know whether she hung it somewhere, or whether she -- she was a very fussy lady.</span> <span id="s1920">At home I remember when I went for vacation to her siblings, they were -- one day they were s-soaking, the next day they were boiling the stuff, the third day they were washing.</span> <span id="s1921">And then it was washed, they took it down to the beach -- to the river, spread it out on the lawn and let it bleach in the sun.</span> <span id="s1922">And when it was dry they made it wet again so it can bleach some more.</span> <span id="s1923">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">Q: Lot of work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">A: Lot of work.</span> <span id="s1926">And when she came to visit and our kids in the white socks ran around without shoes, the bottom, the sole was gray, even coming out from the washer.</span> <span id="s1927">She said, “You see?</span> <span id="s1928">These machines are no good, you have to wash by hand.”</span> <span id="s1929">So she took the socks and started to wash them in soap.</span> <span id="s1930">They didn’t come out totally white, but she said, “You see?</span> <span id="s1931">This is how it’s supposed to look.”</span> <span id="s1932">What an old fashioned girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s1933">Q: Let’s talk about your --</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">A: We should talk about my mother, she’s more interesting than I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">Q: Yes, yes, no.</span> <span id="s1936">I -- no, I want to talk about your mother, and they we’ll get back to the -- the -- the music.</span> <span id="s1937">Your parents come a few weeks after you come, right, three weeks, am I right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">A: Three weeks.</span> <span id="s1939">And I was standing on the main street with a -- right in front of the church when she walked by and she looked at me like said, did you see what you get us into?</span> <span id="s1940">You know, I read it on her looks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">Q: And she thought that you had brought her there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">A: No, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1943">Q: It was -- but because they were keeping families together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">A: They might have -- no, because if I wouldn’t have volunteered, they might have still been there, at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1946">And you too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">A: Ye -- yeah.</span> <span id="s1948">She didn’t say, but I could read it on the looks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1949">Q: And where did they live when they first came?</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">A: Mother went to Dresner, and Father went to the Hannover.</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">A: It was already opened at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1954">And your father is about how old at this point, in his 60’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">A: He was 64 when he went in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">A: 60 -- 60 -- yeah, 64 and a half, 64.</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">Q: And your mother is 18 years younger.</span> <span id="s1959">Do they both get work right away?</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">A: He got a job, I don’t know how he discharged it, peeling potatoes.</span> <span id="s1961">It was a sitting job, and these potatoes were stolen from the pigs, because half of them were rotten.</span> <span id="s1962">They had not only to peel them, they had to cut away all the rotten part.</span> <span id="s1963">But if you were hungry you could eat the [indecipherable] and you had some -- filled your stomach.</span> <span id="s1964">So it was a good job for -- for some of the people.</span> <span id="s1965">I don’t know how he got it, I had no influence in that.</span> <span id="s1966">But he -- he wasn’t very happy with the whole situation.</span> <span id="s1967">He -- he sat at home, when he retired from working, and after the war, until he went to bed, he sat at home in the living room, with reading, with a tie, jacket and shoes on.</span> <span id="s1968">He would not make himself comfortable.</span> <span id="s1969">He always had to be presentable.</span> <span id="s1970">So for him this life was -- was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">Q: Was really awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">A: -- was very tough.</span> <span id="s1973">And Mother, again, did the best under the circumstances, and as I said, she even once was jailed, and -- by the Germans, because the woman from the upper bed had something she shouldn’t have had, or some contraband under the bed, and Mother was on the lowest bed, so she was suspected of -- of is -- that being hers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">Q: Okay, we have -- I’m sorry, I have to interrupt you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">A: That’s a short one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">Q: Sorry for the interruption.</span> <span id="s1977">Y-You were talking about your mother being arrested because the -- her bunkmate, the third tier, had contraband?</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">A: Had some contraband underneath, and it was thought that it’s hers, because it was under her bed.</span> <span id="s1979">So she spent three days in the vault area of that commander of SS -- Kommandatur, how do you say that in English?</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">Q: Commandant?</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">A: Commandant’s office, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">A: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1984">Q: And was this Sydell’s office?</span> <span id="s1985">Was he still there or is this later?</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">A: I don’t remember whether --</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">Q: You don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">A: -- that was on Sydell, or later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">A: But she -- she came out of it, she was unshaken that anything could happen to her because God is always with her.</span> <span id="s1991">She --</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">Q: She wasn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">A: She wasn’t shaken --</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">Q: -- hurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">A: -- she knew it’s going to come out well, and it did three days later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">Q: Were you worried?</span></p> <p><span id="s1997">A: Yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s1998">Father was -- he was falling apart.</span> <span id="s1999">And -- because th -- you never knew what’s ge -- you had no impact, and -- on -- on anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">Q: Now, s -- he was living at the opposite end of Terezín from where your mother was?</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">A: Mother went to visit him, he --</span></p> <p><span id="s2002">Q: She could visit -- she could go?</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">A: Yeah, oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s2005">And so when she didn’t come, he knew that something had happened.</span> <span id="s2006">Was he informed in some way that she was arrested, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2007">A: I think through me, we tried to first not tell him, and then we said it, and we said it’s nothing, it’s going to come out well.</span> <span id="s2008">Actually we were lying, because we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s2009">But -- and then in the end proved that we were -- we were right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">Q: Now were you bringing extra food to your mother and your father?</span> <span id="s2011">And was this mainly in the evening, when they were together?</span> <span id="s2012">Or don’t y --</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">A: You made me think.</span> <span id="s2014">Most of the time, because -- yeah, the Hannover, yes, but I also occasionally went to Mother separate and Father separate, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2016">Now, is there a time when they end up living together?</span> <span id="s2017">No, they never live together?</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">A: In Terezín, [indecipherable] no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">Q: In Terezín, that’s what I mean.</span> <span id="s2020">They don’t.</span> <span id="s2021">And consequently the three of you are never living together, so that you are all separate.</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">Q: Do you see them very often?</span> <span id="s2024">Almost daily?</span></p> <p><span id="s2025">A: Yeah, yeah, I -- I was -- after all the kitchens were running, I could dedicate myself to -- as I say, to some of it’s menu making, and -- and -- but I did not have to stay in a kitchen, spend a shift, or so --</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s2027">So where did you eat mainly?</span> <span id="s2028">Where did you take your meals?</span></p> <p><span id="s2029">A: Where I was at the moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s2030">Q: Where you -- so, would you wait in line?</span></p> <p><span id="s2031">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2032">Q: And where would you go -- the -- where people would go --</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">A: In --</span></p> <p><span id="s2034">Q: Just in the kitchen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">A: In the kitchen, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">Q: So essentially you could eat whenever you wanted, as long as food was available?</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">A: Yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s2038">Told you that my aunt was right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2040">No, no, for -- for sure she was right.</span> <span id="s2041">And were your parents -- especially your father, at some point found it advantageous that you had gone first?</span> <span id="s2042">They -- did he realize the implication?</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">A: After the war, I found a poem where she writes about it, that they thank for their life to me.</span> <span id="s2044">Which I don’t [indecipherable] I know they’re thankful, grateful for their life, for my decision.</span> <span id="s2045">They never mentioned it, and never came up and I never asked.</span> <span id="s2046">But I found it in one of the birthday poems.</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">Q: And that you found after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">Q: So you -- but you were very devoted to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">A: Yeah, in spite of the hittings.</span></p> <p><span id="s2051">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2052">But they stopped hitting at a certain point, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2053">A: Yeah, when I got bigger than them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">Q: Did they?</span> <span id="s2055">Were they short people, or they tall people?</span></p> <p><span id="s2056">A: No, Father was tall.</span> <span id="s2057">All his brothers were tall, and his sisters, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">A: Mother were shorter.</span> <span id="s2060">Two sisters were little taller, but the rest of the family was medium s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">Q: Did they have a sense of humor?</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">A: I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">Q: You don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">A: At least not in my presence.</span> <span id="s2065">Not in my presence.</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">Q: When -- when you -- I’m going to come to the Verdi Requiem in a minute, but when you think about -- if you close your eyes and think about walking around Terezín, and think about what people were looking like, and smelling like and what the sounds were like -- was it hurt --</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">A: I don’t think they were smelling bad.</span> <span id="s2068">People --</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">Q: You don’t think so?</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">A: -- tried -- those who were able to move around, took care of their personal hygiene, including, or in spite of the cold water.</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">Q: And did people look depressed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2072">A: They -- I don’t know whether it was depressed.</span> <span id="s2073">I don’t know whether -- I’m not a psychologist, to be able to reco -- but they -- they did not look happy like as if they were at home, but it -- they -- the feeling must have been there, that they’re better off than those who are deported somewhere, because they were 60 kilometers from Prague.</span> <span id="s2074">The majority was -- were Czech speaking people.</span> <span id="s2075">If they go to the east to Poland, they’ll be among Polish people.</span> <span id="s2076">They don’t know how they will be received, how they will be, how their life will be with them, where they are the dominant part of the population.</span> <span id="s2077">And that’s what the Germans Jews complained about, that the Czechs, because they were first there, had the -- the privileged status, as privileged as it can be in a camp.</span> <span id="s2078">But they -- they had the connection --</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">Q: Was that an accurate --</span></p> <p><span id="s2080">A: -- yeah, su -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2081">Q: It was an accurate portrayal?</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">Q: Do you have any idea how many people understood that if they could be protected, they would not be put in the transport?</span> <span id="s2084">You felt protected, insofar as --</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2086">Q: -- one -- one could be --</span></p> <p><span id="s2087">A: In spite I haven’t been at the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s2088">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">Q: So were there --</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">A: You know, people tried, with connections -- if you knew someone in that office, if you knew someone very well, you could go there and say, do something with that card.</span> <span id="s2092">So they do something, but another family has to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2094">A: So then you would feel -- should feel bad, although they may be going in the next transport, but at that time you did something that -- it wasn’t right.</span> <span id="s2095">When I speak in schools, I had a sixth grader ask me, “Do you feel guilty that you survived?”</span> <span id="s2096">And that’s a heavy question for a sixth grader.</span> <span id="s2097">And I didn’t.</span> <span id="s2098">I don’t feel guilty, because I would fe -- I -- I fe -- I would feel guilty if I would have caused somebody else to die, but I don’t feel guilty that I survived, I only feel sad for those who didn’t.</span> <span id="s2099">And this -- that -- you get some of these tough questions from those kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s2100">Q: Did you ever feel -- forget guilty, because clearly you didn’t do something against anybody, right?</span> <span id="s2101">But there is a kind of -- I don’t know whether I want to call it moral compromise one makes.</span> <span id="s2102">You can’t be morally pure in a situation like that.</span> <span id="s2103">So the fact that you’re protected always means that someone else is unprotected.</span></p> <p><span id="s2104">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2105">The self preservation --</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">Q: The self preservation, yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">A: No, no, the -- the act, or the thought of self preser --</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">Q: Is strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">A: -- preservation, makes you partial to yourself without regard about somebody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">Q: And that you understood, for a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">Q: Let’s talk about the Requiem.</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">A: No, that comes afterwards.</span> <span id="s2114">First we have to talk about the inspection of the international Red Cross.</span> <span id="s2115">And the Germans just decided what they will do, and who will be there, report card writer.</span> <span id="s2116">We found out it’s the international Red Cross, everybody was happy.</span> <span id="s2117">Now, the international Red Cross, they will force them to make it real, a proper, a good and beneficial stay here.</span> <span id="s2118">Give all of us to have a beneficial stay.</span> <span id="s2119">So it was designated which way they will led -- be led, on that -- that was the main street between the square and the -- and the church.</span> <span id="s2120">The barracks and tents, where the war industrial production was taking place was all taken down.</span> <span id="s2121">The girls from the agriculture planted lawn and -- and flower beds on that square.</span> <span id="s2122">And the houses on that street all got a face lift, a -- a new coat of paint.</span> <span id="s2123">And stores were opened, money was printed.</span> <span id="s2124">Have you seen the money?</span> <span id="s2125">You must have.</span></p> <p><span id="s2126">Q: [inaudible].</span></p> <p><span id="s2127">A: Terezín money in all denominations, and it looks like money of any other country, except for George Washington, there was Moses with the two tablets on it.</span> <span id="s2128">And there was not much to do with it, becau -- so they opened the bank, and you could make a -- a savings account, but there was no interest on your money, just to deposit it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">Q: So when did all of that start?</span> <span id="s2130">The pre -- the -- the preparation for the ’44 -- do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2131">A: End of ’42, beginning of ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s2132">Q: So it’s a long period of time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">A: And there was a shoe store and the clothes store, and I think I told you about it.</span> <span id="s2136">They put the -- the clothing that was in that warehouse was suddenly put out, put on coat -- a co -- coat hangars, and exposed and exhibited in that store, and the shoes, too.</span> <span id="s2137">And that was that -- the only benefit of that money.</span> <span id="s2138">You could buy for the -- get the money, because after three years, your shoes wear, and your clothes wear, you have not much to change.</span> <span id="s2139">So that was a benefit.</span> <span id="s2140">There was a grocery store, and they were selling there mustard and relish.</span> <span id="s2141">I don’t know, the Germans must have had a -- a surplus of those two items.</span> <span id="s2142">But it was a good -- good to -- to vary a taste of your slice of bread that you got.</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">Q: And who got the -- everybody get the money, or only a certain portion of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">A: Those who worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s2145">Q: Those who worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s2146">A: Those who worked.</span> <span id="s2147">And you [indecipherable] enough you could take a friend.</span> <span id="s2148">You paid for tickets for the -- for those performances.</span> <span id="s2149">And I don’t know what else you could use your money for, the stores, the bank, the -- the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2151">A: And you could buy a stamp, that you could send somebody in Prague, which they woos -- would use the stamp to send you a food package.</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">Q: So you could receive food packages?</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">A: You could get a food package.</span> <span id="s2154">There’s no guarantee th -- that you get everything that’s in the package.</span></p> <p><span id="s2155">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2156">A: Some the Germans would steal, and some th -- take out, consider contraband.</span> <span id="s2157">And you know, if they send a loaf of bread it was cut open to see where there’s anything inside that shouldn’t be there.</span> <span id="s2158">Like in prisons.</span> <span id="s2159">And so -- and some was stolen by the people who worked in that Terezín Post Office, other Jews.</span> <span id="s2160">That’s the dark side of the prisoners.</span> <span id="s2161">And so these were the few things I can remember the money was good for.</span></p> <p><span id="s2162">Q: So if this starts in ’43, all the preparations, is that when Schacter comes up with the idea of the Verdi Requiem?</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">A: For some reason, in January ’43, the last transport was sent away, and here we are in July, and no transports since January.</span> <span id="s2164">I have no idea why.</span> <span id="s2165">Everybody was up and happy, that this is the end of deportations.</span> <span id="s2166">So he also had got the courage to start to implement what he was thinking the Requiem, knowing, or at least anticipating that this choir will stay together.</span> <span id="s2167">There was a huge uproar when he came up with that idea.</span> <span id="s2168">All the scholars and professors, and the -- and the bor -- the borders -- the -- the elder -- the -- the Council of Elders, they all protested for different reasons.</span> <span id="s2169">The -- the scholars and the rabbis, why would you as Jews in a Jewish ghetto perform a Catholic mass for the dead, when there are comparable works on Jewish themes?</span> <span id="s2170">[indecipherable] and so, which cannot be performed in -- anywhere in occupied Europe, and this is the only place you could.</span> <span id="s2171">He did not give in to this.</span> <span id="s2172">He didn’t say it openly because it was dangerous to say, but I know that he -- his mind was on being -- wanting to be able to sing to the Germans in Latin what he couldn’t tell them in German to their face.</span> <span id="s2173">Like the -- the [indecipherable] the day of wrath, the [indecipherable] that it -- i-in this book, the names of all the sinners are inscribed, and none will escape the punishment.</span> <span id="s2174">So this -- there were about three or four such occasions.</span> <span id="s2175">And this is what drove him to get it out of him, and be able, even for distance, in the absentia, to tell the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2176">Q: You mean whether the Germans were there or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">Q: Wh -- you’re saying whether the Germans were there or not to hear it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">A: No, yeah, they were not there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">A: And the Council of Elders thought, if the Germans find out the intentions behind this performance, that will really be dangerous for the singers and for him, and maybe even implications for the rest of the population.</span> <span id="s2182">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">Q: I ne -- I need to interrupt you, I’m sorry --</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">Q: -- I’m going to stop the tape [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2186">A: Is another oil truck coming in?</span></p> <p><span id="s2187">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2188">End of Tape #7</span></p> <p><span id="s2189">Tape #8</span></p> <p><span id="s2190">Q: Edgar, you were talking about the council being possibly upset if the German -- I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">A: Really upset.</span></p> <p><span id="s2192">Q: -- upset if the Germans would find out.</span> <span id="s2193">Now, let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s2194">You said you know from Schacter what -- what he was really feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">A: That was the driving thought behind --</span></p> <p><span id="s2196">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s2197">Yeah, is -- is that because you were rooming with him at this time, and you talked with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2198">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2199">This friend of mine, the lawyer, meanwhile was deported, and we found in a attic of a house in the a backyard of one of those private houses, that must have been a mother-in-law arrangement, and the stairs up to the attic, and with a carpenter connection again, we got a -- a little separation, and we had a room with privacy for the two of us.</span> <span id="s2200">And so I was pretty much informed about him, his lifestyle, his thoughts, and his determination.</span> <span id="s2201">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s2202">Q: But let me ask you -- I -- I just want to know -- understand something.</span> <span id="s2203">You -- did you meet him separately from joining the choir, or only when you joined the choir?</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">A: Through the choir --</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">Q: Through [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">A: -- we met, and for -- for some reasons, including that I provided some more food for him, we ca -- we came close.</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">Q: You got together, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">A: I still mention, I don’t have any complexes that he would have found in me a -- a level companion, cause I was a young guy, and his circle were the musi -- social circle were the musicians, the composers, and he had other interests.</span> <span id="s2209">But we were very close, and very good, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2210">Q: And what was the difference in age between the two of you, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s2211">A: He was born 1905, so it was about 19 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2212">Q: That’s a big difference, yes.</span> <span id="s2213">But you -- you spent a lot of time together, I gather?</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2215">Not a -- not a lot.</span> <span id="s2216">We were both --</span></p> <p><span id="s2217">Q: Busy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2218">A: -- during the day we were both working, and then -- he then became part of that free time department.</span> <span id="s2219">And I think his assignment, his job was working within this department so he didn’t have to go somewhere to a -- I don’t know stone quarry, or whatever he worked in in that.</span> <span id="s2220">So that was his day job.</span> <span id="s2221">And then in the evening, after everybody finished, they came for rehearsal.</span></p> <p><span id="s2222">Q: So did he tell you ver -- talk to you about wanting to do the Verdi Requiem?</span></p> <p><span id="s2223">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2224">Q: And he told you what --</span></p> <p><span id="s2225">A: And he said why, that we can’t tell them in German, and I -- it’s -- it’s -- it has to come out, and this is one way I can get it out.</span> <span id="s2226">And when he was told about all the dangers, he told everyone in the choir, “It is assumed to be dangerous to you, to us, to the rest of the inmates here.</span> <span id="s2227">So if you don’t want to be part of it, I don’t feel bad if you leave.”</span> <span id="s2228">Nobody left.</span></p> <p><span id="s2229">Q: And what did the council th-think about the danger, that -- that somehow the Nazis would discover his intention?</span></p> <p><span id="s2230">A: That if they find out that he -- that the purpose of this was to tell them, you bastards, you going to get it at one point, that they will not appreciate it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2231">Q: But let me ask you something, when you read the words of the Verdi Requiem, it’s als -- there’s also words of forgive these people, whoever they are, who -- who, and the Requiem is speaking about both the wrath of God and begging for forgiveness, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">A: Yes, so this -- this part we ignored.</span></p> <p><span id="s2233">Q: But you sang it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2234">A: And -- yeah, ignored as a -- as a thought --</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2236">A: -- that propelled us to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2237">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2238">A: And in saying the -- the Libera me, was interpreted as set me free from here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2239">Q: So some of it was said for the Jews, and some of it was said against the -- the Nazis, as the interpretation, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2240">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2241">Q: When -- when you were rehearsing, did you feel this kind of emotion, that you -- wh-when -- just when you’re rehearsing yourself --</span></p> <p><span id="s2242">A: No, I just felt I’m part of a group that despises the Germans and the Nazis, and that this is the best we can do to get even with them within our capabilities.</span></p> <p><span id="s2243">Q: What was the -- were the rehearsals more intense than when you did “The Bartered Bride,” and “The Magic Flute,” and “The Marriage of Figaro”?</span></p> <p><span id="s2244">A: It was, because it was a different language, and it was much more difficult music.</span></p> <p><span id="s2245">Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2246">A: And much more concentration was required.</span> <span id="s2247">And some people who didn’t work in the kitchen, were not so well-fed to really dedicate themselves to such a -- that was a hard --</span></p> <p><span id="s2248">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2249">A: -- work on a half empty stomach.</span></p> <p><span id="s2250">Q: Yes, it’s difficult singing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2251">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2252">So with the fact that there were no transports, he was encouraged that he’ll have an easy job, as easy as this can be.</span> <span id="s2253">Th -- I am sure Toscanini would have never undertaken it with -- with well-fed people, to teach them without a score.</span> <span id="s2254">So it took six weeks -- we were six weeks into the rehearsal when the rumors sprung up the transports will resume.</span> <span id="s2255">So every time a transport is put together, people from different sectors are involved.</span> <span id="s2256">And so the choir members anticipated that some of them will definitely be included in the transport.</span> <span id="s2257">So they pushed him to make one performance for them, for their hard work, so they can enjoy performing it.</span> <span id="s2258">And he would not, because it wasn’t up to his standards yet.</span> <span id="s2259">But then it became known that by September six, 5,000 people will be deported.</span> <span id="s2260">He couldn’t resist, because he knew a lot of them will be in it, and he made a performance for them and their families and friends, not the o -- open, public sh -- performance.</span></p> <p><span id="s2261">Q: So this is September ’43?</span></p> <p><span id="s2262">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2263">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2264">A: And the irony with this, the sad irony, that these 5,000 people -- about -- he lost about half the choir, and these people went to Auschwitz and they came there, and they were treated differently than anybody else who came before them and after them.</span> <span id="s2265">They could retain their clothes, they could retain their luggage, and they went into a camp which was from then on called the family camp.</span> <span id="s2266">They lived together, not in privacy, but families were together.</span> <span id="s2267">And they were there for six months, and they were not working, they did not -- and this Freddie Hirsch, he took care of the kids, entertained them and taught them.</span> <span id="s2268">Als -- also made sport with them, and art, and he really took care of the kids.</span> <span id="s2269">And this group was held there while the Germans were negotiating with the allies in exchange of the German prisoners of war for these Jews, and also some war material.</span> <span id="s2270">They wanted some trucks, and -- and of course the allies wouldn’t give the Germans another few thousand soldiers that will then turn against them, and trucks that they will use in the war against them.</span> <span id="s2271">So when the negotiations fell through, in one night, all of those who were still alive from the 5,000 went into the gas.</span> <span id="s2272">Was exactly three months -- six months later, on March eight.</span> <span id="s2273">And this is also -- on March seventh is the -- was Masaryks’ birthday, President Masaryk, the first -- the creator of Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s2274">So could be that had something to do with it, because they were -- they were planning the -- timing some things to coincide with some -- something that gives you a bigger -- a ce -- bor -- bigger pain.</span></p> <p><span id="s2275">Q: Was Schacter worried that he was going to be deported at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s2276">A: No, hadn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s2277">Q: No, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s2278">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2279">Q: Was he protected in some way, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s2280">A: Not that I knew, but those people who put together the transport list had some kind of directives whom to leave out, as long as it was possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2281">Q: And as far as you know, who was it who put together these transport lists?</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">A: There was a department, it was called evidence.</span> <span id="s2283">Evidence is where all the files about every single one who came into Terezín was kept.</span> <span id="s2284">A card with a name, with a transport, date of birth, a transport when they came in, and -- and also the transporting date when they left Terezín.</span> <span id="s2285">I did after the war search, y -- my parents survived, in spite of Schliesser being sent to Auschwitz, and myself, my parents survived.</span> <span id="s2286">I thought the easiest thing would have been if he had written on top of the card -- of their card, do not deport it, initial it, that would have been the easiest.</span> <span id="s2287">I got copies of those cards, there’s nothing there, and I was researching how he did it, because he must have done it, because it’s inconceivable that two, old, useless people would stay there, especially before the Red Cross came, they deported a lot of old people, they wanted only -- they wanted the Red Cross only to see young, good looking people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2288">Q: Maybe there was a special section for cards, a different place.</span></p> <p><span id="s2289">A: So the -- the staff in that office --</span></p> <p><span id="s2290">Q: Would do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2291">A: -- did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">Q: And was that then approved by the council, or did they just do it themselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s2293">A: The head of the Council of Elders had to sign the transport list.</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">Q: List.</span></p> <p><span id="s2295">A: And then later we get to why he was -- and the whole Council of Elders was sent away.</span> <span id="s2296">He must have found out where they go, and what’s happening, and their destination, and he refused to sign it.</span> <span id="s2297">He told the camp commander, you sign it.</span> <span id="s2298">So he, the camp commander, must have guessed that he knows what’s happening, and didn’t want the word to be spread among the inmates because a panic would be created.</span> <span id="s2299">So the whole council left.</span> <span id="s2300">But even though in September six, and the -- half the choir left, and they have -- they have -- he has recruited new people and started the whole thing from the beginning with them.</span> <span id="s2301">And he lost one more time, less people, and recruited new and started a third time with new people.</span> <span id="s2302">And then in January ’44 was the first performance.</span></p> <p><span id="s2303">Q: With the new -- with the new group.</span> <span id="s2304">Did any of the soloists get deported --</span></p> <p><span id="s2305">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2306">Q: -- or was it only among the choir?</span></p> <p><span id="s2307">A: Maybe some.</span> <span id="s2308">I didn’t know all of them --</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">Q: [indecipherable] yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2310">A: -- but those [indecipherable] Schacter did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s2311">Q: Uh-huh, in -- in the Requiem group --</span></p> <p><span id="s2312">A: Yeah, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2313">Q: -- the soloists did not get deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s2314">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2315">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2316">A: And he had two for each part, should something happen to one, he has a replacement.</span></p> <p><span id="s2317">Q: Another person.</span></p> <p><span id="s2318">A: [indecipherable] good organi --</span></p> <p><span id="s2319">Q: And when you did the September performance, September ’43, before that first deportation, was that with a piano accompaniment?</span></p> <p><span id="s2320">A: Everything was only piano --</span></p> <p><span id="s2321">Q: Only piano.</span></p> <p><span id="s2322">A: All the time, only piano.</span></p> <p><span id="s2323">Q: And did he --</span></p> <p><span id="s2324">A: And when I listen now to a Requiem with a concert, and a -- the -- the trumpets and the drums, I said how -- it seemed to us like -- like absolutely perfect performance, just the piano.</span></p> <p><span id="s2325">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2326">A: And a crappy piano on top of it.</span> <span id="s2327">How did they bring out all these -- these impressions, these results [indecipherable] of -- that the orchestra can provide.</span></p> <p><span id="s2328">Q: And did he play the piano, or did he do the conducting and someone else played?</span></p> <p><span id="s2329">A: No, bu -- there -- during the rehearsal he played the piano, and do -- and during -- in the performance, Gideon Klein played.</span></p> <p><span id="s2330">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2331">A: They were very close together.</span></p> <p><span id="s2332">Q: And did Gideon kli -- Klein ever play at the rehearsals?</span></p> <p><span id="s2333">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2334">Q: So it’s a -- it’s somewhat odd, however, to play only at a performance, and never at a rehearsal.</span></p> <p><span id="s2335">A: Gideon Klein had other work to do --</span></p> <p><span id="s2336">Q: Yeah, well he’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2337">A: -- he -- he was composing --</span></p> <p><span id="s2338">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2339">A: -- and he was playing per -- giving performances.</span> <span id="s2340">Schacter, that’s why I said he didn’t tolerate any inattention, because everybody had to look at his eyes, and see when he gets the signal.</span></p> <p><span id="s2341">Q: Do you remember anything ever going wrong in the concerts?</span></p> <p><span id="s2342">A: Wrong?</span></p> <p><span id="s2343">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2344">A: In the concert?</span></p> <p><span id="s2345">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2346">A: I’m sure it did, but everybody was so grateful for it that -- that either they didn’t notice, didn’t want to notice, didn’t make an impact on them, they were happy to -- to be part of it whether active or passive.</span></p> <p><span id="s2347">Q: Now, once you started giving performances, or Schacter is conducting the performances of the Requiem, starting in January ’44 -- January ’44, right?</span> <span id="s2348">You give about 14 or 15 --</span></p> <p><span id="s2349">A: 15, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2350">Q: 15 performances.</span></p> <p><span id="s2351">A: And each time with less singers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2352">Q: So you ne -- he never restarts again, he just accommodates?</span></p> <p><span id="s2353">A: Only three times.</span> <span id="s2354">Only three times he started to -- with new people.</span> <span id="s2355">And then after the 15th, he was left with 60 singers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2356">Q: Out of 150.</span></p> <p><span id="s2357">A: And not the same amount in each voice.</span></p> <p><span id="s2358">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2359">A: So he didn’t want it.</span> <span id="s2360">But then came the order from camp commander, that he wants a performance of the Requiem for high SS officials who came from Vienna and Prague, from Berlin, to shake the hands of the Red Cross people who were also invited -- no Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s2361">Q: This is -- this is Rahm, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2362">A: Rahm, yeah.</span> <span id="s2363">And you know they had to pay homage to the Red Cross [indecipherable] and so now, I didn’t know -- he didn’t want to do it with the -- with the regular choir, but it was an opportunity he was dreaming of.</span> <span id="s2364">Not only can he sing it to them for distance, but he has them right in front of him, they are sitting there, and he can really tell them.</span> <span id="s2365">And the paradox again is, that we all thought -- we told him, and the Germans were the only ones who knew that we were actually singing our own Requiem.</span> <span id="s2366">You know, they knew where we will end up.</span> <span id="s2367">They didn’t think that there would be some survivors.</span> <span id="s2368">So that was a mutual giving it to each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s2369">Q: And the Germans knew what was being sung, because they knew the Catholic liturgy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2370">A: I think -- I’m sure, yeah.</span> <span id="s2371">But I think they -- they thought it’s a -- it’s a musical performance, and -- but they also understood the meaning of it, and what’s going to happen with us, that this is --</span></p> <p><span id="s2372">Q: Your own Requiem.</span></p> <p><span id="s2373">A: Our own eulogy.</span> <span id="s2374">The -- when this Red Cross came, I couldn’t understand that they accept the German conditions that they will not interview people at random on the street, only special auditioned people that the Germans prepared to meet them.</span> <span id="s2375">And they knew that they’re saying lies, but it was again against the threat of the whole family being endangered if they refuse.</span> <span id="s2376">So they did it.</span> <span id="s2377">But I don’t -- still don’t understand, if you were psychologist, rather than philosophy doctor, I would ask you, how is it possible to audition, and indoctrinate little kids to the same performance?</span> <span id="s2378">When they came to the playground, and there were some kids who never been on a playground because they were not allowed at home to go, the little ones.</span> <span id="s2379">When they came for the chocolate bar that was on the table in front of the playground, the only one uniform was Rahm, and they had to address him uncle, and they, “Uncle Rahm, again chocolate?”</span> <span id="s2380">As if they were already fed up with chocolate, and there were some kids who never knew what chocolate was because it wasn’t on their ration tickets at home.</span> <span id="s2381">This I don’t understand, how they got the kids to do that.</span> <span id="s2382">Maybe they told them you’re going to play a theater or whatever.</span> <span id="s2383">But this were tough for me to understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s2384">Q: Did you see that?</span> <span id="s2385">Were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2386">A: No, not --</span></p> <p><span id="s2387">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2388">A: -- not, I didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s2389">Q: Were you told that at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2390">A: Yeah, yeah, by the -- the -- those who were in charge of the kids.</span> <span id="s2391">And the agriculture workers, and my wife among them, dressed in shorts, and nice blouse, marching by with the rake, or the -- the -- the spade over the shoulder, singing happy songs going to work.</span> <span id="s2392">And the orchestra was playing in that pavilion on the -- on the sta -- on the town square.</span> <span id="s2393">It was a real happy town.</span> <span id="s2394">This doesn’t belong to my li -- yeah, I hear the party.</span> <span id="s2395">After the war, in -- in Newton was a Harvard philosophy psychology professor who researched to write a book about the Red Cross, International Red Cross at that time, what they should have done and didn’t do, and they shouldn’t have done and did do.</span> <span id="s2396">And he was researching it, and I knew about it because I was translating his papers that he brought from Germany, from Austria, even the French.</span> <span id="s2397">And at one point he told me he had an appointment with the then president of the International Red Cross, Dr. Rossler.</span> <span id="s2398">In his office, in his factory -- he had aluminum, a huge aluminum factory in Switzerland, and he came there, and the secretary says, “Oh, Dr. Rossler called, he apologizes, he’ll be an hour, hour and a half late from another appointment.</span> <span id="s2399">Make yourself comfortable in the library.”</span> <span id="s2400">Brought in cup of coffee, said [indecipherable] whatever.</span> <span id="s2401">And he perused -- and he found documents that he had branch factories in Austria and in Germany where he used prisoners from concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2402">So how much was his enthusiasm to confront Germans, the Nazis?</span> <span id="s2403">Speaks for itself.</span> <span id="s2404">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2405">Q: Were you supposed to be interviewed by anybody during this time?</span> <span id="s2406">Where -- where were you when they were visiting, did you see them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2407">A: I -- I was just doing my work, I was not --</span></p> <p><span id="s2408">Q: Are you surprised that nobody said anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s2409">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2410">Q: No.</span> <span id="s2411">You think that fear was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2412">A: And I’m sorry they didn’t, but some single guy who didn’t have a family could have spilled the beans, but it wouldn’t have helped, because this was called the International Red Cross, but the seven directors all were Swiss.</span></p> <p><span id="s2413">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2414">A: There was no internationality in that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2415">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2416">A: And so it was very well done, like a real Potemkin village, that the Germans orchestrated.</span> <span id="s2417">Before that cross -- Red Cross came I mentioned the old people -- a lot of old -- thousands of old people were deported, and after that, it must have been under the influence of the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto that the Germans did not want it to happen in other ghettos as well, so all able bodied people who were not necessary for the war industry, and like agriculture for where they produced for the Germans, and those who were necessary to maintain the functioning of the town, of the ghetto as such, the physical functioning, were all deported, and Schliesser was gone, and I was among -- the kitchens were running, so I was no l-longer needed.</span> <span id="s2418">So that was end of September ’44.</span> <span id="s2419">I went and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2420">Q: Let me -- let me -- let me hold it for one second.</span> <span id="s2421">This performance for the Germans, was it Germans sitting in the front row?</span></p> <p><span id="s2422">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2423">Q: And you can see them, and who -- do you see Eichmann.</span> <span id="s2424">Is he there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2425">A: I didn’t know Eichmann --</span></p> <p><span id="s2426">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2427">A: -- I -- he -- he jus -- it is said that he was there, but -- and it -- we often heard Eichmann is in Terezín, transports will go.</span> <span id="s2428">They knew that he was in charge of transports.</span> <span id="s2429">But I never saw him face to face, so I wouldn’t have recognized him among that group.</span></p> <p><span id="s2430">Q: Now, I know that you reported -- you reported in octo -- October one of 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s2431">A: October oneth, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2432">Q: So then [indecipherable] what happens between September -- the perfor -- the -- wait a second, June -- I’m sorry, June of ’44 and October?</span> <span id="s2433">Does Schacter keep you folks singing?</span> <span id="s2434">There’s a few months there after -- after the Red Cross visit, or is he deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s2435">A: He was deported after me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2436">Q: After you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2437">A: I didn’t know -- when I left --</span></p> <p><span id="s2438">Q: I see, he was still there --</span></p> <p><span id="s2439">A: -- he was still there, and I didn’t know or think that he will be also deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s2440">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s2441">So does the choir -- does he keep working with people?</span> <span id="s2442">Do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2443">A: We -- we went -- after the Red Cross visit, we still did -- we perfor -- we performed, and that was not much of a choir required, Pergolesi’s “La Serva Padrone”, it was mainly soloists and a small choir, but -- and we were doing mainly get-togethers with anyone who wanted could come and -- and listen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2444">Q: So it became much more informal?</span></p> <p><span id="s2445">A: Yeah, informal.</span></p> <p><span id="s2446">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2447">Did you end up learning music?</span> <span id="s2448">Could you read music by this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2449">A: No, but Schacter taught me.</span> <span id="s2450">He started to teach me to play the piano, then I started to read music.</span> <span id="s2451">And unfortunately, it didn’t go for very long, and after the war I had no chance to resume.</span> <span id="s2452">I had to work to maintain my parents and myself because we had nothing except what they had left from the 110 pounds.</span> <span id="s2453">I had nothing, coming from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2454">So there was never an opportunity for me to break and study music.</span></p> <p><span id="s2455">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2456">We have to turn -- change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2457">End of Tape #8</span></p> <p><span id="s2458">Tape #9</span></p> <p><span id="s2459">Q: Edgar, prior to the -- the visit of the Red Cross, which was as far as I know, June 24th, 1944, di -- th-the painter’s affair, they arrested the pain -- the artist was before that, am I correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s2460">A: It was before that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2461">Q: And so they were deported before the performance?</span></p> <p><span id="s2462">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2463">Q: Was that also surprising to you that that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s2464">A: We found out that -- why it happened, I don’t know that -- how -- how it became known, but we found out in the -- on the street that the Germans were [indecipherable] for this.</span></p> <p><span id="s2465">Q: Right, for the sort of undercover --</span></p> <p><span id="s2466">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2467">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2468">Now, you said that Schacter was a very sweet guy when he wasn’t being a conductor, but once he was going to be serious about his music, he was a tyrant.</span> <span id="s2469">Was he also charismatic?</span> <span id="s2470">Was he also a very compelling person, or was he just very strict when he was doing his --</span></p> <p><span id="s2471">A: While we were working?</span></p> <p><span id="s2472">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2473">A: I don’t know what do you mean by charismatic.</span></p> <p><span id="s2474">Q: Well, we --</span></p> <p><span id="s2475">A: He just was -- he demanded full attention, there was -- there was nothing else but rehearsing, and if you wanted to be with him, you had to pay full attention.</span></p> <p><span id="s2476">Q: I think what I mean is, obviously people wanted to be with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2477">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2478">Q: It wasn’t just the music, because you could have somebody in front of you who is conducting, who you didn’t want to be with, right?</span> <span id="s2479">I mean, the music alone wouldn’t necessarily be enough if someone wasn’t interesting, or taught you well.</span> <span id="s2480">I mean, he had to have something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2481">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2482">Q: When he was teaching you piano, was he easier on you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2483">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2484">Q: He was?</span></p> <p><span id="s2485">A: This wa -- yeah, well this was -- he was not aiming to make me acam -- academy member, but he was starting to teach me music.</span> <span id="s2486">Whether it was the relationship that he was easier, but he did not have a -- I don’t think he set a goal for himself where I should be at what time --</span></p> <p><span id="s2487">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2488">A: -- with my piano knowledge, but [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2489">Q: Now didn’t he also give some recitals, piano recitals, or did he accompany people?</span></p> <p><span id="s2490">A: I think he did accompany some.</span> <span id="s2491">Not very often, but I don’t think he gave recitals --</span></p> <p><span id="s2492">Q: Did he compose?</span></p> <p><span id="s2493">A: -- because there were better pianists than he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2494">Q: Uh-huh, than him, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2495">And was he a composer also?</span></p> <p><span id="s2496">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2497">Q: So he was primarily a conductor, yes.</span> <span id="s2498">Did he ever conduct some of the work of the composers who were working in Terezín, Olan, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s2499">A: Very few of those works were presented to the public.</span> <span id="s2500">They -- they played it, they performed it for the critique of the other musicians only.</span> <span id="s2501">So those compositions were not heard in public in Terezín.</span></p> <p><span id="s2502">Q: Although “Brundibar” was, wasn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2503">A: “Brundibar” is another story.</span> <span id="s2504">That was composed in Prague, still, and when Krasa was deported to Terezín, he left the manuscript with the director of the orphanage, who was a musician himself.</span> <span id="s2505">And unbeknownst to Krasa, this director, Freundenfeld was his name, studied with the kids “Brundibar,” and performed in Prague.</span></p> <p><span id="s2506">Q: In Prague.</span></p> <p><span id="s2507">A: And Krasa had no idea about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2508">Q: Huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2509">A: So when we came to Prague -- to -- to Terezín, he continued to work with “Brundibar” with an enlarged ensemble, it -- other kids, not just those from the orphanage.</span> <span id="s2510">And he -- and Krasa was -- was very happy with it.</span> <span id="s2511">He did not interfere or participate in anything else, or any of those performances.</span> <span id="s2512">There was a time when Schacter auditioned -- not auditioned, rehearsed with the kids, but he never conducted “Brundibar.”</span> <span id="s2513">It was always this Freundenfeld.</span></p> <p><span id="s2514">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s2515">So often the person who rehearsed the kids would not necessarily be the one that would --</span></p> <p><span id="s2516">A: No, it was not very often.</span> <span id="s2517">This Freundenfeld, he was dedicated to that.</span> <span id="s2518">There were 55 performances of “Brundibar”.</span></p> <p><span id="s2519">Q: Of bru -- yes.</span> <span id="s2520">Did you see it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2521">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2522">Q: Did you like it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2523">A: Yeah, it was a -- it was the same -- the same motive as the Requiem, just a smaller framework that -- that was the -- especially with a [indecipherable] with the finale, where they sing we have overcome the oppressor, and we won, and victory is at hand.</span> <span id="s2524">That was -- and the Germans didn’t know, because they were singing with -- in Czech.</span> <span id="s2525">So that was a similar kind of a resistance, or at least a sole improvement and spiritual enlightenment as the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2526">Q: But what -- from what you explained, it’s clear that the Germans are oppressors, but it was not clear to you or your colleagues that they were murderers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2527">A: No, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2528">Q: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2529">A: Now let me -- there was a -- one guy from Terezín went to Auschwitz, and one of the SS men, a disgruntled SS man was a schoolmate in Sudeten.</span> <span id="s2530">He brought in the SS uniform and took him out on a motorcycle from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2531">And he came to Prague -- to Terezín, and he spoke with Edelstein, and told him about what’s happening, and nobody would believe him.</span> <span id="s2532">This is impossible, it is -- it’s unthinkable.</span> <span id="s2533">But then there were some other -- for instance, those people who were helping load or unload the -- the dep-deportees noticed on the wagons that the -- always the same ones were coming back, you know, they are numbered, coded, numbered.</span> <span id="s2534">And so one of them knew there is somewhere a board loose behind the frame of the -- of that little window that’s up there, the barred window.</span> <span id="s2535">He said, when you arrive, look where, and write it down, and put it in there, under that trimming.</span> <span id="s2536">And it came back Auschwitz but the person could not describe anything back -- because when you come to Auschwitz, you don’t know what’s happening, you know -- know you’re getting a rougher treatment right away, but you have no idea.</span> <span id="s2537">I know from my own experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s2538">Q: How did you find out about this man who was taken out of Auschwitz by the -- did you find it out when you were in Terezín or after?</span></p> <p><span id="s2539">A: After.</span></p> <p><span id="s2540">Q: After.</span></p> <p><span id="s2541">A: After.</span></p> <p><span id="s2542">Q: You think you would have believed him, if he had told you?</span> <span id="s2543">What do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s2544">A: If I had known him as somebody who does not exaggerate, I -- I might have --</span></p> <p><span id="s2545">Q: When you think about Edelstein just saying it can’t be, when he’s -- finally has before him, someone --</span></p> <p><span id="s2546">A: It’s odd.</span></p> <p><span id="s2547">Q: -- do you think about what -- what’s the matter [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2548">A: You could think he wants to make himself interesting, or -- it’s -- it’s unthinkable to a normal person.</span> <span id="s2549">Not that I consider myself totally normal, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s2550">Q: And do you think this is ’43 or ’44?</span> <span id="s2551">Or earlier?</span></p> <p><span id="s2552">A: Four ya -- ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s2553">Q: ’44.</span> <span

because you’re so isolated.</span></p> <p><span id="s2558">A: No.</span> <span id="s2559">It was a -- one other person that escaped from Auschwitz, a -- a Rudolph Vrba.</span> <span id="s2560">I don’t know how he did it, I know that there were a group that dug a hole, and covered it up, and put on top something that repels the dogs, so they wouldn’t give it away that they are in there.</span> <span id="s2561">And they -- they escaped -- some of them --</span></p> <p><span id="s2562">Q: There are four Jews at that time --</span></p> <p><span id="s2563">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2564">Q: And Vrba was with a man named Wetzler.</span> <span id="s2565">The two of them escaped together.</span> <span id="s2566">And then Mordowicz and Rosin escaped.</span> <span id="s2567">And they told what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2568">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2569">Q: And they went to Bratislava, so they were close.</span> <span id="s2570">It’s interesting.</span> <span id="s2571">After Epstein is taken out -- you know, it’s interesting, he doesn’t believe this guy, but he doesn’t want to sign.</span></p> <p><span id="s2572">A: Yeah, he --</span></p> <p><span id="s2573">Q: So what is he -- what -- what do you think he’s thinking?</span></p> <p><span id="s2574">A: I don’t know, I think if it is really true, he doesn’t want to have the responsibility.</span> <span id="s2575">He may have weighed -- like --</span></p> <p><span id="s2576">Q: And who comes after him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2577">A: A German, Dr. Epstein.</span> <span id="s2578">And he was not a -- really a strong person to push for improvement, so -- so he did what he was told, and then he was shot, and the new camp commander was an Austrian SS man, and he put in an Austrian man to be the head of the council, Murmelstein.</span> <span id="s2579">He was not a very nice person.</span> <span id="s2580">He was very self-centered.</span> <span id="s2581">And after the war he wound up in the Jewish archives in the Vatican, in the library.</span></p> <p><span id="s2582">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2583">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2584">Q: Working there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2585">A: He was a rabbi, this Murmelstein.</span> <span id="s2586">And he lived his life out in the Vatican.</span></p> <p><span id="s2587">Q: Interesting.</span> <span id="s2588">Did -- did you know Edelstein at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s2589">A: Yeah, but not --</span></p> <p><span id="s2590">Q: Not well?</span></p> <p><span id="s2591">A: No, not --</span></p> <p><span id="s2592">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2593">A: He was I -- you know, there was a guy experienced, traveling to Palestine, and on -- on German insistence, and tra -- I was a nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s2594">Q: When Schlisser -- Schliesser was deported, he was deported before you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2595">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2596">Q: Did you then think you were vulnerable to being deported if he was -- if he was deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s2597">A: I didn’t think I was vulnerable, I thought my parents would be.</span></p> <p><span id="s2598">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2599">You thought something else would protect you because you were younger?</span></p> <p><span id="s2600">A: No [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2601">Q: Or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2602">A: Yeah, I was the big shot, so I didn’t -- wasn’t concerned about myself, I was concerned about my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s2603">Q: When -- when you think back now before your deportation, and you -- and I don’t know whether you thought about the three years that you were there, and thought about what the council did or didn’t do, did you have respect for the council?</span></p> <p><span id="s2604">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2605">Q: You did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2606">A: Definitely.</span> <span id="s2607">They tried their best.</span> <span id="s2608">Of course, as -- as -- as the carpenter stole a board, and the cook stole a -- a piece of bread or something else, they also did favors for their family and maybe even close friends, that were at the -- at the cost of -- of other -- somebody else.</span> <span id="s2609">I -- I don’t think that anybody under those circumstances would stay totally clean.</span></p> <p><span id="s2610">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2611">A: And the wife’s father did.</span> <span id="s2612">I’m sorry, I have to apologize, he -- he was straight like an arrow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2613">Q: Did you know him then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2614">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2615">I didn’t know her, but I knew him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2616">Q: [indecipherable] you knew him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2617">A: He was the head of the police, the secret police that without uniform made inspections in kitchens and in storerooms and warehouses.</span> <span id="s2618">And his job and his dedication and his whole thinking was if nothing will be stolen by individuals, everybody will have more.</span></p> <p><span id="s2619">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2620">A: And that was his driving force.</span></p> <p><span id="s2621">Q: And his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2622">A: Oskar Fuchs.</span></p> <p><span id="s2623">Q: Oskar Fuchs.</span> <span id="s2624">So he’s one of the rare people who stayed --</span></p> <p><span id="s2625">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2626">Q: -- completely straight.</span></p> <p><span id="s2627">A: His wife had to deceive him when she -- when Hana brought home some tomatoes from the field, she gave him half a tomato at lunch, and he said, “Where did this come from?”</span> <span id="s2628">She said “Oh, your daughter worked so well, the supervisor gave her a tomato.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2629">Q: So that was okay.</span> <span id="s2630">When -- when -- did you receive a notification that you would be deported, eventually did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2631">A: Yeah, everybody did, you get the piece of paper, tomorrow, or after tomorrow at this and this time, report to the Hamburger --</span></p> <p><span id="s2632">Q: Do you remember that moment when you -- this is mail, I guess.</span> <span id="s2633">I mean, it seems so odd, but how -- was it handed to you?</span> <span id="s2634">Is there a -- a place where you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2635">A: It was brought to the place of your residence, wherever you lived.</span> <span id="s2636">In barracks it was easier, a room, so they put through the five, six, seven from this room, and then they gave it to the room Altesten, there were room supervisor, whatever she was called.</span> <span id="s2637">Was called eldest, the eldest there, I mean that, even if they were not the oldest.</span> <span id="s2638">And this was brought, I think just put in under the door where you lived, it was not even handed personally.</span></p> <p><span id="s2639">Q: Did your heart sink when you saw this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2640">A: No, I li -- I don’t think heart sank, I -- so I’m going, and I’m going to do something somewhere else.</span> <span id="s2641">I don’t think --</span></p> <p><span id="s2642">Q: And did you go -- who were the first people you told?</span> <span id="s2643">Did you go to your parents right away?</span> <span id="s2644">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s2645">A: Father was devastated, and Mother, she was such a believer in God, that nothing could shake her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2646">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2647">A: She was the -- sure that I’m coming back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2648">Q: Did that give you strength, her -- her being so sure, in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s2649">A: I didn’t think myself that -- that I would not come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2650">Q: You didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2651">A: So you go somewheres --</span></p> <p><span id="s2652">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2653">A: -- do your work there, and then when the war ends --</span></p> <p><span id="s2654">Q: And the war --</span></p> <p><span id="s2655">A: -- you go home.</span></p> <p><span id="s2656">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2657">And you were allowed how much?</span> <span id="s2658">Were you allowed to bring a bag of something?</span></p> <p><span id="s2659">A: There were no -- no prescriptions for -- as to weight, but it was one duffel bag with the -- with the bedding, and -- and another luggage with some clothing and shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2660">Q: Now this was not a passenger train that you went on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2661">A: No, that was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s2662">Q: This is a cattle train.</span></p> <p><span id="s2663">A: It was not any more.</span> <span id="s2664">And there were a lot of people, about close to 70, and not everybody could sit at the same time, you had to alternate.</span> <span id="s2665">And if one of the older people fainted, or died, then they lied there, so it took up two additional spaces for someone to sit down.</span> <span id="s2666">And -- sorry -- we didn’t know how long we’re going to be on the trip -- on the train, but it took three full days and there was no food, and no water in that enclosed truck -- wagon.</span> <span id="s2667">There was one -- it was called comfort bucket in the corner, without any privacy, and [indecipherable] but you had to go, you had to go.</span> <span id="s2668">And with 70 people in three days, that bucket was full very quickly, and the same kind of -- of atmosphere there were not -- as with the old people when they went to the bathroom and couldn’t hold it, it was horrendous.</span></p> <p><span id="s2669">Q: So this is the first time, for you, to be in this situation, that so deteriorated, physically and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2670">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2671">Q: -- otherwise, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2672">A: And while we were the -- very soon -- I don’t remember how soon after the door was locked and sealed, two boys from that home for the boys have attached themselves to me.</span> <span id="s2673">I don’t know why, I wasn’t a father figure, but I was a tall guy, and somehow they felt confident.</span> <span id="s2674">And we stayed together the -- the three days in the wagon.</span> <span id="s2675">And when the door opened, there was -- wild guys came in, in those prison uniforms, and started to yell in German, out, out, out, hurry.</span> <span id="s2676">I looked back, and I could read backwards, from the back that sign, “Arbeit macht frei,” and Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2677">But it still didn’t mean anything to me, I [indecipherable] we coming to labor camp to do --</span></p> <p><span id="s2678">Q: You saw a sign that said Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s2679">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2680">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2681">A: On -- on that building, the railroad sta -- the railroad -- the -- the railroad station.</span> <span id="s2682">And one of those wild guys saw the two boys who were with me, and he asked them how old are you?</span> <span id="s2683">And they say 15.</span> <span id="s2684">He said, “You are 18.”</span> <span id="s2685">Without explaining why he said it, and where they should use it, and was also a man -- well, there were several men supporting themselves on a cane, and the same guy told them, don’t come out with a cane, leave the cane here.</span> <span id="s2686">Also, not saying why, so I’m sure the guy didn’t listen, if he needed a cane to support themself.</span> <span id="s2687">And we were put on five abreast lined up, the whole contingent.</span> <span id="s2688">And we were moving forward, and you can -- forward I saw two SS uniformed men with white gloves.</span> <span id="s2689">And when my -- when I was in the first row, they went to the -- through the five, and he just looked at me and waved me to one side.</span> <span id="s2690">And the boys were next to me, he asked them, “How old are you?”</span> <span id="s2691">Now it lit up in their head, and they said 18, and it was their luck because he send them to the good side.</span> <span id="s2692">So then we were -- when there were enough people together, we were marched along a -- those barbed wire fences.</span> <span id="s2693">And there was a guard, a SS with a rifle over his shoulder walking at [indecipherable], and I naively asked him, “What are those chimneys?”</span> <span id="s2694">They’re not only smoke coming out, also sparks, and flames.</span> <span id="s2695">I didn’t smell anything, and he said, “Oh, that’s the bakery, they must have burned the whole load of bread.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2696">Q: You didn’t smell anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s2697">A: No.</span> <span id="s2698">It could be the wind wasn’t coming in my direction.</span></p> <p><span id="s2699">Q: But you were in Birkenau?</span></p> <p><span id="s2700">A: Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s2701">Q: Mm-hm</span></p> <p><span id="s2702">A: And until we met some veterans, didn’t find out what this -- these chimneys are.</span> <span id="s2703">We were brought to a huge hall, with nothing in except benches around, and pegs on the wall.</span> <span id="s2704">And the pegs were numbered, and we were told to take everything off and hang it on a peg, and remember the number, so you can get back to your clothes.</span> <span id="s2705">Till the last moment were deceptions.</span> <span id="s2706">And everything you have in your pocket, throw -- there’s a blanket on the ground, throw out everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2707">Q: And who’s telling you this?</span> <span id="s2708">Are these --</span></p> <p><span id="s2709">A: SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s2710">Q: SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s2711">A: These were SS people.</span> <span id="s2712">Throw everything down.</span> <span id="s2713">And don’t let us find anything on you, you’ll get severely punished.</span> <span id="s2714">Then we were shaved, every hair on our body, and with me they had a lot of work because top of my head to the big toe, I’m hairy.</span> <span id="s2715">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s2716">Q: And they shaved all over your body?</span></p> <p><span id="s2717">A: All of the body, and then they did it with -- they never changed the blade, that was dull, they were pulling the hair, and ripping the skin, and after that, we were washed down with some disinfectant that burned in those scratches.</span> <span id="s2718">And then we were brought into shower.</span> <span id="s2719">Hot water, nice showering, after three days in fil -- filth.</span> <span id="s2720">There was no food the three days, and we still were not eating before the shower.</span> <span id="s2721">And from there, not coming back to the peg, but another door, they chased us out, naked and wet from a hot shower in the cold, wintry night, to another barrack, and then we’re marching along a counter, behind which some prisoners were sitting and throwing at us a pair of pants, a jacket, and a pair of boots.</span> <span id="s2722">And the hat to take off -- not a hat, a cap to take off when you meet an SS man, it was for no other reason there.</span> <span id="s2723">And those -- that clothing was without regard to our size.</span> <span id="s2724">So it was up to us then to exchange it so it fits.</span> <span id="s2725">And we were brought to a barrack, and I’ve no idea where I was in Birkenau, I couldn’t -- couldn’t identify where we were.</span> <span id="s2726">But the kids were with me, the two, and we were not working while we were in Auschwitz, in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s2727">During the day we were just in front of the barracks, hanging around, loitering they call it.</span> <span id="s2728">And [indecipherable] we went for the soup and the bread.</span> <span id="s2729">But every other day, or sometimes every day, and sometimes over three days break, people came to look for workers in their factories.</span> <span id="s2730">Civilians accompanied by an officer.</span> <span id="s2731">And we wanted to get away from those chimneys, so whatever, whoever they were looking for, we applied or [indecipherable] and we got away to a welding job, they were looking for welders.</span> <span id="s2732">There were 350 of us, and at that point, when we were accepted to become welders, they started to tattoo us, the numbers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2733">Q: So your -- how long are you in Auschwitz before --</span></p> <p><span id="s2734">A: I have no idea, but I know it --</span></p> <p><span id="s2735">Q: Week?</span> <span id="s2736">Two weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s2737">A: -- I know it wasn’t long.</span></p> <p><span id="s2738">Q: Wasn’t long.</span> <span id="s2739">Could have been a few days?</span></p> <p><span id="s2740">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2741">Q: But you were eating?</span></p> <p><span id="s2742">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2743">Q: Yes, they were feeding you?</span> <span id="s2744">So once you s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2745">A: Yeah, Auschwitz diet.</span></p> <p><span id="s2746">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2747">Worse than the Terezín diet, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2748">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2749">Q: So once you decide that you’re going to say that you’re welders --</span></p> <p><span id="s2750">A: I said anything I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2751">Q: Anything, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2752">A: -- but before they came to me, they had their contingent --</span></p> <p><span id="s2753">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2754">A: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2755">Q: So then they tattoo you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2756">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2757">And now if you were psychology PhD, I would ask you a question, but I have to live without the answer to that.</span> <span id="s2758">There were three guys doing the tattooing, and I was at the edge of my life, or edge of death, or whatever you call it in Auschwitz, and I went to see which one does it the nicest way.</span> <span id="s2759">And in that line I lined up.</span> <span id="s2760">I’ve seen guys with, you know, irregular numbers, b-big ones, small ones, sideways and so.</span> <span id="s2761">I wanted to have it neat.</span></p> <p><span id="s2762">Q: Can you show us your number?</span></p> <p><span id="s2763">A: I can show you this, and it’s very regular and neat.</span> <span id="s2764">It has to be read this way, I don’t know why they didn’t do it here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2765">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2766">A: 11636.</span></p> <p><span id="s2767">Q: It’s E11636.</span></p> <p><span id="s2768">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2769">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2770">A: And from that moment on -- I don’t know when in Auschwitz they called us by a name, but they must have, because people who were with me, I know in alphabetical order, they have either higher or lower number.</span> <span id="s2771">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2772">Q: So you must have been lined up alphabetically.</span></p> <p><span id="s2773">A: Alphabetically either by name, or they had documents, I -- I’m sure they had documents, because they came from Terezín, the documents came along.</span></p> <p><span id="s2774">Q: The documents came to Auschwitz from Terezín, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s2775">A: Yeah, the names of -- of the deportees.</span></p> <p><span id="s2776">Q: And were cards made out for you in Auschwitz, do you have any idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s2777">A: No, nothing was -- I -- I have no -- nobody asked, interviewed, nothing.</span> <span id="s2778">Th-They may have called my name, I don’t remember that part.</span> <span id="s2779">Just judging by the fact that I -- those whom I meet, whether their name starts with a lower or higher letter in the alphabet, they have a lower, or higher number of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2780">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2781">A: -- the tattoo.</span></p> <p><span id="s2782">Q: I think we have to stop the tape and change it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2783">End of Tape #9</span></p> <p><span id="s2784">Tape #10</span></p> <p><span id="s2785">Q: So you’re in Auschwitz for a few days.</span> <span id="s2786">Do you hear the orchestra when people --</span></p> <p><span id="s2787">A: No, not in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s2788">Q: Not in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s2789">A: No.</span> <span id="s2790">Although I read later on that they supposedly played upon arrival for the -- for the arriving prisoners to -- still to give them a -- an impression that they’re coming somewhere to a spa where the orchestra plays for them.</span> <span id="s2791">But I -- I have not heard or seen the orchestra in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s2792">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s2793">So when people were going to work, you didn’t hear anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s2794">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2795">Q: And were people near you in the barracks going to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s2796">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2797">Q: Going in and out -- no they weren’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s2798">A: No that was -- that was just those who waited to be taken away --</span></p> <p><span id="s2799">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2800">A: -- for jobs.</span></p> <p><span id="s2801">Q: And where were you sent?</span> <span id="s2802">Aft -- after your tattoo, you weren’t -- you had the same clothes, the same shoes, but they just tattooed you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2803">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2804">And we went to -- by tractor, or we walked, I don’t remember cause I forgot.</span> <span id="s2805">We went to the train, by whatever method.</span> <span id="s2806">It was the same cattle wagon, and we were going to Gleiwitz, which is nearby, and it also took longer than it should have taken because the military transports had priority on the track.</span> <span id="s2807">That’s why it took three days to go to Auschwitz, a trip that shouldn’t have taken longer than five, six hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s2808">Q: But you -- you were in Auschwitz before the uprising, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2809">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2810">Q: The uprising the end of October, so you have left by this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2811">A: Yeah, I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2812">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2813">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2814">Q: So they take you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2815">A: You mean the crematorium -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2816">Q: Yeah, yeah, the blow up, yes.</span> <span id="s2817">So you’re by train to Gleiwitz.</span> <span id="s2818">And what happens when you come to Gleiwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s2819">A: From Gleiwitz we marched through the streets, into the camp, there’s a huge camp.</span> <span id="s2820">And the whole camp was -- all inmates in that camp were working in a -- a railroad repair shop that was fixing wagons that were damaged by the Royal Air Force on the way to the front.</span> <span id="s2821">So with my experience, I did get a -- a cutting torch, at the gate, cutting off all the damaged parts of the wagon, and then the wagon went further on to be -- to -- to parts to be measured, and re-install the good parts.</span> <span id="s2822">And the job had a good side and a bad one.</span> <span id="s2823">Everything in life, I guess, has a good and a bad side.</span> <span id="s2824">The good one was when a wagon with garbage came in, I had the first pick.</span> <span id="s2825">The bad part was that was in the open gate, and we had nothing, we had no underwear, no socks, just those cotton pants and the -- and the jacket.</span> <span id="s2826">And -- very cold.</span> <span id="s2827">My meister was a -- a Pole -- a German Pole, or a Polish German.</span> <span id="s2828">A Pole of German nationality.</span> <span id="s2829">He wasn’t especially good, but he was one of those who was afraid to be good.</span> <span id="s2830">He wasn’t -- he wasn’t very bad, but y -- we worked 12 hour shifts, six days a week, one week day, one week night.</span> <span id="s2831">And when we went to work there was music in Gleiwitz, and when we came back was music.</span></p> <p><span id="s2832">Q: Musicians sitting outside, or walking --</span></p> <p><span id="s2833">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s2834">Q: Where were the musi -- or was the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2835">A: Next to the gate, standing --</span></p> <p><span id="s2836">Q: They were standing near the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2837">A: -- the musicians were standing next to the gate as we came in, and if we didn’t march in proper step, we were helped by a kick to improve the step.</span> <span id="s2838">Big guys like me deteriorated in Auschwitz much faster than the little skinny ones.</span> <span id="s2839">I guess our body required more than they were offering, and a lot of pussyboils presented themselves on my back.</span> <span id="s2840">And the pus rubbed off on the jacket, and when it dried, it rubbed back into the wounds.</span> <span id="s2841">I also had some that were not opened, were -- the skin didn’t break and the pus was pushing, and it was terrible pressure, and they were very painful.</span> <span id="s2842">And I didn’t want to go to the infirmary because the Germans didn’t like sick Jews, they liked them less than the healthy Jews.</span> <span id="s2843">So -- but it became unbearable, so I went.</span> <span id="s2844">And there was a French doctor, I don’t know whether he was a doctor, or just filled the position of a doctor -- a -- a prisoner, and he -- for anesthesia he put me down on a table face down, and for anesthesia he used three guys, two sitting each on one of my arms, and one sitting on my legs, and he proceeded to open those closed -- it was a split second unpleasant, but there was immediate relief, the pressure was gone.</span> <span id="s2845">So you bite your teeth together, and -- and I went immediately back.</span> <span id="s2846">There was no -- no bandage, no stitches, no nothing, just cut open, relief, and I went back to the barracks, and next shift I went to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2847">Q: And you’re welding?</span></p> <p><span id="s2848">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s2849">Q: You’re welding?</span></p> <p><span id="s2850">A: Welding, no, cutting with a torch.</span> <span id="s2851">I’m not -- welding is putting things together, I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2852">Q: Together, you were cutting things -- and the two boys were also with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2853">A: Each one, yeah.</span> <span id="s2854">In -- one in the carpentry shop, he -- because one worked in -- in Terezín in the carpentry shop, cause 15 and older had to work, and one of them was carrying the plumber’s toolbox.</span> <span id="s2855">So -- and they found similar jobs.</span> <span id="s2856">Whether they said what they did before, what their experience was -- I couldn’t say what my experience was.</span> <span id="s2857">And that second cook was in that same transport, and he came also to Auschwitz into Gleiwitz from the same camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2858">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2859">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2860">And so one day on the way home -- there was nothing -- I went -- we went full to e-elaborate on that job, other than only once in those 12 hours you were allowed to go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s2861">They took your number down, and if you came again, they kicked you out.</span> <span id="s2862">The guy who was there was called scheiss meister.</span> <span id="s2863">[indecipherable] to spell it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2864">Q: She may know how to spell that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2865">A: I -- I don’t know what people did who had diarrhea, but there must have been people with diarrhea.</span> <span id="s2866">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s2867">Th -- one day was really, really sick, tired and -- and I -- I really couldn’t perform.</span> <span id="s2868">So I found a place, and with these radiators with the ribs, you know?</span> <span id="s2869">There was one that allowed a little space between the wall and itself.</span> <span id="s2870">I leaned down behind it, and there was nice, warm, and I fell asleep.</span> <span id="s2871">It wasn’t difficult for me to fall asleep until I’ve been awakened with a -- a rifle butt by an SS man.</span> <span id="s2872">I think the -- the -- my meister must have told the guard that his helper is missing.</span> <span id="s2873">So he found me.</span> <span id="s2874">I’m glad I’m not bald because I have a very ugly protrusion still, on my head.</span> <span id="s2875">And so he kicked me in the behind and sent me back to work.</span> <span id="s2876">I was lucky he didn’t deport me.</span> <span id="s2877">So I did my work again, you know, you get this kind of encouragement with a boot, you continue to work.</span> <span id="s2878">One day after the shift, we go back to camp, there was a snow on the floor -- on the ground.</span> <span id="s2879">And I had wooden shoes, those Dutch wooden clogs, that was the only shoes that fitted me, that I got exchange.</span> <span id="s2880">They were good -- a good and the bad side.</span> <span id="s2881">The good was it insulated from the cold of the ground, but uncomfortable because they were not flexible.</span> <span id="s2882">Walking back to the camp, I see ahead of me a huge -- only maybe it just seemed that -- that huge to me, onion on the edge -- on the side of the road.</span> <span id="s2883">So I look back where the guard is, and told the guy behind me, step a little bit out of formation, cover me.</span> <span id="s2884">And I bent down, and picked it up and put it in the jacket to take it to camp, because whatever either one of the three of us found, stole, or otherwise, we shared.</span> <span id="s2885">So I took it in to share it with them.</span> <span id="s2886">And we were brought in and lined up on the roll call area for frisking.</span> <span id="s2887">We were frisked on -- infreque -- not infrequently like little, but unannounced because we were working with tools, and we could have made some weapon, a knife, or -- or something which the Germans did not like very much.</span> <span id="s2888">So what do I do with the onion?</span> <span id="s2889">If I throw it away and don’t say it was me, everybody gets punished, the old theme of collective punishment.</span> <span id="s2890">If I say it was me, they beat me to a pulp because they won’t believe I found it, they will think I stole -- they will insist I stole it.</span> <span id="s2891">Only one way out, to eat the onion, quickly.</span> <span id="s2892">This is with the peel and with those little roots on it.</span> <span id="s2893">The eyes were -- tears were coming down my cheeks, and the nose was running, and sweat in that cold, wintry day, sweat was coming up on my forehead.</span> <span id="s2894">And when he ca -- I finished it before he came to me, and I didn’t dare to breathe while he was frisking me.</span> <span id="s2895">And why I am saying it is a day or -- or t -- the next day or the day after, these wounds started to get smaller and less pus-y.</span></p> <p><span id="s2896">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2897">A: The one onion did a marvelous job.</span> <span id="s2898">But it was only one, and we continued days and weeks without another onion, so it opened up again, and the -- the pus-y routine has reappeared.</span> <span id="s2899">But it gave me enough respect for onions that I am consuming an awful lot of them, cooked or raw.</span> <span id="s2900">And recommending it to everybody.</span> <span id="s2901">I don’t remember much of happenings inside the camp.</span> <span id="s2902">This other cook, second cook from Prague, he had the chutzpah on a -- in -- on the -- on the road in the camp, to stop the camp commander, who was a s.o.b. you can say, no?</span> <span id="s2903">That’s in public.</span> <span id="s2904">He was the -- previously the commander of the crematorium and the gas chambers in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2905">And here was the lager kommandant, always walking with a dog.</span></p> <p><span id="s2906">Q: And his name, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2907">A: Yeah, Moll.</span> <span id="s2908">And he stopped him, he said, “Herr Kommandant, I would like to work in my profession.”</span> <span id="s2909">And he said, “What’s your profession?”</span> <span id="s2910">He said, “I’m a cook.”</span> <span id="s2911">He said, “Did you tell it when you came into this camp?”</span> <span id="s2912">He said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s2913">So next Sunday on the roll call, they pull him out and put him into the SS kitchen.</span> <span id="s2914">I wouldn’t have dared to say I’m a cook when I said I’m a welder.</span> <span id="s2915">I thought, you know -- anyway, he -- I never -- already the oldtimers in the kitchen, the veterans, they wouldn’t let him anywhere near, and he has to wash dishes, the floor, the tables, just the dirty work.</span> <span id="s2916">And one afternoon there was some mashed potatoes left from the SS menu, and he made like a decorating bag out of paper, and made some decorations like for a cake.</span> <span id="s2917">And the SS in charge of the SS kitchen was a baker, or a -- a -- call it baker patisserie, or the fine -- fine baker, you know, the -- how do you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2918">Q: Pastry chef?</span></p> <p><span id="s2919">A: Pastry chef.</span> <span id="s2920">What would I do without you?</span> <span id="s2921">Couldn’t complete the interview.</span> <span id="s2922">He saw this, “Who made this?”</span> <span id="s2923">And he said, “I did.”</span> <span id="s2924">“You did?”</span> <span id="s2925">He immediately made him the proviant meister, which was in the storeroom, giving out to the cooks the -- the food, the -- the -- the items to cook.</span> <span id="s2926">So he had everything, he was in there alone, no other veteran -- prior veteran.</span> <span id="s2927">He took care of everyone from Terezín he knew.</span> <span id="s2928">He saved my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2929">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2930">A: At 4:30 in the morning, behind the barracks, we crawled to that SS kitchen -- and several people, and he threw at us a -- a boiled potato unpeeled, or a piece of bread, or whatever was left over.</span> <span id="s2931">And when I was at night shift and couldn’t come to the kitchen, he left me some food on the beam in the latrine.</span> <span id="s2932">Not a very aesthetic place, but who cares?</span> <span id="s2933">And all these things, whatever he sa -- left there we -- the three of us shared.</span> <span id="s2934">And I don’t think I would have made it without him.</span> <span id="s2935">And so now again, nothing extraordinary.</span> <span id="s2936">I was lucky, I was never present at -- when there was some hangings, or when somebody got 25 or 40 lashes.</span> <span id="s2937">I never -- when I -- when we stood in the roll call place, I bent my knees not to stick out, because I was tall.</span> <span id="s2938">Cause they -- the tall ones and those who were in some way different than the rest, they pulled out for the nice jobs like cleaning latrines, and so -- so you learn how to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s2939">Q: And are you now hearing rumors about the war, that the Russians are getting closer?</span> <span id="s2940">Because it’s now what, November or December?</span></p> <p><span id="s2941">A: It was January already.</span></p> <p><span id="s2942">Q: It was January already by this time, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2943">A: And we did hear faint explosions like bombs and so.</span> <span id="s2944">And one day at n -- noon -- before noon -- before noon at the factory, over the loudspeaker came an announcement, all prisoners assemble where we usually assemble after the shift to go back.</span> <span id="s2945">And there was not much talking.</span> <span id="s2946">They counted us and marched us back to the camp.</span> <span id="s2947">No music was playing.</span> <span id="s2948">Lined up on the roll call area.</span> <span id="s2949">After awhile we were sent to the block -- to have -- to enjoy our own luxury, each one had a blanket.</span> <span id="s2950">We brought our blanket and it was a godsend because we could wrap it around and be a little less cold.</span> <span id="s2951">And soon thereafter we were marched out.</span> <span id="s2952">That was already afternoon, again without music, and that was the beginning of what they call a death march today.</span> <span id="s2953">With the kids on my side, we are together.</span> <span id="s2954">And there were no more kids, they were already adults, you know, this kind of a circumstance matures a person quickly.</span> <span id="s2955">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s2956">Q: Are you still wearing --</span></p> <p><span id="s2957">A: The shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2958">Q: The -- the wooden shoes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2959">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2960">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2961">A: And so we marched until late at night, and we came to an already abandoned camp, evacuated -- another evacuated labor camp.</span> <span id="s2962">So we were herded in, and right went into the bunk and fell asleep.</span> <span id="s2963">There was no food, no drink.</span> <span id="s2964">We were able to pick up some of the dirty snow from the road.</span> <span id="s2965">And early morning I was -- it was not -- before dawn, they woke us up, and the Germans insisted that we go as quickly as possible.</span> <span id="s2966">Now, we noticed whoever fell, couldn’t make it, was shot on the road.</span> <span id="s2967">On the first day with one of the kids, we were supporting one who couldn’t road -- couldn’t walk any more, you know, the shoulder, and under the arm.</span> <span id="s2968">And we could do it as -- as long as he could move his feet -- his legs forward.</span> <span id="s2969">But then he became totally heavy, we had a dead weight, and we ourselves were already weak.</span> <span id="s2970">So we just couldn’t continue to drag him, and then when we heard the shot it was like -- it felt like I was shot, you know, the -- the guy -- I felt guilty that time, I felt guilty that I didn’t try more.</span> <span id="s2971">But it wouldn’t have helped, I could have only weakened myself, and wouldn’t have helped him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2972">Q: So you both let him go, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2973">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2974">Q: And then you heard a shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s2975">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2976">And then the next day after this camp, we were marched again, there was no food, no drink.</span> <span id="s2977">Continued with the dirty snow, and at late at night again, we came to a barn.</span> <span id="s2978">We were herded in, the -- they -- they closed the barn.</span> <span id="s2979">And that was nice because there was something, we didn’t recognize it in the dark, hay or straw.</span> <span id="s2980">We crawled in and had a warm, soft sleep.</span> <span id="s2981">On that day my -- on top of the shoe where the laces are -- there are no laces on the wooden, but on where on other shoes are the laces, a little triangular piece broke out, and two sharp corners were digging into my foot.</span> <span id="s2982">And that was very unpleasant.</span> <span id="s2983">I don’t know where and how I found a piece of wax cloth, I think in that barn or around it, and I wrapped my feet into that, and that’s like McDonald uses this checkered tablecloth?</span></p> <p><span id="s2984">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2985">A: That kind of material.</span> <span id="s2986">It did not insulate me any more from the cold, but it didn’t hurt like the -- that shoe.</span> <span id="s2987">But early in the morning on the third day I felt -- I -- I will be one of those shot on the road.</span> <span id="s2988">I am weak, tired, tough trying to drag my feet.</span> <span id="s2989">And the kids were in -- in fairly good shape, because I mentioned the smaller ones and skinny one tolerated it better.</span> <span id="s2990">So I said, if I stay here, I get shot.</span> <span id="s2991">I try to escape.</span> <span id="s2992">Whatever chance I have, I will take it.</span> <span id="s2993">If it’s 10 percent, I’ll take 10 percent of success to escape.</span> <span id="s2994">And so I told them, stay together and help each other if you need to, and I can’t any more, and I have no use to you anyway.</span> <span id="s2995">So we come to a forest, tall forest on both sides of the road, no moon, real dark.</span> <span id="s2996">So that was the moment.</span> <span id="s2997">I slipped to -- into the ditch on the side of the road.</span> <span id="s2998">I don’t know why I didn’t encourage the kids to do it too, but I felt I don’t want to be responsible in case -- you know, to suggest something where they may suffer.</span> <span id="s2999">And I laid down in the snow, face down.</span> <span id="s3000">And there was -- must have been a zealous guard who shot me.</span> <span id="s3001">And whether it was the dark, or whether it was frozen fingers, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3002">He shot me under the arm, and the bullet got stuck in the rib.</span> <span id="s3003">And the snow -- the -- the blood was color -- starting to color the snow, and that was good, because nobody else attempted a second shot, that the guy must have had it, you know, but -- so when the column past, I suddenly had strength to pick myself up, and went into the forest, and found like minded people, other prisoners who escaped, having been lucky, not getting shot.</span> <span id="s3004">So we huddled together and used the blanket in ma -- outside in -- in January in the forest with this -- just a cotton uniform, and I think we all slept, sitting, holding each other.</span> <span id="s3005">And in the morning we went to the edge of the forest, that the road we came from, looking whether we find a sign where we are, what’s happening.</span> <span id="s3006">And we see the top of the hill another camp.</span> <span id="s3007">The gate is open, no guard in the watch tower, and prisoners walking in and out.</span> <span id="s3008">So inside the forest we ran -- suddenly we could not only walk, we could run, near to that camp, and we asked one of the prisoners, “Well what -- well what is this?”</span> <span id="s3009">He said, “I don’t know, but before dawn, all the Germans jumped into car -- into the trucks and took off.”</span> <span id="s3010">Didn’t even take the time to liquidate the camp, with machine guns, and -- and hand grenades.</span> <span id="s3011">So what really happened, in that area, a Russian tank force cut a wedge into the German front.</span> <span id="s3012">And of course they didn’t want to be caught by the Russians, so they jumped in the trucks and left in a hurry.</span> <span id="s3013">We -- I went into the camp, and saw guys from our camp.</span> <span id="s3014">I said, “Where were you located?”</span> <span id="s3015">Sort of the last block, because that was the last group that arrived there.</span> <span id="s3016">And I found the two kids there, and we started to look for food, but we didn’t find any, because those who were there already, they plundered the -- the -- the potato storage, and all -- all other storages.</span> <span id="s3017">But somebody told us there’s, on the side the road, is a abandoned village where the German population ran the same way as the SS, and there’s food in their pantries.</span> <span id="s3018">So we went there, not far, and there’s food.</span> <span id="s3019">Everything except bread.</span> <span id="s3020">They must have taken the loaf and bread and ran.</span> <span id="s3021">The speed at which they ran wa -- showed itself.</span> <span id="s3022">That was unfinished food, even unfinished food on the table, and the rest was burned in the oven, or on top of the range.</span> <span id="s3023">So we had food, and there was no -- at that time there was no refrigeration in Europe [indecipherable] I don’t know, a few people may have had a refrigerator, and -- we want to break --</span></p> <p><span id="s3024">Q: I -- I --</span></p> <p><span id="s3025">A: -- at the refrigerator, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3026">Q: At the refrigerator, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3027">End of Tape #10</span></p> <p><span id="s3028">Tape #11</span></p> <p><span id="s3029">Q: Edgar, you didn’t describe your wound and what happened, because it seems impossible that you were running after a night of bleeding.</span> <span id="s3030">So what happened when you met these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s3031">A: I -- after I picked myself up from the ground, I was pr-pressing my arm against the wound, and lo and behold, among those in the forest was the French doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s3032">Q: Which French doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s3033">A: The French doctor from -- that operated on my back.</span></p> <p><span id="s3034">Q: You’re kidding.</span></p> <p><span id="s3035">A: No.</span> <span id="s3036">And anybody who has some function in a concentration camp has different degrees of privileges according to the degree of the function.</span> <span id="s3037">And it must have been his privilege to have a pocket knife, which we were not allowed to have.</span> <span id="s3038">And people see that around this time without other guys, just with snow as a somewhat numbing agent, and he had to make another hole because the bullet was away from where it entered.</span> <span id="s3039">And he pulled it out, wriggling and wiggling.</span> <span id="s3040">And I continued to do the same thing, holding my arm against the body until the blood dried, and -- and later on I started to take advantage of my profession, and -- by feeding myself, I gained enough healing power that it healed without bandages, without stitches.</span></p> <p><span id="s3041">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3042">A: There was no -- there wa -- there was no doctor --</span></p> <p><span id="s3043">Q: Did you eat more onions?</span></p> <p><span id="s3044">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s3045">Q: Did you eat more onions?</span></p> <p><span id="s3046">A: Okay, now we stopped before the bullet -- or that was after the bullet --</span></p> <p><span id="s3047">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3048">A: We stopped in that village, and I mentioned there were no refrigerators used.</span> <span id="s3049">If this is a kosher tape I can’t mention it.</span> <span id="s3050">People were -- had all kinds of preservation methods of food without refrigerator.</span> <span id="s3051">So the first thing I found was a -- like a gallon jug glass jar, with roasted pork, covered with rendered lard, which prevents the -- the oxygen reaching the meat, and the meat therefore, does not spoil.</span> <span id="s3052">And after months of Auschwitz diet, and three days absolutely nothing, I dug into that lard, and ate it like that.</span> <span id="s3053">No bread, no nothing.</span> <span id="s3054">And I still don’t understand that this didn’t kill me faster than -- than the Auschwitz diet.</span> <span id="s3055">But it had a effec -- had it’s effects.</span> <span id="s3056">This was a huge place, the -- that camp was called Blechhammer, and it was part of a huge industrial complex.</span> <span id="s3057">All the camp inmates were working in it -- of forced laborers from occupied countries were there, and POW’s were also there, and were working.</span> <span id="s3058">We found the camp of the British prisoners of war, and for some reason -- they were bombing London, but for some reason they were treating the British POW’s very well.</span> <span id="s3059">We found in that barrack warm uniforms, boots, socks, scarves, caps, coats, and a lot of toilet paper, which saved us from result of the way we were eating.</span> <span id="s3060">There were 10 of us in -- in one of those barracks, there were two toilets, one on each end, and that wasn’t enough.</span> <span id="s3061">So they brought from the village, I don’t know, somewhere, a huge half barrel, like a big whiskey barrel.</span> <span id="s3062">I put two boards across so four could sit at the same time.</span> <span id="s3063">That bad it was.</span> <span id="s3064">I started to improvise cooking, and one guy was helping me, and eight did -- the rest of the 10, the eight went to town to bring supplies.</span> <span id="s3065">The one kid I mentioned was working the carpentry shop in Terezín, he made a sled so more stuff could be brought.</span> <span id="s3066">And there’s one point he brought the whole -- took out from one of those houses a kitchen stove, including the pipes.</span> <span id="s3067">He installed it, and then we were really cooking.</span> <span id="s3068">The Russian soldiers came to eat, to us, because they didn’t get food like that.</span> <span id="s3069">It was another compliment for the aunt.</span> <span id="s3070">And we’re cooking till 10 in the evening, and by 10:15, there wasn’t a bite to be had.</span> <span id="s3071">That’s how we ate.</span> <span id="s3072">No -- no control.</span> <span id="s3073">And the Russian soldiers told us how wonderful Communism is, everybody is even, and it’s the best system, until a Jewish officer came, a Russian Jewish officer, said, “Don’t believe a word.”</span> <span id="s3074">We were thinking of Communism, because that’s a -- was presented to us as a real equal society, a society of equal people.</span> <span id="s3075">But he set us straight.</span> <span id="s3076">We were six weeks in that British barracks, because between where we were, and our home, they were still fighting.</span> <span id="s3077">You know, from the east front, we were here, and Prague was here, and the Russians were only getting there.</span> <span id="s3078">So for six weeks we suffered terrible diarrhea.</span> <span id="s3079">And in spite of it, I gained 79 pounds within six weeks, with my own cooking.</span> <span id="s3080">I said -- what’s her name, I fi -- know this -- this diet advertiser, Jenny Craig would have gone crazy if she heard that somebody gained 79 pounds in six weeks.</span> <span id="s3081">And everybody -- after six weeks we moved out of there, and went to Katowice -- here come friend of the spelling.</span> <span id="s3082">And they put us up in the schoolhouse where or -- other -- other form of prisoners were.</span> <span id="s3083">And the Polish Red Cross gave us identification papers based on what we told them, because we didn’t have anything to show.</span> <span id="s3084">But we needed something because we were in the Russian occupied zone, and I don’t know how long we were there.</span> <span id="s3085">One of the tenant was a chemist, and he found a job in a smoke factory there, to earn some money.</span> <span id="s3086">And next day he comes and says, “Come with me, they need a cook in the employees cafeteria, in the manager’s restaurant.”</span> <span id="s3087">I have absolutely no recollection that I worked there, until I read one of the two kids memoirs, where he names the factory.</span> <span id="s3088">So the name immediately sprang up, and I knew I know it.</span> <span id="s3089">But even with that knowledge, I could not remember that I worked there.</span> <span id="s3090">But I must have, because they all told me, and I brought food to the school for them.</span> <span id="s3091">So -- and I don’ know how long we were there.</span> <span id="s3092">Somehow time is not very noticeable, if you don’t have a calendar, you don’t have a routine, and that responsibility.</span> <span id="s3093">Okay, and then we picked ourselves up and went home by means of freight trains, military trucks, horse-drawn carriages, walking.</span> <span id="s3094">We were already strengthened -- strong by that time.</span> <span id="s3095">The day we moved out from that British barrack, the diarrhea stopped like immediately.</span> <span id="s3096">And our digestive systems started to work normally, cause we didn’t eat like pigs any more.</span> <span id="s3097">Oh, there was a -- and one story, and it’s a funny story, one of the guys came and said down a little past the village is a pig farm, and a lot of pigs there, and nobody’s watching them, feeding them.</span> <span id="s3098">So I found some -- a little hammer and a piece of rope, and we said we go down and get ourselves a pig with the sled.</span> <span id="s3099">And I go there, and there were lots of pigs running around, and they were in the building.</span> <span id="s3100">So I found one, tied a rope to his hind leg, and tied the rope to the -- to that column, the supporting column, and hit him on the head, that’s how you kill pigs.</span> <span id="s3101">But the hammer was small, and I was not strong enough yet, and when you hit them here, it swells up and you can never break his skull any more.</span> <span id="s3102">So it was screaming there, and suddenly we hear machine gun fire.</span> <span id="s3103">I -- oh my God, the Germans are back.</span> <span id="s3104">So we look out, and on top of that farm, a Russian column, military column pass by, and one was shooting the pigs with a machine gun, and they were throwing them at cars and trucks as they ro -- drove by.</span> <span id="s3105">And the guy sees me with a knife, and commandeered me to about 12 or 13 pigs to eviscerate them.</span> <span id="s3106">They want -- he want only the meat, not the innard.</span> <span id="s3107">So I did that, and I said, “Now I worked for you, now you come and shoot my pig.”</span> <span id="s3108">And one of those wanted only the two hind legs, it was a [indecipherable] soldier.</span> <span id="s3109">So we had one and a half pig, and a innards from a liver, and the organs from 12 more pigs.</span> <span id="s3110">I don’t even know how we brought it all on that sled.</span> <span id="s3111">We were rendering the lard till 10 at night.</span> <span id="s3112">And there was no worry about refrigeration, it was cold enough.</span> <span id="s3113">So that -- we consumed all that -- I’m sorry -- okay, we started on our way home from Katowice, and we had to go -- I told you all the means we went, but I have to turn around to tell you -- to give you the direction.</span> <span id="s3114">We were here, in Katowice.</span> <span id="s3115">We went to the Ukraine, to Romania, to Hungary, Austria and Prague.</span></p> <p><span id="s3116">Q: That’s a long trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s3117">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3118">And in Ukraine was an office of the Joint, and they were giving to Jewish prisoners some onion.</span> <span id="s3119">But you had to prove that you a Jew, so if you knew a [indecipherable] or something, a prayer, was fine.</span> <span id="s3120">If -- some of those who never learned anything, they had to take their pants off to prove they are Jewish.</span> <span id="s3121">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s3122">Q: How did women prove they were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s3123">A: That was my question.</span> <span id="s3124">That was my question and still is.</span> <span id="s3125">So came to lac -- I think two days after, one day or two days after the war officially ended, and right away I went to Terezín to see if my parents are there, and they were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3126">Q: Were you shocked?</span></p> <p><span id="s3127">A: No, i -- when something nice happens, you don’t get shocked.</span> <span id="s3128">I asked Mother, “Weren’t you worried?”</span> <span id="s3129">“No, I knew God wouldn’t do this to me.</span> <span id="s3130">He will send you back.”</span> <span id="s3131">Such a strong belief.</span> <span id="s3132">She didn’t -- it’s [indecipherable] it’s good, I mean a good disposition.</span></p> <p><span id="s3133">Q: But your father was worried?</span></p> <p><span id="s3134">A: Father was worried and he was -- he was very excited to see me back.</span></p> <p><span id="s3135">Q: To see you, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3136">A: There was meanwhile a quarantine in Terezín because some of the death marchers wor -- were brought near there, from Poland to Mauthausen, either through the Czech territory, or right outside, where Terezín was the nearest place, so they brought all these sick people in, including the dead.</span> <span id="s3137">There was a crematorium in Terezín.</span> <span id="s3138">They started first, when few people died, individual graves.</span> <span id="s3139">My grandmother is in an individual grave.</span> <span id="s3140">Then mass graves, without -- without coffins because the Germans wouldn’t supply wood for that.</span> <span id="s3141">And when that wasn’t enough space for mass -- more mass graves, they built a crematorium, and the bodies were cremated.</span> <span id="s3142">So I [indecipherable] was a quarantine, and people brought in typhoid, and scarlet fever, and all kind.</span> <span id="s3143">And I must say, my wife, I don’t know how she did it, they were friends from before, that’s when they started to believe what happened.</span> <span id="s3144">Her friends she has from before, one in one place with typhoid, one with the scarlet fever.</span> <span id="s3145">This one couldn’t eat, so she took his food to the other one, and she never got anything, and was lucky.</span> <span id="s3146">I went home, and started to look for an apartment, and there was a -- you know, you couldn’t like here go to someone, to a landlord and rent an apartment.</span> <span id="s3147">That was all operated by a -- a housing cop -- not a cooperation, a state housing office.</span> <span id="s3148">And they didn’t come Tuesday, come Wednesday, come the afternoon, come day after.</span> <span id="s3149">I said, “What the hell happened?</span> <span id="s3150">The Jews didn’t come back.</span> <span id="s3151">The Germans you have expelled, what happened to the apartments?”</span> <span id="s3152">I was too di -- naïve and dumb to know that he wanted some -- something for the apartment.</span> <span id="s3153">So it took almost two weeks before I lost my patience, and I took a chair and banged it on his desk, the desk collapsed, and I said, “And you are next.”</span> <span id="s3154">The -- “Wait, wait, wait, maybe we can find something.”</span> <span id="s3155">In the afternoon I had a apartment and I was mad at myself that I waited with this -- with this extended patience, that I waited that long, I could have had an apartment two weeks before.</span> <span id="s3156">So then my parents came and -- thought you said you wanted this after -- at another time, or just so long -- as long as the tape runs?</span></p> <p><span id="s3157">Q: Well, let’s see, how -- how much more time do we have on the tape?</span> <span id="s3158">Oh, well let’s continue a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s3159">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3160">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s3161">Q: Do you bring -- do you bring your parents from Terezín?</span></p> <p><span id="s3162">A: I brought the parents from Terezín and now we -- I don’t know where we got some furniture.</span> <span id="s3163">Maybe the house -- th-the apartment was furnished, I don’t remember the details.</span> <span id="s3164">But I took two jobs because I needed to earn enough money for the three of us, and provide the things that we did not have after coming back from Terezín.</span> <span id="s3165">So one job was where I took my apprenticeship, a day job, and then I worked in the evening in a restaurant where they also had the bar.</span> <span id="s3166">And that -- there I worked at -- at night, and a lot of people who returned came to that evening restaurant and to the bar.</span> <span id="s3167">And in October ’46 -- until October ’46, when I was in inducted into the Czech army as a reserve, in the reserves, cause I was older than inducting age, for five months.</span> <span id="s3168">And somehow, a United Nations request to the other states was to reduce the military, the numbers in -- of the people in the military.</span> <span id="s3169">And the easiest -- the Czechs and for others, I guess, was to get rid of, was the shortest ones in, because they had not invested a lot of effort into them, and the others were already more valuable by having been trained.</span> <span id="s3170">So I was let go on the New Year’s Eve, 1946.</span> <span id="s3171">And then I worked in a hotel in Prague.</span> <span id="s3172">I have a certificate informing me and everybody else who wants to look at, that I worked there to their full satisfaction.</span> <span id="s3173">I don’t remember the kitchen, the time that I did work there, the people with whom I worked.</span> <span id="s3174">And it’s a -- it’s an hotel on -- on the Wencel Square.</span> <span id="s3175">And -- and that’s it, I have a -- I have a -- a [indecipherable] or certificate that I -- document that I worked there.</span> <span id="s3176">Anyway, in the spring of ’47, I si --</span></p> <p><span id="s3177">Q: Don’t you meet somebody New Year’s Eve, on 1946?</span></p> <p><span id="s3178">A: Oh my God, this woman.</span> <span id="s3179">Yes, I did, some -- meet somebody.</span> <span id="s3180">I thought she will tell the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s3181">Q: But you met Hana, your wife, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s3182">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3183">Q: At least the person who became your wife, you didn’t know that [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3184">A: Yeah, one of the friends whom I also met in Terezín after I came back, with a New Year’s Eve party in her sister’s apartment, and invited me.</span> <span id="s3185">I don’t know, I came only back from the military, how I found out there is a party, how she got to me, I don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s3186">But I know that I went, and Hana came with somebody, who was another fr -- childhood friend, who was much younger than she.</span> <span id="s3187">A he friend, but not a boyfriend.</span> <span id="s3188">And also somebody who came back alone.</span> <span id="s3189">So they went together, and I don’t -- didn’t know how tough it will be to live with her, but somehow I started a relationship with her.</span> <span id="s3190">And I -- I don’t like dancing, but I thought it’s what girl’s like, so I invited her to dance.</span> <span id="s3191">And she called the other girl, in whose house we had the party.</span> <span id="s3192">“Edgar wants us to come -- wants you to come to dance.”</span> <span id="s3193">And she said, “Well why didn’t he call me directly?”</span> <span id="s3194">She said, “I don’t know what.”</span> <span id="s3195">So I was dancing with both of them, and I hate to dance, always did.</span> <span id="s3196">But I thought it’s -- you know, instead of the other introductory sentences.</span> <span id="s3197">And then the second time I said, “Would you like to come without a chaperone?”</span> <span id="s3198">And somehow we did, and we had a relationship until, I think a few weeks, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3199">I don’t know about time, she -- she remembers better.</span> <span id="s3200">She remembers even -- she said she could never -- you won’t have a problem [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3201">She even remembers what I supposedly promised 53 years ago.</span> <span id="s3202">She still [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3203">I have [indecipherable] cook, I want to be a good cook, and there was not much to cook with in Czechoslovakia after the war.</span> <span id="s3204">So I wrote to the Swiss Chamber of Commerce that I would like to work there in the coming season, and I started in -- to work in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s3205">But before we -- I went to Switzerland, there’s another thing I don’t like, I don’t like movies, because I can sleep cheaper at home.</span> <span id="s3206">And she insisted she wanted to go to a movie.</span> <span id="s3207">I said, “I am not going,” Yes, and she want -- I said, “If you want to go, you stand in line for the tickets.”</span> <span id="s3208">And she did, and she came with the ticket, and I said, “You know, maybe we should not go, and should go to your apartment, have some other kind of fun.”</span> <span id="s3209">And that was the end, she walked away, and I didn’t see her until I came back from Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s3210">Q: And then you started up again.</span></p> <p><span id="s3211">A: Yeah, I don’t know why, but some -- something told me to --</span></p> <p><span id="s3212">Q: Something told -- told you to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3213">A: -- go -- to go and see her.</span></p> <p><span id="s3214">Q: And you married in 1949?</span></p> <p><span id="s3215">A: Yeah, and then she proposed and wouldn’t take no for an answer, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s3216">Q: There you were.</span></p> <p><span id="s3217">A: I’m in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3218">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3219">A: For life.</span></p> <p><span id="s3220">Q: Well, I know there’s much more to say --</span></p> <p><span id="s3221">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3222">Q: -- but I -- I think we’ll have to wait for another time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3223">A: I thought, three o’clock, that’s nine to three, six hours, that’s six o’clock.</span> <span id="s3224">You did a marvelous job, and these two guys, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s3225">Q: Well ha -- they’re great.</span> <span id="s3226">Tell me, if you can, how you think your experience affected your life?</span> <span id="s3227">Did it change you very much?</span></p> <p><span id="s3228">A: The camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s3229">Q: The camp, Terezín -- Terezín, Auschwitz, Gleiwitz.</span> <span id="s3230">Did you become a different person?</span></p> <p><span id="s3231">A: I don’t think so, I -- I think I didn’t have time to reflect much.</span> <span id="s3232">I [indecipherable] the Swiss took great advantage of me because for a g -- a guy who wants to come, they didn’t ask me, I asked them, so I thought -- and I went -- I worked in the restaurants, when you -- first in Interlaken, then in Lausanne, and in the [indecipherable] the hotel school, operated by the chef’s association.</span> <span id="s3233">And in the afternoon, from two to five, when a hotel [indecipherable] five to work for the dinner, I went to school there, and then I was in -- in Arosa for the winter, and from two to five I was cleaning.</span> <span id="s3234">And next spring I went to Lausanne where I learned my French.</span> <span id="s3235">And at that time the Communists took over in Czechoslovakia, and I didn’t want to go back.</span> <span id="s3236">And at that time Czechoslovakia, on the Russian request, have supported Israel with selling arms, training pilots, and letting every Jew go who wanted to join the Israeli army, the Hagana.</span> <span id="s3237">So I told my father I-I want to go to Israel, then we can [indecipherable] and live a certain time on the [indecipherable] there’s a ship.</span> <span id="s3238">At that time I already knew more about the Communists.</span> <span id="s3239">So -- and bec -- I went to Israel and when things calmed down, they come and joined me, about a year or [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3240">They couldn’t imagine to a --</span></p> <p><span id="s3241">Q: Yes [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3242">A: -- foreign country, that just finished a war.</span> <span id="s3243">And so I went back and said, “I stay as long as I can leave legally.”</span></p> <p><span id="s3244">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3245">And then you left in 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s3246">A: And then as I said, she proposed, and somehow she got pregnant, and they had to close the border, and I didn’t want to go with a baby, because most people who left [indecipherable] with a baby to chloroform it, and so it doesn’t cry, and bring the attention of the border guard.</span> <span id="s3247">So we left [indecipherable] I worked in the Israeli embassy as a chef when I came back.</span> <span id="s3248">And they helped me, and I helped them, because when the borders were closed, they were helping people who had no papers to move to Israel.</span> <span id="s3249">And suddenly all the ways were closed, and something seemed to maybe work, and I was the guinea pig, and [indecipherable] really volunteered to find out, and it succeeded for the benefit of them and mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s3250">Q: I know this is cutting your story short, and you were in Israel until ’62 --</span></p> <p><span id="s3251">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3252">Q: -- and came to the United States, yes?</span> <span id="s3253">So the tape is going to run out, so what I want to do right now is just thank you very much, for a very long, and very interesting story.</span></p> <p><span id="s3254">A: You don’t have to thank me, that -- this was the longest presentation I made, and that -- it wasn’t complete ye -- isn’t complete yet, so what I’m glad that I have a -- a -- you know, when I speak elsewhere, I get maybe two hours, I’m happy.</span> <span id="s3255">But here I could provide details and think about them, all not to -- it’s blinking -- not to --</span></p> <p><span id="s3256">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3257">A: -- not to think which details to leave out and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s3258">Q: Well thank you so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s3259">A: It was my pleasure, no, it was refreshing.</span> <span id="s3260">A refreshing lunch, refreshing company.</span></p> <p><span id="s3261">Q: Good.</span></p> <p><span id="s3262">End of Tape #11</span></p> <p><span id="s3263">Tape #12</span></p> <p><span id="s3264">Q: Edgar, what is this photograph?</span></p> <p><span id="s3265">A: This is my grandmother on my mother’s side.</span> <span id="s3266">I knew her only three years, a-actually only towards the end, she died when ou -- little after I was three years old, and the only thing I remember, that she always wore an apron any time of the day, and that she told my mother, “Don’t hit the boy, he’s such a nice child.”</span> <span id="s3267">So she loved me already when I was three years old, and my mother was hitting me before then, keep me straight.</span></p> <p><span id="s3268">Q: And do you remember her na -- do you remember her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s3269">A: Catherine Heller, H-e-l-l-e-r, née Pick, P-i-c-k.</span></p> <p><span id="s3270">Q: Okay.</span>

postcard, but the interesting thing of it is that all the pictures of Charles Bridge are made from the other side with the Prague castle in the background.</span></p> <p><span id="s3361">Q: And how did you get this photogr -- this painting?</span></p> <p><span id="s3362">A: He gave it to me as a --</span></p> <p><span id="s3363">Q: He gave it to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s3364">A:

id="s3386">And looking on is Hana, my wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s3387">Q: And this?</span></p> <p><span id="s3388">A: And this is the -- a caricature, drawn by Leo Haas, of Hana’s father in Terezín, in 1943.</span> <span id="s3389">And you can’t see it in this small dimension, on the bottom is a -- like a sheet of paper with a heading report, and a arm reaching out, chasing a cook.</span> <span id="s3390">Because her father was the -- the head of the -- we call it economic police, whose charge it was to avoid, or minimize, at least, theft in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s3391">Q: And how old was your mother then, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s3392">A: How long what?</span></p> <p><span id="s3393">Q: How old is your mother?</span></p> <p><span

remember his name.</span> <span id="s3401">This was made, and also Hana’s, in a jewelry shop that existed in Terezín, where the -- the prisoners ma -- made jewelry for the Germans, and most of it was sent to Germany for sale.</span> <span id="s3402">This is some scrap metal, I think, because it’s not silver.</span> <span id="s3403">They -- on the top you see the cook that it was you symbolize my profession there.</span> <span id="s3404">And then the AK is the designation of the first transport, Aufbaukommando, which is the construction command, or construction detail, and the 268 was my number, and I think it was in alphabetical order, organized.</span> <span id="s3405">And on the bottom is the town emblem of Terezín, and the 1944, that’s when I must have gotten it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3406">Q: Did you ever wear this as a pin?</span></p> <p><span id="s3407">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3408">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3409">A: No --</span></p> <p><span
