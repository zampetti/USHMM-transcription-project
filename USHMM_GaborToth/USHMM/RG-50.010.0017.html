seen some of the pictures of the bodies stacked up in a circle like cordwood.</span> <span id="s4">They left them there for three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">Q: When you came in there, you knew that they had left them there for three days?</span> <span id="s6">A: No, it was the first day that I went in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Q: You were one of the first units to enter?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: None of them entered [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s9">They just went over and took control of it, and then some went in to tell them that they didn't have to worry.</span> <span id="s10">Then they sent in a kitchen group and a clean up group and then the clean up group called the surgeon of the First Army.</span> <span id="s11">I was with the First Army and the First Army was first in everything.</span> <span id="s12">We made the invasion of France.</span> <span id="s13">We were the first ones into Belgium.</span> <span id="s14">We took Paris.</span> <span id="s15">We were the first ones in the Netherlands.</span> <span id="s16">We were the first ones in Germany.</span> <span id="s17">We were the first ones across the Rhine.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: You were number one all the way around.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: All the way.</span> <span id="s20">And before we left Jena, we'd been to a small town called Kovach.</span> <span id="s21">I was in the advance group of our unit, and about three weeks before, some guys in the First Division had got into an Arbeit Amt 1 there.</span> <span id="s22">They had cracked open the safe and got out two and a half million marks, which were worth 10 cents a piece.</span> <span id="s23">We found a big safe in this Arbeit Amt so the sergeant and I went to work on the darn thing and opened it up.</span> <span id="s24">It took us five hours and we got 100 marks which is $10.00 but more important, we had the records of everybody in that</span></p> <p><span id="s25">1A work office whole geographic area as to when they had joined the Nazi Party and for Intelligence this was great.</span> <span id="s26">We had the ones that joined in 1933 and 1934 when they were just starting the Nazi Party.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: The beginning of the set-up, the Nazi set-up.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: That was the beginning of it and then, of course, when Hitler got power, everybody had to join.</span> <span id="s29">But this Intelligence was great because they had the records of the people that were first active in the Nazi Party.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q And you were able to give it to somebody in....</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s32">We turned the whole thing over.</span> <span id="s33">It was a great big safe and it had the records of 100,000 people, as to when they had joined the Nazi Party.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: So you were really part of a very important historical finding.</span> <span id="s35">A: Intelligence liked that.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: I'm sure.</span> <span id="s37">When did you get into Jena to the best of your recollection?</span> <span id="s38">A: I think it was early April.</span> <span id="s39">I'm not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Of 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s42">I think we crossed the Rhine about the 20th of March.</span> <span id="s43">I just don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: It's hard to recall those dates.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: What happened there was that the 8th Division liberated people in the Klingelputz Prison, which is in Cologne, and this was our first experience with what to do about prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: Were you told before you got there anything you were going to see or given any orders as to what you would have to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: No.</span> <span id="s48">Actually, in the Prison at Klingelputz there was nothing particularly there.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">It was just a regular prison.</span> <span id="s50">It was a city prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: A criminal prison?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Except that over 50% of the people there were on their way to the camps and 50% were criminals.</span> <span id="s53">What happened was that they had a breakout of typhus in that prison.</span> <span id="s54">When the 8th Division liberated them, they threw open the doors and said, "Everybody go."</span> <span id="s55">They were going to be real good to them.</span> <span id="s56">So they all left but most of them were coming down with typhus.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: And took the typhus with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: And took the typhus with them.</span> <span id="s59">And, of course, then it began to show up.</span> <span id="s60">The prisoners knew the Americans were definitely going to be there, and the day after we were there the political prisoners all came to the surface.</span> <span id="s61">But the criminals did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: They thought they had to run.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Dr. Schneider and I spent three or four weeks tracing typhus up and down the Rhine Valley.</span> <span id="s64">I was taken away from my unit and worked with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: How did you go about tracing typhus up and down the Rhine Valley?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: We had to contact the local German physicians and they got somebody with the peculiar illness.</span> <span id="s67">They got [unintelligible] what we had to do...by this time it was presenting a problem and we learned how to handle it a little bit better.</span> <span id="s68">What we did was set up road blocks and everybody who went through had themselves and their clothes dusted with DDT, and that stopped it.</span> <span id="s69">But we still had to find isolated outbreaks.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: When you contacted the German doctors, had you already seen the results of the concentration camp at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: No, because this was at Klingelputz and there were no...Dachau was down by Munich and Auschwitz was in Poland, and Buchenwald was in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Belsen, I guess, was up in north Germany and the Russians got Belsen.</span> <span id="s73">It is now Poland, but it was then north Germany and east Prussia and we didn’t get to that; but we got to Buchenwald and Dachau at about the same time.</span> <span id="s74">But it was different Armies.</span> <span id="s75">Dachau was down by Munich and Buchenwald was just outside of Jena.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: I hear your German is fairly good, too.</span> <span id="s77">Did you speak German before you entered?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: [In German] Yes, I spoke.</span> <span id="s79">I understand.</span> <span id="s80">Q: [In German] You speak German.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: That was one of the reasons why I'm a little bit funny about these dates.</span> <span id="s82">We spent three weeks taking blood samples from people and checking them out.</span> <span id="s83">We ran onto one woman that was working as a maid in a German household.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: This is a German civilian?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Yes, and she was the loneliest woman in the world.</span> <span id="s86">She spoke a relatively rare east German, east Russian dialect and she was working in this house and she had not found anybody in two years that she could speak to.</span> <span id="s87">Then we did find one of our linguists that could talk to her because she was positive [for typhus].</span> <span id="s88">I don't know how long she had had her typhus.</span> <span id="s89">She had it a long time ago in [unintelligible] in Mongolia.</span> <span id="s90">And this is one of the strangest things about war you find [laughter].</span> <span id="s91">How in the world she got approximately 3,000 miles away from her homeland and was working as a maid in this German family.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: Incredible.</span> <span id="s93">With no ability to communicate.</span> <span id="s94">A: How lonely her life must have been.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Incredibly so.</span> <span id="s96">What were the methods you used once you got into Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Somebody thought maybe we ought to try to find out how many entire diseases there were and how many of them had them.</span> <span id="s98">So this was one of the things we did.</span> <span id="s99">We went in and got some samples.</span> <span id="s100">I just took ten stool samples back from just ten patients.</span> <span id="s101">We didn't call them patients -- they were inmates.</span> <span id="s102">Every single one of them had one or two [unintelligible] strains of salmonella or something like that.</span> <span id="s103">So there was no point in doing anything, because every one of them was infected.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Were these people well enough to give you the stool samples?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: It's amazing how much the human body can stand.</span> <span id="s106">I am sure that there were men and women there who were less than 50% of their normal weight, even less.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: And still systematically they functioned.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: They were still functioning even with all of the disease that they had and the poor malnourishment.</span> <span id="s109">One thing we found out was if you gave them a good meal, you could kill them.</span> <span id="s110">Their body wasn't used to it.</span> <span id="s111">So they brought in a nutritionist to try to give them chicken soup (laughs), but they left.</span> <span id="s112">They had these piles of bodies that they left for two or three days.</span> <span id="s113">I didn't go back and see how long they left them.</span> <span id="s114">I didn't feel that there was anything I could accomplish and I just didn't want to have to look at it again.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: You wanted to be relieved of that particular duty?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: I was relieved of it.</span> <span id="s117">I didn't ever have to go back.</span> <span id="s118">I just went in there the one time.</span> <span id="s119">I did get the pictures and they were such terrible pictures that when I got them home my wife destroyed them.</span> <span id="s120">She tore them up.</span> <span id="s121">She couldn't believe it; she tore them up.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Unbelievable.</span> <span id="s123">Do you remember how you felt when you first saw them?</span> <span id="s124">Those are hard things to recall.</span> <span id="s125">.</span> <span id="s126">I can understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: We went in a jeep.</span> <span id="s128">Then I got out of the jeep [unintelligible] and then I was supposed to go down and see some of these people; and when I came to the first heap of bodies I just couldn't believe what I was seeing.</span> <span id="s129">I guess I just had to stop and wait, and then I finally brought them out of their place to get the stool samples that I was supposed to get.</span> <span id="s130">I went past them.</span> <span id="s131">The buildings they had for these people were not very wide.</span> <span id="s132">They were quite long and they had a door at each end and a couple of doors on the side, and they were wood framed and there was nothing to keep out the cold in the winter.</span> <span id="s133">And it got cold there.</span> <span id="s134">A certain number would die in each barracks every night.</span> <span id="s135">The inmates had to take their own dead out in order to make it easy for them to clean it up.</span> <span id="s136">Waiting for them to bury were SS staff men.</span> <span id="s137">And they didn't want to work very hard, so on the end of every building were a bunch of standard meat hooks, like so, hanging down.</span> <span id="s138">.</span> <span id="s139">The prisoners would bring out the dead and just slap them up and put them on that hook so the fellows coming along on the wagon didn't have to reach down and pick up the bodies; they just took them up on the hook and threw them on the wagon.</span> <span id="s140">There were still some of those hung up on the hook.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: You saw that?</span> <span id="s142">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: That's a pretty difficult thing to be part of.</span> <span id="s144">Were the inmates afraid when they saw you?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: No.</span> <span id="s146">The first day they didn't pay any attention to us one way or the other.</span> <span id="s147">Then the second day, they started to talk to some of the people and I talked to one or two of them while I was getting the samples.</span> <span id="s148">And they didn’t say anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">They still were kind of stunned.</span> <span id="s150">As I understand later they did talk to some of us.</span> <span id="s151">Then we put up our unit in a place which was called Zeiss Kinder Haus.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Children's Home.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: Yes, it was sponsored and financed by the Zeisswerks in [unintelligible] in Germany.</span> <span id="s154">And we used that place for our laboratory and also for our men to sleep in.</span> <span id="s155">We just took over an apartment next to us, threw the Germans all out of it, and then took over their rooms and those apartments where the officers used to sleep.</span> <span id="s156">But we would go down into Jena once in a while and see what was going on.</span> <span id="s157">After these inmates began to get strength, many of them would come into town.</span> <span id="s158">They were offered clothing but they wore their striped gray and white uniforms and I think they wore them as a badge of honor.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Honor of survival?</span> <span id="s160">Would that be an accurate description?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: I don’t know if it was honor of survival or honor that they had been persecuted.</span> <span id="s162">Not only that they had survived, but they wanted people to know that they were some of those that had been especially selected.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: How did you feel about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: I thought that was fine because every time the Germans saw them, they cringed.</span> <span id="s165">Q: They did react?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Sure did, because what they did was they would take the Burgermeister and he influenced the civilians and made them go through there.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Were you there when they went through there?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: I saw one group but I was not close enough to really see their reaction, but I know what it was.</span> <span id="s169">It was not good.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Did they take any of the civilians and insist on them burying the dead?</span> <span id="s171">Did you see any of the burial take place?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: No I did not.</span> <span id="s173">I just went in the one time and I just don’t know what happened after that, except I was told that they were going to leave them there until they got a lot of people educated.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: To let them see what had been going on.</span> <span id="s175">Were there any definite orders given to you?</span> <span id="s176">I didn't get some of the specifics.</span> <span id="s177">You were in what Division?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: 1 was in the 10th Medical Laboratory.</span> <span id="s179">Q: A medical laboratory.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: It was the medical laboratory that served all the hospitals that were assigned to the First Army.</span> <span id="s181">We had evacuation hospitals, field hospitals.</span> <span id="s182">We didn't have any general hospitals, because general hospitals were back where the lines were.</span> <span id="s183">We did have evacuation hospitals and special surgical hospitals; not so much special surgical hospitals but they were like the MASH units.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: Field hospitals of some sort?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: A field hospital was sometimes [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s186">This kind of hospital was huge.</span> <span id="s187">Evac hospitals are two sizes -- 400 bed and 750 bed.</span> <span id="s188">And we would go through these little places and they would have surgical teams and different types put on because we always were ahead of that.</span> <span id="s189">We found out if we were going to do our jobs, if we were going to help anybody, we had to be where they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: So were you writing out any orders for those that were to follow you and come into the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: No.</span> <span id="s192">All we did was do the laboratory work and return the results to the surgeon's office the first time.</span> <span id="s193">It was their responsibility to advise the army commander as to what he was to do.</span> <span id="s194">All we did was the lab work.Q: And how did you know about the typhus?</span> <span id="s195">Just when you got in there or before you entered the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Before I entered the camp, I knew about it because [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s197">I had to contact the German laboratory director.</span> <span id="s198">But I could not find the German laboratory in Kassel.</span> <span id="s199">We were supposed to go there, but Kassel had been bombed four times and there was nothing there -- no water, no nothing and I couldn’t find the Hygienische Arnt in Kassel.</span> <span id="s200">There was supposed to be one, but we never could find it and then we went from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Hygienische Amt?</span> <span id="s202">The Public Health Office.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Then when we got to Jena that was again.</span> <span id="s204">They had a [unintelligible] group, so I went to the Hygienische Amt that I found and this is where I met this Professor Schneider and I had to see him the first day I got there which was the day [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s205">And he told me that he had gotten water samples from the drainage ditches out of Buchenwald and he had isolated typhoid and shigella organisms and the rest of them out of the water, and he had demanded entry to find out what was going on.</span> <span id="s206">Of course, he had been refused.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: This was a German professor?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: He had a three-headed position.</span> <span id="s209">He was a professor of bacteriology in the medical school of Jena.</span> <span id="s210">He was director of the Hygienische laboratory for the regional area of Jena; that is, Landkreis2.</span> <span id="s211">He also was the director of the laboratory services for the Ninth [unintelligible] of the German Army.</span> <span id="s212">So he was an Oberst.</span> <span id="s213">So he did have the triple function of being the chief laboratory officer in the army area.</span> <span id="s214">He was also chief of the Hygienische Institute for the Rhine.</span> <span id="s215">They have a Hygienische Institute in Heidelberg, and another one in Frankfurt and in the big cities, but each one of them serves a Landkreis, so he had the three of them and he had tried to get them...this is why, after I talked to him, that I called Operations and said that I had heard this report.</span> <span id="s216">This is why they said you have to go in there; we will find out.</span> <span id="s217">So the next day is when I had to go in.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Did you question him at all in terms of his [unintelligible] as to what was....</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: He wanted me to tell him what was going on because he had been trying to get information out of there, because he felt it was a menace to the German civilian population for which he was responsible.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: But he was in no way involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: He couldn't get in; they wouldn’t let him in because he was not SS.</span> <span id="s222">Q: Did he tell you that he was not a member of the Nazi Party?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">2County, rural district</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s225">I mean that was thoroughly investigated because...[unintelligible] with him and several other people.</span> <span id="s226">A lot of them working with the [unintelligible] because Jena was supposed to be given over to the Russians.</span> <span id="s227">[Unintelligible] they had the thing and we were supposed to have sent some of our men to Berlin for the parade but they never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: For the parade?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: They never did ask for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: What parade were you referring to?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: The Victory Parade after VE Day.</span> <span id="s232">And we were supposed to send not me, but I guess our veterinarian because he looked more military than the rest of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: A veterinarian?</span> <span id="s234">You had a veterinarian in your... A: Yes, (laughter) yes, we had a veterinarian.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: And the veterinarian served a function also?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Oh, yes, because we had horses and dogs, and he also had a responsibility for seeing that the food was good, [unintelligible] was good in the First Army.</span> <span id="s237">But this was quite a job.</span> <span id="s238">When we were caught in the snow in January, we had a little trouble getting people out of the [unintelligible] Forest.</span> <span id="s239">There were 1000 men that got killed or wounded before nine o'clock every morning and we had trouble getting them out.</span> <span id="s240">So someone got the bright idea of getting some husky dogs from Alaska.</span> <span id="s241">And the dogs arrived some time in March when the snow was disappearing.</span> <span id="s242">[laughter]</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Oh, the huskies didn't do too much good in March?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: They didn't do any good but our veterinarian had to take care of them, and we did use mules or horses to get some of these guys out and he had the responsibility of taking care of those too.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: So you really saw a lot of your own men killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: As we interview some of our liberators, who had seen so much death around them and then see the type of death in the concentration camps, I am wondering if you think perhaps the effect was no longer as great on them?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Oh definitely so because I was hard as nails.</span> <span id="s249">Nothing meant anything to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">After the war I volunteered to stay on because I knew it wasn't over.</span> <span id="s251">I didn't get sent home right away.</span> <span id="s252">They sent me down to Marseilles -- first to Cannes with the hospital there, then to Marseilles.</span> <span id="s253">When I was in Marseilles, one of the things that I saw was a black soldier [unintelligible]with some French girl and the MP told him "You better watch out."</span> <span id="s254">The black soldier said, "I'll take care of her and I'll even go back and take care of your sister."</span> <span id="s255">And the MP said, "The hell you will" and he pulled out his 45 pistol and shot him dead.</span> <span id="s256">I just walked down the street and let it go at that.</span> <span id="s257">I figured this black just got out of line.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: It was part of your total living environment for many years.</span> <span id="s259">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: So, the actual inmates that you saw at the camp really took on a different appearance?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: I'm sure they didn't affect me nearly as greatly as they did the German civilians that had gone through there because I had become inured to a certain extent, but still it was bad.</span> <span id="s262">The best thing that happened to me -- it probably kept me from getting into trouble -- was when I came home.</span> <span id="s263">I lived in Salt Lake City, just outside of there, and my wife picked me up and we went home.</span> <span id="s264">I asked my wife “Is there a place we can go to have some drinks?”</span> <span id="s265">So we had a couple of drinks or so and she said something, and I reached over and hit her; I didn't hit her, but slapped the side of her face.</span> <span id="s266">Her brother said, "Well, you're a lot bigger.</span> <span id="s267">Don’t hit her.</span> <span id="s268">If you are going to hit somebody, hit me."</span> <span id="s269">And I hauled off and smacked him.</span> <span id="s270">Bang.</span> <span id="s271">And he just went down.</span> <span id="s272">Of course, it was totally out of character as the way I had been.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: When you left.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: When I left.</span> <span id="s275">And I think it was a good thing for me that it happened because the next morning, when I realized what I had done, it shook my character back to a certain extent.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Which really showed you what had happened while you were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: I realized what had happened to me.</span> <span id="s278">When we were in New York, another fellow and I decided that we were supposed to be kept in because we had not been debriefed.</span> <span id="s279">They had us in this camp and we decided that we wanted to have some civilian food.</span> <span id="s280">It had been a long time since we'd been in the United States, so he and I thought we’d just go to a little town right near the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: Where was the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: It was up the Hudson River some where.</span> <span id="s283">And so, we got to the gate and here was an MP and he said, "You can't go out."</span> <span id="s284">We looked at him and said, "What the hell you mean we can't go out?"</span> <span id="s285">"You can't go out That's the orders."</span> <span id="s286">I said, "Well, we're going."</span> <span id="s287">[unintelligible] So the MP said, "I'll shoot you."</span> <span id="s288">So I said, "Go ahead and shoot."</span> <span id="s289">And, of course, he didn't, but we were lucky that he had not been an MP in Germany or we would have been shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: Do you think that it has taken many veterans a long time to rid themselves of... A: I'll tell you I think it’s dependent on their stability to begin with.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: How long were you in the service?</span> <span id="s292">A: I went in in 1942 and that was....</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: And you returned to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: In 1945.</span> <span id="s295">Q: While we are on some vital statistics, I will ask you a few questions for the record.</span> <span id="s296">I need your full name.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Philip Rich Carlquist.</span> <span id="s298">Q: Carlquist.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: C-A-R-L-Q-U-I-S-T.</span> <span id="s300">Q: Your address'?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: 1351 Chalmette Drive, N. E., Atlanta, 30306.</span> <span id="s302">Q: And your date and place of birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Salt Lake City, March 25, 1910.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Another non-native of Atlanta, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: I'd never been a day in Atlanta until I retired from the Army and came here.</span> <span id="s306">Q: Your age at the time of liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: I was 35 years of age.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: And your prospective profession at the beginning of the war had already been established.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: I do exactly the same thing now as I did before the war and all the time.</span> <span id="s310">Q: And specifically, what is your work?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: Medical laboratory work .</span> <span id="s312">Specifically bacteriology.</span> <span id="s313">Today is an anniversary.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">It’s 48 years today that I went to work in a hospital laboratory.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Congratulations.</span> <span id="s316">That's a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: First of September, 1930 was when I first went to work in a hospital laboratory.</span> <span id="s318">Q: Incredible.</span> <span id="s319">What hospital was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: Salt Lake General Hospital.</span> <span id="s321">I've seen a lot of changes.</span> <span id="s322">You can’t imagine.</span> <span id="s323">Q: I am sure.</span> <span id="s324">Your military unit, specifically.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: When I was called back to duty, I was sent out to Barnes General Hospital, Vancouver Barracks.</span> <span id="s326">I was supposed to be there only a year, but the war broke out before the year was up.</span> <span id="s327">Then I got transferred to the First Medical General Laboratory which was to go to England and operate for the whole European Theatre of Operations.</span> <span id="s328">We had it very good in England because we took over buildings that had been built for a unit from Harvard by the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s329">They had built them in 1940 and I was sent over to them as an assistant to the British.</span> <span id="s330">As you know, the Red Cross won’t spare a dime.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: You had some very fine quarters there?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s333">Sure did.</span> <span id="s334">We had a service of Spode.</span> <span id="s335">We could seat 100 people with sterling flatware no less.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: Sterling flatware!</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: I don’t know what happened to it afterwards.</span> <span id="s338">I was chief of bacteriology in that unit and everybody else could do research but me, because they were always expecting an outbreak of an epidemic of a bacterial disease, but we never had it.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: In England?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s341">We never had it.</span> <span id="s342">There were a couple of things that came up that were hard and made interesting studies, but after they were solved, there was nothing to them.</span> <span id="s343">For instance, there was something with gas gangrene and the airmen that got shot up in the air because they always thought that gas gangrene was an infantryman's disease but these guys in the Bl7s got gas gangrene, too.</span> <span id="s344">And we had to figure out why that was and we did and it was stopped.</span> <span id="s345">So I didn't have anything to do and I was about going nuts.</span> <span id="s346">I did help them to create a blood bank, but then I couldn't have command of it because I was Sanitary Corps officer, Medical Corps officer.</span> <span id="s347">They took me out of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Because you were sanitary officer and the medical corps officer you were not permitted to be involved in the blood bank?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: No, I could not take command of it.</span> <span id="s350">They put someone else in command of it, then I said I was getting bored stiff, so they let me go.</span> <span id="s351">They said, "All right, you can join the 10th Medical Laboratory and go in on the invasion.</span> <span id="s352">At least, you'll get some excitement.”</span> <span id="s353">And I did.</span> <span id="s354">I was very happy about that.</span> <span id="s355">So I left the First Medical General Laboratory and joined the 10th Medical Laboratory and we went into France.</span> <span id="s356">The night we got in was actually D plus three -- The third day after D-Day.</span> <span id="s357">We had been given a spot where we were supposed to set up our unit and we couldn’t get it because it was still ten miles behind the German lines.</span> <span id="s358">They had not been as successful as they planned.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: How long were you in France?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: From June 9, 1944...and I think we got out of France into Belgium in September of 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: And you stayed in Belgium for a while?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: Until.</span> <span id="s363">they made the break out the next spring over the river and clear into Germany.</span> <span id="s364">We were in Foyfen and that was a part of Belgium where they all spoke German and, actually, the Germans had reincorporated into Germany right at Aachen; it was ten miles from Aachen.</span> <span id="s365">We took over a building that had been built originally as a Jugendherberge.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: A youth hostel type.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Yes, but they bombed out the [unintelligible] in Aachen and so the Chemistry Department had moved out and had taken over this building.</span> <span id="s368">We took it over and used it for a laboratory.</span> <span id="s369">It was ideal for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: You brought all your own equipment with you?</span> <span id="s371">Did you get any equipment from the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: Some of them, we did.</span> <span id="s373">Until we got to Aachen, I had had very poor incubators for myself, but in Aachen in one of the schools, I just....</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Just went in there and helped yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: Yes, I got a good incubator which I needed.</span> <span id="s376">But in this building we found three containers each one a thousand kilograms of mercury.</span> <span id="s377">This was extremely valuable and that was sent back to the U.S. right away, the next day.</span> <span id="s378">With the war, it was absolutely essential to have [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s379">You can imagine 2 1/2 tons of mercury.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: No, I don't think I can imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: This was sent back and it was really worthwhile.</span> <span id="s382">And the other thing we found was telephones in this building.</span> <span id="s383">They turned out to be quite interesting because we picked one up and they were speaking German.</span> <span id="s384">We had a young man we called Ossi because he was very quiet and shy.</span> <span id="s385">He was a Jewish boy from Vienna; and so someone called Ossi to come and listen to what was going on and he listened and he got startled.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Startled?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: It was somebody in the SS talking to somebody else in the SS [unintelligible].</span></p> <p><span id="s388">So we called Intelligence and they followed the wires down and we caught some SS troops that had been left behind our lines.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Because of the conversation between the two SS men that was overheard?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: Yes, because this had been a central listening post for the SS people and they just followed those telephone lines back and caught some that were still back there as spies.</span> <span id="s391">We had to evacuate the areas around the front lines, because if we didn't, the units would be shelled because there were people there somehow who were getting word over to the Germans as to where we were.</span> <span id="s392">So we just got all civilians and put them in buildings behind the lines.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Did you come across many young children roaming around in Germany?</span> <span id="s394">A: Not then.</span> <span id="s395">At that time, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: There was a time when you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: I went back.</span> <span id="s398">I had to go to Copenhagen in 1947 to a meeting of the International Association of Microbiologists.</span> <span id="s399">I went through Germany, and there were lots of kids around then.</span> <span id="s400">Nobody to take care of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Nobody to take care of them?</span> <span id="s402">A: Just wandering.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Did you talk to any of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: No, because there really weren't many I would have anything to do with.</span> <span id="s405">I mean that's the way more or less I felt like.</span> <span id="s406">There was a little girl that we got very friendly with in 1945 when we went to Jena and the reason I did was because she behaved exactly like I taught my children to behave.</span> <span id="s407">She was about eight or nine years old.</span> <span id="s408">Our soldiers came and she lived in the house next to us and she threw rocks at them.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: She threw rocks at whom?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: At the American soldiers.</span> <span id="s411">Her mother got kind of perturbed about it so her mother came to talk to me about it and I said, "Well, don't think anything of it."</span> <span id="s412">What she had been taught was that the Americans were no good, that they were terrible people, so she used to throw rocks at them.</span> <span id="s413">And I said, "Just tell her not to do it any more."</span> <span id="s414">I talked to her and I could see my daughter who was exactly the same age.</span> <span id="s415">She had been taught all her life that these people were nasty people, to throw rocks at them, and she would.</span> <span id="s416">The rest of the German kids then asked for chocolates, chewing gum, and stuff like that as soon as the soldiers came.</span> <span id="s417">But not this little girl; she threw rocks and I thought this was great.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: She was angry.</span> <span id="s419">It was based on what she had been taught.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: She had been taught.</span> <span id="s421">She believed in what she had been taught.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: What was your feeling about the German people after you went to the camp and saw what you did see?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: I thought they were terrible.</span> <span id="s424">This is why I had no part of it.</span> <span id="s425">Then I went back in 1950 with [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s426">There I made them all speak English to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: The German people?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Yes, [unintelligible] they could speak English.</span> <span id="s429">I kind of divided them into groups.</span> <span id="s430">Some of them I got a feeling had been Nazi and I had no part of them and others were not too bad.</span> <span id="s431">There were a couple of professors I knew--some of whom I thought were terrible, others not.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: The professor that you told me had these wide responsibilities, the one that you had been told to contact, were you ever able to ask him as to exactly how this typhoid got started?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: It was highly endemic in the people in Poland.</span> <span id="s434">Some of them had been brought there and put in the camps, and then, of course, it had just gone from one to the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: He didn't tell you of any experimentation that took place?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: We didn't even bother with it, because it was just too large a problem and we got him out.</span> <span id="s437">We took him out so he was not left to the Germans.</span> <span id="s438">In 1950, when I went back to Germany, I met him again and then he was director of the Hygiensche Amt at Frankfurt and Professor of Bacteriology at the medical school at Frankfurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Do you correspond?</span> <span id="s440">Do you still keep in touch?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: He's probably dead now.</span> <span id="s442">He was much older than I. He's probably been dead.</span> <span id="s443">Actually, he came to the United States in 1948 as an honored guest and I met him then.</span> <span id="s444">He told me where he was so when I went to Germany in 1950 I went up to Frankfurt to see him.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: So you never really discussed any of the sociological or political... A No.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: You wouldn't touch that.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: I made them speak English to me unless I thought they were [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s448">And when we moved from Heidelberg to Lansfeldt we had trouble getting the house fixed up right and my wife said I had to come and talk to the workers so we could get it done right.</span> <span id="s449">I came back from the laboratory and met the workmen and told them what we wanted to do.</span> <span id="s450">We went through the house and he said, "Yes, Yes."</span> <span id="s451">So he left.</span> <span id="s452">And then I said to my wife "I don't see why in the world you have so much trouble with the guy.</span> <span id="s453">He speaks English good."</span> <span id="s454">And she just about whacked me with the frying pan because there had not been one word of English spoken from the time he started.</span> <span id="s455">[laughter].</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: Oh, you were communicating in German?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: I could talk to him in German if I wanted to but I didn't want to.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: You decided you would stick to your...It's your way of saying, “Now you are going to do it the way I feel that I want you to do it."</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: But this one I did, but maybe others, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: You had your family with you there, Dr. Carlquist?</span> <span id="s461">A: I had my wife, my daughter, and my two sons.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: That was in 1950.</span> <span id="s463">While you were in the Service, you had a family at home in the States?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s465">You see, my daughter is 44 years of age.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Did you write of your experiences at the camps to your family?</span> <span id="s467">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Nothing at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: I did not write and, actually, I didn't say much about it when I came back.</span> <span id="s470">.</span> <span id="s471">But I did bring quite a few pictures -- pictures of me, pictures of other people, and the pictures of the heaps of bodies were in that group.</span> <span id="s472">My wife went through those and took them out and destroyed them so the kids would never see them.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Have the kids ever heard about your experiences since that time?</span> <span id="s474">Have you seen the Holocaust TV movie?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: No, I didn’t look at it.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: Did you know it was going to be on and you purposely did not?</span> <span id="s477">A: No.</span> <span id="s478">I purposely did not look at them.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: I just didn't feel I wanted to.</span> <span id="s481">I had seen all I wanted to; I didn't need any reminder.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: The reminder is painful.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: The reminder would be painful and I don't want any more reminders.</span> <span id="s484">Q: I can understand that, certainly.</span> <span id="s485">Did your children see that movie?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: You have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: My daughter lives in Philadelphia, my son lives in Oklahoma City, and the other one lives in Glendale.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: And they don't know what you experienced?</span> <span id="s490">A: No.</span> <span id="s491">They know where I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: But they do not know what you saw.</span> <span id="s493">A: No, they do not know what I saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Did the publicity on the Holocaust TV show bring back the memories of what you had seen?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: The publicity was there, but I did not read a single thing about any of it.</span> <span id="s496">Every time I saw "Holocaust", that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: You tuned it out completely.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: I tuned it out completely.</span> <span id="s499">And I still probably will.</span> <span id="s500">Q: The pain of having seen it is too great?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Well, it's not any pain but there is no point to me in seeing it because....</span></p> <p><span id="s502">[End of Side One.</span> <span id="s503">Conversation resumes on Side Two as follows]</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: A lot of other people did; I never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: Well, once you've seen that....</span> <span id="s506">A: Once you've see it, you don't want any more of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: Are you a religious man, Dr. Carlquist?</span> <span id="s508">A: Not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: What is your religious...?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: I'm a Mormon to start with, but I don't follow all the things and they made a big thing out of things that I feel are not too big.</span> <span id="s511">So as a result I don’t go to church, but I don’t go to any other church.</span> <span id="s512">I couldn’t go to any other church.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: Did anything happen to your feelings about religion when you saw what you saw at Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: It didn't have any effect on me.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: It had no effect on you?</span> <span id="s516">Did you see the concentration camp as being particularly pointed at one type of people; for instance, the Jews or the Gypsies, or the mentally retarded?</span> <span id="s517">How did you see it?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: From what I saw even in Buchenwald they had criminals.</span> <span id="s519">Q: Yes, they had a criminal element there.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: Yes, a criminal element.</span> <span id="s521">For example, one of the famous things that was made was the so-called lamp shades that the Beast of Buchenwald had made out of these tattoo skins.</span> <span id="s522">But I'm sure those came from criminals, because in all my life I have never seen a Jew with a tattoo on his body.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: You have not see any?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: No.</span> <span id="s525">I mean I have seen Jews with tattoos, but they were the numbers tattooed on their arms for identification purposes when they were put in the camps.</span> <span id="s526">I have never to the best of my knowledge seen a Jew with tattoos.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Are you saying the lampshades had tattoos on them?</span> <span id="s528">The skins had pictorial tattoos that were used.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: Didn't you remember the stories of the Beast of Buchenwald, the Bitch of Buchenwald, the one that had the tattoo?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: The one of Belsen I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: There was one of Buchenwald and she had these lampshades made out of the tattooed skin that were taken off of someone that died.</span> <span id="s532">Now, I didn't see them, but I know people who did see them.</span> <span id="s533">A lot of the German sailors were tatooed and I am sure that all of those skins were taken off of criminals that were in there because, as I say, I have never seen a Jew in my life that’s been tattooed.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: That's an interesting observation.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: And I'm sure they are made out of criminal's skin, because I've never seen a Jew that's been tattooed.</span> <span id="s536">I never could understand why people wanted to be tattooed.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: It is a difficult thing to understand, isn't it?</span> <span id="s538">Dr. Carlquist, after you were in Buchenwald, the first time you went in...A..</span> <span id="s539">The one time I went in.</span> <span id="s540">I didn't go back.</span> <span id="s541">I did not have to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Did you share what you saw that one time with any of your fellow workers?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: With my commanding officer, of course, and we had talked it over because I had to go with him; he had to go back me up so we didn’t have to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: Was that a medical conversation or an emotional...?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: Strictly medical.</span> <span id="s546">I said I couldn’t do any more good there.</span> <span id="s547">I mean with all the thousands they had in there, if we tried to do any diagnostic work, we couldn't do it; it was beyond our scope.</span> <span id="s548">I mean it was too big a problem and so there was no point in trying.</span> <span id="s549">All you could do was just feed them and hope they got better.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: The German civilians that you saw afterwards, did you ever talk to them about what you saw at the [unintelligible]?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: I didn't see any, except I talked to [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s552">Basically he was the only one.</span> <span id="s553">There were German women who would come in and clean up our soldiers’ places, make their beds.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Was there much fraternizing going on between the German women and the soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: There was some.</span> <span id="s556">We had one Jewish boy who was a tough little New Yorker, a young New York Jew, and he was going to reinstitute some Jewish blood into Germany.</span> <span id="s557">We had German women who had not had intercourse without condoms, so he used to cut the end off the condom [laughter].</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: That was his way?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: He said he was going to reintroduce some Jewish blood into Germany.</span> <span id="s560">I don't know whether they did or didn't, but he tried.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: But he tried, that was his goal.</span> <span id="s562">Since we know that the Holocaust has certainly a great deal to do with the Jewish affliction, have your feelings towards Jews changed?</span> <span id="s563">Did you have any feeling before or after or what is the situation today?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: The only thing that was a problem for me was to understand anti-Semitism, because I grew up in Salt Lake City and there it never did exist.</span> <span id="s565">When the first Jewish people came there, they were given an old Mormon building to use.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">There weren't really too many Jews living in 1914-15.</span> <span id="s567">The governor of Utah was a Jew.</span> <span id="s568">Simon Bamberger, the mayor of Salt Lake City, was a Jew.</span> <span id="s569">Lou Marcus, the chairman of the County Commission, was a Jew.</span> <span id="s570">There were very few Jewish people there so there was no such thing as anti-Semitism in Salt Lake City.</span> <span id="s571">Now I think this worked to the disadvantage for the Jewish religion, because there's nothing like persecution to keep the group together.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: Too bad you have to think of it in those terms.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: But the Reform just quit going to their...and the Conservative became Reformed and the Orthodox disappeared entirely.</span> <span id="s574">I could remember the Orthodox.</span> <span id="s575">We had some Orthodox Jews we met there and they fought every rule there was.</span> <span id="s576">I don’t think we had any of the ones that had the curls there.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: Hassidim...</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: Hassidim.</span> <span id="s579">I don't think we had any of those there, but I remember one Orthodox.</span> <span id="s580">You couldn't even borrow his truck on the Sabbath to use.</span> <span id="s581">Even his truck could not work on the Sabbath, but every one of his children were real Orthodox Jews.</span> <span id="s582">Most of the Jews were from east Poland and were not Orthodox, so I'm sure the Orthodox Congregation disappeared out of Salt Lake City in one generation.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: So you are saying because of the way you were raised, anti-Semitism was an unfamiliar thing to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: Totally.</span> <span id="s585">I never could understand it.</span> <span id="s586">Unto this day I can't.</span> <span id="s587">One of the people I work with was talking about one of the Jewish doctors.</span> <span id="s588">He said he was a nice guy, even if he was a Jew.</span> <span id="s589">This, to me, has nothing to do with it.</span> <span id="s590">I mean, Jews can be stinkers or they can be good, but so can the rest of us.</span> <span id="s591">Their religion has nothing to do with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: So you went in with that feeling and came out....</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: I had no reason to change.</span> <span id="s594">A lot of people think of Jews as a race and I do not, because we have had Jewish pharmacists.</span> <span id="s595">One of them was just as blonde as she could be because one of her grandfathers had been a rabbi in Spain during the time of the Spanish Inquisition.</span> <span id="s596">Remember a bunch of them went to Holland and they married the Netherlandish people there and she became blonde after two generations.</span> <span id="s597">But she was still a Jew and she was certainly not a Semitic Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: She couldn't be identified with a Semitic picture of Judaism.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: No.</span> <span id="s600">No way.</span> <span id="s601">If you go to Africa or if you go up to Morocco, you see two Moroccans -- they say one was a Jew and the other one was a Moslem.</span> <span id="s602">You couldn’t tell the difference because they are Semitic people, but you could tell them if you saw them by which church they went to or when they have a holiday.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: So this young lady couldn't be identified....</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: No, of course you can't.</span> <span id="s605">Neither can a Black Jew and neither can a Swedish Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: Your background is interesting in terms of your opinion; as a Mormon and perhaps....</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A:.</span> <span id="s608">I think Mormons were much more strong in their religion when they were being persecuted...</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: So it's a similar pattern that you are saying between [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s610">A: But they don't get it now, so they are drifting away.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: I would like to ask you a last question, based on a questionnaire we have here.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">In terms of our project to what do you feel can be done today to try yo help eliminate the repetition of what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: I don't think you can stop it if it's going to happen.</span> <span id="s614">It is even worse than Holocaust what is going on in Cambodia and it will go on... There is nothing as cruel to humans as humans.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: Humans to humans?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: I don’t think you are going to stop it.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Having shared this material with us now, how do you feel about sharing it at an appropriate time with a friend in a social situation or with your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: I don’t think I would.</span> <span id="s619">Q: You would not?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A..</span> <span id="s621">I don't think I would.</span> <span id="s622">Dr. Matthews knew where I had been, so he was the one who saw [your article] and he came down and said I think you had better call because I know you were there.</span> <span id="s623">He said I never did tell him much about it, but he did know from what I have dropped once in a while that I was there, and he said I better call and tell them.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Were you apprehensive about doing this interview with Dr. Crawford?</span> <span id="s625">A: Not really, because I had nothing to be...</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: No, in terms of your own reaction to have to reflect back to this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: I have reflected.</span> <span id="s628">Believe it or not I think about it every once in a while whether I want to or not.</span> <span id="s629">There is no way it will ever be erased from my mind.</span> <span id="s630">It's not going to make any difference what I've said now.</span> <span id="s631">It will not help me get rid of it; it will not make it any stronger.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: I am going to say something to you that I hope will make a difference to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Having shared this with us, it will be part of documented history.</span> <span id="s634">The next generation will study it, and hopefully, learn from it.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: I don't think it's going to make any difference unfortunately.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: I guess we can choose to say it won't make any difference, but I would like to leave you with the feeling that it is important.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: In lots of places in the United States, anti-Semitism is just below the surface.</span> <span id="s638">I know that as well as you do.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: Certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: I have never been able to understand it, but I know it's there.</span> <span id="s641">To me there are kikes and there are Jews; there are Swedes and [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s642">There are Wops and there are Italians; it doesn't make any difference what group they are in there.</span> <span id="s643">Some you like and some you don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: Good and bad in each.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: Good and bad, but it has nothing to do with their religion or their race or anything else.</span> <span id="s646">Those religions run the gamut.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: You feel that this is part of human nature to be discriminatory against a minority no matter what happens?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: Oh, Yes.</span> <span id="s649">Sure.</span> <span id="s650">If something isn't done to cut inflation the way it is so this country cannot be [unintelligible] then I think we are going to have a hard time.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: Do you think minorities are going to be the first to suffer again because of the political and sociological situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: I think anybody that hasn’t got any money is going to suffer regardless of who they are; but I doubt very much if Jews will be picked.</span> <span id="s653">They will be by certain groups but I don't think they will be picked out any more than any other group because so many of the Jews have lost themselves in the....</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: Mainstream?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A., In the Mainstream and there are some people that are considered Jews who are not and never were because of the similarity in the name or something in the appearance and they happen to be...this is where I say anti-Semitism is a little bit underneath there.</span> <span id="s656">I’ve heard a lot of people say, "What do you expect?</span> <span id="s657">He's a Jew."</span> <span id="s658">I happen to know he's not and never was and his family never was and, yet, because he has disagreeable characteristics that somebody doesn’t like, they say "What do you expect?</span> <span id="s659">He's a Jew."</span> <span id="s660">.</span> <span id="s661">Q: This is an indication that it’s under the surface.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: With some people it’s under the surface and there isn't any way you are going to eradicate it.</span> <span id="s663">It was put into them when they were kids.</span> <span id="s664">Has to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: Because their parents felt that way I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: Was there any basic teaching that you felt was responsible for that?</span> <span id="s668">In "South Pacific" there's a song that says: You've got to learn to hate.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: This is possibly true.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: You’ve got to be taught to hate is essentially what the song is.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: There were two Jewish families in our block, and as far as we are concerned, the only difference between them and us is that they went to church on Saturday and we went on Sunday.</span> <span id="s672">That is the only difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: You say you were not a practicing Mormo n so to speak.</span> <span id="s674">I was kind of wondering whether or not that would have an effect on you in terms of forgiving the Nazis for what they perpetuated.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: I don’t know because I don't believe in forgiveness.</span> <span id="s676">Q: You don't believe in forgiveness?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: I think everybody is going to be punished for what he does.</span> <span id="s678">The choice is not me for forgiving.</span> <span id="s679">That's not my privilege.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: Interesting point of view.</span> <span id="s681">You did not come across any SS?</span> <span id="s682">A: Not that I knew were SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: Many of them had abandoned their camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: You had to be in one of the fighting units in front to grab these guys.</span> <span id="s685">I saw them in the roundup places, but I never talked to them and I never had any contact with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: You had no contact with them at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: The only one I can remember I really talked to was Schassberger and a couple of other people like that who were in this Hygienesche Amt.Q: So you had no contact as such?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: I had no contact as such with these.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: I do want to thank you very much for givi ng me your time.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">POST-INTERVIEW COMMENTS BY KAETHE SOLOMON:I am sitting in the car after having left Dr. Carlquist.</span> <span id="s692">I'm feeling a little tense about the interview.</span> <span id="s693">From what I can see Dr. Carlquist is not a well man and I am concerned that he will be all right after our interview.</span> <span id="s694">I tried to reassure him but I do have definite concerns of my own.</span> <span id="s695">It is very difficult to see a man go through such pain, while recording, sharing some of what he went through.</span> <span id="s696">There were no tears, but his body language was enough to let me know that this was not something he likes to recall or talk about.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">When I offered him the brochure, I said, "I would like to leave..." and then I stopped in mid-sentence and said, "No, I do not feel that you really should have this to remind you."</span> <span id="s698">He said, "No, I don't want to take it; I don't want a reminder.</span> <span id="s699">I don't want to hear anything nor see anything about the Holocaust.”</span> <span id="s700">And I told me I certainly respected that feeling.</span> <span id="s701">But my own feeling right now is that I almost hold myself responsible for leaving a man who hopefully will have a good day the rest of the day.</span> <span id="s702">I'm not too sure.</span> <span id="s703">Dr. Carlquist also mentioned to me that his wife is not too happy about him sharing this period of his life.</span> <span id="s704">Once again, it seemed to be a bad time for her.</span> <span id="s705">They had two children there with him.</span> <span id="s706">He was away most of the time when she felt he should have been there and it was just a bad period for both of them, so the entire experience brings back very unpleasant memories.</span></p></body></html>
